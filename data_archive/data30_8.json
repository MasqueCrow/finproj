I grew up in an artistic family and spent most of my  childhood in Elmira, New York. After living for years in Florida, I settled in Hendersonville, North Carolina and now make the mountains my home.After picking up my first digital SLR camera in 2006, I discovered that the beauty of Western North Carolina helped train my eye, and hone my photographic skills. In 2009, I stumbled on an abandoned airplane graveyard in St. Augustine, Florida. Shooting the derelict planes, I discovered a passion for abandonment photography. Since then I have focused on developing a personal style of photography that I call \u201cThe Art of Abandonment\u201d.I travel the country seeking to photograph and document our nations modern ruins. By photographing these abandoned and endangered places, I help to preserve the history and tell the stories of these locations before they are gone.I have received national and international recognition. Most notably, Hollywood movie director Ron Howard selected one of my images to inspire a short film, When You Find Me. Howard chose \u201cThe Final View\u201d out of almost 100,000 entries to craft a setting for the story.
