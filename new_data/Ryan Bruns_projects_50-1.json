Raze the Woodland to the ground as the fearsome Lord of the Hundreds, or recover precious relics from this destructive conflict as the Keepers in Iron. Explore dozens of faction combinations, including many new head-to-head matchups with the hirelings and advanced setup cards. New and experienced players have never had so many ways to enjoy Root!\nThe Keepers in Iron are an order of itinerant warriors who have come to the Woodland to recover ancient relics. To find them, they must manage their Woodland contacts carefully, as only the local animals know how to find the relics they seek. Paragons of discipline, their warriors sport pristine armor of a quality rarely seen here, making them a terror in battle. However, to keep their forces well-supplied and mobile, they must maintain a network of caravans and waystations.\nClaiming to be the true voice of the Woodland, the Lord of the Hundreds spreads distrust and division among its inhabitants, inciting torch-wielding mobs to destroy the enemies of their righteous dominion. His swarming army can overwhelm all but the toughest defense. By looting items from the undeserving and adding them to his towering hoard, his power grows as he develops an increasingly fearsome monomania.\nRoot's hirelings lend their services to factions willing to pay the price. Court the Marquise's infamous Forest Patrol or sway the rampaging Last Dynasty from the Eyrie to join your cause. Whether you are playing with two players or six, the hirelings are sure to offer you exciting new ways to play Root. \nDiscover new corners of the world of Root.  Fight for control of the cosmopolitan Free City of Root or attempt to secure influence over the Black Market. Build buildings among the Elder Treetops or secure the Legendary Forge. Each landmark offers players new strategic challenges and tactical possibilities. Best of all, they work with each of Root's four maps!\nWith your support in 2019, the Underworld Kickstarter brought Root to more players than ever before. In the years since the game\u2019s release, Root continues to enjoy a vibrant and welcoming community of old and new players alike.\nAt Leder Games, we are deeply grateful for this community. Because of you all, we can keep food on our tables and the lights on at the office. You also give us space to take risks and develop new games. And, perhaps best of all, your support means that we can continue exploring the world of Root!\nRoot: The Marauder Expansion is the next chapter in the series. The expansion offers two new factions: the Lord of the Hundreds and the Keepers in Iron. Both factions are designed to work seamlessly with all previous factions and provide players with unique gameplay challenges and the dramatic, narrative-first asymmetry that has become a hallmark of Root\u2019s design.\nThe expansion also introduces the hireling system. This is a gameplay option that can be used at any player count and faction mix. Hirelings are perfect for folks wanting the experience of Root as a two-player contest or who want to inject their multiplayer games with even more combos and color from the game\u2019s wider world.\nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. In Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability.    \nTo understand how Root integrates with all of our products in this campaign, as well as our current existing expansions, please refer to our New to Root Chart.\nRoot is currently in-stock and available on our webstore for most regions. (For North American backers, we have a pre-order open for late Spring delivery.) If you want to obtain a copy as fast as possible, check with your Friendly Local Game Store or consider ordering from our site. For other expansions and products, you can order directly from our webstore or visit your neighborhood game seller. We will not offer an \u201cAll-In\u201d pledge, or include previous releases as add-ons for this campaign. \nAt Leder Games, we are committed to sharing our design process openly. As with campaigns in the past, we'll be releasing preview kits both as print-and-play files and mods for Tabletop Simulator. The first kit will be released on Thursday the 25th, and the second will arrive on the week following. \nClick here to download the preview kit!\n\nIf you are looking for players, you can find a huge community over on Leder Games' official Discord channel, the Woodland Warriors. \nShipping will be charged post-campaign in Backerkit.\n\nCustoms and Duty-Free Shipping\nLeder Games will pre-pay the duties and taxes for the backers who receive their games in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. All other countries or regions may be subject to additional customs fees upon delivery.\n\nFor our UK friends: At this time the UK has not provided a mechanism that will allow this type of pre-payment for crowdfunded projects fulfilling after June 2021. We are working with our VAT agency to find a solution, but at this time there is not one available. It is likely that by the time we\u2019re making plans for fulfillment there will not be additional VAT, but we cannot promise this with the ongoing legislation changes. We are keeping a close eye on developments, and will provide updates as we are able during the campaign and leading up to fulfillment. We assure you we wish Brexit had less effect, but alas here we are.\nCountries we cannot ship to: Afghanistan, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan,  and Syria.

If we raise enough funds on Kickstarter, we will make sure that you get your games. \n\nThat said, the global pandemic has put stress on supply chains everywhere. This has caused some delays in Oath's shipping and increased our costs. It is possible that this project experiences some delays, but we have built lots of padding into our schedule.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. \n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the retail release. \n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email orders@beziergames.com for further information.

Instead of activating a District or a Mission card, you may select a face-up Character card from the Teahouse, to join you and grant you their special ability for your next turn. The Teahouse guests change every turn, thus creating a tableau of transient special abilities to strategically use in your game.\nThis module offers you unique abilities each clan can use during your struggle for supremacy in Yedo. A set of 6 cards offering new and exciting strategic options great for veterans of Yedo as well as new players looking to make each game even more interesting and dynamic.\nFor retailer and group offers, please message us directly!\nPlease note that pledges below $10 will not guarantee access to Pledge Manager after the campaign is over. Only existing pledges will allow you to enjoy the benefits of actual Yedo Deluxe Master Set backers. \nIf you are a backer of the previous Yedo Deluxe Master Set you may order just the add-ons. Use the Ronin Pledge Level to gain access to the Pledge Manager.\nIn order to pledge for any add-ons, simply add the total amount for all extra content to your pledge: we will ask you for exact information on add-ons chosen via the Pledge Manager. With a copy of Yedo Deluxe Master Set, add-ons are shipped for free. Please see the Production and Fulfillment section below for information on shipping add-ons separately.\n\nLooking for high-quality sleeves to protect you game? Check out Paladin Card Protection.

You can order premiurm protection for your Yedo Deluxe Master Set, as well as sleeves for thousands of other games then!\nDuring its original Kickstarter campaign, Yedo Deluxe Master Set received a total 26 unlocked Stretch Goals and daily upgrades and additions. All of these were created in close cooperation with the original designers, and provided all of the content the vision of new Yedo could ever fit. Yedo Deluxe Master Set is thus complete. Each copy pledged for during this Kickstarter will come with all Stretch Goals and upgrades unlocked during the last campaign. \nYedo: (Un)pleasant Surprise expansion will be shipped for free to all backers at Shonin level. All these packages will be shipped from Poland. For all other pledges, the expansion will be treated as an add-on.\nYedo Deluxe Master Set is our second large deluxe box (after Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set) manufactured by the same factory which produced the iconic printed wooden components of Snowdonia. With the full knowledge of all the whole process we are able to accurately tell you both the shipping costs and the exact timeline for production and delivery.\nShipping costs will be added after the Kickstarter project is finished (except for Shonin pledge, which comes with free worldwide shipping), using a pledge manager. Before backing this campaign, please make sure that your region or country is present in the pledge level\u2019s shipping list, as Yedo Deluxe Master Set does not ship anywhere in the world*. Here is a list of shipping costs to different regions of the world:\nWhem combined with a copy of Yedo Deluxe Master Set, all add-ons come with no extra shipping cost (beyond the shippijng cost of Yedo outlined above). Ordering just the add-on is also possible. Any number of add-ons will come with the same shipping cost as Yedo Deluxe Master Set. However, regardless of the number of add-ons ordered, the shipping cost remains the same. In essence, a single pledge (regardless of its contents) will always come with a shipping cost given in the table above.\n* Because local postal services are unreliable and/or custom taxes are off the charts, we are currently unable to ship to: Brazil, Libya, Syria, Philippines, North Korea and... Antarctica.\n** USA shipping cost will depend on tariffs valid at the date of shipping. At the moment the tariff for board games is zero, but this can change unexpectedly. Every 10% in tariffs will most likely increase shipping charges to USA by $2-$3.\n *** South-East and East Asia covers: Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam.\nFor most regions of the world, Yedo Deluxe Master Set will arrive in April or May 2021. However, there are some locations with exceptionally long shipping times. So, if you are located in South America or Central America, you will probably wait for your copy of Yedo Deluxe Master Set until June or July 2021.\nPlease read carefully before pledging for this project!\nContent Presented\nUnless specifically stated otherwise in a given section of this project, all elements shown on this page are depictions of near-final product. All of the 3D elements and pieces are conceptual visualizations and representations of game elements. The content depicted is subject to minor changes before delivery in order to meet manufacturing requirements and game balance.\nThe Pledge Manager\nWe will be using a pledge manager after the campaign. Access to the Yedo Deluxe Master Set pledge manager will be granted based on having pledged $10 or more for this project. By pledging for this campaign, you agree to provide us the information needed for us to fulfill your pledge (including an address valid at the time of delivery) using the pledge manager within the time frame (which for this project will be 10 consecutive days within a month after this project is over) made public by us via updates on the project page.

When they are released to the public after this Kickstarter, they will have a $20 MSRP.\nThe following add-ons will be available to every backer in the pledge manager:\n $10 Metal Coin Set for For Sale or For Sale Autorama featuring 72 metal coins.\n $9 For Sale: Advisors Expansion \n $29 For Sale Autorama (English or Japanese Editions) \nAdditional add-ons, such as the classic For Sale (GBS edition) in English, will be available to backers based on availability in various regions. A list of add-ons will be posted in an KS Update prior to the launch of the pledge manager.\nFor this campaign, we are presenting to you the entirety of the high-quality improvements for the production of this game upfront, at the very beginning of the campaign. Each copy of For Sale Autorama will come with high-quality linen finish cards, a linen finish box, quality punchboard money tokens, and a custom insert to hold the cards and money tokens.  Each copy of For Sale: Advisors will come with high-quality linen finish cards and quality punchboard coin tokens inside a durable tuck box.  We feel that providing you with a quality product for a great game is inherent in who we are at Eagle-Gryphon Games and we want you, our Backers, to know you can expect this from us from the start.\nThe classic game of For Sale is a quick, fun game about buying and selling real estate. It was first released in 1998, when it originally only had 20 different properties.  In 2005, a new version of the game introduced new art and 10 more properties bringing the total to 30. The game has seen massive success and has remained a BGG top 60 Family Game for the past 20 years. It is widely regarded as one of the best quick-playing filler games for 3-6 players.\nHow to Play\nPlay Through\nWe love local game stores and enjoy supporting them all around the world by offering the special editions of our games through our PIP program! If you are interested in carrying For Sale Autorama, For Sale: Advisors Expansion and/or Eagle-Gryphon Games in general (such as Age of Steam Deluxe, Rococo Deluxe or On Mars), please contact our Sales Director, Jason Grantz ( jgrantz@eagle-gryphon.com ) for further information on how to place your pre-order. Jason will also provide you with further information about our line-up of other great quality games and he will ensure that you stay up-to-date with all of our special promotions! Only available to Brick & Mortar retail stores. Proof of status will be required. Note: To place a retailer order, please submit your information in the following link to be contacted:\nTerms & Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while this Kickstarter campaign is active. All artwork is subject to change. These terms and conditions apply specifically to this project.\nRefund Policy\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component of your order regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter, we will only be able to refund 80% of your pledge. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order through both Kickstarter and the pledge manager. NOTE: Once the games have shipped from China towards our fulfillment centers, refunds may no longer be available.\n\nFulfillment Estimated to Begin by SEPT, 2021\nWe will try to have your games in your hands before that time, but please note that this is an estimate, and there are many factors that are beyond our control -- such as virus outbreaks, holidays, customs inspections, factory quality control, inclement weather, leaky ships, and dock strikes, etc. (all of which we have experienced in the past). Please understand we have little to no control over such factors. As always, and especially in the current state of the world, things change that may affect these estimates. We assure you that you will be the first to know about any developments having to do with production and shipping as we learn them.\nPut simply: you will get everything we promise to you when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\nPlease do not add any estimated shipping expense to your Kickstarter pledge!\nBased on lots of prior experience, we have decided to collect from you the actual shipping cost for For Sale Autorama, and any add-ons you want to order, during the pledge manager period -- which will be open shortly after this campaign. We believe that this is the fairest and best approach, to both you as a Backer and to us as the publisher.\nPlease note that there is much more cost to us involved in shipping your game to you than just the postage from the local hub to you. Logistics and freight costs between our Chinese manufacturer and our regional fulfillment centers around the world also must be paid; as do unpacking and repacking labor and materials costs at each fulfillment center; as well as VAT, Government and Sales Taxes.  In most cases, you are only paying for the postage expense and a small amount of these other \"shipping costs\".  In all cases, we are subsidizing the greater costs involved in an effort to keep the overall costs to you as low as possible.\nWe ship your orders, en masse, to our Fulfillment Partners around the world: in Canada, Asia Pacific, EU, UK, Australia and the US. Our Fulfillment Partners will then make sure your orders are sent to you quickly and safely, regardless of where you live in the world. While we aim to have the shipments to each fulfillment partner shipped from China at roughly the same time, the speed with which each shipment reaches its regional fulfillment varies, as does the speed with which each fulfillment partner can ship out all the pledges for their region.  We will try to keep you updated as to the shipping and distribution status in your region or country, but we must ask that you remain patient and respectful during the shipping and fulfillment process.\nNOTE: If the UK does not remain in the Customs Union, at the time of shipment any extra taxes and duties will be the responsibility of the UK backers.  It is possible for customs fees and/or tariffs to apply to any country outside of the country of origin for the shipment and we are not responsible for these Custom fees, special taxes, etc. It is simply not possible for us to know and anticipate these for you. This can be true for countries such as Japan and Brazil, among others.\nWE DO NOT SHIP DIRECTLY TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBelow we have included a chart with shipping estimates for the Advisor pledge level and the Autorama pledge levels (subject to change based on your country / locale and final shipping weight):\nPlease keep in mind that these are just estimates and costs may vary  based on your specific country and address. Weight changes and any  optional rewards/add-ons you choose in our pledge manager may  also affect actual shipping charges.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP DIRECTLY TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Eagle-Gryphon Games we stand by our products, but sometimes issues do happen.

We will always do our best, through Kickstarter Updates, to keep you as informed as possible as to the status of your game(s). But as we said above, in this business some uncertain factors are beyond our control, such as holidays, customs, factory quality control, inspection delays, inclement weather and dock strikes - to name a few.

Adventure gaming at its best!\u201d Jeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\"If 7th Continent was the journey, then 7th Citadel is the destination. This is a great evolution of the game mechanics.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card. Whenever you take a Terrain card stored after that divider (card nr. 111 and up), you must replace 1 Exploration card attached to that terrain with one showing the \u201cPeril\u201d (skull) icon.\nLuckily, you possess a Groundquaker, a powerful artifact stolen from the Necrodruids, which will help you push the divider further back and with it the edge of peril!\nWe\u2019ve been working on The 7th Citadel for over a year now.\nThe game\u2019s mechanics have been heavily tested over the last few months. Dozens of players have had the opportunity to try them out, notably at the Essen 2019 and FIJ (Cannes) 2020 trade fairs.

Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 20 years, in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign.

To date, we have delivered rewards to over 60,000 backers around the world.\n\nWe have accumulated experience and selected our partners (manufacturer, logistics, distribution centers) among the best in the world, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this project and ensure its follow-up (communication with the community, after-sales service) with the same professionalism that we have shown so far.\n\nThe main risk factor, which can never be excluded given the complexity of such a project and the potential number of backers, lies in a possible delay in delivery.\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nBecause you place your trust in us and allow us, through your support, to bring our project to life, we are keen to clarify our commitments to you.\n\nTo this end, we commit ourselves, as we have always done, to:\n\n1. not launch a new Kickstarter campaign until we have delivered the previous one.\n2. do everything possible to guarantee the sustainability of our company through sound management: control of its workforce, its operating costs and investments.\n3. ensure continuity as far as possible in the event of force majeure\n4. keep you informed with regular updates about the project until its delivery.\n\nWe would like to thank all our backers for the trust and support they have shown us since 2015!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is requested more than 15 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 15% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Kickstarter.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll payments (pledged on Kickstarter and/or in the pledge manager) will be made in \u20acuros.

This led to the release of Ante Up, which introduced many new elements to Western Legends when newcomers arrived in Buzzard Gulch via train, eager to create their own legends. The frontier may have been settled, but the desire to explore the world of Western Legends still burns in many a Legend's hearts.\nDiscover Western Legends: Blood Money, the most recent and the final addition to the saga you love and have helped us to bring to life! Saddle up for one more adventure before riding off into the sunset!\nWestern Legends: Blood Money not only expands on existing content and introduces new gameplay elements of its own, but it enhances the experience in ways that have been called for by many of its most enthusiastic fans!\nAdventure loving players of Western Legends can finally have the added risk they've been looking for while the more competitive players will find new ways to win in the West!

Welcome to the Western Legends: Blood Money special game modes! These special game modes are a collection of Western Legends variants that are meant to cultivate specific gameplay experiences for players who want to try something different. At its core, Western Legends is a sandbox gaming experience, with a world of possible play styles, strategies, and opportunities to explore, but if you've ever wanted to play a game more focused on shootouts between players, or focused on stories, or maybe who can strikeout to be the richest in the West, then these game modes are for you!\nDiscover more about game modes here.\n Even with your amazing support before the launch of Blood Money, we didn\u2019t unlock the last game mode \u00ab Who Runs Border Town \u00bb. However, we decided to add this game mode as a Social Stretch Goal to unlock during the campaign! \nAll Stretch Goals unlocked go into the core product of Blood Money. They do not add to each other to make a small expansion, unlike past Western Legends campaigns.\n\nTo provide more extra awesome content for Blood Money, we set up unique social stretch goals.\nThese Social Stretch Goals unlock when new followers are added to any of our social media platforms combined. You can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram; it's up to you. Each follower on a social media page counts as +1 follower to reach the social stretch goals.\nMore details about the Backer Appreciation Pack. It contains:\nA full set of poker cards from all Western Legends saga: 68 cards in total that would ensure consistent color and cut.\nThe full fight deck, with corrected colors on the back.\nA small punch board to replace the current outlaw tokens.\nA replacement piece for the general store that has the barrel icon on one side and the horseshoe icon from the playmat on the other. This allows owners of the playmat to have matching icons.\n6 Player Aids (same as Ante-Up).\nAll in one clarified rulebook: it includes all the corrections to the Western Legends and Ante Up rules, and includes content from Blood Money.\nThis is a retailer pledge.

As such, we are dedicated to continuing to bring unique and meaningful gaming experiences to people all around the world! \n\n\n#Successful Campaigns\nKolossal Games has continued this record by successfully funding 18 games already, such as Western Legends, Mezo, and Terrors of London. \n#Production & Delivery Kolossal Games has a proven track record of successfully funding campaigns, and we have delivered 15 campaigns since 2018! However, sometimes there are unexpected issues despite our best efforts.\nIn some cases, delays result from issues with the production process. We work very hard to make sure the correct components, of the promised quality, are included in all of our games. So when a component issue arises, we take action to correct it as quickly as we can. This occasionally results in us discovering a manufacturing issue very late in the process, which can delay delivery. \nOne such case arose during the delivery of our game Mezo. We discovered that a punchboard was missing after all of the games had arrived at the fulfillment centers. Our response was to immediately halt the fulfillment process and begin an emergency round of production for the missing punchboards. We then had the newly produced punchboards flown to the fulfillment centers so they could be included with each copy of the game. While the delays and added expenses were unfortunate, we were determined to deliver the games to our backers with all of the promised components. \nSometimes delays result from the development of the game itself. These may be an issue with the art, rules, or gameplay that we discover ourselves or are perhaps pointed by our backers. \nThis is one of the best parts of crowdfunding because we have implemented more than one clever idea suggested by our backers. However, implementing these changes also causes small delays, but it is worth to bring the best version of the game to our backers!\nLastly, delays sometimes occur during the delivery of the games themselves. It is a long and complex process of getting games from the factory to our backers, and so many things can happen along the way! We try to plan for all eventualities, but some things simply cannot be predicted. We have faced shocking challenges that include warehouse fires and flooded containers! In the event of such an unlikely situation, we will first inform our backers and begin working to find the best solution. Fortunately, such disasters are rare, and when everything goes according to plan, fulfillment usually lasts between 1 and 4 weeks for all of the backers serviced by the same hub. Games are being packed and sent individually by hard working teams around the world, and it takes a bit of time to fulfill all of our backers! \n\n#Communication\nFor our global communication, we use many different channels, including our website, social media, and newsletter. For our Kickstarter projects, we mainly provide information through campaign updates. However, feel free to contact us through our website (kolossalgames.com) or ask questions on boardgamegeek.com.\nAdditionally, we are active on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, so look us up on those platforms as well! \nDuring the campaign, we regularly update backers with information on the game, campaign progression, stretch goals unlocked and stretch goals to come. We also use updates to provide answers when many backers have the same question.\nFollowing the campaign, we provide information on the next steps: files validation, production starting, components ready, production completion, games ready to be loaded on boats, arrival at the fulfillment centers, games being packed to be sent to backers.\nAfter backers have received their games, we remain available for comments and to answer questions. We are active in the BGG forums dedicated to our games. Additionally, our support center is always available and we will answer your tickets using the following link: http://support.kolossalgames.com/open.php.\n\n#WIP\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of Western Legends: Blood Money stretch goals and add-ons, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented on the Kickstarter project page.\n\n#Refund policy\nWe can totally refund you if the request is made within 14 days of the end of the campaign. After this delay:\n- \"No Reward\" pledges will not be refunded,\n- All requests for a refund, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10% cancellation fee, which represent the Kickstarter fees, our work and payment processing fees. We won\u2019t proceed for any refund after production is complete (scheduled for July 2021).\nPlease note that if you do not complete the pledge manager by our required deadline, you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. Pledge manager is open for a long-enough time for you to complete it, and you\u2019ll be sent several reminders for that.\n\n\nWe are making transparency our top priority. Kolossal Games is a small team of dedicated people, full of positive energy. It is truly our passion to create unique and innovative games for the public to enjoy with their friends and families. We are still learning, and make some mistakes, but we are improving our processes with each new Kickstarter project.\nWe are just a bunch of people that love playing and making board games. In the past, some of our communication has been bad, and even misleading at times despite our best intentions. We have learned from these past failures and now use very specific vocabulary to describe the different stages of fulfillment. Please keep in mind we are a small team, and this can delay our answers, but we will always endeavor to respond to all questions and concerns as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there will be times where we are unable to provide a solution that pleases every backer, but we will try our best to do so. In such cases, all we can do is ask for forgiveness from any of our backers we have disappointed. It is our sincere promise that we are committed to constantly improving our process and are grateful for the opportunity to continue making games that your gracious support provides!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "The Backer Appreciation Pack", "descp": "The Back Appreciation Pack is made for Western Legends saga owners.

Instead of your dream vacation, it now falls upon you and your rival aspiring leaders to forge the ragged, disorganized survivors into a functioning society. \nYour first task is to establish and defend a foothold settlement from the dinosaurs, but your curiosity will soon call you to adventure beyond the safety of the town walls.\nOver the years, your city and society will grow strong, slowly adapting to the island and learning to both fear and respect the dinosaurs inhabiting it. Your new home is a land of danger and mystery, but also beauty and opportunity.  \nPerseverance: Castaway Chronicles consists of Episodes 1 and 2, two standalone competitive strategy games for 1-4 players, from the designers of Anachrony, Trickerion, and Yedo. Both games are playable on their own, or can be combined to experience a highly replayable Chronicle mode with overarching mechanics and no legacy elements.\nFor retail and group pledges of 6 copies or more, please write us an email at sales@mindclashgames.com \nPlease note that certain parts of Perseverance Castaway Chronicles are still in development. Because of that, the final look and quantity of the components shown here may slightly differ in the finished game. \nThe cornerstones of every Episode, these mechanisms will stay with you for the whole saga with minor evolutions between the Episodes. \nDice drafting and dice placement: The core mechanism of the entire series; you take Actions by drafting and placing Specialist dice from a pool. Some Specialists are better suited for certain Actions than others. \nThe Assembly: Whenever the dice pool runs out, an Assembly occurs. This periodic area majority mechanism scores Followers (the games\u2019 victory points) for establishing a presence in the city\u2019s districts with your colored player pieces. You can do this by building Settlements, placing your Leader, and converting Specialist dice to your player color.\nInfluencing the Officers: The city and its forming society are developing under the guidance of the Officers\u2019 Council. As an aspiring Leader, a good relationship with the Officers goes a long way and will reward you after the Assembly based on the strategies you\u2019ve been pursuing. \nThe way you interact with the threats and mysteries of the island is different in each Episode, giving it a unique feel and distinct identity.\nEpisode 1 - Dino Defense:  Build Walls, set Traps and rally Soldiers to defend against periodic Dinosaur attacks against the emerging city. Defense is often a joint effort but players are rewarded individually based on their contribution. Be careful though - failure will result in breaching Dinos, trampled Settlements and lost Followers!\nEpisode 2 - Exploration and Construction: Assemble exploration parties and venture beyond the walls of the established city! Undertake Adventures, capture Dinosaurs roaming the wild, and establish Outposts on the map hexes for even more die placement options.\nEpisode 2 - Leader Skills: Continue building relations with the Officers and they will share their tricks to help you survive and thrive! With over 30 Skills to choose from, Episode 2 offers very deep customization of your Leader and excellent replayability. \nChronicle Mode: The standalone Episodes can be linked together in the infinitely replayable Chronicle mode. Earn a Title at the end of each game based on your performance, and accomplish the goals they provide in the next. Accomplished goals and achievements earn you Glory, which you can spend to unlock various permanent bonuses and abilities. This replayable non-legacy campaign can be wrapped up after Episode 2 but also picked up again and continued when more games in the series are released.\nSolo Mode: As you rise as a leader, you will inevitably face opposition: the Dissenters. Gather Followers despite their interference: protect the city - even the Dissenters' settlements; explore the jungle - even if the Dissenters would rather stay back; and earn votes - even as the Dissenters negate your presence. Playing against them uses every feature of the game, as the Dissenters are powered by an elegant, card-driven automa designed by D\u00e1vid Turczi and developed by John Albertson, the same team that brought you the dreaded Chronossus for Anachrony.\nPlease note that all rulebooks are work in progress and their content and visuals are subject to change. The rulebooks under the link below will be periodically updated as we continue to develop the game after the campaign.\nIf you prefer watching a video instead of reading the rules, check out these tutorial videos presented on Tabletopia, courtesy of Tabletop Tutorials.\nPlease note that these videos have been recorded during a period of social distancing, with two of the players playing remotely. Because of that, as Edward also explains, these videos do not reflect the actual gameplay length, which would normally be a lot shorter.\nPlease note that these videos have been recorded during a period of social distancing, with two of the players playing remotely. Because of that, as Paul also explains, these videos do not reflect the actual gameplay length, which would normally be a lot shorter.\nBoth Episodes are mostly language independent, with a few English texts (such as Action names) that are not essential for the gameplay.\nDue to the limited availability of the games (see Exclusivity and Availability for details) and the fact that it is always a very popular request, we decided to offer a language pack for the game, available in the three most common languages among our backers: French, German and Spanish.\nThese will be publishing-quality professional translations of every rulebook and player aid card in the game.\nSince all games will be printed in English by default due to minimum manufacturing order quantities, the language pack will be packaged separately from your game box and we've kept their cost as low as $5.\nIf you are interested in the language pack, all you need to do is add an extra $5 to your pledge (now or in the Pledge manager). You will be able to choose the language you\u2019d like in the Pledge manager, as you finalize your pledge and pay the shipping cost.\nThese items are optional purchases in addition to your current pledge. Please note that one Neoprene Dice Tray is included in every pledge by default, and the Dinosaur miniatures, Squishy Berries and Metal Tokens are included in the Deluxe pledge level by default.\nTo add an addon to your pledge, simply click Manage your Pledge, then increase your pledge amount by the total cost of the items you wish to add. In the Pledge Manager following the campaign, you will be able to allocate the funds added this way to the respective addons.\nThe retail versions of all previous Mindclash Games titles will also be available as addons in the Pledge Manager. \nJust like in our previous campaign, we will be using the Gamefound pledge manager platform after the Kickstarter. On this platform, you will be able to pay the shipping cost of your pledge, increase your pledge and/or choose different rewards, and add more items to your pledge. \nYou will be able to access the Pledge Manager and the pricing you see on Kickstarter even if you pledged $1, but pledging the full amount during the campaign will be a tremendous help in making this project a success!\nAs with our previous campaigns, we will be working with shipping partners within the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Asia to provide region-friendly shipping in each of these zones. If you live in these regions, you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties.\nThe shipping cost will be charged after the campaign, using the Gamefound pledge manager. We will be charging the actual shipping cost with a small subsidy to be able to offer you the best possible value in pledge prices. The table below contains the expected shipping cost of one copy of each pledge type. If you pledge for multiple copies, the per unit shipping cost will be lower than this.\nTo make sure we minimize the potential damage during fulfillment, each of the Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles Deluxe pledges will be packaged individually by the manufacturer in 7-layered cardboard boxes and carefully padded with foam padding.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can fully refund pledges within 10 days of the campaign\u2019s end. You can still request a pledge cancellation after this time window but please note that we will deduct 10% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees, which we are unable to recover after 10 days. Cancellations are possible until the final production numbers are submitted to our manufacturer, about 4-5 months before the estimated delivery date.\nAll refunds requested more than 10 days after the closure of the campaign will either be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Refunds within 10 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Any refunds will be processed in USD.\nINCOMPLETE/ UNFINISHED ORDERS\nA few days after the campaign, we will send out the invitations to our pledge manager platform, Gamefound. The pledge manager will stay open until we submit the final production numbers. We will be in touch regarding the exact time frames and deadlines and will give timely heads ups in regular project updates after the campaign. Please note that if you fail to complete your order and pay for shipping within this time frame, you may receive your pledge with a delay, or we may not be able to send it to you.\nSHIPPING DAMAGES\nWe will ship the Deluxe pledges in 7-layered, customized cardboard boxes, carefully padded with foam padding in order to avoid shipping damages. If your copy still arrives with a visible damage, please contact us at info@mindclashgames.com. All decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace boxes with minor cosmetic damage. Thank you for your understanding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Mindclash Games' sixth Kickstarter campaign. Four of those campaigns have already shipped, and the fifth is already in mass production, allowing us to fully focus on the successful execution of this project.\n\nWe have been working on the Perseverance saga for almost 3 years, Although the entire saga's scope is bigger than anything we have ever done before, Episodes 1 and 2 are both about 85% complete: they have been extensively playtested and most of the art and graphic design work on them is already done. Once the campaign is finished, our focus will be on finishing the Chronicle mode and the rulebooks in various languages, both of which we expect to fit comfortably into the estimated delivery timeline.\n\nIn manufacturing, we will continue to work with Panda Games Manufacturing. They have been excellent partners for all our projects so far, and our five-year partnership is a guarantee for smooth communication and an inside-out knowledge of their processes and deadlines. We have a new, dedicated project manager hell-bent on making even our craziest component ideas a reality, and we already have detailed price quotes and manufacturing samples for everything this project entails.\n\nFinally, we have to take into account the uncertainty of our time, mainly caused by the COVID-19 virus. Even before the worldwide quarantine in Spring, working remotely has been an integral part of our company's culture, so another lockdown would be unlikely to slow down our internal operations and delay the project. The campaign itself is only 3 weeks, but we are leaving the pledge manager open for longer than usual to give our backers enough time to consider and recover financially, if needed. Finally, we have reserved enough capital from previous projects to be able to deliver this one even in the face of unexpected financial hardship.\n\nWe highly value transparency in all our campaigns. As always, we will be in touch about our progress and important milestones via regular project updates approximately once per month, but if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us at info@mindclashgames.com.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThanks to the high-quality materials used by Panda Games Manufacturing and the excellent replayability of both the standalone games and the campaign mode, Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles is designed to entertain you and adorn your shelf for years.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer's standard cardboard components are made from 30% recycled material, our shipping cartons are crafted from 100% recycled paper pulp, and we take great care to recycle all excess plastic and paper materials instead of simply discarding them.\nSustainable materials\nOur manufacturer uses eco-friendly inks, glues, varnishes, and wraps, and sources wood from providers who use responsible forestry practices.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nA message from our manufacturer:\nAt Panda, we have a commitment not only to produce the best quality games in the industry, but to operate in a sustainable and ethical manner.\nWe believe in producing the highest quality games in the industry, so you, your friends, and your family can play them for years to come.

As a first-time publisher, we're keenly aware of the trust you're giving us to make this project a success from start to finish. Dawnshade is the first of hopefully many games and expansions to the Dawnshade universe. We're committed to developing a trusted brand that is known for quality, reliability, and--most importantly--FUN! To this end, we've taken the time to finish and polish Dawnshade: The Watcher's Prophecy prior to releasing it on Kickstarter. The Kickstarter campaign is functionally a pre-order of the game to determine demand and how many copies we should print rather than a crowdsourced idea. The stretch goals we have chosen add content and value to the game without increasing production time and without requiring additional game testing and balancing.

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The Founders and Lords will continue to bring you weekly, high quality, irreverent nonsense about tabletop gaming and more.\nThe goal of this campaign is to ensure that The Secret Cabal continue producing weekly audio and video tabletop gaming media. To do this to full capacity we need to raise enough funds to keep Jamie in the full-time position of producer and editor of our content.  Below are just a few of the audio productions and videos that we plan to produce in 2020 - and the list doesn't end there! Check out my video talking about our plan for 2020. \nPLAY\n\n\n\nShipping Costs\nShipping is the most difficult part of running any Kickstarter. We are running this project to facilitate making as much content as we can and too many campaigns have been sunk by botched shipping. Each pledge level including physical rewards (Except the all-in pledge) will have a shipping and handling cost added to it. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING FOR ADD-ON ITEMS. All add-on items will have individual shipping added based on size, weight and destination.\nUS Shipping: $6 ($5 for just promos)\nCanadian Shipping: $13 ($10 for just promos)\nEverywhere Else: $16 ($15 for just promos)\nIMPORTANT: Double Secret Grand Master: ALL-IN shipping will not be charged during the Kickstarter but will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager based on it's destination. This pledge will require multiple shipments from different points of origin and will be determined in the same manner as if each item was add-on in the pledge manager. For international backers of this pledge level, please see note below regarding Game Topper Mats.\nIMPORTANT: Game Topper Mats and International Shipping. All pledges and add-ons including Game Topper Mats being shipped outside of the United States and Canada will be VERY expensive due to the size, shape and weight of the item. We're talking $60+. Please be aware of this when deciding to pledge for a Game Topper Mat.\nShipping For Add-Ons\n   In the post-campaign pledge manager, shipping costs will be added per add-on item based on size and destination.\nWe very much appreciate your understanding as we are attempting to minimize our risk and make sure you get all your goodies!\nWhy No Backer Dinners This Year?\nAs you know, convention season is up in the air, and it looks like most of the summer conventions and likely all of the fall conventions will be canceled. Because of this uncertainty, we have decided not to offer the backer dinners at this time. If an opportunity arises for us to host a backer dinner later in the year, we will consider how to handle it at that time. Sorry!\nIt stinks because I was planning a really special Gen Con dinner this year that would work in tandem with our Gen Con meetup (which also won't be happening). I had it all worked out too...

When social distancing restrictions begin to lighten, you will again see the other Founders back in action on the YouTube channel.\n\nRegarding fulfillment.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber.

But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid.

Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

They are what got my brother Brady and me into the hobby back when we were teenagers. Whether we\u2019re using them in roleplaying games, board games, or tabletop miniatures games, we love collecting, assembling, painting, and playing with them. While Blacklist Games has published several of our games that feature miniatures, they saw our passion could be used for the creation of a new division that would focus solely on miniatures and allow for company growth in parallel with creating great board games. With everyone at the company excited about the possibility of this new division, here we are to share it with you!\nBlacklist Miniatures will focus entirely on producing high quality, highly detailed, pre-assembled plastic miniatures to be used in any type of game. Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1, our first miniatures line, is not only a celebration of our love for miniatures, but also of all things fantasy.\nWith your support, this campaign will not only bring this project to life, but also open the door to other lines of miniatures in various genres and even new games to utilize them! \nBlacklist Games has published several board games that include detailed plastic miniatures. With each game we publish, we learn more about how to improve the quality of the miniatures we produce. When you compare the miniatures in our first game, Street Masters, with those in our most recent game, Altar Quest, you can see these improvements.\nBlacklist Miniatures will take this experience and apply it to produce our best miniatures yet. These miniatures are 28mm scale and will be produced in PVC plastic.\nDragon (Kickstarter Exclusive!)\nMale Elf Paladin\nOrc\nOoze\nQUARTERMASTER LOGISTICS\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that Quartermaster Logistics (QML) will be handling our fulfillment for Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. From what we\u2019ve seen, they have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers a peace of mind.\nFinding the perfect fit for logistics has been an immense test of trial and error, but after better understanding the needs of backers and our own expectations, we are now confident and excited for this new direction and our partnership with QML for this campaign.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nPlease note: Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, Ruins of Arkenspire, First Four) will ship in a separate, earlier wave. See below for details.\nSHIPPING FOR FANTASY SERIES 1 ITEMS\nThe current estimated delivery for Fantasy Series 1 items (Adventurer Tier, Guildmaster Tier, Altar Quest Lurker Pack add-on) is December 2020.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight).Keep in mind costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons purchased.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $65 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $12-$18 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below).\nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia and New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$20 to most countries.\n$25-$30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n$50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n$65-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n  Unfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nSHIPPING FOR ALTAR QUEST ADD-ONS\nIf you pledge for any of the Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, First Four Hero Pack, Ruins of Arkenspire) during this campaign, they will be shipped to you separately from your Fantasy Series 1 items. They will be shipped in the same time period as rewards are shipped to backers of the Altar Quest campaign (current estimate is July 2020).\nYou will pay for this shipment based on the shipping rates from the Altar Quest Kickstarter campaign. In other words, you will pay the same shipping costs that Altar Quest backers paid for these items to be shipped.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe products/rewards shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change.

Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nCOMPLETING THE PLEDGE MANAGER\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation to our pledge manager will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. \nRemember that unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and could lead to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, therefore if you do not complete your order by the pledge manager\u2019s closing date, we cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity for your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing five successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are continuing to learn how to further improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. \n\nThe following are the statuses of our crowdfunding projects:\n\nStreet Masters: Fulfilled\nBrook City: Fulfilled\nAftershock: Delivering now\nAltar Quest: In production at the manufacturer\nHour of Need: Development wrapping up \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

After the campaign closes we will be using Gamefound's pledge manager to finalize your pledge by updating your shipping address, add items to your pledge, and pay for shipping costs. You will also be able to change your address and update your pledge until mass production is completed and shipping from the manufacturer begins. We will notify you through an update on the exact date that we close the pledge manager.\nIT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU VISIT THE PLEDGE MANAGER AFTER THE CAMPAIGN CLOSES SINCE WE DO NOT GET YOUR ADDRESSES ANY OTHER WAY. THEY ARE NOT PROVIDED AS A PART OF THE TRANSACTION SERVICE.\nBe aware that pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager closes are not guaranteed to be shipped from your local fulfillment center, and may be shipped from our warehouse in the EU. For backers outside of the EU this can lead to increased shipping costs, so please remember to confirm your pledge in time.  \nAll backers from all levels will have access to upgrade their pledge after the campaign ends. After the pledge manager closes, the games and modules including all unlocked stretch goals will be available through our website ionsmg.com. \nIf you live in the regions where we offer \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d, you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties. \nIf you would like to pick up your pledge awards at SPIEL in Essen (October 2020) there will be no shipping costs for you. This alternative can be chosen in the pledge manager.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\n\nOnce mass production is complete, shipping from the manufacturer to the fulfilment centers in the US and Europe takes about 7 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of set up time before shipping to all backers in the US and Europe begins. From manufacturer to our Chinese based fulfillment center, it takes about 1 week followed by 2 weeks of setup time before shipping to all backers outside of Europe begins. Note, these times are only estimates based on information from the fulfillment centers.\nThe game production will be overseen by ION:SMG (Ion Game Design and Sierra Madre Games). At the time of the launch of this Kickstarter campaign we have still not selected a manufacturer for Pax Renaissance and Pax Viking. For High Frontier 4 All: Module 3 - Conflict we will continue using Longpack, who has done the core game and the previous modules for High Frontier. At ION:SMG we are proud to say that we have a great deal of experience producing board games. We are devoted to providing the best possible games to players and work continuously to improve the spot checking and quality assurance process.\n  There will not be a retailer/distributor reward level during this campaign. If you are a retailer or distributor and are interested in securing copies of Pax Renaissance, Pax Viking and High Frontier 4 All: Module 3 - Conflict then please send an email to besime.uyanik@iongamedesign.com to get pre-order pricing and information about how to place an order. If you are a retailer/distributor in the US then please contact Mr B, mrbgames@gmail.com.\nIf you have any questions please check the FAQ above. If your question is not answered there please ask in the comment section, and we will do our best to answer it. \nFor other general backer questions see Kickstarter\u2019s extensive help section.\nWelcome backers, and thank you for supporting us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you pledge on Kickstarter you put your trust in a project long before it is completed and you contribute, with this trust, to the making of Pax Renaissance 2nd ed, Pax Viking and High Frontier 4 All: Module 3 \u2013 Conflict a reality. We are grateful for the trust you show us. \n\nAlthough we have the best laid out plans and a generous time-line, there might be bumps in the road since there are so many different external partners (manufacturer, fulfillment center, etc). The estimated time of delivery may change due to this, but we are continuously improving the way we manufacture and deliver games based on experience from previous projects, and really hope to be able to avoid delays.\n\nAnother factor that is influencing the world right now is the covid-19 outbreak, which is constantly evolving and continues to escalate globally. This is stressful times for all of us and we are hoping it gets better soon. At the moment Ion Game Design continues as usual here in Sweden and we are in contact with our partners to be able to give all our backers continues updates.

The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with future add-ons and expansions in mind. The art style and graphic design can handle different illustration and themes so that we can create future expansions that don't require reprinting all of the base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will be producing replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials.

In 2010, we published Lords of Vegas, a high energy casino-building game. It cemented itself as one of the best games we've ever made, and a favorite of such series as Tabletop, Shut Up & Sit Down, and The Dice Tower. Our 2014 hard-to-find expansion Up! enabled more strategic casino-building and added pieces for more players. But since then, we haven't been able to bring anything new to the game's legions of fans.\nUntil today, that is. Last month, we regained the rights to Lords of Vegas. After five years in the hopper, we're publishing the long-awaited expansion Underworld, filled with mobsters and shady dealers. We're bringing out a 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle, a lush mobster briefcase stocked with poker chips, a felt-lined tray, player piece upgrades, and gambling dice. We're making a 15th anniversary edition of our book Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. And you can get the previously released versions of the base set and Up! here. We want to reward our fans for supporting our game all these years.\nIf you've never heard of the game, you might want to know... \nThe base set, Up!, and a theory of what the Underworld box might look like.\n\nLords of Vegas is a city-building eurogame in which players are casino moguls turning the desert of Nevada into something even nastier. The game starts in 1940, when Las Vegas is merely cheap motels and one-room poker houses. Of course, you bulldoze them. Over the next few decades, you construct glittering meccas of gambling and debauchery. You can build, remodel, reorganize, and sprawl your casinos along the Strip. Should you come up a few million short in your plans for world domination, take those dollars to a competitor's casino and roll the dice on a gambling spree. Here's what it looks like in play.\nThe game comes with a beautiful board of the Vegas Strip, illustrated by the masterful Franz Vohwinkel. It has 48 casino tiles, 55 cards, 40 player markers, and loads of paper money\u2014and, oh yeah, 48 dice. Yes, we made a eurogame with 48 dice. \nHere's Mike to explain how it works.\nAnd here's Quinns of Shut Up & Sit Down walking you through it.\nWith the strongly recommended expansion Up!, your casinos build skyward, gaining you  more wealth and power. This expands the game to 2-6 players using the base set and Up! The expansion has 48 riser tiles for elevating your casinos, 20 player markers, even more money, and 24 more dice, bringing the total to a spine-rattling 72 dice. If you have a copy of the base set but have never gotten your hands on Up!, please take this opportunity to do so. You'll never play the game the same way again.  \nThe Underworld expansion is a brand new set of characters, events, and properties to enhance your game with that seedy-side-of-Vegas feeling. See below for that. \nHere are some nice people saying nice things about Lords of Vegas:\n\"Lords of Vegas is the perfect simulation of the reality of gambling in Vegas, only sometimes you win.\"\u2014Wil Wheaton, Tabletop \n\"Lords of Vegas is the economic warfare game that we find ourselves recommending the most. The reason that no one should play Monopoly. Ever.\"\u2014Shut Up & Sit Down \n\"I have not seen this level of intensity. It goes back and forth fighting over these (casinos). One of the best games of the year.\"\u2014Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower (both Vasel's and Eric Summerer's top 10 of 2010)  \n\"Buy the game. Now. Do it! I'm the Lord of Vegas.\"\u2014Storm of Paul & Storm, alongside the luminaries Matt Lees, Emma Larkins, Peter Adkison, Matt Forbeck,  Aubrey Cello, Patrick Hillier, and Ignacy Trzewiczek\nCover design for the Underworld box, illustrated by Fastner & Larson.\n\nUnderworld is the Lords of Vegas expansion we've been wanting to make for a decade. Ever since the game came out, people have said, \"This is great, but where's the seedy underbelly of Vegas?\" We've got it for you in Underworld. Faster than you can say \"Those are Terry Benedict's casinos!\" you'll be deep in the muck with mobsters, thieves, grifters, and, worst of all, accountants. Here's Mike with the lowdown.\nThis expansion comes with a new Underworld board by Franz. It depicts downtown Las Vegas, the current site of the Fremont Street Experience, north of the main board's Vegas Strip. This is a work in progress. \nUnderworld board by Franz Vohwinkel. Image not final.\nUnderworld contains 52 cards, all lovingly illustrated by the talented Nate Taylor. Here's how they work. At the start of every turn, you flip out a new Underworld card onto the Underworld board. You then gain a new action called Acquire, which allows you to spend money to buy a single Underworld card. Some give you points in different ways, while others give you money over time. Others provide powers that you can use to alter your gameplay. One card might make sprawling easier, while another gives you more opportunities to gamble every turn. Eventually, who and what you have in your Underworld cards can drastically change your board position by the game's end.\nPlaytest versions shown. Images not final.\nRight now, if you own Lords of Vegas, you can help us perfect this expansion. We've created a print and play with rules and cards, which you can download by going to this page and clicking on the button marked Lords of Vegas Underworld Print and Play. Once you've played with it, go to our feedback form and tell us what you think!\nEach copy of Underworld comes with two promo cards: Time Share and The Big Score. (See below for how to get our charity promo card, Vegas Shutdown.)\nUnderworld is the expansion we've wanted to make for over half a decade. With your help, we can finally introduce the mob to Lords of Vegas.\nThe Boss Bundle is inside your very own mobster briefcase. Image not final.\nFor diehard Lords of Vegas fans, the 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle is the option you want. It's a mobster briefcase box with places to hold the components from the base game, Up!, and Underworld. Check it out. \nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box. Image not final.\n\nWhen you pull this game off your shelf, we want you to feel like a casino magnate. The briefcase box is 320 mm x 320 mm (fits nicely into a Kallax shelf) but feels weighty and substantial. There's a leather-like exterior, a felt interior, and a removable felt-lined tray with snug spaces for each player's components. It's the box we always wanted Lords of Vegas to be in.\nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box interior, with the felt-lined tray pulled out. Image not final.\nThe tray is dark wood with a felt-lined interior. There are separate compartments for the casino tiles, Up! risers, property and Underworld cards, and poker chips. The scoring markers, dice, and parking lot markers fit into the recess between the tray and the briefcase wall. The rulebook, base set board, and Underworld board set into the top.\nPrototype of the poker chips. Image and quantities of each denomination are not final.\nFans have asked for poker chips for years. The Boss Bundle'spoker chipsare still in design, but these are some initial concepts. We plan to include 20 each of $1 million, $2 million, $5 million, $10 million, and $25 million chips. The chips we like are high-density plastic with a metal chip inside making them 11.5 grams similar to a clay chip, but more durable. (Poker chips are also available as an add-on for $55 a set.)\nPrototypes and designs for the bags, gambling dice, player pawns, and cars in the player upgrade kit. Nothing here is final.\nThe Boss Bundle also comes with a player upgrade kit. We'll include 60 wooden cars (of a different shape for each player) to use in place of the markers for parking lots. We are including a deluxe version of the scoring tokens, possibly airplanes so you can vroom around on the scoring track like it's a runway at McCarran Airport. The player pack will come with six velvet drawstring bags, one for each player. It will also contain a pair of larger casino gambling dice. (The player upgrade kit is also available as an add-on for $45 a set.)\nDigital prototype of the Vegas Playmat. Image not final.\nThe Boss Bundle will also come with a Vegas playmat. This is a 24x28\" neoprene playmat which features both the base set board (The Strip) and the Underworld board (Downtown Vegas). The playmat comes with the Boss Bundle, but is too big to fit in the briefcase box. (The Vegas playmat is also available as an add-on for $40.)\nSince all people who get the Boss Bundle should have all three boxes, we've added to the bundle a unified rulebook that incorporates the rules of base, Up!, and Underworld.  (The unified rulebook is also available as an add-on for $5.)\nThe 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle comes with a copy of the base set, Up!, Underworld, and Dealer's Choice. Or, if you already own the base set and Up!, you can get it without those at the Boss Bundle (New Stuff Only) level. You can also buy most of these items as add-ons. See below for details on how that works.\nIf you want something really unique, check The Big Score Bundle with You In It. That gets you illustrated into one of our promo cards like The Big Score. You or someone you really like will become a Lords of Vegas denizen forever. We'll send you 10 of your promo card so you can leave your calling card when you next rob the Strip blind. \nThe Dealer's Choice cover from 2005. Phil's drawing a new one for the 15th anniversary edition.\nIn 2005, we joined with our buddy Phil Foglio, whom you might know from the Hugo Award-winning graphic novel series Girl Genius, to write and illustrate the definitive book on dealer's choice poker. We called it Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. After it went out of print, we were often begged for copies. So we decided to get the rights to that book back too. We're excited to offer a brand new 15th anniversary edition of Dealer's Choice, complete with a new cover. This new edition will be a staple at every poker night you attend.\nThe Dealer's Choice softcover contains the rules to 200 poker games, including old favorites like Omaha and Chicago, and bizarre new constructions like Demolition Man, Black Jack Shellacque, Frankenstein, and Night Baseball of the Living Dead. Plus we've added a bunch of additional games courtesy of our columns in Bluff Magazine. The book also features valuable tips for how to host a poker night, how to design your own games, and how to talk like a poker player. Every copy of the book comes with a PDF and an ebook. It's cool. \n Here's a handy table of what's included in each reward level.   \nWe also have a $1 level for those who just want access to our PledgeManager after the campaign. We know times are tough, so if you are stressing right now about finances, you can just pledge a dollar and we'll let you upgrade later. \nYou can also buy many of the elements of the Boss Bundle as add-ons, using the prices in this chart.\n\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. Including add-ons in your order will increase shipping costs. See below for our current shipping estimates, based on shipping out of our fulfillment sites of Florida, England, and Australia. (And yes, those \"Rest of World\" numbers are horrible. If you're from those places, we're really sorry about that,) \nAgain, these are estimates. You'll be charged exactly what it costs us to get it to your location, wherever that is. \nWe are game designers. James founded Cheapass Games and the head crustacean at Crab Fragment Labs. His games include Kill Doctor Lucky, Tak: A Beautiful Game, Button Men, Pairs, and Unexploded Cow. Mike is the lead developer and/or designer of Betrayal at House on the Hill, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Risk Godstorm, and Thornwatch, as well as the author of The Maze of Games, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Puzzlecraft. Mike and James co-founded Lone Shark Games, and together designed Pirates of the Spanish Main, Unspeakable Words, Fightball, Gloria Mundi, 12 Days, and many other games, and recently collaborated together with the Brothers Chaps on Trogdor!! The Board Game.\nLone Shark Games is a Seattle board game and puzzle company that has made such Kickstarter-fueled games and books as The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and Puzzlecraft. We also are responsible for the design of Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. You can get all our stuff at our webstore.\nWe're joined by some great artists on Lords of Vegas. Franz Vohwinkel does our boards; he's known for his work on Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, Dominion, and boardgames like Ra and Princes of Florence. Steve Fastner and Rich Larson did the covers for our base set and Up!, and are famous for their comic and pinup art. Nate Taylor is illustrating the Underworld cards; you may know him from his collaborations with Pat Rothfuss, especially The Princess and Mr. Whiffle. \nThis is a strange time to be asking for money for a game. Here's some things we know.\n1. It's the 10th anniversary of this game, and that only comes around once.\n2. We don't know when things will get better. The economy could rev back up quickly, or things could get worse. We just can't know.\n3. We can't print the game without help.\nSo, encouraged by lots of fans on BoardGameGeek, we decided to go ahead with the campaign. Still, most of our opportunities to promote the campaign\u2014conventions, magazines, Twitch play around a table\u2014are not available to us right now. We could use your help. Please share this post as much as you can with people who like games. You can also put this badge on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Kickstarter icon.\nWe also want to give back to the Las Vegas community, which was open when we shot our videos. So we're making a promo card called Vegas Shutdown (named in honor of our other favorite Vegas board game, Henry Stern's Vegas Showdown). Since it's a charity thing, and Kickstarter doesn't do charity campaigns, you can't buy it here. But if you pledge for a physical reward in this campaign, you'll have the first opportunity to get copies of the promo card for an additional $5 each in our PledgeManager. Every charity promo card purchased will help Three Square Food Bank take care of workers affected by the shutdown of the casino industry. Here's the card.\nThat's our reasons for doing this now. Once you're done taking care of your needs for yourself, your family, and your community, if you decide you like the game and would like to contribute, we'd really appreciate it. Thanks, and we hope to see you playing Lords of Vegas around a game table soon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNeedless to say, we're concerned about the coronavirus pandemic's effect on the production and shipping of this campaign. \n\nWe're acquiring inventory of the last printing of the base set and Up! from Asmodee. We're making new editions of Underworld and Dealer's Choice for this project, and we don't anticipate any manufacturing problems with those. Underworld is being printed by the same printer who printed the base set and Up! They're in the United States, which costs more but avoids problems with tariffs and shipping from China. We expect that our factory and warehouses will be open by the time these need to go to those steps, but of course we cannot know for sure. We are committed to getting the games to our backers whatever difficulties arise in the next few months.\n\nThe 10th Anniversary boss boxes are considerably more complex. We've set the shipping date on those for Christmas, but our experience with these types of projects on Thornwatch, Tak, and Apocrypha leads us to be careful about specific dates, given some instability in the supply channel now. We are planning to ship these editions separately from the games themselves, so if you pledge for a Boss Bundle, you'll get your games and books at the same time everyone else does. We'll keep you in the know as the Boss Bundle is developed.

From the award-winning game designer of Root, Cole Wehrle brings you into an interactive history lesson about life on the edge of empire.  \nIn Pax Pamir, players take the role of Afghan political factions in the early nineteenth century. For generations the Durrani Empire held the region together. Now, their authority has collapsed. Rivals both old and new have emerged from the shadows. It\u2019s up to the players to see if a fledgling Afghan state might come into being.\nThe core of Pax Pamir is simple. Each turn, players will draft cards from a central market and then play those cards. Cards can be used to entrench your position and grant players access to powerful abilities. Throughout the game players will command mighty armies, direct the subterfuge of their spies, and undertake daring political maneuvers.\nPlayers have many tools at their disposal, but the work of forging a new central Asian state is not easy. Players will often need to band together in coalitions. However, only one player will be the winner. As a coalition grows in size, its members will have to fend off internal rivals and secure their own personal dominance.\nPax Pamir takes its subject seriously. The game is the product of over five years of research and draws on a wide range of both primary and secondary sources. For this reason, the game may not be suitable for all groups. It offers an extended meditation on life at the fringes of European power and asks the players to understand the many currents that guided the history of central Asia in the nineteenth century. It is also a deeply interactive game where the path to victory often cuts through the hopes of your opponents. \nFor the first print run of Pax Pamir: Second Edition, Drew and I printed as many copies as we could manage. At that time, we weren't sure if there would be much demand for the game after it's release. The game was a labor of love, and we wanted to focus our efforts on making the best game we possibly could. Neither one of us thought that the game would require a second printing so soon. \nBut the game's sales after its release were strong, and we began to be flooded with requests for a reprint. Because Pamir is an expensive game to produce, we are once again returning to Kickstarter to raise funds for this new printing.\nWe're happy to report that there will be only marginal differences between the second printing and the first. A few small typos on some of the card flavor text have been fixed and a couple of very minor clarifications have been added to the rules. Neither of these changes warrant an upgrade kit for any of the printed components.\nThere will be only one material change. The laser cut ruler tokens proved to be both expensive and hard to decipher, so, for the second printing, we're swapping them with screen printed wooden disks. Anyone who owns the first printing can acquire these by either pledging at the five dollar level or by adding five dollars to either of the other pledge levels. \nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again as our pledge manager. Pledge mangers are third-party services that lets you manage your order leading up to fulfillment. After the campaign ends,  you'll be able to see your unique shipping rate and select any add-ons to your pledge on Backerkit.  \n Anyone who wishes to supplement their pledge with any of the add-ons listed below may add that dollar amount to their pledge or adjust their order in Backerkit after the campaign. \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again to help with your KS pledge and process accurate shipping fees. After the campaign, everyone will be emailed by Backerkit so that we can collect your shipping address and process shipping payment for your finalized order. \nThe metal coin add-on contains a cloth bag and 40 single-denomination coins pressed with a period design from the early 19th century (the last struck by the Durrani empire).  Each coin is 25 x 25 x 2mm, small enough to be practical for parsing the market and large enough to have a great feel during play. You can see another picture of the coins here.\nWe have partnered with several experienced international fulfillment companies to help you get your game as soon as possible. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from a partner hub in the US, EU, China, Canada, or Australia.\nThe following is a list of cost estimates for shipping 1 copy of Pax Pamir. Keep in mind these are not finalized yet, and the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address after the campaign wraps up. Shipping will vary from country to country and be calculated using both weight and size. In general, the more copies of Pax Pamir you order, the more shipping will cost. Additional copies will add another 30-50% of shipping cost to your order. \nFor folks submitting small orders, like those interested in just metal coins or ruler tokens, shipping will be a fraction of the cost. Depending on your address, most small order shipping will cost less than 50% of the listed rate below. \nIf your game store is interested in a retail order, please submit a Retailer Deposit Pledge and a fill out this form here!  This offer is only available to Brick & Mortar retail stores. Proof of status will be required. Bulk discounts not available for group buys or clubs. \nAll retailers will be required to place a $50 deposit on Kickstarter to get access to our Retailer Backerkit platform. Your $50 pledge will be credited to your retailer order. Note, you must be a verified retailer to have access to this order platform. All unverified Retail Deposit Pledges will revert to the standard pledge. If you have any questions about Pax Pamir retailer info, check out the order request link and do not hesitate to contact drew@wehrlegig.com\nThis Kickstarter is for the English edition of Pax Pamir only. However, alongside this edition, we have partnered with several established game companies to help produce editions of Pax Pamir in five languages!

That means we will offer a full, free print-and-play kit of Pax Pamir: Second Edition for download. Anyone can use, remix, and share the game so long as they do not use it for commercial purposes. \nAt Wehrlegig Games our objective is simple: publish beautiful games with historical themes that treat their subjects and their players seriously. These are games that make arguments and encourage discussion. They don't shy away from difficult subjects.\nBecause we know the audience for such games is limited, in order to make sure we produce games up to our standards we have decided to rely on a direct sales model. The vast majority of all copies produced will be sent to Kickstarter backers. Our games are not designed for traditional distribution or retail channels. This means we can spend many more resources on the game's physical production without having to worry about retail viability.\nOur next project is the second edition of John Company, which we hope to launch on Kickstarter later this year.\nCole Wehrle is a published writer and game designer who currently serves as a staff designer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. Before working in the board game industry, Cole earned his PhD at the University of Texas. His research concerned the ways that the British Empire influenced narrative structure in the nineteenth century novel. He has presented at conferences all over the world and taught classes on a wide range of subjects, from Rhetoric to American Postmodernism. He is perhaps best known for his historical board games (An Infamous Traffic and John Company),for Root, and for his upcoming game Oath.\nDrew Wehrle is the older of Cole's two younger brothers. He has helped Cole develop every game he has ever designed. During the development of the first edition of Pax Pamir, Drew lived with Cole in Austin, Texas and was instrumental in preparing the game for publication. Drew will be handling all of the business and operational elements of Wehrlegig Games, as well as assisting in game development. He previously managed school programs at Chicago Botanic Garden, and as of early 2020, he now helps manage Wehrlegig games full-time. \nThank you to our collaborators: Abol Bahadori for the action icons illustrations, Josh Berer for the box script design, Alex Singh for the wonderful video, Travis Hill for the rulebook support, Ross Connell for the lovely photos, David Carter for the extra customer service, Ben Kyo and AgentElrond for the digital implementations, and all the Backers that help bring our projects to life.

At this point, all of the files of the game are compete and the majority have already made it through the pre-press process. We hope to begin production shortly after the campaign is over. \n\nDrew is now managing this project full-time and will be able to keep an close eye on both the production and fulfillment of the campaign. We have also built a wide network partnerships with folks around the gaming industry, and we have contingencies in place for every element of the project's production and fulfillment. This is the eighth game Cole will have shepherded through the manufacturing process.\n\nWe have built plenty of padding into our schedule to absorb delays, and we are closely monitoring the global effects of COVID-19 outbreaks on the production and shipping timelines.

This is the third title in the West Kingdom trilogy of games, following on from Architects and Paladins.\n*Tax-friendly shipping to Canada and Portugal is only for English editions, not French or Portuguese.\nViscounts of the West Kingdom is set at a time when the King\u2019s reign began to decline, circa 980 AD. Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.\n Key Features:\nUnique gameplay experience, blending deck-building, tableau-building and rondel movement, with a lot of interesting and tough decisions to make each turn\n10 unique Hero characters, more than 60 unique Townsfolk Cards and a modular board, creates a huge amount of depth and replayability\nMultiple paths to victory, due to the 4 unique primary actions, virtue/corruption system and deck-building flexibility\nPositive player interaction, with a lot of off-turn benefits to keep players engaged\nIntuitive and easy to use solo play mode, with 4 unique AIs to compete against\nOver 200 cards, 200 wooden tokens and a 3D castle!\nAim of the Game\nThe aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!\nComponents\nBuild the kingdom, defend its borders and increase your influence throughout the lands. In the campaign mode, players will be competing in an epic journey to collect the most tomes and earn their place among the chronicles of their people. Alternatively, players may instead band together to take on the ruthless Overlord in separate co-operative modes for each game in the West Kingdom Trilogy.\nCampaign Components\nCo-Op Components\nFree Promo Components\n* Note that these promos are a standard part of the Tomesaga box.

These promo packs are not available as a separate add-on in this campaign.\nGroups:  Over the past 5 years we have always looked to improve how we handle larger group pledges.

He foolishly set himself a goal in 2012 to have 10 games published internationally within 10 years, a journey that began with Pocket Imperium and Dragon Slayer in 2014 and The Ming Voyages is the 8th to be published. With 9 and 10 to be announced shortly he is wondering what is next...\nAlan Paull: Alan started designing games aged 11 and has refused to give up on the idea even though he's now 62. Alan has designed games in many genres: bijou and large, Euro and card, family and niche hobby, board wargames and miniatures wargames, role-playing and freeform games. He hopes to master one of them before he dies. \nSurprised Stare Games: SSG is a small UK independent game design and publishing company, run by Tony Boydell and Alan Paull, and now in its 20th Anniversary year. We design and publish games that people want to play again and again; games that are colourful and rich in theme and detail; games that are innovative and, most importantly, fun!\n2Tomatoes: There are 2 tomatoes: \u00c1lvaro Lerma and Jordi Rodr\u00edguez. We met at uni and after having adventures more or less all over the world we founded the company with a simple goal in mind: make games that are different, that stand out. We're very passionate about what we do and we only publish games that we love. It is a lot of work but we can live with the burden. Expect more from us soon...\nFrosted Games is about not only offering games, but also the icing on the cake and the cherry on top.

It is prone to many mistakes and things can sometimes go wrong. \n\nHowever, 2Tomatoes Games and Frosted Games have successfully run and delivered all of our crowdfunding projects (Kickstarter, Verkami, Ulule), and this one will be no different. While Surprised Stare Games has not run such projects directly, we have partnered with other companies to deliver our games on many occasions over the past 20 years, in addition to our own production projects. The second and third editions of our game Snowdonia were kickstarted successfully by other partner companies.\n\nHere are the steps we have taken in order to reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays: \n\n1 - We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the materials for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete; the remaining 5% will be achieved during the campaign. We already have the production quotes and an agreement with our manufacturer. We just need the funding to be able to start producing! \n\n2 - We use fulfilment companies for shipping when we have a large number of orders to ship in a short period of time. \n\n3 - We are fully committed to transparency and backer communication.

Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

You will earn Production Points (PP) for performing various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at the end of the game is declared the winner.\nVehicles moving down the assembly line\nElectric Vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014. EV\u2019s are the future of the automobile industry. They are superior vehicles due to being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and are cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion engine counter parts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\nEach car model can be upgraded by various parts\nOver the course of the game, players take on the role of novice supervisors, trying to secure their careers. You will need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\nBlueprints can be claimed from the Design Department\nYou must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you, or for mistakes.\nSandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo\nThe Eagle-Gryphon Kanban EV Deluxe version of this critically-acclaimed game improves on past editions by providing:\n All-new artwork and graphics by Ian O'Toole to improve both the visual aesthetics and the functional play of the game (e.g. the beautiful and all-new board layout and display!)\n 5 different models and \"paint jobs\" of the 5 wooden vehicles AND the possibility to add-on a complete set of 40 metal vehicles \n A solo game version designed by the master of solo game versions -- David Turczi \n A brand new SpeedCharger expansion created by Vital Lacerda\n A new approach to the Boardroom (and its chairs) which streamlines play in that area of the board by using wooden Speech Tokens -- creating a cleaner implementation of this mechanic\n Lots of other great 3D wooden bits instead of 2D cardboard tokens (e.g. see below the Certification, Production Cycle, Meeting, Banked Shift, and Car Part Value Markers; Worker and Sandra Meeples; Player Locks and Car Parts; and Book and Parts Voucher tokens)\n Dual-layered, spacious and well-organized Player Boards \n A silver-painted Metal pace car (Stretch Goal)\n A Special Garage Tile Expansion (Stretch Goal)\n New (and extra) Final Goal tiles (Stretch Goal)\n A new and better laid-out Rulebook, Reference Book, and Player Aid sheets \n Rules Changes from Previous Editions:\nYou may no longer replace Cars in your garages with new ones.\nWhen Sandra penalizes you, you now lose 1 PP in addition to PP for any Banked Shifts that you have below 5.\nIn the Nice Sandra variant, you are only rewarded PP for Banked Shifts you have over 5, instead of for all of your Banked Shifts.\nThere are 3 new Final Goal tiles to choose from during Setup. \nThe new Board Room with Speech tokens for a cleaner implementation\n SOLO Mode by David Turczi\nKanban EV Solo cards\nIn the Kanban EV Solo Rules, you\u2019re the new hire at the company and your productivity will tightly watched. Any sign of slacking behind and you\u2019ll be terminated. Worse, the senior engineer Mr. Lacerda and junior architect Mr. Turczi would rather you don\u2019t make the cut, and will be trying to outperform you every step of the way.\nSPEEDCHARGER Expansion Now Included! \nThe SpeedCharger expansion provides players with persistent special abilities they may pay shifts to unlock.\nDuring setup, place 4 SpeedCharger tokens per player in a supply next to the Game board. Each player receives a Charging board which is placed next to their Player board.\nWhen working Shifts in R&D (or indirectly through Administration), you may spend 1 Shift to take a SpeedCharger token from the supply and place it on a space of your choice on your Charging board. From now on, the covered bonus is active for the rest of the game. Also, at the end of the game, each Charger token is worth 1 PP for each Car in your garages.\nFor example: If you have 3 cars and 4 SpeedCharger tokens, you score 12 PP. \nYou can only take one SpeedCharger per turn.\nThe Bonuses when played in...\nR&D - Once per turn, you can upgrade 1 Design with a Car Part from the supply.\nAssembly - You may ignore the restriction of having to provide upgraded parts first.\nLogistics - You bank 2 Shifts instead of 1 when placing a Kanban card.\nDesign - When you take a Design from the Central Design Stack, gain 1 Book.\nAdministration - When working in Administration, you receive 1 extra Shift.\nKANBAN EV Rulebook\nClick for Draft Rules\nALL the wood components in Kanban EV!\nNow that Kanban EV has 10 images on BoardGameGeek.com with 500+ thumbs, we are ADDING a Metal Pace Car, produced the same way as our 40 Metal Vehicle Add-On Pack cars, to the game in addition to the wooden pace car.\nNow that Kanban EV has at least 1,000 'Fans' on BoardGameGeek.com, we are adding additional Final Scoring tiles to the game. We do not yet have an exact number of how many tiles this will be, but we will fill the remaining space available on the punchboard with additional Final Scoring tiles to increase the variability of the game.\nNow that we have added 1000 New Subscribers to our Newsletter, the Special Garage Tile Mini-Expansion will be included in the Kanban EV KS Edition.\n\nNow that we have 500 retweets of our Tweet about Kanban EV, we will expand the SpeedCharger Expansion (see below) to include 6 new Meeting cards and 4 new Final Goal Tiles. \nNow that we have 500 shares on Facebook, we have INCLUDE the SpeedCharger Expansion (see above) in the Kanban EV KS Edition!\n\n\nThe following Add-Ons will be available in the CrowdOx pledge manager after the conclusion of this Kickstarter campaign on February 21. We expect the CrowdOx pledge manager to run from February 24 through March 20, at which time all add-on purchases must be made.  Please do not add funds for these Add-On items to your pledge now -- you will pay for them and shipping for this KS campaign when you complete your pledge manager.\nForty metal cars in the same dimensions as the wooden cars for the game. 8 per vehicle type.

Mariana Vit\u00f3ria de Bragan\u00e7a (1718\u20131781)\nOnce the King was unable to reign, the Queen became the regent.  Mariana Vit\u00f3ria didn\u2019t like the Marquis de Pombal because of the way he handled the Tavora affair, in which a  noble and powerful family that were friends of the Queen were accused of attempted regicide, and then executed in public by the Marquis, without a fair trial, purely to gain political power. In 1777, immediately after the death of the King, she dismissed the Marquis by Royal Decree and exiled him to his hometown, Pombal. \nPaul Grogan of Gaming Rules! hosted a live Q&A with Designer Vital Lacerda on February 6th, 2020, but you can watch the recording of this livestream in the video above.\nGaming Rules! overview of the original edition of Kanban:\nThe Official How-to-Play Video for Kanban EV will be created by Paul Grogan, and will appear on Gaming Rules!\nHeavy Cardboard's teaching & playthrough video of the original edition of Kanban:\nClick to Launch KANBAN EV on Tabletopia!\nElectronic Vehicles in the Production Queue\nVital Lacerda has designed a prolific list of euro strategy games including On Mars, The Gallerist, Vinhos Deluxe, Lisboa & Escape Plan.

The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order through both Kickstarter and Pledge Manager.

We assure you that you will be the first to know about any developments about production and shipping as we learn them.\nPut simply: you will get everything we promise to you when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur.

If your package is damaged, please contact us at kickstarter@eagle-gryphon.com so we can assist you. \n\nPlease do not add any estimated shipping expense to your Kickstarter pledge!  \nBased on lots of prior experience, we have decided to collect from you the actual shipping cost for Kanban EV, and any add-ons you want to order, during the Crowd Ox pledge manager period -- which will be open from February 24 through March 20, 2020.  We believe that this is the fairest and best approach, to both you as a backer and to us as the publisher.\nWe will ship your orders, en masse, to our Fulfillment Partners around the world: in Canada, Asia Pacific, EU, UK, Australia and the US.  Our Fulfillment Partners will then see that your orders are sent to you quickly and safely, regardless of where you live in the world. While we aim to have the shipments to each fulfillment partner shipped from China at roughly the same time, the speed with which each shipment reaches  its regional fulfillment varies, as does the speed with which each fulfillment partner can ship out all the pledges for their region. We  will try to keep you updated as to the shipping and distribution status in your region or country, but we must ask that you remain patient and respectful during the shipping and fulfillment process.\nNOTE: If the UK does not remain in the Customs Union, at the time of shipment any extra taxes and duties will be the responsibility of the UK backers. It is possible for customs fees and/or tariffs to apply to any country outside of the country of origin for the shipment and we are not responsible for these Custom fees, taxes, etc. It is simply not possible for us to know and anticipate these for you. This is true for countries such as Japan and Brazil among others.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP DIRECTLY TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. We do have a Ukrainian shop (Geekach) that will order and send games to you (see more info on Geekach above).\nBelow we have included a chart with shipping estimates for the Factory Worker & Employee of the Month pledge levels (subject to change based on your country / locale and final shipping weight):\nPlease keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may vary based on your specific country and address.

The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories in retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete.\n\nKickstarter Video Credits:\nVideo Production: Brian Davis\nVideo Music: Oh, Jeremiah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project.

Printing for these Spring releases will begin soon, with releases scattered in the upcoming months. This campaign gives backers the chance to receive two of the new titles, Zen Garden and Way To Go, at the very beginning of the release window. \nBoth of these games will be available in distribution in many regions. However, on this campaign we are offering prices far below MSRP, along with the chance to get it when it first releases. In addition, our bundles with both games provides even more of a discount, as well as reduced shipping.\nZen Garden\nIn Zen Garden, the players assume the role of architects working to build the most beautiful garden for the Emperor. To do this, they need to pay careful attention to the Emperor's preferences, while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.\nDesigned by first-time designer Mike Georgiou, Zen Garden is a tile laying and pattern building game that pays tribute to the beauty and simplicity of Japanese Rock Gardens. Every one of the 90 tiles in the game has unique features, and the players must draft the tiles wisely as they seek to construct a tranquil garden for the emperor. The game features a simple ruleset with high variability, and the satisfaction of creating a beautiful garden with your pieces. \nZen Garden comes with five preference boards that determine which features of the garden score in that game. The boards selected (and their number) will greatly change the objectives players will strive for in that game, as well as the complexity of the scoring. \nGame Play\nZen Garden Rulebook\nAt the start of the game, players decide how many Preference Boards (representing the demands of the emperor) they will use for the game. The more boards, the more difficult it will be to arrange the garden. This system allows the difficulty of each game to be tweaked so that the game is playable with all groups of players, from casual to expert gamers. \nAll players are given a garden board with 16 spaces. The difficulty comes in placing tiles such that the walkways connect and the features of the garden match the preferences of the emperor as much as possible. You will also need to pay attention to what your opponents are doing in order to choose the correct tiles to place. \n Tiles are selected from a market of twelve, with 4 tiles being free, 4 costing 1 coin, and 4 costing 2. You have a limited number of coins to spend all game (and they are worth points at the end), so spend them wisely. Players will alternate taking tiles until each player has filled their garden. \nWhen all players have filled their garden board with 16 tiles and made a complete garden it is time to check which one is the best according to the emperor\u2019s wishes. One by one each wish is checked and points are earned by the players. The player who has the most points is the winner and the new official gardener of the emperor!\nWay To Go\nQueen Games is delving into a new genre with a party game by Urtis \u0160ulinskas (who recently designed the acclaimed release Planet). Way 2 Go is a sensory deprivation party game for a team of 1-7 players (or two teams of up to 7 players) that promotes team play and trust, along with a lot of laughs.\nThe object of the game is to draw a line within a confined space from start to finish. This would be easy\u2014except the person drawing the line is blindfolded and must receive direction from the other players. All other players form a line and have different means of communicating where to draw the line next. A complex and hilarity inducing chain of hampered communication forms, where information is lost or misinterpreted, making the simple task of drawing a line quite challenging. \nWith 4 different tracks and many difficulty levels as well as a team vs team variant this party game does not become stale and can be played countless times! \n Game Play\nAt the start of the game one player is chosen to be blindfolded and tasked to take the pen and draw the line from start to finish. All other players take, depending on the difficulty level, a communication card that describes where in the line they are and what they are allowed to do. Sometimes you are not allowed to look or say something so your only means of communication is by touching the next person in line to communicate where to draw next. Sometimes you can speak, but you have to use some coded language to convey what to do next.    \nThe game includes 7 different difficulty levels and 4 different tracks, ensuring that the challenge will never get stale, even for the group that is looking for a challenge. Tracks vary from very easy with only a few corners and wide areas to draw on to very narrow ways with chances to to take short cuts. The combination of difficulty levels and tracks means that there is something for every skill level.\nAnd finally you can play Way To Go as a team versus team game, competing to the be the first to cross the finish line. This mode is very intense and is perfect for large groups of players to have a battle of wits and dexterity. If a team draws over the track they have to wait 5 seconds before drawing again, giving the other team a big time advantage.\nWay To Go is super fun party game for the whole family and extended family!\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Way 2 Go and Zen Garden is planned for the end of April 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for in our warehouse. Some pledges will be sent via container to our fulfillment center in the US, meaning these pledges (US and possibly other regions outside of Europe) may fulfill 6-8 weeks after pledges in Europe start to ship. Please note that all shipping projections are our best estimates only, and not guarantees.\nWe offer \"friendly\" shipping to a number of zones around the world, including the United States, and the European Union. If your country is not listed as \"friendly,\" Queen Games is not responsible for any local charges, customs fees, or if a local carrier (i.e. not the carrier we shipped by) loses your package. In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\nPledge Manager\nQueen Games plans on using a pledge manager to help with the logistics of fulfilling the campaign. It is the responsibility of each backer to complete the survey on the pledge manager in a timely manner in order to receive their rewards. \nIt might be possible to add on additional copies of products in the pledge manager after the campaign, although the best prices are obtained by pledging now. \nPost Campaign Communication\nWe will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions. Please note that, since we do not have a full time employee dedicated to Kickstarter alone, we may not be able to actively monitor the comments after the campaign closes. If you have a question about your pledge, please send us a message.\nWe will do our best to post all pertinent information in a timely manner either as an update or in emails to relevant backers.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging for this product, you are accepting the following terms.\nREFUND POLICY Following the terms of Kickstarter, Queen Games will provide a full refund provided the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.If a request is made after this period, any refund would be at the discretion of Queen Games, and would be a maximum of 85% based on incurred fees and handling costs.\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS We understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY We will send a survey out to backers to collect addresses. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the name, final look, and materials of the project are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active. Queen Games will make all reasonable efforts to make the final product congruent with what is presented in the campaign, and to inform backers of the reasons for necessary changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQueen Games is a company with over 30 years of experience to it's name.\n\nWe know about the Kickstarter challenges, such as coordination of production from multiple manufacturers, delays with production and shipping, challenges with shipping around the world and missing or lost packages.\n\nAlso, despite sending the rewards at the same time, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others because of logistics of international shipping.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the name, final look and materials of the project and hence the rewards, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Way To Go", "descp": "Includes rules in English, German, French, and Dutch.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to buying our company \"team building\" yacht.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Today\u2019s update is brief, but we didn\u2019t want another day to go by without sharing some progress with you folks."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 4440, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcanewonders/foundations-of-rome", "project_name": "Foundations of Rome"}}, {"backer": "Ryan Bruns", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The coolest game to ever hit the planet first appeared some 38 years ago, featuring an electronic tower that lit up, played music, and somehow ran an epic fantasy adventure game with its state-of-the-art technological wizardry. That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components.

These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet.

Players might attempt to bolster the power of the Chancellor or scheme to bring the empire to ruin. The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game's core victory condition.\nEvery system in Oath is built from the ground up to be responsive and adaptable. A single decision could reverberate for dozens of games afterwards.\nThe core rules are simple: Players will spend their turns adventuring within the Chancellor's realm and the lands that surround it. They will gather support, recruit warbands, and discover dark and dangerous secrets. Over the course of the game, players will collectively populate the world with a cast of strange and wonderful characters and institutions. This world is essentially a shared tableau, which every player can interact with and seek to control.\nMost players begin as Exiles, powerful figures living on the edge of polite society. An Exile wins the game by directly challenging the Chancellor's power or by attempting to fulfill a new Vision.\nThe Chancellor wins the game by maintaining their grip on the empire. To this end, they may wish to make offers of citizenship to one or more Exiles. If accepted, these new Citizens will help the Chancellor maintain control, but the Chancellor will need to be careful. These new Citizens present threats to their own succession. Though players will sometimes need to work together, only one player will ever win.\nIn the video below, Cole, Oath's designer, will walk you through a few turns of the game so that you can see some of the systems in action:\nPLAY\n\nEvery game in Oath affects the games that follow. If one game ends with the fall of an empire, the next game will be played in its still-smoldering ruin. There is no pre-written narrative or pre-determined end point. Oath is not a legacy game. Instead, it is a game about legacy where the choices the players make will determine what happens next.\nAt the end of each game of Oath, players will take account of what happened in their game during the Chronicle Phase. During this phase, the game\u2019s board will be re-centered around the territory of the game\u2019s victor, the victory condition may be adjusted, and new cards will be introduced to the deck depending on how the game was won. When they have completed this process, they will have advanced the history of their world by a generation and set the stage for the next crisis.\nAt this point, players can opt to play another game or they can pack up the game into the box in a way that will preserve the game state for easy setup for the next game. Games of Oath take about 6 minutes to pack up and no more than 3 minutes to set up.\nSet up the game in three minutes or less.\n\nThose looking for an epic, multi-generational game can play several sessions of Oath in a row easily. Each game only takes 45 minutes to a couple hours depending on the players' experience and what happens in the game. But it\u2019s also easy to play a single round, clean up the game, and then resume it days or weeks later. And, because of the game\u2019s design, your playgroup doesn't need to remain consistent. After playing the game on a Saturday night with your regular group, you can continue to develop the world during the week with your partner or by yourself with the game\u2019s solo mode, and then continue the story with your group when you meet again the following week.\nTo catch our live streams, make sure to follow us on Twitch. Recordings of our live streams will be posted on Youtube.\nYou can follow Leder Games on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nFor more information about Oath and designer diaries, head on over to the BGG page!\n For Retailer Orders, please email clay@ledergames.com.\nSince 2014, Leder Games has been building immersive designs that put players first. In 2015 we released Vast: The Crystal Caverns, a ground-breaking asymmetric strategy game. In 2018, we released Root, which has won numerous international gaming awards for both its design and production.\nAt Leder Games we believe in creating socially conscious games that reward repeat play and study. These are games meant to be enjoyed for many years. Game design, art direction, illustration, and product design are all handled holistically from the start of every project until its completion.\nThis creative spirit extends to the structure of the company. The vast majority of our staff are employed full-time and have benefits. Everyone is enfranchised in the success of all of our games, both old and new. We pay our interns too.\nThis means we might be a little slower at making games than your average game company, but we work hard to treat our titles with the utmost care and create games that we think can stand the test of time.\nIf you're interested in getting your hands on previous titles, we still have copies of Vast: The Mysterious Manor, the stand-alone sequel to Vast: The Crystal Caverns, available on our website here.\nWe will resume selling Root and its expansions in February, after we have completed the bulk of fulfillment for the Underworld Expansion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLeder Games now has 10 employees covering a wide range of tasks. Our project management, production, and logistical details have grown considerably.\n\nWe recently completed Vast: The Mysterious Manor and we are currently shipping Root: The Underworld.\nAtlas, our North American warehouse and shipping partner, has moved to a larger facility and can ship things much more quickly. Our shipping outside of North America is being handled by another firm, and currently, they need to receive all of their inventory before shipping which could cause delays.\n\nWe have many established business partners in every part of the process, from printing to customer service to fulfillment. We do not foresee any challenges but can change partners as needed.\n\nProduction-wise if our partner were to close under the weight of new tariffs or from the competition. We would simply employ one of the other production relationships we have been working on to continue the print.\n\nLogistically we have had a few snags in the past. Part of the confusion is a lack of understanding that our larger international shipping partners are either massively overbooked or dependent on all of the inventory arriving before they will process any orders. As we move into the future we will continue exploring our logistical options and we strive to improve the process. When shipping starts we now have many more Leder Games personnel to dedicate to the task.

This epic undertaking connected the United States from coast to coast for the first time. Now is your chance to make history!\nIn Pacific Rails Inc, players are the Presidents of their own Railway Company, with a contract to build a railroad from one side of the board to the other.\nWell-known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more, professional illustrator and game artist Damien Mammoliti joined the Vesuvius Media Team to create the stunning artwork of Pacific Rails Inc. From the box cover all the way to the game board, the artwork is highly-detailed and beautifully  crafted.\n Pacific Rails is language independent. The game's components have no text. As such, with just the rulebook you will be able to play the game in all supported languages.\nInside the game's box, the rulebook will be in English. However, through our website (http://www.vesuviusmedia.com) or the Hive Portal (http://www.hiveinteractive.net) you will be able to download the rulebook for the core game and its expansions in several supported languages (eg. English, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more), after the end of the campaign.\nEnd Game Goals are random Victory Point milestones. Every time you play you choose a different combination of them, which will affect your overall strategy.\nAll the upgraded components in this image will be provided by \"Upgrade Your Games\", packaged separately from the core game.\nUsing our Stretch Goals we will try to upgrade the Resources of the Deluxe Edition, from simple plastic to components from the \"Upgrade Your Games\" collection. We have already unlocked the upgrade for wood, metal and gunpowder:\nUpgrade Your Games is a up-and-coming production company that creates high-quality tokens at competitive prices. From metal coins to pre-painted resin components (and more!), its goal is to enhance your gaming experience and help bring your favorite boardgames life! [http://www.upgrade-yourgames.com]\nThe Deluxe Components (and all related Stretch Goals) will be packaged separately. However, there will be room in the core box's plastic tray to fit them.\nLearn how to play by watching the following video:\nClick to download the BETA version of our rulebook.\nKickstarter Previews\nClick on this image for more information about our Retailer's Program\nClick on this image to get more information about our Group Orders.\nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below:\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nUK & Brexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for September 2020. Right now, the UK is in an unstable and unknown status as far as its relationship with the EU is concerned. There is no way for us to predict how this is going to end and what repercussions this might inflict on shipping. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know more when we do.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to use VFI so we can give you a customs-friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might mean it will take longer to be fulfilled, but it ensures that there will be NO custom fees or surprise extra charges on your pledge!\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nHawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the USA category. They are included in the Rest of the World category.\nWe expect the shipping box for the Standard Edition tobe 29 cm x 29 cm x 12 cm and weigh around 2.5 kilograms. The estimated shipping rates, which are based on these assumptions, can be seen in the table below.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you are close to any of the following locations, you can choose to pick up your reward and not pay shipping costs!\nConference Pickup\nIn our pledge manager you will be able to select as a pickup location one of the conferences that we will be attending. About 10 days before that conference you will receive an email with a special unique \"Pickup Code\" which you can bring to our booth to get your game, without paying any shipping costs! Below you can see a list of conferences that can be used as pickup location for this game:\nSpiel 2020 at Essen, Germany\nPax Unplugged 2020 at Philadelphia, United States\nAthensCon 2020 at Athens, Greece\nHalcon 2020 at Halifax, Canada\n[*] FanExpo 2020 at Toronto, Canada\n[*] GenCon 2020 at Indianapolis, United States\n[*] Conferences marked with the asterisk are still under consideration.

That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign. Loyalty Credit can be used to purchase add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us in only one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive a $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty Credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty Credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback. Its community of players help shape the future of its games!\nTo date, Vesuvius Media has successfully Kickstarted eleven (11) board game projects:\n Centauri Saga (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Cosmic Pioneers (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Centauri Saga: Season 1 (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Covil: The Dark Overlords (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Winter (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Nocturion (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n MonstroCity (Production Finished, estimated delivery February 2020)\n Up Your Game (Production under way, estimated delivery April 2020)\n Dwar7s Spring (Production under way, estimated delivery May 2020)\nYou can check out our Kickstarter Projects' history and stats on this cool website:\nhttps://www.tabletopanalytics.com/creator/vesuvius-media-ltd-78\nWe learn from our mistakes, we listen to your suggestions, and we strive to become better.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Vesuvius Media Ltd should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible. \n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is September 2020. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nBACKER RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIt is your responsibility to check the Kickstarter campaign's updates and the private messages we send you. If a backer does not complete the Pledge Manager in time, then the shipping rates to send you the game at a later time will be a lot higher (because they will not be part of the mass shipping process). If the game can not be delivered because you did not fill out your shipping information and more than 6 months have passed after the deadline, there is a chance we will not be able to deliver you the game. At that point, you will not be entitled to a refund. \n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAfter this campaign, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around May, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates about Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects. Such updates will be rare.\n\nYou will also receive notifications about future projects. These notification will also be very rare and it will be very easy for you to opt-out with on click.\n\nBY PLACING A PLEDGE ON THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS & CHALLENGES STATED IN THIS SECTION.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nVesuvius Media Ltd.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Standard Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Pacific Rails Inc. and all applicable Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nPacific Rails Inc.\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["206 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Deluxe Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Pacific Rails Inc, a set of upgraded tokens, and all Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nPacific Rails Inc.\nUpgraded Tokens\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,341 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Retailer's Pledge", "descp": "A deposit of 4+ bundles of Pacific Rails Inc.

Players play as Druids trying to forge powerful Rune Stones and earn the right to rule over the magical kingdom. You must buy cards and use them to gain gems and forge artifacts, all in a race to 65 points. But be careful\u2014every card has a unique number on it, and when you play two cards, the higher numbered card will be destroyed. Artifacts help players build Rune Stones, which give powerful abilities, and will accelerate you towards victory. \nThe release of Rune Stones has met with critical acclaim, including Top 20 rankings at the Essen Game Fair (tied for 10th by Fairplay and 16th in BGG Geekbuzz) and BGG Con, and the entire first print run has sold out already. Coinciding with a second print run of the game will be a second expansion which brings more variability and a new mechanic to the game.\nThis new expansion, along with the Nocturnal Creatures expansion, will be for sale in this print run only directly from Queen Games, and will not be sold into distribution.\nRune Stones Expansion 2: Enchanted Forest\nThe second Expansion to Rune Stones includes two modules: Rune Influx and Familiars.\nRune Influx comes with 8 totally new rune stones for players to discover new strategies with. With double the number of Rune Stones, the possibilities are vast. The module also includes rules for playing with all Rune Stones in a single game.\nFamiliars introduces animal assistants and an enchanted forest. Send your familiars into the forest to earn endgame points, as one as powerful one-time abilities which may be saved and used at the opportune moment. \nThe Rune Stones All In Bundle offers everything there is to discover in the world of Rune Stones:  \n Expansion: Enchanted Forest \nModule 1: Familiars\nFamiliars will help the druids on their quest by discovering the enchanted forest and collecting different toadstool tiles, which will offer powerful one-time use abilities. These abilities are kept hidden by the players and may be used at any time to gain a tactical advantage.\nTo advance a familiar one space deeper into the forest, players either need to forfeit an ability on a played card, or forge the artifact located at the second forge on the game board (this space previously had no bonus). For most steps the familiar either gains an immediate effect, such as taking a card or rolling the die, or they can draw one toadstool tile to be used at a later time. The player who has progressed deepest into the forest will receive 8 points at the end of the game, with other players receiving 5, 3, and 1 point.\nAmong the toadstool tile effects include copying another player's played card, not discarding cards that are played for their ability, using other player's rune stones, or declaring a gem color to be wild that turn!\nModule 2: Rune Influx \nEight new rune stones await discovery and experimentation!\nNew rune stone abilities include:\n Forge 3 artifacts in a turn instead of 2.\nPlay the same card twice (and ignore the other played card)\nGain the same bonus as another player when they forge an artifact.\nGain a creature card when forging an artifact with a bonus.\nAnd more...\nWith now a total of 18 rune stones (Base Game, Queenie, and Expansion) there is a lot of variability and combinations to try. \nAlong with the new Rune Stones is a new way to play the game. Instead of choosing 8 Rune Stones for the game, two copies of each stone are placed in a bag. Eight of these are placed on the game board, and are available for players to build. Whenever a Rune Stone is taken, it is replaced by one in the bag. This variant allows for a more tactical and variable gameplay, with players having to choose when to turn in for Rune Stones that are best for them.\nBundle Offers\nGet Luxor and Rune Stones from acclaimed designer R\u00fcdiger Dorn in this Designer Bundle offer: \n Rune Stones Base Game\nA game from Queen Games and award-winning designer R\u00fcdiger Dorn (Luxor, Istanbul) which transports you to a world of druids, mystical creatures, and magical artifacts!\nRune Stones is a deck-building, hand management game by acclaimed designer R\u00fcdiger Dorn. In Rune Stones, every card has a unique number on it. Two cards are always played together, and the higher numbered card is removed from the player's deck. You have to be careful which cards you buy and how you play them to not lose your best cards. Players will use their cards to gather gems, forge them into Artifacts, then combine those into Rune Stones, which grants a special ability for the rest of the game. The more artifacts used in making a Rune Stone, the more points it scores, so players must decide whether it is best to gain abilities early or save to score more points.  \nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Rune Stones Expansion 2: Enchanted Forest is planned for the end of March 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse. Pledges to the US will most likely be sent via container to a fulfillment center. Please note that all shipping projections are our best estimates only, and not guarantees. \nWe offer \"friendly\" shipping to a number of zones around the world, including the United States, Canada, and the European Union. If your country is not listed as \"friendly,\" Queen Games is not responsible for any local charges, customs fees, or if a local carrier (i.e. not the carrier we shipped by) loses your package. In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\nPost Campaign Communication\nWe will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions. Please note that, since we do not have a full time employee dedicated to Kickstarter alone, we may not be able to actively monitor the comments after the campaign closes. If you have a question about your pledge, please send us a message.\nWe will do our best to post all pertinent information in a timely manner either as an update or in emails to relevant backers. \nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging for this product, you are accepting the following terms.\nREFUND POLICY Following the terms of Kickstarter, Queen Games will provide a full refund provided the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.If a request is made after this period, any refund would be at the discretion of Queen Games, and would be a maximum of 85% based on incurred fees and handling costs.\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS We understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY We will send a survey out to backers to collect addresses. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a months.

There are no enemies and no combat, only an environment where every step, breath, and particle around you could mean immediate, terrifying, death.\nIn these incredible conditions you must complete a series of tasks necessary to your continued survival. Perhaps the water reclamation system on the ship needs repair, or (as usual) food supplies are running low. Before you lies a strange alien landscape - it\u2019s up to you to complete these tasks using\u2026whatever you find out there.\nEach time you play you will have a different combination of survival tasks to complete and the things you discover (and their weird properties) will be different as well. So while you always start out knowing what problems you need to solve you have no idea how you\u2019re going to use the world before you to do so (or what the world is going to do to you while you try).\nAs you explore the environment, encountering wild & unique opportunities along the way, you will work closely with the rest of your crew to achieve your goal of continued existence.

Dominations and Rallyman: GT are currently being shipped to distribution centres with fulfillment beginning not long after this campaign ends. We are active on all three pages, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a November 2020 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games.

You will need to gather allied advisors, manage your workers, recruit armies and, together with other players, raise and defend the Great Wall! As the game progresses, you will often need to negotiate and interact with other players, but make no mistake \u2013 there can be only one winner\n \u201cIts an interesting game (\u2026) I have to play some more, its pretty high for me! Theme is really strong.\u201d-  Tom, Dice Tower\n\u201eDefinitely quality! (\u2026) Theme is super cool and the tension! The tension in this game is real. Very interesting game! \u201c   - Rob, Rob\u2019s Gaming Table \n\u201cAll of this comes together in a very unique way, in which players will continue to work together and against one another to earn they Honor points\u201d- Jeremy, Man vs Meeple \n\u201cThe Great Wall has enough depth to continually enjoy each new play session as you customize your experience and have new interactions with other players.\u201d - Michael, King of Average \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDst2rvGG4&t=  \n\n\nThis fresh worker (and soldier!) placement game for 1-4 players faces them with many difficult choices and often pushes them to interact with each other. You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry. Players place these soldiers one by one, playing the Tactics cards that create another layer of interaction.\nGain meditation by shooting with the Monk Archer, then spend meditation on a Cavalry Squad Leader to move your Cavalry around the battlefield faster, and \u2013 finally \u2013 finish off by getting extra Honor for each of the Cavalry\u2019s engagements thanks to the Banner Holder. There are endless possibilities for great combos and memorable plays.\nOn top of that, your Advisors and General might give your troops extra abilities, such as shooting twice or looting twice the resources!\nAll of the above makes the Great Wall one of our most strategically involving designs that will be appreciated by many different groups of players:\n                            - those who love euro-styled games with their intricate economies and engine-building,\n                            - those who love over-the-table play,\n                            - and finally, those who simply like to wage war on a beautiful map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The two games have the same parents: the designer Antoine Bauza, the illustrator Na\u00efade, and the publisher Funforge for artistic direction.\nWith Namiji, the family grows with a hitherto unseen adventure!\n\u201cIn ancient Japanese, Namiji refers to the wake and eddies visible behind a boat.\u201d\nAntoine Bauza, designer of Namiji.\nIn Namiji, you are fishers from the Japan of yesteryear, navigating south of the Japanese archipelago, a few kilometers from the famous Tokaido road. You will need to have a fruitful day at sea to win the game.\nTo do this, you will have the opportunity to contemplate magnificent marine species, to fish with a line or a net to fill your racks with colorful fish, and haul in your crustacean traps.\nYou can benefit from stops to improve your fishing equipment, and you will also have to contend with the gods of the sea by setting offerings afloat, or by fulfilling their wishes that they express during your contemplations with the Sacred Rocks, for which they will reward you.\nFunforge is currently working on the rulebook. Please note that the PDFs below are prototypes, and the rules currently have neither illustrations nor nice layout. These are not the rules as you will receive them in your game box; however, the rules have been playtested hundreds of times by the designer and the Funforge team. The rules themselves have long since been approved and are final.\nPlease click on the picture to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l\u2019image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\nDuring my forty-one years of existence, gaming has always occupied an important portion of my agenda. I have done a lot of role-playing games, and I have written a few. I long wanted to work in the videogame industry before discovering the modern world of board games in the early 2000s.\nAs a primary school teacher, I started to conceive my first prototypes. My first game, Chabyrinthe, was released in 2007, followed by Ghost Stories in 2008. In 2010, 7 Wonders appeared (Kennerspiel des Jahres 2011), which was an enormous success and permitted me to devote myself entirely to creating games.\nDriven by my passion for Japan, I designed several games around the them of the Land of the Rising Sun: Takenoko, Hanabi (Spiel des Jahres 2013), and in collaboration with Funforge, Samurai Spirit and Tokaido. Building on its success, Tokaido has been joined by two expansions, Crossroads and Matsuri.\nI am also one of the co-founders of Team Kaedama (a team of 4 game designers), and I take care of the logistics for la Radio des Jeux, a French podcast dedicated to the world of gaming.\nFor me, Namiji is the perfect opportunity to refresh the gaming experience you can appreciate in Tokaido, as well as revisit the graphical universe of Na\u00efade\u2026 and to share it all with you!\nFor me, the adventure really begins with Tokaido. At that time, it\u2019s been two years since I started the occupation of game illustrator. I was delighted because I am passionate about the ancient civilizations.\nThe Japan of the feudal era is obviously one of these civilizations that has long fascinated me. In addition, by that point, I had learned to read and write Japanese, and most of my interests came from Japan (manga, video games, figurines, movies).\nI did some research on boats, marine species, fashion of the era, Japanese archipelago, crustacean traps, fishing equipment and so on.\nAs with Tokaido, the final result here with Namiji is pure, white, peaceful\u2026\nFor both games, I wanted to keep an alchemy between the gameplay and the artwork to obtain two board games of which I am extremely proud.\nI hope that you will enjoy this new journey as much as I enjoyed retracing it through my art.\n\n\n\n\n\nROLL FOR CRIT: \u201cThere is a very good game to look forward to here. I am looking forward to see this more in final production state. I had a lot of fun.\u201d\nSPIKEYBITS: \u201cFunforge has a new title in the Tokaido universe coming out called Namiji. Not an expansion but a completely new game. Instead of walking the Eastern Sea Road, you are fishermen sailing around the islands of Japan. I\u2019m definitely dying to play more of this one.\u201d\nNERD CALIBER: \u201cI look forward to seeing it on Kickstarter later this year.\"\n\nTHE BOARD GAME KAPTAIN: \u201cAfter the game (played at Gen Con), they (Funforge) showed us some art and mini designs. The art and minis looked amazing! Be sure to look for Namiji on Kickstarter in November. It was really fun.\u201d\nGOING ANALOG:\u201cIt gave us the lovely, serene feeling of Tokaido but with more critical decision-making, more push-your-luck, and a fun puzzle element with fish collection.\u201d\nROLLING DOUBLES: \u201cRolling Doubles got a quick preview of this sequel and it looks to keep the foundation of Tokaido intact but moving & evolving the formula forward with Namiji! It. Looks. Wonderful.\u201d\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time.
