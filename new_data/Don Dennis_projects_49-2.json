Dennis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "F\u00fcr eine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung bitte nach unten scrollen.\nThe Sphere:\nPLAY\n\nIn this very sphere, every one of the 380.000 lasered dots is not only a star, but an entire galaxy with billions of stars. A journey through our entire galaxy, the Milkey Way, would last 120.000 years...with the speed of light! and it contains of 300 billion stars. A journey to our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, would last around 2.5 million years with that speed. And there we are, at the first tiny dot, next to our own tiny dot in the center of this very sphere. If you add the next 100 000 Galaxies you can see the structure of Laniakea, our home supercluster. Laniakea is around 160 megaparsec in size and of cause surrounded by even larger structures.\nThe diameter of the cloud of galaxies in the sphere is around 250 megaparsec (Mpc). One Parsec is equal to 3.2616 lightyears, which means, that the cloud is 815.400.000 lightyears in diameter. 815 million years of travel, with the speed of light, captured in an 8cm glass sphere. \nWith all these information, this sphere convinced me, that we can\u00b4t be alone in the universe. \nHow is it made?\nI took a katalogue of galaxies and chose every galaxy in a radius of 125 Mpc. I converted the data and found a company, which was able to laser these 675 758 galaxies into a glass sphere. Some galaxies were to close to each other, so they merged together. There are in total 380 000 dots in this 8cm (3.14\") sphere and it weights 0,8Kg (1,76lb). The inner structure reflects light, so it looks really nice, if you put it on an LED, but it is also really good to see without an extra light. The brightness changes with the perspective, so you can spend hours looking into the Sphere. It comes in a black gift box with black velvet inside.\nPLAY\n\nUniverse Sphere in it\u00b4s box.\nExtension:\nThese are some pictures of the Sphere on the polyamid bases on the LED-Base Plate.\n\"LED fitting Base\" on the \"LED Base Plate\"\nI finished the first bases you could buy as an extension. They will be 3D-printed in different colors and materials such as polyamid, steel and some precious metals like pure silver and gold coated brass.\nPLAY\n\nHexagonal Grid Base, Pure Silver\nHexagonas Base, Black Plastic\nRound Base, Black Plastic\nMy Motivation:\nThe idea of the Universe Sphere came to me, after I was watching the video \"the power of ten\" and the more recent video \"a cosmic voyage\".It showes how incredibly huge our observable universe is and I wanted to see the structure of our universe in 3D with my bare eyes. So I decided to create a more concrete view of it, by lasering this tremendous structure in a glass sphere. I was so impressed by what came out of that, that I decided to make it available for all the universe-loving people outside, who try to understand the gigantic dimension of the place we exist in. To make it affordable, I need to order a large amount of Spheres and for that...I need your help!  \nYou can watch the clip \"A Cosmic Voyage\" on youtube and I promise, it is mindblowing.\nDeutsch:\nZu der Struktur im Inneren:\nJeder gelaserte Punkt entspricht nicht nur einem Stern, sondern einer ganzen Galaxie mit milliarden von Sternen. Eine Reise durch unsere eigene Galaxie, der Milchstra\u00dfe, w\u00fcrde 120.000 Jahre dauern, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit! Sie besteht aus ca. 300 milliarden Sternen. F\u00fcr eine Reise zu unserer Nachbargalaxie, der Andromeda Galaxie, w\u00fcrden 2,5 millionen Jahre ben\u00f6tigt. Und da w\u00e4ren wir nun bei dem n\u00e4chsten kleinen Punkt neben unserem kleinen Punkt angekommen. F\u00fcgt man diesen beiden Galaxien noch weitere 100 000 hinzu, erkennt man den Laniakea Supercluster, der wiederum von weiteren noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Strukturen umgeben ist.\nDer Durchmesser der Punktewolke entspricht ca. 250 Megaparsec (Mpc). Ein Parsec entspricht 3,2616 Lichtjahren, was bedeutet, dass die Wolke einen Durchmesser von ca.815.400.000 Lichtjahren hat. Diese unvorstellbar gro\u00dfe Struktur, in der es 815 millionen Jahre dauern w\u00fcrde, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit von einem Ende zum anderen Ende zu fliegen und in der 380.000 Punkte enthalten sind, kann man jetzt in einer 8cm gro\u00dfen Glaskugel in seiner eigenen Hand halten. \nDiese unvorstellbaren Mengen an Galaxien mit jeweils Millionen von Sternen, haben mir gezeigt, dass wir nicht alleine im Universum sein k\u00f6nnen.\nWie wird sie gefertigt:\nIch habe aus einem Galaxienkatalog alle Galaxien in einem Umkreis von 125 Mpc ausgew\u00e4hlt und diese so umgewandelt, dass eine Firma sie in eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Aus 675 758 Galaxien wurden 380 000 Punkte, da einige f\u00fcr den Laser schlichtweg zu nah aneinander lagen. Die Kugel misst 8cm im Durchmesser,  wiegt ca. 800gramm und wird in einer schwarzen Geschenkbox geliefert. Die Struktur im inneren reflektiert Licht, sodass sie von verschiedenen Perspektiven unterschiedlich hell wirkt. Man k\u00f6nnte sie gut auf einen beleuchteten Sockel stellen aber auch ohne Lichtquelle sieht sie fantastisch aus, sodass man Stundenlang ins Innere der Kugel starren kann.\nErweiterung:\nMomentan arbeite ich an 3D-gedruckten Sockeln f\u00fcr die Kugeln, die ich freischalten m\u00f6chte, sobald das Projekt sein Finanzierungsziel erreicht hat.\nMeine Motivation:\nDie Idee der Universe Sphere kam mir, nachdem ich das Video \"a cosmic voyage\" auf Youtube gesehen habe. Es zeigt, wie unglaublich gro\u00df das beobachtbare Universum ist und in was f\u00fcr einer fantastischen Struktur die Galaxien angeordnet sind. Diese Struktur wollte ich gerne mit blo\u00dfen Augen in 3D sehen k\u00f6nnen. Daraufhin habe ich recherchiert, woher ich die Koordinaten der Galaxien bekommen kann, wie ich diese umwandele und letztenendes habe ich eine Firma gefunden, die mit meinen Daten eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Das Ergebnis war so erstaunlich, dass ich mich entschieden habe, mein erstes Kickstarter Projekt zu starten. Um den Preis der Kugel von \u00fcber 90\u20ac auf unter 50\u20ac zu bekommen muss ich allerdings eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Menge bestellen.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Up to 9 Spheres", "descp": "In this Reward you can pledge for up to 9 Spheres.

We need it to see\u2014when in cars, when finding keyholes, even when we\u2019re outdoors. We have noticed that many everyday carry, or EDC, essentials are too dull, and current EDC flashlights are too big and bulky, so we set out to create our own.\nIt all started when I needed a flashlight one evening after I dropped my phone under my car. I immediately needed a light but did not have one. I thought to myself, \"It would be great to have a flashlight, but the size of a bullet.\"\nInspired by the 9mm round.\nA sleek, minimal, and beautiful design, we present to you BULLET, providing a strong LED mini flashlight in its most minimal form, while eliminating bulky flashlights from your everyday carry. Minimize your life. \nEveryday Carry Done Right\nWe believe that your everyday carry items are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET\u2019S functionality, beauty, and minimalism make it the best everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available. The easiest way to carry your flashlight is on your keys! Save the space in your pockets for what truly matters.  \nA quick quarter rotation on the head of the BULLET to turn it on, and a quick rotation back to turn it off. We wanted to get rid of unnecessary buttons to keep it slick and precise. A built in key chain allows you to carry BULLET with you everywhere you go.\nBullet clipped on a backpack.\nAvailable in Matte Black, Gunmetal, and now Blue!\nWe took the smallest, sleekest possible design, and combined it with aircraft-grade aluminum and an anodized finish to bring you a powerful tiny LED light, perfect for everyday use. We believe that the shape, and size kept the design minimal, functional and easy to carry, completely hassle-free in any situation.\nMeasuring in at an incredible 10.5mm x 30mm and weighing only 6 grams, BULLET is the perfect size flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 15 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. \nWhy BULLET?\nWe like keeping things simple, and easy to carry around everywhere you go. What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\n Compared to other alternatives, the choice is simple.\nPLAY\n\nDesigned with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized finish, the BULLET is built for any situation possible. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, the BULLET will illuminate in any weather, helping solve any problem. \nAn LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. Battery's also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul. \nWhat is an LED you ask? Well, for all you who don\u2019t know, LED\u2019s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically.\nWe went through many iterations, finishes, and housings for the design of BULLET.\nWe decided to use the bottom twist due to the leverage provided by the key ring. By holding onto the keyring, twisting to turn on was easiest. Furthermore, the triangle ring offered increased stability when on a keychain.\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 1\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 2\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 3\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 6 Grams\nWidth: 10.5mm\nLength: 30mm\nMaterials: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy\nBattery: LR41 Button Cell\nType of Bulb: LED 5mm\nSpecial Features: On/Off Twist Setting, and Mini Keyring Attached\nColors: Matte Black/ Gunmetal\n    Slughaus is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional, all at the same time.

They allow you to be more creative & versatile in the kitchen, help produce better quality food, and if well-made should last a lifetime.\nA good Chef\u2019s Knife is the single most important tool in any kitchen. From mincing garlic to breaking down meats, it\u2019s the workhorse behind virtually every great dish. There's an almost indescribable joy to effortlessly slicing through foods with a razor-sharp blade.\nBut between confusing, unexplained features and needlessly expensive price tags, finding the perfect blade can be difficult. That didn\u2019t seem right to us, so we spent the last 18 months making something better.\nAn amazing knife at an honest price.\nWhat Makes a Great Knife?\nGreat knives do two things very well: feel good in your hand and hold a sharp edge. But behind these deceptively simple concepts are centuries of tradition, technology, design and craft.\nWe went through dozens of prototypes to create a handle that not only provides comfort for every hand, but also encourages a proper grip for better control. To ensure true sharpness, we experimented with various blade shapes and high-carbon steels until we found the right match.\nAn Honest Price\nMost knives cost so much because of traditional retail markups. You\u2019d be shocked to know how little many well-known \u201cpremium\u201d knives actually cost to make.\nBy partnering closely with our factories and selling directly to you online, we\u2019re able to offer an incredible knife at wholesale pricing. Better materials, lower price. Save your cabbage for the cutting board!\nOur Knife\nHow We Got Here\nHundreds of sketches. Dozens of prototypes. Countless tomatoes, onions and carrots cut (but none wasted!). The last 18 months have been spent building, testing, learning and improving.\nWhere We Are\nWe have a knife design that has been heavily tested and refined at every step along the way. We have partnered with craftspeople, factories and raw material suppliers across the world and built a strong supply chain network. We are ready to go!\nWhat We Need\nWe need your help to raise $25,000 in order to fund the first production run of the Misen Chef's Knife. More specifically, this money will go towards the initial custom molding, raw materials and skilled labor required to make our knives.\nTimeline\nNote on the above timeline:\nWhen we launched this campaign, our original timeline had production ending February, and delivery slated for March 2016. Due to the increased volume of knives that now need to be made, we updated our timeline as consistent with Update #3 that was sent to backers (please read the full update for more information).\nWe thought it prudent to add a buffer of one to two months (April - May) to account for the unknown. Why? Because we'd rather ship a great knife slightly later than an average knife on time. Thank you so much in advance for your understanding.\nWho We Are\nWe're a team of passionate cooks, designers and operators that love great food and well-made objects. We have extensive experience bringing products to market and operating companies both large and small.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to our project is timing.\n\nWe have our supply chain partners ready and able to help us manufacture our knives, but unforeseen bumps can happen along the way.

It's more than a camera bag, it's your day-to-day essential carry workhorse, and it does things other camera bags can't.\nIt comes in Charcoal...\n...and in Heritage Tan...\n ...and it will make your everyday carry experience wonderful, no matter what you're doing.\n                                                                                             When something is \"totally dialed,\" that means that every last bit of it does its job perfectly and fits together flawlessly. This bag is totally, indubitably, unequivocally dialed. See why:\nTo reiterate:\nIt adapts to your gear and lifestyle.\nWhat do all camera bags have in common? Foam cubes. Big ones. Bulky ones. Square ones. What do all cameras and lenses have in common? They're not square.\nFlexFold\u2122 dividers: instantly customize them to organize your gear and maximize your space for everything else. Fold 'em over and stack gear on top. Note that the final divider color is the same as the rest of the inner bag.\nLike we said before, The Everyday Messenger is not just a camera bag, it's an everyday bag. And since no two days are quite the same, we designed a shell that expands greatly to accommodate the perpetual \u201cone last thing,\u201d and also lets the bag maintain its shapely figure when your load is light. \nFlexFold\u2122 dividers allow the bag to expand and contract depending on load. Typical camera bag dividers are about 3x the thickness and designed to have a fixed width. Note: final divider color will be the same as the rest of the bag interior.\nThe semi-rigid shell expands from a capacity of 13.5L to 20.5L without the need for slack material. \"I like a floppy messenger bag,\" said no one, ever.\nLastly, it adapts to your activity too. No more switching bags when you travel or hop on your bike\u2014one bag, with straps that let you wear it in a multitude of ways.\nThe main strap is made of internally-padded seatbelt webbing, and it adjusts for messenger or shoulder carry style. Removable stabilizer strap can also be worn as a waist strap to take weight off your shoulder.\nCarrying a tripod? We've got you covered. Slip your tripod leg through the sleeve in the main flap, fold the flap over, and place the silicone band (included) around your tripod legs. Carry a tripod will full access to the rest of your bag.\nThe versatile straps can be configured for easy, secure luggage carry. Use the shoulder strap to sling your bag around large rollers, or use the stabilizer strap as a standard luggage band.\nIt gives you instant access to everything you need.\nYour hands are always full. Full of cameras, toddlers, beer...sometimes all three. Hence we invented a new way to open and close a bag:\nThe patent-pending MagLatch\u2122 is a digital-safe magnetic latch that opens/closes securely, blindly and one-handedly. It can latch onto 4 different catchpoints, depending on your carry load. There's no other piece of hardware quite like it.\nStill, you don't always have time to open a flap. Unlike traditional messenger bags, The Everyday Bag has quick-zip access to the main compartment, as well as an outer pocket layout designed around the workflow of photographers, commuters and travelers.\nFront access panel has 8 stretchy mesh pockets for bits-n-bobs. Water resistant top zip gives instant access to main compartment. See images at the top of the page for final interior pocket colors.\nWhat's faster than getting your camera from inside your bag? Getting it from outside of your bag. Peak Design started as a company that made Capture\u00ae, a clip that lets you carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Naturally, we had to incorporate the perfect Capture attachment point:\nYou'll find 2 diagonal straps on the side walls, designed for attaching the Capture Camera Clip. Keep your camera secure/accessible and free up carry space. Capture is included in our $375 Reward, and also available in our Add-On Menu below.\nA dedicated, protected 13-15 inch laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve and document pocket makes this truly an everyday bag, even if you're not carrying any photo gear.\nThere's a clever place for every bit and bob imaginable, like the pen sleeve in the laptop compartment and the Anchor link key/ID tether in the side pocket.\nIt protects your stuff like a boss.\nOur favorite messengers are roomy and built to repel water, mud and unwanted flotsam. Our favorite camera bags are padded and protective cradles for our digi-babies. The Everyday Bag had to be both.\nThe shell, made of lightweight Kodra\u00ae synthetic canvas, is waxed and DWR-coated to repel water. It also contains high-density tessellating foam pads to protect from bumps and bruises.\nThe super soft poly-spun twill interior is soft on your photo gear, but will hold up to years of stuffing and re-stuffing your bag with you-name-it.\nBar-tacked stress points, reinforced with ultra-tough Hypalon. Beautifully anodized aluminum hardware.\nWe built The Everyday Bag to last a lifetime. In fact, we guarantee it will.\nIt looks totally dialed, with zero slop.\nDangling strap ends, cheap internal fabrics, cookie-cutter plastic hardware...these are what we call \"slop.\" Many bags out there have slop because it's cheap and it's easy. We designed this bag with a strict no-slop policy, and the result is a product that looks, feels and functions like a premium product should. \nNo corners were cut in the building of this bag.\nThe form of The Everyday Messenger took a cue from the past, incorporating timeless elements and shapes from classic messengers and camera bags. Then we fused that with modern materials, custom hardware and Peak Design\u2019s less-is-more aesthetic.\nYou use the inside of a bag just as much as you do the outside. So, we designed an inside that you'll want to look at again and again.\nClassic lines and textures, but with refined hardware and technical materials.\nWe\u2019ve created 2 color schemes - Charcoal with red accents and Heritage Tan with blue accents (shown above). Pledge now, choose your color when the campaign ends.\n                                                      Behind every good bag is a wing-bag. The Field Pouch\u2122 is a manager of cords, hard drives, toiletries, socks, Pogs slammers and all those other pesky doo-dads that can\u2019t seem to get along with the big boys.\nHello. Is it keys you're looking for?\nKeys, hard drives, laptop chargers, pens, and even small lenses can fit inside the stretchy mesh pockets that line its interior.\nThe Field Pouch fits in both the main compartment and the front panel of The Everyday Messenger. It\u2019s made from the same materials, contains 5 stretchy mesh pockets, and holds a lot or a little without losing its shape. It also comes in Charcoal or Heritage Tan.\nStowe The Field Pouch in the main and front compartments of The Everyday Messenger.\nLike its big bro, The Field Pouch expands and contracts depending on what's in it. It saves you space and saves itself from looking embarrassingly floppy and misshapen. Note that this animation depicts an older prototype.\nYou can even attach Peak Design straps to the Pouch (via Hypalon loops on either side) and attach Capture on the front Hypalon strap. It becomes the perfect excursion bag for you and a mirrorless camera.\nAttach any Peak Design camera strap to The Field Pouch and have yourself the perfect excursion bag, which is a type of bag that is not at all like a man-purse.\nThe Field Pouch and The Everyday Messenger. 2-gether 4-ever.\nTo pre-order The Everyday Messenger, click the button below and pick a reward that contains The Everyday Bag. Simple as that. If you want more stuff that isn't in your reward, then follow the instructions in our Add-On Menu (scroll 2 sections down). Once you have pledged, sit back and relax. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment info when this project is complete, in late September.\nOnce you pledge, you're in for a fun ride. Throughout our campaign we'll be updating backers with footage of our latest production units and having live Q&A hangouts with Trey Ratcliff and the PD team.\nNot sure how the Add-On Menu works? Scroll down below.\nWant to add additional items to your reward like another Everyday Messenger or Field Pouch? Perhaps you want to add on a Capture clip, so you can carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Either way, adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level.\nEverybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward\u2014you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. For example, you cannot order the PD Dream Pack and switch out CapturePRO for an extra Slide. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.\n2. If you want to add something, check out the Add-On Menu.\nIf (and only if) you want something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a Peak Design product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry. We will give you a chance after the campaign is over to add additional products to your shipment for a special discount. See the FAQ for further explanation.\n3. Relax, you're done for now.\nAll details like shipping information, color preference and add-on specifics, will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended in late September.\nCaptureLENS and Lens Kit are 2 new products that let you change and carry lenses easier than ever before. Watch this video to see it in action:\nWe launched CaptureLENS halfway through this Kickstarter campaign, and right now it is only available to Kickstarter backers through our Add-On Menu. Instructions on using the Add-On Menu are above, and below, and in the FAQ. How's that for a helping hand?\nIn our opinion, CaptureLENS + The Everyday Messenger is the most convenient, rapid-fire lens changing solution in the world.\nRight: Lens Kit has loops for attaching Peak Design Anchors, letting you sling a spare lens across your body. Left: CaptureLENS works on any belt or strap.\nOther specs you should know about CaptureLENS:\nIt works with Canon (EF mount), Nikon (F mount) and Sony (E and FE mount) lenses. You'll specify which mount you need in our post-Kickstarter survey.\nCaptureLENS ($80 add-on, $90 MSRP) includes a standard Capture clip (nylon backplate) plus a Lens Kit adapter plate. It does not include a plate for camera bodies.\nLens Kit ($40 add-on, $50 MSRP) includes just the adapter plate. It's for people who already own (or plan to own) a Capture clip. Lens Kit is compatible with all versions of Capture.\nHow to pre-order CaptureLENS and Lens Kit:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that. Join at any reward level (or, don't select a reward level). Already a backer? Click here instead.\n2. Add $80 to your pledge (for CaptureLENS) or $40 (for Lens Kit).

After this project is complete (late September) we'll send you a survey where you can specify which model you'd like.\nSlideLITE is a new camera strap designed specifically for mirrorless and small DSLR cameras.\nFor those familiar with our other camera straps (all of which were launched here on Kickstarter) SlideLITE sits smack-dab in the middle of our lineup. Not too bulky, not too skinny, it's perfect for your ultralight mirrorless companion.\nSlideLITE contains the same adjustment hardware that Slide does. But SlideLITE is a skinnier 3.7cm (1.25\") and does not have internal padding.\nWear SlideLITE as a sling, neck strap or shoulder strap. It connects to your camera with our patent-pending Anchor link quick-connect system. And, it looks damn good.\nHow to pre-order SlideLITE:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that.

Want SlideLITE sooner? Pre-order it from one of our retail partners. There's a list of them in this update.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Peak Design's 5th Kickstarter project. We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues, and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders for our new products. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science. While this ain't our first Kickstarter rodeo, our forecasting capabilities aren't the same as what you might expect from a big company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk \nAs Peak Design continues to mature we're getting better and better at managing our supply chain. For example, two years ago we set up two fully-operating parallel supply chains to shore up our ability to make quality products, at high volumes, on time. We're totally stoked on how far we've come. But it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new parts doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

The production for the Polar Ice Tube will be completed a little bit later, till the end of August, because it is a stretch goal. Hence, delivery time is going to be between mid September to mid October. Once the time is up for the project, we will start to collect your shipping address. Unfortunately, we only provide one time shipping, so the Polar Ice Tube is not available if you wish to receive the Polar Ice Tray in August.\n Why do we need a Polar Ice Tray?\nNo more ice chiseling, and no more ice machines.\nAre you wondering why the drinks you make at home don't taste as good as the ones you buy at a bar? Do you know that ice has huge impact on drinks? Do you have to spend a lot of time chiseling ice before you drink? \nThen Polar Ice Tray is what you need.\nPerfect for drink lovers and home parties, Polar Ice Tray is the first ever patented device that allows anyone to make a sphere of crystal clear ice in an ordinary home refrigerator. \nNow let's see why Polar Ice Tray, and clear ice, can make things all better.\nFeatures\n  CRYSTAL CLEAR ICE: the unique, patented design separates water molecules from impurities. Clear ice brings out the best taste of drinks.\nEASY TO USE: add water in it, put it into a freezer, wait for some hours, the end. \nFROSTBITE PREVENTION: the Polar Ice Tray is made of PU foam and silicone mold; it never causes frostbite. \nMELTING SLOWER: ice made from our tray has a round shape and a relatively big size, so it has less surface area than general ice cubes. That means the clear ice in your drink melts slower, and your drink stays colder for longer without dilution.\nFAIR PRICE: an 50% off the average selling price of similar products!\nWhat's so special about crystal clear ice? \nIt enhances the taste of your drink.\nThe ice that comes out of your freezer contains air bubbles and other impurities, which can ruin the taste of your drink. Crystal clear ice, on the other hand, is flavorless and odorless.\nBy lowering the serving temperature of your whiskey or mixed drink, clear ice enhances your beverage by adding a cold, crisp taste.\nIt looks fascinating. \nShining with dazzling brightness, or glimmering under dim light, crystal clear ice in your fancy craft drink transforms your beverage into an exquisite work of art.\nMoreover, adding a flower or piece of fruit between the silicone layers can turn your clear ice into an amazing show piece! It's perfect for a romantic occasion and it's a great way to impress you friends!\nYes, for the sake of health. \nNo air bubbles or impurities in your drink that's soon going down to your stomach.\nHow does it work?\n(Size: L108 x W108 x H108mm; Ice ball produced: 6 cm diameter)\nWe've been researching how to make clear ice since 2008. Our goal was to find a simple, elegant solution. Existing techniques only partially solved the problem. That's when we turned to the nature to find our answer!\nInspired by the natural ice-forming pattern which takes place in lakes and rivers, we've designed a dual-chambered system that separates the clear ice from the impurities in the water.\nOrdinary ice trays allow ice to freeze from the outside in, trapping air and impurities to the center. Polar Ice Tray insulates all sides of the tray except the top, so only the surface of the water is exposed to the cold. As a result, the water starts to freeze from the surface.\nBy allowing the water to freeze gradually from top to bottom, layer by layer, air and impurities are compressed to the bottom, forming a layer of opaque or \"white\" ice. Our dual-chambered technology allows easy separation of clear and white ice.\nHow to use it?\n1. Place the silicone layer on top of the perforated layer, and then put the perforated layer on top of the plastic layer. Ensure each piece has a tight seal to prevent leaking.\n2.Slowly pour water into Polar Ice Tray via the hole on top of the silicone layer, until the water flows out of the hole. (Do this slowly because the air needs time to get forced out of the tray.)\n3.Place the assembled components into the insulated base. Next, place the Polar Ice Tray into the freezer and wait 8-12 hours. \nUsage Tips \nTo make crystal clear ice, set your freezer to medium (-0.4F/-18C). Leaving your freezer at a warmer temperature takes a longer time to freeze, while using a colder temperature may cause needle-like bubbles to form. \nAfter pulling your Polar Ice Tray out of the freezer, let your tray rest 3-5 minutes. This makes it easier to remove the clear ice.\nTo store your crystal clear ice, put it in a ziplock bag and keep it in the freezer.\nMore ideas on making your life prettier...\nTimeline\nIn addition,\nPolar Ice Tray comes in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors!\nPolar Animals \nThis tray makes two crystal clear ice balls at once! Each ball is 6cm in diameter. The Polar Animal embossed on each ball is a reminder to protect our natural resources.\nPebble\nThe Pebble is the largest and most versatile tray in the polar ice tray family. It is unique because the tray plus the lid serves as an ice bucket after the ice is made. The Pebble makes a crystal clear Inukshuk (ice Man) sculpture (250 ml) or a large ice block (600 ml), which can be cracked into asymmetric pieces and served in your drink.\nRewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. The predicted quantity of product order at this moment is 4000. If the order quantity exceeds 4000, delay in shipment might occur. The order will be processed in sequence, in a first-come first-served manner.\n\n2. The effect of crystal clear ice may be affected by the condition of freezers and water.\n\n3.

Places like the B.C. coast\u2014remote, lightly populated and mostly roadless\u2014have often been treated as 'nowhere' areas that don\u2019t have much value beyond the resources can be taken out of them. But in reality, this is a place that\u2019s full of life, has an amazing culture and history, and is absolutely priceless to protect. For myself, my family and many others here, this place is everything. So to me, this book is about deconstructing the idea of nowhere and demonstrating that places like this have a value that goes far beyond money.\n16\" x 24\" framed Fortune Bear. (For reference. Reward prints come unframed.)\n5\"x7\" Art Cards\nSet to publish in August 2015, This is Nowhere will be an 11\u201d x 11\u201d clothbound hardcover with 144 pages and 100-plus photos. I\u2019ve chosen to have it printed on FSC-certified paper at Hemlock Printers in Burnaby, B.C., a carbon-neutral company that does amazing work like Kinfolk Magazine and The Great Discontent. For me it\u2019s important to use a printer and paper that\u2019s more sustainable, even if it takes more money to do so. By doing this project through Kickstarter instead of a traditional publisher, I'll be able to retain full control of both the creative content and the production process. With the support of a community of people who believe in my work, I\u2019ll be able to publish a unique and beautiful book worthy of the places, people and living things it portrays.\nThis Is Nowhere - Black debossed text on black clothbound hardback cover\nChapter Story\nFull frame images with varying layout\nFull frame images with varying layout\nThis is Nowhere \u2014 black debossed text on black clothbound hardback cover\nSome further detail:\nThe foreword will be written by Dr. Chris Darimont, Science Director of Raincoast Conservation Foundation and professor at the University of Victoria. The book is divided into five sections: Air, Water, Earth, Fire and The Unknown. The introductions to each section are being written by people I\u2019ve learned from and worked with over the years: my dad, Patrick Koreski, along with Noah Cohen, Keith Malloy and Malcolm Johnson. The designer is Chris Allen.\nThe money I raise through the Kickstarter campaign will fund the final production and printing of This is Nowhere. Also, as a member of 1% for the Planet, I'll be donating 1% of all sales to Raincoast Conservation Foundation and Central Westcoast Forest Society.\nBook Specs\n11\" x 11\" (28cm x 28cm)\n144 Pages\n100+ Photographs\nFour-Colour Process\nHardback / Clothbound", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve hoped to publish a collection of my work for a long time, but I didn\u2019t want to put anything out unless it was something I was truly proud of.

So for me as an independent photographer, the biggest challenge is raising the necessary funds to print the book. \n\nAnother risk of any publishing project is errors in production, but having This is Nowhere printed close to my home means I\u2019ll be able to oversee the entire process and be present for press checks to ensure the images are reproduced exactly how I want them to be seen.

There simply is nothing else like it. From its original shape to the sidearm throw to it's mesmerizing flight; the ZipChip is unique. And it fits in your pocket for fun anytime, anywhere.\nDISTANCE: The ZipChip is designed to be used at various distances. Play catch at short range for leisure or spread way out to test your skill. We've gotten the ZipChip to fly over 200 ft. / 65 yds. Can you?\nPOCKET-SIZE: The ZipChip is ultra portable. This enables spontaneous fun in never-before-played locations. Take it everywhere. We do.\nSTABLE FLIGHT: This is what makes throwing and catching possible. Level release = level flight. Angled release = curved flight. That equates to predictable and accurate throws.\nFLOATING: The ZipChip is buoyant and ready to be played with at the beach or pool.\nSOFT and FLEXIBLE: Our goal was to make the ZipChip soft for confident catches. The elastomer material is even recyclable.\nMANUFACTURED in CONNECTICUT: \u201cMade in our backyard, played in yours\" is our motto here. Conception through construction the ZipChip is a local endeavor. We are partnering with an injector and mold maker in-state so we can be hands-on every step of the way.\nThe ZipChip works best as a game of throw-and-catch between two or more people. Start close to get dialed in and warmed up. Slowly spread out to really ramp up the fun. You will notice that due to its light weight, arm fatigue is low which allows for extended sessions. This makes the ZipChip great for kids.\nCatching can be done with one or two hands. We recommend starting with two as you get accustomed to how the ZipChip flies. It zips in a unique way. Once you've got a beat on it, test your skills with one-handed catches.\nSomething interesting happens when you use the ZipChip in public. Complete strangers will marvel at what you are doing and many will approach inquiring, \"What is that?\". As Kickstarter backers you will be the first to own the ZipChip and as such are bestowed the honor of introducing it to the world. Proudly educate the onlookers while you relish your position as an original ZipChip Pro.\nThrowing the ZipChip is just like skipping a stone, except you're not trying to skip it. Imagine you're standing waist-deep water. Now, try to skip the ZipChip on the fictitious water's surface. This means the ZipChip is designed to be thrown forehand, not backhand as you would a Frisbee.\nThe more you throw the ZipChip the better you will get, and the more fun you'll have. The following graphics are to show you how it's done. Get ready to \"Grip it and Zip it\".\nHold the ZipChip in your throwing hand with the domed side up. Place your index finger in the groove around the ZipChip's perimeter. The exact placement of your other fingers is less critical. The thumb may be on the top or edge. The remaining three fingers will be underneath the ZipChip. Experiment with different grips to maximize performance. Just remember that the grip should be gentle.\nNow you're ready to Zip It. Every successful throw combines the following two factors upon release: Spin and Angle.\nSpin: Maximizing spin will combat the enemy of the ZipChip; wobble. Generate spin by rolling the ZipChip off the index fingertip. \nAngle: The ZipChip must be released level for a straight flight. To do this, the forearm must be horizontal (like the arm of the ZipChip PRO logo).\nOne added tip: don't be afraid to zip it with some force. This will help you get the correct amount of spin. \nIt turns out the physics of a flying disc are quite complex. Even after some serious math, accurate flight predictions are hard to ascertain. As such we called upon our two friends Trial and Error for help during ZipChip development.\nEnter prototyping. We began by casting rubber into the bottom of household cups, glasses and bowls. It soon became evident that the limited possibilities of pre-existing shapes were not going to work. We needed to start from the ground up. This meant hand-turning pieces of wood on the lathe. \nThe lathing enabled us complete control of the shape; the freedom to test out all variations of the ZipChip's form. We reconciled several balancing acts simultaneously: aerodynamics vs. ergonomics, rigidity whilst throwing vs. softness whilst catching, and size vs. weight. After many prototypes we achieved the characteristics we sought and performance the ZipChip deserves.\nE pluribus unum\nFinally, we tested numerous colors for visibility both in the air and on the ground. Neon yellow was the winner.\nPackaging Mock-up", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'll do everything we can to avert bumps in the road, and those we encounter will be taken head on.

Wilma Mankiller, the first woman elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, is omitted from most history books despite ranking among revolutionary leaders like Harriet Tubman or Eleanor Roosevelt. She was an activist and a champion to a nation \u2013 and it\u2019s time the world remembers her name.\n(Credit: J. Pat Carter/The New York Times)\nMANKILLER is a documentary celebrating a leader who defied all odds to make a difference for her people. During a time when American Indians found themselves disenfranchised and undervalued by the United States at large, Wilma emerged as a champion of the Cherokee Nation and became its first female Principal Chief in 1985.\nThis film is the passion project of director/producer Valerie Red-Horse (owner/founder of Red-Horse Native Productions, Inc.) and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the \u201cFirst Lady of Sci-Fi\u201d. Although Gale is best known as the producer of iconic science fiction including THE TERMINATOR trilogy, ALIENS, and AMC\u2019s THE WALKING DEAD, she previously produced two documentaries directed and produced by Valerie \u2013 TRUE WHISPERS and NAVAJO CODE TALKERS. Now, she and Valerie are bringing to life the true story of a Cherokee leader who possessed the same heroic traits as Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Both Valerie and Gale are passionate about Wilma\u2019s story and have joined forces with their friends and colleagues to share it with the world.\nWILMA'S STORY\n\"It is crucial to tell stories like Wilma's that inspire women across the globe to have their voices heard. I am happy the documentation of her struggle will be in the capable hands of Gale Anne Hurd and Valerie Red-Horse.\"\n-- Liz Garbus, Emmy-winning and Academy Award-nominated documentary filmmaker (THE FARM: ANGOLA, USA; BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD; GHOSTS OF ABU GHRAIB)\n 117 years after the US relocated the Cherokee Nation from their traditional homeland in Georgia and North Carolina \u2013 and forced them to walk 2,000 miles in winter to Oklahoma \u2013 Wilma endured her own government-mandated relocation from Oklahoma to Northern California. It was there, standing on the front lines of the civil rights movements of the 60s and 70s, that she developed her politically revolutionary mind. She carried that passion for progress with her into the office of Principal Chief decades later.\nUnder Wilma\u2019s leadership, the Cherokee became one of the strongest Indian Tribes in America. Wilma\u2019s focus on economic development and national healthcare helped the Nation to re-assert its self-governance. During Wilma\u2019s tenure, the Cherokee Nation saw its population of registered citizens nearly double, from 68,000 to 170,000. Beyond her policies and programs, Wilma enabled the Cherokee to come together, taking pride in its history while planning for its future.\nNone of Wilma\u2019s accomplishments was easily achieved. When she came into office, the existing Cherokee leadership was unconvinced that a woman could handle the job of Principal Chief. Wilma endured rampant sexism \u2013 including personal and physical attacks. In the midst of this struggle, she demonstrated a quiet strength and unwavering resolve that won over her opposition.\n\u201cPrior to my election, young Cherokee girls would never have thought that they might grow up and become Chief.\u201d\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton honored Wilma with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She enjoyed brief mainstream attention when Ms. Magazine named her their 1987 Woman of the Year, and she was even inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. Despite this recognition, we are in danger of losing her story to time.\n(Credit: Associated Press)\nMANKILLER seeks to capture Wilma\u2019s revolutionary life on film and preserve it for years to come. Our goal is to make \u201cWilma Mankiller\u201d a household name, to give her the same recognition as the trailblazers that came before her and to serve as an inspiration for future generations. A mix of biography and historical storytelling, it will illuminate, entertain, and galvanize viewers to follow Wilma\u2019s example and rebel against the status quo.\nOUR APPROACH\nA message from director and producer Valerie Red-Horse:\n\u201cBeing a Native American female, the opportunity to tell the inspiring story of Wilma Mankiller\u2019s life and legacy is extraordinary. The support and interest we have garnered, even thus far, from subjects and organizations are tremendous. I am thrilled to be reunited with award-winning producer, Gale Anne Hurd. Gale and I have been very fortunate in that our past documentaries are embraced by the Native community. We have fostered and garnered trust as filmmakers to be true to our subjects.\n(Credit: http://www.cw4w.com/)\nIn our documentary, the audience will follow Mankiller\u2019s life through personal, community, political, and family stories. Charlie Soap, Wilma\u2019s widower, is on board as one of the documentary\u2019s producers with Kristina Kiehl (Wilma\u2019s close friend and manager of her campaigns) and Gina Olaya (Wilma\u2019s daughter) also joining the production team. We will gain unique access to subjects, materials, and rare footage that will bring her story to life.\n\u201cWe must trust our own thinking. Trust where we're going. And get the job done.\u201d\nMANKILLER will shed light on important issues raised in Wilma\u2019s life, such as sexism, racism, community empowerment, self-help, and team building. The documentary itself is designed thematically, as an inspiration to encourage further research, exploration, and discussion about Wilma and her contributions to the Cherokee Nation. There will be media links, classroom viewer guides, and social media networking, so that the audience can be encouraged to explore more about Wilma\u2019s legacy, the Cherokee Tribe,  cultural traditions, the path to healing, community organizing, bridge building, and the Cherokee philosophy Wilma lived by: GA-DU-GHI , \u2018being of good mind.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cReal Native American stories are grievously absent in America's film lexicon. A descendant of the horrific Trail of Tears, Wilma Mankiller grew up in government squalor, yet she managed to become one of the most significant activists for Native American rights, working tirelessly to improve conditions for her people. Mankiller broke down barriers with humility and grace, becoming the first female elected principal chief of Cherokee Nation. Mankiller's story is a triumph, proving that not even genocide can hold a people down. This is a great American story that needs to be told. Please help these filmmakers tell it.\u201d \n-- Jillian Ke'haunani Moul, Documentary film and television editor FAME HIGH (Tribeca Film Festival Best Documentary Nominee), NATIVE SOIL (Oscar Shortlist), TIME OF DEATH (2014 IDA Award for Best Limited Series) \nWHO WE ARE\nValerie Red-Horse, a director of Cherokee ancestry, is the owner/founder of RED-HORSE NATIVE PRODUCTIONS, INC., which has become the preeminent collaborator with American Indian tribal nations to bring important Native stories accurately and respectfully to the screen. Red-Horse\u2019s body of work spans over two decades of film and television content creation and production; always providing insightful, sensitive and unique perspectives for both the historical and contemporary indigenous story.  The Company\u2019s premiere feature film, NATURALLY NATIVE, was an official Sundance Festival selection, which Red-Horse wrote, produced, co-directed, starred in, and distributed.  Red-Horse followed with the WWII PBS/ITVS award winning documentary TRUE WHISPERS: THE STORY OF THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS, produced with Gale Anne Hurd of Valhalla Entertainment. Red-Horse also produced/directed a follow up program, again with Hurd, CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS (Vision Maker Media/PBS). \nGale Anne Hurd, known as the \"First Lady of Sci-Fi,\" is a producer of Academy Award-winning films and Emmy-winning programs that shatter box office and ratings records. Hurd\u2019s career as a Producer was launched when she produced and co-wrote THE TERMINATOR. This success was quickly followed by ALIENS, which received seven nominations and two Academy Awards, and the Academy Award winning films THE ABYSS, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, and THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. Hurd\u2019s additional feature credits include the Academy Award-nominated ARMAGEDDON, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, TREMORS, DANTE\u2019S PEAK, \u00c6ON FLUX, THE PUNISHER, DICK, and THE WATERDANCE. She also produced two documentaries on Native American subjects, TRUE WHISPERS: THE STORY OF THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS and CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS. Hurd is Executive Producer of THE WALKING DEAD, which currently reigns as the most-watched scripted drama.\n\u201cThe secret of our success is that we never, never give up.\u201d\n(Credit: www.thebluegrassspecial.com)\nREWARDS\nIn case you missed our updates, we posted some new AMAZING rewards that are still available, including:\n- A customized outgoing voicemail message recorded by Norman Reedus, Michael Rooker, or Danai Gurira from THE WALKING DEAD!\n- A spaghetti dinner with Hershel himself, Scott Wilson\n- Go shootin\u2019 with Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) at his private shooting range\n- A 10-minute Skype call with THE WALKING DEAD\u2019s Steven Yeun (Glenn)\n- Tickets to a live taping of TALKING DEAD hosted by Chris Hardwick (you can attend a recording of the Nerdist Podcast, too!)\n- Gorgeous prints by Cherokee artists Bill Rabbit and Traci Rabbit. \n- This original canvas giclee by Bill Rabbit!\n- These beautiful, one-of-a-kind framed animation cels by Native American artist Dawn Jackson (Saginaw Chippewa).\n- A 5-piece set of Native American jewelry, created and signed by Zuni artist Anselm Wallace.\nOf course, we can't forget about some of the original rewards!\nJOIN US!\nMANKILLER is a passion project for us.

This is because of natural curiosity. I want to encourage that curiosity as well as the imaginative thinking that comes with it. I want to remind people there's still so much to discover and explore. \n \"Nanotechnology. The science is good, the engineering is feasible, the paths of approach are many, the consequences are revolutionary-times-revolutionary, and the schedule is: in our lifetimes.\" - Stewart Brand\nWhy is Nanotechnology Important?\nNanotech is a disruptive technology. It creates new possibilities and makes things that once seemed impossible very real. Ferrofluid is just one small example of this. Researchers are currently creating other meta-materials that sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie or video game. \nFor example, we have created objects that can bend light completely around themselves, making them invisible. We have business suits already on the market that use carbon nanotubes to make the fabric bullet proof. The potential game changing uses for carbon nanotubes alone generates a list too long to post here. New applications and discoveries are being made in this field regularly. \nAdditionally, nanotech fuels Moore's Law...\nExponential growth is explosive. Every 25 years the processing power of computers grows by a factor of 1000!\nMy Past Experience\nI often collaborate with a group known as CZFerro. CZFerro is a ferrofluid knowledge bank that specializes in ferrofluid displays. Members have been offering ferrofluid displays for sale on the internet for over 5 years and have worked with ferrofluid since 2008. Inspired Designs, LLC will have full access to CZFerro members and their expertise if needed.\nThe Science\nOkay, if you've read this far your probably interested in the science behind it. Good for you!\nFirst, I want to highlight the size 10 nm because that is the size of the nanoparticles in the ferrofluid...\nWhat is ferrofuid?\nAs you can see, ferrofluid is a magnetic liquid.\nThis is something special because all known magnetic materials lose their magnetization when they get too hot. And this always happens long before the material reaches it's melting point. The trick is to suspend tiny pieces of solid magnetic material in the liquid.\nNormally, solid particles mixed in a liquid will eventually settle to the bottom because of gravity. Much like mixing sand in water. But, if the particles are small enough (say 10 nm) they won't be pulled down by gravity. This is because of a force called Brownian Motion. \nBrownian Motion is the tendency of liquid molecules to be constantly moving around. As a result, they bombard other particles in the liquid. And when the particles are very small in size this force is strong enough to counteract the force of gravity.\nIt's a lot like a balloon being bounced around by a crowd of people. The sea of waving hands will keep bouncing the balloon back into the air.\nWhy does it spike?\nThe spiking is the result of a few different forces competing with each-other. On a fundamental level these would be the van der Waals force (attractive/repulsive forces between molecules), gravity and the magnetic force. \nIn this case, the first two forces (van der Waals and gravity) manifest themselves as surface tension and play a very big role in how the ferrofluid spikes. \nObviously, the magnetic force plays a major role in forming the spikes because we only see the spikes when we apply a sufficient magnetic field. What's really happening is we are attracting the magnetic nanoparticles with the magnetic field and this creates an uneven distribution of particles, or gradient, within the ferrofluid. This gradient follows the magnetic field lines and rearranges the nanoparticles in the ferrofuid.  \nWhy does it rise and fall (The Inspiration)?\nInitially, the ferrofluid is more dense than the clear liquid and sits at the bottom. But,the ferrofuid changes it's density when it absorbes heat from the lamp at the bottom and becomes 'lighter'. This allows it to float to the top. Then, it begins to cool and it's density changes once again. As it cools it gets 'heavier' and falls back down. Then the process repeats itself.\nWhat are Other Ferrofluid Applications?\nCooling in loudspeakers for better sound\nLiquid O-rings for making computer chips\nMagnetic hyperthermia for better chemotherapy\nTargeted drug delivery for cancer treatment\nVanessa of Ferrotec wrote a wonderful blog post where she explains these applications and more.\nBacking This Project\nBacking our Kickstarter is simple and secure, and open to people from all around the world.

Sharing is caring!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as research and development is concerned, I feel I have adequately covered everything imaginable. However, it is true that ferrofluid is well known for throwing curve balls. Sometimes there are unexpected snags in the manufacturing process. I have been through this many times over in the past. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't possible this could happen with these new products as well. But, I do have a track record of troubleshooting these issues very well on previous projects with the CZFerro team. I also will take any complaints very seriously and do my very best to resolve any problems as quickly as possible. I will replace anything damaged during shipping free of charge. I will be as transparent as possible with my backers during order fulfillment and keep you updated on the progress as well as any speed bumps that may pop up along the way.\n\nI've watched previous ferrofluid kickstarter projects by others in the past fumble both the R&D as well as transparency and do not wish to follow in their path. This is why I have applied 3 years of R&D before filing for patent pending status and launching a kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "New Project Launch: Outer Space Ferrofluid Collection", "update_content": " Make 100: Outer Space Ferrofluid Collection"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "New Project Sneak Peek (Exclusive Rewards and Early Backer Discounts)", "update_content": " Magnetic Dice \nOur friends are launching a Kickstarter this week for some really cool magnetic dice trays!

So we made some new ones... (see below)\nWith us hitting the original high goal with two entire days remaining, we have no choice but to offer you Over-Stretch Goals...\nLet's knock these 3 Over-Stretchers out.\n1 Down - 2 to go!\nLook for Frozen Tundra & Gamma Dice in Halfsies 2.0 in mid 2015.\n\"Why the increase in the pricing curve in the Over-Stretch Goals?\"\nThe original campaign was designed and budgeted around shipping up to 9 sets.  Beyond that our shipping costs take a turn for the worse (something we've chosen to help mitigate for you beyond 9 sets).  Unlocking more sets also reflects a larger number of backers, which in turn demands higher production runs for some, and eventually all, of the colors.  In order to cover our increased production and shipping costs, we need to take the curve up a notch.  We kinda wrote the book on Kickstarter budgeting, and promise you that these exciting Over-Stretch Goals are budgeted both accurately and honestly.\nThanks for pledging!\nLet's do this!\nA quick FAQ note about A.D.A.P.T.\nA.D.A.P.T. is our newest game, and our next release.  It is a strategic battle card game for 2-3 players, that has never before seen mechanics (that's the way we like to do things), and is a total blast as you forcibly adapt your Guppy into a Master Fish with all manner of fun fish (and not-so-fish) parts.  The PnP takes about 5 minutes to print and set up; the rules take about 8 minutes to read, and the whole thing will cost you less than $1.50 print (if that).  It's a fun way to be the first to playtest our newest game, and maybe even offer feedback.  Heck! You've already helped design some of the Fish and Parts we'll flavor the game with. : ) \nOh, and p.s.... the big secret is... It requires a full set of dice to play! ; O\nHalfsies Dice are all new full dice sets that feature a beautiful new half-&-half color-split design, have a pearlescent swirl within each color, and are semi-translucent for stunningly vibrant colors.  \nAesthetically pleasing, and professionally manufactured these dice are a perfect addition to any collection.\nDice Details\nHalfsies Dice are manufactured in high impact resin with smooth corners, on preexisting, industry standard dice molds for a clean and reliably-balanced roll every time.\nHalfsies Dice have been prototyped in a number of color sets for you to see, but can and will be designed in any color arrangement you can imagine.\nAll sets are complete, the industry standard 15-20mm by die, and include the standard 7 dice:\n*backer favorite renders shown - full sets will be all the same colors\nThese dice sets fit perfectly in any collection, whether you are a casual gamer, a dice collector, or just like shiny objects.\n\"These are your dice.\"\nHere are some dice closeups so you can compare what you have at home to what Halfsies Dice look like.

After that, you choose the rest!\nSet #1) Mithril\nMithril Lore - A legendary metal first mined by the dwarves of Moria.  Some say it is actually an organic metal that can be found forming the scales of certain dragons. Beautiful and engaging, these silvery blue dice make a great companion for any noble gamer.\nSet #2) Orichalcum\nOrichalcum Lore - A rare red metal found only in the sunken city of Atlantis.  Its strength and molecular commonalities with gold made it abundantly valuable.  Bold and strong, this set can roll with the best of them in any dungeon crawl campaign.\nSet #3) Adamantium\nAdamantium Lore - Once known as the indestructible metal Adamantine that held the Greek titans captive in the underworld.  Now, its popular alloy has been used to create some pretty sweet claws.

The drawback to this state is that they can no longer beget new trees; they produce seeds, but those seeds can't germinate as they too have a consciousnesses of their own.  These are your Treant Dice.\nSet #8) The backer chosen: The Heir -Now Available!\nThe Heir Lore - On March 17th 2014, The Heir was discovered.  On November 23rd 2015, 2014, The Heir was born.

Though we welcome you to view the updates to see the results.\n1) We need your help. \nAs big fans & collectors of various dice sets ourselves, we invented this new half & half design to honor a promise made to our The King's Armory Backers and to bring a brand new style of dice to the tabletop.  We have even begun prototyping them to ensure the idea would work.  Successful in prototyping, these dice can become a reality - with your help.\nPlus by backing, you'll have access to participate in the Backer-Only Dice Selection Surveys.\n2) Our motto is \"This is your game\", and is so for a reason.\nIf you followed our first campaign, you know that A) We love your involvement, B) We believe in transparency, and C) We have a tendency to give away free stuff.\nInvolvement: The majority of dice sets (sets #4-8) will be chosen by Backer Vote.  Sure, we could pick them all ourselves, but that's not the way we roll.\nTransparency: All Pledge Tiers are already displayed and available from the start.  No mysteries about pricing as the campaign progresses.  We even posted our budget in the FAQs at the bottom of the page, and have reduced international shipping costs 3 times over the course of the campaign.\nFree Stuff: We've added a \"Better the Odds\" Tier, in which you put your faith in this campaign to see ALL Dice Sets unlocked, bettering everyone's odds of unlocking Stretch Goals, and we in turn give you the Yin Yang Dice Set for FREE when we hit that point.  Plus the Saint Patrick's Day Tiers, now the Gift Package Tier!  Free stuff!  ...we're kinda obsessed with free upgrades. \n3) These dice are the lowest prices they'll ever be.\nWe have priced the Tiers as low as we can to make them accessible to everyone, while still guaranteeing successful production & delivery.\nIn retail, these dice will MSRP at $9+ per set + full price shipping.\nHere on Kickstarter you can get them for as low as $7.00 (or less) per set!\nFor designer 2-tone dice, that price can't be found anywhere online.\nDetails and a little math:\nEven at the first Tier, since shipping is included in your order (USA full; International in-part), they are already cheaper than ordering retail from most online retailers (because they charge full shipping in addition).  And these dice get less expensive per set with each Pledge Tier. \nPricing by Tier:\n1 Set Tier - $12.00\n2 sets tier - $11.50 per set\n3 Sets Tier - $11.00 per set\n4 Sets Tier - $9.75 per set\n5 Sets Tier - $8.80 per set\n6 Sets Tier - $8.17 per set\n7 Sets Tier - $7.71 per set\n8 Sets Tier - $7.38 per set\n9 Sets Tier - $7.33 per set (Booyaa!)\n10 Sets Tier - $7.30 per set\n11 Sets Tier - $7.27 per set\n12 Sets Tier - $7.25 per set (Booyaa!)\n**18** Sets Tier - $7.17 per set\n**27** Sets Tier - $7.00 per set\n**34+2** Sets Tier - $6.61 per set - Tier now available\nAt the \"6 Sets Tier\" the price per set is notably less than other designer 2-color dice available online.  ...even after International Shipping.  And it only gets cheaper as you add more!\nA quick check:\nCommon online retail pricing: $9.95 x 9 sets = $89.55. \nPlus $5-25 shipping = Total: $94.55 - $114.55\nThis Kickstarter: $7.33 x 9 sets = $66.00.\nPlus our max of $23 Shipping = Total: $89.00 \u2026to anywhere in the world ...at max!\nCompare these prices with any online retailer of specialty 2-tone dice.  We think you'll be rather pleased.\nHow are we able to do this?  We kicked this with zero margin on these dice.  We've offered up our profits for your savings.  We'll make a couple bucks selling the left overs after the campaign.  But you get them crazy cheap for investing your trust in us.  That's the way we do things.\nStill unsure? \nWe invite you to back us at the lowest Pledge Tier so you can join in the comments, surveys, and updates to see we do things.  If at the end of all things you're not happy with your time with us, simply cancel your pledge.  You have nothing to lose. \nJust give us the chance to wow you.\nEach Pledge Tier represents a quantity of Dice Sets.  The more sets ordered in a single pledge the less each Dice Set costs.\nAll Tiers include: A number of Dice Sets in plastic dice cases, a shipping subsidy, and entry to Backer-only voting.\nFinal color choices for your order will be made after the campaign closes, at all Tiers.  Pledge early, choose later.\n\n\"Can I order multiples of certain color sets, so this campaign hits all its goals?\"\nAbsolutely!  To do so...\nClick the green \"Back this Project\" button at the top of the page.\nSelect the Pledge Tier that corresponds to the total number of sets you'd like to receive.\nGo tell your friends about these dice, so they can pledge too.\nAt the close of the campaign, simply tell us what color sets you desire; repeats welcome.\nAll shipping charges will be collected after the campaign.\nWe chose the \"pay for shipping after the campaign\" method because it keeps the Funding Goal & Stretch Goals more transparent & accurate, while it also reduces your final shipping charges. \nWe just hacked down International Shipping CONSIDERABLY... again. (3/7/15)\nShipping costs - detailed by quantity of sets ordered, by area.\n\u2020 = \"Friendly Shipping\" with VAT & Customs Fees pre-paid.\n\u2021 = Yes, we managed to successfully unify ALL OF EUROPE, Western, Central, and even Non-EU, etc. for shipping rates.  EU Europe is also \"Friendly\"; while non-EU Europe may be subject to VAT by locality.\n* As we have successfully reached $69,000 in funding.  These prices are locked in.  Congratulations!\nPlease DO NOT add the shipping rate to your pledge. \nShipping will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management.  Because...\nWe continue our pledge: If we find prices less than the ones we've already quoted, we will reduce the shipping accordingly.  It's already happened THRICE so far...\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced as of 2/18/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced further as of 2/28/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced HUGELY as of 3/7/15\nShipping Q&A:\n\"International Shipping got cheaper with each Stretch Goal?\"\nPer set, yes. We budgeted in a sliding scale for shipping subsidies within our Funding & Stretch Goals, so that we could guarantee that USA shipping remains free with every unlocked Tier.  As the USA subsidy grew, so did the international one.  That means, the higher our funding goal grew, the less international Backers have to pay, on average, for shipping!\n-\n...the lost prototypes...\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving already begun manufacturing on The King's Armory - The Tower Defense Board Game, we have gained a lot of experience with game production - including custom polyhedral dice - and we put that experience to work reducing the risks and challenges. \nIt also allows us to foresee potential issues, and solve them in advance.\n\nFor example: we can't be 100% certain what final International Shipping is going to cost for each Backer's unique order, so we did extensive research with multiple companies in order to provide very accurate estimates, and ultimately chose to collect shipping post-campaign. This way there's no \"we ran out of money for shipping\" faux pas, because each person pays what they owe by order and by region.\n\nOur Commitment to Your Excellence: \nIf you get the wrong dice, experience excessive production delays, or are in any way dissatisfied with the way we fulfill your pledge, whether it be our fault or any others', we'll fight on your behalf to make it right. We've done it for our TKA Backers, and we'll do it again for you.\nAnd if we can't make it right, we'll refund your money; thus mitigating YOUR risks and challenges.\n\nGiving Back to Those That Have Helped Us: \nOur experience with game production during The King's Armory campaign really has taught us a lot.

Imagine never again damaging your nicely painted walls with loads of extra holes. And imagine never seeing another tilted frame on your wall. Sounds a bit improbable, right?\nNot any more. Introducing the Beehive Picture Hangers! In about 5 minutes, you can hang nearly any size frame, right where you want it. And the process is so easy, you may even enjoy hanging pictures \u2013 something you never would have imagined!\nThe honeycomb design of the Beehive Picture Hangers is key to their incredible functionality. Once the hangers are placed on the custom designed Support Pins, your frame can be quickly and easily adjusted in any direction. You simply lift the frame from the Support Pins (more about these later), and adjust up, down, left, right or diagonally. It really is that simple! \nNo more removing nails from the wall and starting over. No more repositioning the hardware on your frame. No more swiss cheese walls. About 5 seconds or less is all it takes to adjust your frame in any direction. \nThe Max hangers have 143 hexagonal openings in each hanger, giving you the option of 143 different positions to adjust your frame, on each corner. The Original give you 68 positions for adjustment.\nCheck out the clip below. We've attached the Max hangers to a plexiglass frame so you'll have a clear view of how the hangers work. This also gives you a close-up view of a Support Pin after it has been inserted into the wall.\nEach Beehive Picture Hanger has a small point that projects from the center of the hanger. These are called the Positioning Points. The Positioning Points allow you to hang a single frame, or an entire series of frames without taking a single measurement. That's right. You can ditch the tape measure and ruler next time you hang a frame.\nHow they work. After the Beehive Picture Hangers are attached to your frame, simply hold your frame up to the wall in the approximate position you want to hang it, and press the top corners of the frame against the wall. The Positioning Points will make two small indentations in your wall (one for each hanger). These indentations are where you'll insert your Support Pins into the wall to hang your frame.\nThe clip below shows a demonstration on using the Positioning Points, as well as the custom designed Support Pins.\nNotice how the Support Pin does not fully penetrate the drywall (sheetrock). This feature eliminates any concerns of hitting pipes, conduit or wiring, which is a common problem when using nails, hooks and other standard hardware. In addition, there's no need to locate a wall stud (or worry about hitting one). The Support Pins are uniquely designed to hang frames up to 30 lbs. in standard drywall alone.\nWhether you're planning to hang 1 frame or one thousand, this product is for you. The Beehive Picture Hangers can be used on just about any size or shape of wooden frame or canvas.\nNo special skills are required for installation. You'll simply need a small phillips head screwdriver for attaching the hangers to your frame, and a hammer (or shoe heel) to tap the Support Pins into your wall.\nThe Beehive Picture Hangers now make all other picture hanging hardware, obsolete.\nBeehive Picture Hangers are the brain child of inventor Herb Bigelow. \nSome of you may already be familiar with a product similar to the Beehive Picture Hangers (formerly Beehive Hangers or Honeycomb Hangers) which were also designed by Herb. These were originally being distributed primarily as a wholesale product through frame shops and canvas suppliers. Shortly following, the Beehive Hangers were signed into a licensing agreement and were being manufactured by a third-party company. The licensee was unsuccessful in their promotional efforts and the agreement was amicably dissolved. During the agreement period, inventory for the Beehive Hangers was depleted. \nHerb has since made an innovative change to the design, adding the Positioning Point, which virtually eliminates any need to take measurements.\nIn 2014, after several years of perseverance, Herb was granted a Utility Patent, securing his production rights to this amazing innovation.\nBoth the Original and Max hangers are rated up to 30 lbs. This rating is based on using two hangers on each frame, along with the included Support Pins.\nBoth the Original and Max hangers are equipped with the new Positioning Point (described above) and come standard with the custom designed Support Pins and screws \u2013 all the hardware you'll need!\nThe Max hangers have been specially designed so they can be attached across the miter joints of your frames. This will add additional support to larger, heavier frames, helping prevent separation of the joints over time.\nFor you left brain thinkers, we're including a technical drawing showing the details and dimensions for both hanger sizes. \nTooling\nManufacturing of the tooling for the Beehive Picture Hangers will be our first priority. Funding for tooling will be apportioned to the Original and Max hangers (which incorporate the new Positioning Point), in addition to the Support Pins.\nManufacturing\nIn effort to keep production costs and unit prices down, we'll need to meet minimum order quantities with our manufacturer. Exact numbers will be determined by the success of our Kickstarter campaign. Our first order from the manufacturer will include the inventory required to sustain sales for a period of approximately 4-6 months, as well as fulfill your Kickstarter pledges.\nE-commerce Site\nWe're well into the design, and now in need of capital to move things to the next level. Your funding will help us design and maintain a shopping cart and set up a shipping calculator, as well as implement the SEO needed to generate and maintain website traffic.\nRetail Packaging\nOur goal is to place the Beehive Picture Hangers into retail in Q1 of 2016. After meeting with several of the world's largest hardware manufacturers and distributors over the past several months, we're confident the Beehive Picture Hangers will quickly find their way into big box, hardware and home improvement stores around the nation as well as around the world. With your pledge, we'll be one step closer to making this a reality. Imagine seeing the Beehive Picture Hangers at your local retailer, knowing that you helped make it happen!\nMoving Forward\nOur current Beehive Picture Hangers are designed for wood frames only. But stay tuned! We're designing a secure 'clip on' version for metal frames. This will be a 'no screws required' design. Our goal is to have this line extension in production by Q2 of 2016. \nWe've also designed a unique hanger that will be offered to picture frame manufacturers. This version will provide manufacturers with a cost-effective solution to adding the Beehive Picture Hangers directly to their frame lineup before their products reach the wholesale and consumer markets.\nIn Summary\nWe have a fully developed, proven, and patented product that is ready for production. We've aligned with a highly qualified manufacturer that has the ideal facilities and capabilities for production of the Beehive Picture Hangers. The retail packaging has been designed and sourced, and is set for production. \nWe're now we're ready to hit the 'go' button on production and fulfillment. With your help, the Beehive Picture Hangers will soon be a household brand!\nAre you ready to be a part of our dream? \nWe've prepared a series of reward levels. Based on the amount you pledge, you'll receive sets of the Original or Max hangers. In two simple steps, you'll be on your way to not only making your life just a bit easier, but also the lives of people around the globe!\nNOTE: After giving a great deal of thought to our rewards, we decided to forego the cute t-shirts and fancy widgets, and base our rewards on what really counts. The product. We thought this was the best way to put your hard earned dollars to work!\nMake your pledge count! Keep in mind that you're allowed to choose just 1 reward level. However, during the Kickstarter campaign, at any time, you can increase your pledge to 'boost' your rewards.\nRemember, this Kickstarter campaign is our endeavor to get the Beehive Picture Hangers into production! Once the Kickstarter is successfully funded, the hangers won't be available online for another 4-5 months, after our goal is met. This means the only way to get your hands on a set of shiny new Beehive Picture Hangers is to choose a pledge amount and back our project! Don't be the last one on your block with crooked frames!\nYour pledge, big or small, is vital to the success of our project. It's not going to happen without you. And regardless of whether you're able to pledge or not, if you believe in the Beehive Picture Hangers, you can help us a ton by sharing our Kickstarter project with your friends and family.\nSpreading the word is essential to a successful campaign.

Disposing of standard batteries is an increasing problem because although their uses are various and many, disposing of them is not healthy to the environment. Lightors resolves these issues from a different perspective in providing an easy-to-use alternative. Now, not all batteries are created equal.\nLightors are extremely convenient batteries for use whenever and wherever.\nUnlike other rechargeable batteries, you don\u2019t need an additional charger to house the batteries while charging. Micro-USB cables are the standard when it comes to charging most smart devices today, which makes it much more convenient than having to keep track of an external charging cradle.\nLightors could help potentially reduce battery waste from 10 billion to\n20 million annually!\nDetox the earth, Innovative battery 'LIGHTORS'\nThe Environmental News Network reports that annual global consumption of batteries is at a staggering 10 billion (the US makes up 3 million alone).\nOf the total number of batteries consumed, approximately only 2% (200,000) get properly disposed of for recycling while the remaining 9.8 billion are simply thrown out thus contaminating the environment further.\nLightors is an eco-friendly and innovative product that protects the planet by reducing discarded battery waste by 1/500 (from 10 billion to 20 million). Regularly disposed batteries can bring tremendous harm to the environment. \nOne Lightor battery provides the same value as 500 standard single use batteries.\nExtremely cost-effective and affordable, Lightors offers users a way to reduce costs in battery spending (+$48 Billion Industry). If purchasing one batter was $1, you would be saving $499 inadditional battery spending. This is not only incredible cheaper, but a substantial reduction in resources used to make, store, dispose of extra batteries.\nThrowing away batteries after a single use is probably the most convenient, but isn\u2019t there way to solve major problems in the world that affect people and our earth? Isn\u2019t there a way overcome the disadvantages of using a traditional battery cradle forrecharging?  Our product was developed to address this problem.\nHowever, there were issues with producing AAA batteries due to size and fitting in the PCB and mechanisms in a much smaller form factor.  \nFinally, we were able to come up with a working model recently in December 2014 to offer two different sizes of Lightors batteries.\nLightors is a young company that contributes to the development and distribution of advanced eco-friendly products adding innovative new products to your daily life tomake a difference in the world. The origin of our brand name means \u201cpeople that make light\u201d.\nLight makes for a better society, meaning brightening and making positive changes, and it\u2019s important to focus on creating valuable work that brings light to this world.\nWe want to extend our apologies once again at the mishap we had yesterday revolving our prematurely posted update. Again, the update was posted without receiving proper approval, which has caused some negative feedback and loss of faith from some of our backers.  \nAlthough a lightning port stretch goal is something we would love to include, at this time we cannot verify its feasibility and thus have decided to create new stretch goals in its place.  \nOur first stretch goal will be for the same amount of $150,000. This stretch goal is to double the number of uses for Lightors. Currently, we can guarantee that Lightors can be used at least 500 times. This stretch goal will allow the development and guarantee of at least 1,000 uses.  \nThe second stretch goal is for amp increase. This stretch goal will be for $200,000 and will guarantee a 10% increase in mAH for both types. The AA batteries will increase from 1500mAH to 1650mAH while the AAA batteries will increase from 600mAH to 660mAH.  \nAgain, we want to extend our apologies for our previous error and hope it will not deter current and future Backers from supporting our campaign.  \nPosted above is our current domestic patent and our international patent is currently pending. (PCT/KR2014/011245) Just to clear the air, Lightors is a unique product that does not exist anywhere else in the world and we stand by our product.\nAs a recognized Hi-Seoul Brand company, Lightors has received recognition for being a promising and representative small-medium enterprise by the city of Seoul. \nOnly those companies that offer globally competitive innovative technological products are able  to receive this special recognition in hopes of expanding Korea's domestic export enterprise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLightors is a relatively young manufacturing and distribution company of eco-friendly innovative products that add high value to our daily lives and make a difference in the world. \nWith our flagship product, we\u2019re entering the smart accessory market to match other smartphone peripherals.\n \nLightors = \u201cLight\u201d+ \u201cors\u201d \n \nThe origin of our name means \u201cpeople that create light\u201d.\nLight provides for a better society and brightening peoples\u2019 lives with positive changes.\nAlways focus on creating something positive and bringing light to the rest of the world. \n \nFrom a technical point of view, the main challenges we faced when creating Lightors were \u201chow will we offer USB charging while minimizing circuit discharge\u201d, \u201chow can we maximize Ni-MH capacity\u201d, and \u201chow will we minimize power loss in the circuit configuration\u201d.

So do I. Please consider making a kickstart pledge as a way to help build greater awareness and positive change for the planet and for plant medicine.\"  \n          - Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability, Traditional Medicinals\nAs an herbalist, have you ever felt uneasy about where the plants used in your remedies are from? As a consumer, have you ever wondered if you can trust the label on the bottle of supplements or tinctures on the grocery store shelf? And have you found yourself reaching for the cheaper bottle, doubting those extra dollars really make of a difference?\nI\u2019ve wondered all of these things for years and that\u2019s why I launched the Sustainable Herbs Project.\nWHAT IT IS:\nThe Sustainable Herbs Project is a new project by the producers of the award winning documentary, Numen: the Nature of Plants, the first feature length film on the healing power of plants. We are creating an interactive documentary following medicinal plants through the supply chain to provide you with the information needed to feel more confident about the herbal remedies you purchase. With stories, videos, and facts, we\u2019ll bring the supply chain to life with interviews with men and women involved in all aspects of the industry.\nOur vision is to use this site to launch a more educated and responsible consumer movement supporting high quality herbal remedies and sustainable and ethical sourcing. We want this interactive multi-media website  to be available for free and so we have launched this Kickstarter Campaign to cover our costs up front. Proceeds will go to the design and development of the website/interactive documentary and to birthing an organization to carry on this work. \nReach Goals ~ Help us Reach $65,000!\nChina is a key and questionable source of so many herbs in the industry and being able to include research and footage from cultivation/collecting sites and processing centers in China would make this project even more comprehensive. If we raise $65,000 we can add a research/filming trip to China. The budget for our $54,000 goal is lean. Having a bit of padding will allow us to be more flexible and take advantage of opportunities as they arise...\nWe are confident we can reach this goal, but we need your help to do so! \nConsider what it is worth to feel secure that the plants in your medicinal tea and herbal remedy have been sourced responsibly and that the remedies actually are what the labels claim them to be. And then contribute what you can!\nAnd then share this project with friends!\nImportant questions on wild-collected plants: Were they correctly identified and harvested at the right time? Were they over-harvested? Were they collected from a clean place, away from roads and industrial run off?\nThe Sustainable Herbs Project (SHP) will provide the resources you need to find companies who really are doing the hard work of building sustainability into their supply chain and to encourage the industry as a whole to adopt better practices. Modeled on new, cutting edge interactive documentaries, we will create a user-friendly multi-media site that is educational, inspiring, and fun!\nThe SHP site will include:\nFACTS: A general overview of the botanical industry, tracing and mapping the different supply chains of key products such as essential oils, medicinal tea, liquid extracts, super critical extracts, etc.\nSTORIES: Video interviews and photographs following medicinal plants from different regions of the world through their supply chains, bringing the journeys these plants make alive through the voices of individuals we do not typically see when we reach for a herbal remedy on the shelf or order bulk herbs online.\nACTION: An outline of challenges to quality, sustainability and equity in different supply chains; action steps consumers can take to support responsible sourcing; best practices for companies wanting to improve their sourcing and processing.\nPROGRAM DEVELOPMENT: We are forming an advisory group to guide the development of the project and website and to help develop our long-term strategy. This will either include maintaining the Sustainable Herbs Project as a separate organization/project or partnering with an herb school that includes an educational track on the herb industry and herbal medicine-making.\nAdditional questions include were workers paid a fair wage and on time? How are plants dried and stored?\nPlease make this vision a reality!\nYour contribution will help cover:\nThree Research trips to Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland, Serbia), India, North Carolina, and Oregon to film and interview wild collectors, processors, and finished-product manufacturers. We selected these regions because they are important sources of medicinal plants for the international market and represent different issues in the industry.\nStaff time to conduct and compile the research, edit video footage, and prepare written material for the website.\nCreation of the interactive documentary.\nDevelopment and launch of the Sustainable Herbs Project website.\nSeed money to cover staff costs to keep the project updated.\n8-10% covers Kickstarter and Amazon costs.\nReach Goals ~ Help us Reach $65,000!\nChina is a key and questionable source of so many herbs in the industry and being able to include research and footage from cultivation/collecting sites and processing centers in China would make this project even more comprehensive.

I love teaching the the craft of creating eye-catching images and LightBox Photography Cards will give me the chance to reach out, on a global scale, to share my vision, pass on the techniques I use in my own photography, and help propel your own image making to new levels.\nBackerClub.co\nhttp://backerclub.co/Each card back features a different quote from notable image makers of the past to the present . . . from industry legends to contemporary shooters, it's my hope you'll draw the same inspiration from these valuable words of wisdom as I have.\nNow here's where the fun begins . . . the card faces are where all the action happens. Here's the concept - you are in need of some creative inspiration. Maybe you just got a new camera for the holidays . . . or are simply looking for new things to shoot . . . You grab your deck of LightBox Photography Cards, give them a shuffle and pick a card.\nThe face of each LightBox Photography Card will showcase a different photographic challenge. Assignments like:\nCard #005: Photograph Machinery\nCard #017: Photograph Solitude\nCard #048: Photograph Patterns\nUnder each challenge is a small write-up to better define the assignment. The cards are also numbered for easy reference. There are icons to consider as well - these are highlighted in orange when certain gear, like a tripod, flash or filters are recommended. \nThe image found on the face of each card is my own challenge solution with some camera settings that factor into the creation of that particular image. \nEach card offers up a different challenge, some designed to be simple and easy to accomplish, while others will push your creativity and ingenuity to new heights. How long you spend on the assignment is up to you . . . an hour . . . a day? As you'll read below - the assignment doesn't just stop there. With all the social media surrounding this project, you'll be able to share your image and get some constructive critiques and instruction from other LightBox users!\nAll the assignment cards have been designed and locked in. The three samples above are just the tip of the iceberg! I'll be releasing more of the face cards during the campaign, but not all - where would the fun be in that?\nIn the spirit of teaching and instruction, every deck of LightBox Photography Cards comes with some bonus cards. One of which will be a 3-in-1 Grey card that will help you to easily color correct your images in post production (look for an update with a 3-in-1 tutorial soon!). The other is a photography cheat sheet to help remind you of the different settings your camera might offer.\nThere will be a whole social media aspect to this project, too . . . where we'll all be able to share and converse about our shooting experiences. This particular aspect is what has me most excited! \nFacebook\nGoogle +\nTwitter\n\nThose who backed the Foto Grafis cards might remember all the \"no-obligation\" add-ons achieved through stretch goals! Our first stretch goal will be reached at $4,500 and will come in the form of a more durable 3-in-1 card, printed on plastic! Look for an update with a 3-in-1 tutorial soon! If we hit this goal, every backer will get one of these cards at no additional cost and no additional shipping! \nNew Stretch Goal!  \nEvery backer will get one free printed check list of LightBox Photography Cards if we hit $20,500!\nLets talk about Add-Ons, backers can add on as many decks of LightBox Photography Cards as they wish. I've offered up some group packages, but in an effort to keep things as simple as possible, backers can add on decks for $9.00 (International backers, please add on $2.00 for each additional deck to cover overseas postage). The photo below showcases additional add-ons, which I'll go over in more detail with unique updates - I am particularly excited about the Photo Notes!\n BRAND NEW ADD-ON!!\nOne of the pledge tiers I am most excited about is the \"Education Ambassador\" tier. For your support of $100, you will get 10 decks of LightBox Photography Cards . . . in addition to your rewards, I'll be sending an additional 10 decks to the school of your choice. I do a lot of talks at high schools about photography and it's just about the most rewarding experiences of my career. Pledging for this tier will help me spread the joys of photography into your community schools!\n I'd like to thank you for considering backing LightBox Photography Cards . . . I can't wait to achieve our goals and get these cards into your hands! Here's to a wonderful and creative 2015!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project of this size, obstacles are bound to happen, but with over 20 years in the publishing/graphic design industry, I know I can produce these cards with little or no hiccups on the production side. I am partnering up with the amazing folks over at AdMagic (http://www.admagic.com), who made my last project, Foto Grafis, and am thrilled to be working with them again! To me, nothing is more important than putting out a quality product - especially one that my name has been attached to it - and I know the team at AdMagic feel the very same way!\n\nI've learned a lot from shipping out Foto Grafis and will again be using U-line boxes to ship out all rewards and minimize any potential postal mishaps. While this does cost a bit more, shipping with U-line boxes proved very effective during the last campaign with not a single deck damaged en route!\n\nAs far as risks, there are none that I can see outside the obvious - I'll be crushed if this project doesn't achieve its final goal.

With 3Doodler 2.0 we\u2019re continuing to make 3D creation and 3D design accessible to everyone!\nHow does it work?\nCompact and easy to use, the 3Doodler extrudes heated plastic that cools almost instantly into a solid, stable structure; and with no computers or software needed, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Simply plug your 3Doodler into a power socket and start drawing anything within minutes.\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\nBut you don't need to take our word for it...\nSince we first showed the world that drawing in 3D was possible, we have sold over 130,000 3Doodlers. Our community has been using their 3Doodlers to create amazing things, going far beyond even our wildest expectations: from jewellery, to fully 3Doodled remote control planes, 3Doodled dresses, architectural models, and even writing braille! The creative possibilities are endless (and at times a tad unusual too!).\nSo just like the Backstreet Boys, 3Doodler's back, alright!\nIt was thanks to the support of the Kickstarter community that we were able to make the 3Doodler dream a reality. It was also here on Kickstarter that we began the process of building a vibrant community of artists, makers, designers, educators, as well as others eager to lift their imaginations off the page. Doodle by Doodle you have pushed the boundaries of 3D art and creation and inspired us further!\nTo say a big thank you for all of your help and inspiration, we decided to come back to the place where it all began, and bring 3Doodler 2.0 to you first! We are eternally grateful for all the support you gave us the first time around, and want to give you first dibs at creating with the new 3Doodler. It's your funding that will help make this a reality!\nWhat\u2019s new with 3Doodler 2.0?\nCompletely redesigned from top to bottom, 3Doodler 2.0 is the result of over two years of research and development, and feedback from thousands of users. Our aim? To give you the best 3Doodling experience ever! The result? A smaller, more ergonomic, and even more kick-ass 3D pen. We've also housed the new 3Doodler in a sleek metallic casing, so that it's jaw-droppingly beautiful and feels great in your hands.\nAnd there's lots more...\nAs well as being the world's smallest 3D printing pen, we've packed the new 3Doodler with loads of other enhancements for smoother doodling in every dimension:\na fully re-engineered drive system (the part that feeds the plastic through the pen), for even smoother 3Doodling\nan entirely new nozzle design, for better performance and crisper Doodles. As well as being technologically better it also looks way cooler\nenhanced and quieter airflow, to cool your plastic more efficiently and make it even easier to Doodle in the air from the get-go\ndual speed control, for a more customized Doodling experience (and specially for those of you who just can't get enough speed!)\na new double-click function for continuous flow, so that you can Doodle non-stop without having to hold down any buttons\nmanual temperature optimization, for minor flow adjustments and expertly consistent 3D Doodles\nmore efficient and stable heating (or in other words, no stopping and starting while doodling!) and\ndrastically reduced power consumption, under half the voltage of the original 3Doodler\nIt's also easier to use than ever before thanks to a whole host of other design adjustments. These touch on everything from the shape of the pen, which allows you to Doodle into really tight corners, the more intuitive button design, as well as the positioning of the LED indicator light and cooling fan.\nAccessories & Plastics\nWith the launch of the new 3Doodler on Kickstarter, we are also releasing a series of exciting new accessories to supercharge (and beautify) your 3Doodling. These include:\na DoodleStand for your pen and plastic \na JetPack, a portable power pack that gives you the freedom to Doodle on the go (2 hours of non-stop portable Doodling with ABS and 3 hours with PLA!)\na Nozzle Set equipped six changeable nozzles + a smoothing tool\na foot Pedal, for more versatile 3Doodling.\nWith the new JetPack we're certain you'll be putting Banksy to shame in no time - bring on that 3Doodled street art!\nSo which pledge level is right for you?\nWe\u2019ve tried to create pledge levels to suit everyone, from the novice Doodler to the seasoned designer or engineer, and for those of you looking for a bit of 3Doodling fun. Simply scroll down the right-hand side of the page and pick the combination of plastics and accessories that fits you best.\nEvery pledge level comes bundled with a mix of 3Doodler PLA and ABS plastic strands so that you can start 3D drawing right away!\nEach pledge level is limited to one pledge per backer. However we have also created special double pledge levels for the 3Doodler 2.0, Accessorize, JetSetter and PowerDoodler rewards, as well as a special Family Pack with four pens and a bunch of accessories + plastic strands.\nAnd if you're having trouble deciding which pledge level to go for, please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch to ask us any questions that may help!\nEducation\nThe teaching potential that comes with being able to draw in a new dimension has been truly inspiring, and something the whole 3Doodler team has been eager to get behind. Together with teachers and educators, we're working to make the 3Doodler a standard classroom tool, used for everything from teaching geometry, to making award-winning art, or producing learning aids for the visually impaired.\nTo support the use of the 3Doodler in education, we have created a special EDU pledge level for only US$1,000 (worth almost US$2,000), that allows you to send a full class set, loaded with x12 3Doodler 2.0 pens, a ton of plastic and accessories, as well as curricular materials to any school, university, library or non-profit makerspace of your choosing. You\u2019ll also get a 3Doodler 2.0 and full set of accessories for yourself!\nNote: We will require you to designate a recognized educational institutional or non-profit makerspace (as well as a contact there) in order to claim this pledge level. Full instructions will follow in an Update, and further details can be found in the FAQs below.\nWhat if \"I'm not artistic\"?\nIf you can dream it, you can 3Doodle it! (Or so the saying goes.) The more artistically inclined of you will be sketching castles in the air in no time, but even those of us without that kind of talent can use the 3Doodler to draw on flat surfaces, peel off the Doodled pieces and join them together to make awesome 3D designs and creations. And based on what we've seen so far, previous artistic ability is not a prerequisite for 3Doodling greatness. Even those who considered themselves to be \"not artistic\" have gone on to Doodle breathtakingly impressive pieces!\nThere are a ton of places to find 3Doodling inspiration, including our Community Site, which has hundreds of freely downloadable projects and stencils, how-to videos, and images. Our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages are also frequently updated with Doodles of the Week, Community \u201cDoodle-Offs\u201d, and cool creations from around the world.\nWhen will you get your 3Doodler?\nWe have been working on 3Doodler 2.0 for over 12 months and are inches away from pressing \"go\" on full production. That means we\u2019ll go straight from this Kickstarter campaign to making your pens. Our first backers will get their new 3Doodlers within a few weeks of this campaign closing, and the majority of you will have your pens by April.\nFor those of you curious about the exact stage we're at: All R&D and prototypes (along with compliance testing) were completed in December, all components and suppliers have been locked down, we have finished our final pilot runs (those are the pens you see in the video and images), and the assembly process is being fine-tuned so that we can run as smoothly as possible when full production begins! All that's left to do is put the final touches to tooling and place our first large orders with our suppliers. Then we'll be moving like lightening and hassling our shipping partners day and night to get your pens to you ASAP.\nWe shipped our original Kickstarter 3Doodlers on time and we're determined to do the same, if not better, for 3Doodler 2.0! \nNo waiting six months (or even a year) for this one\u2026 ;)\nThank you!\nWe can\u2019t thank the Kickstarter community enough for being part of this amazing journey, and we\u2019re super excited to give you a first shot at the new 3Doodler. We know that you'll make the most of this incredible tool and use it to create Doodles that will blow us away.\nFor anyone who has not experienced the 3Doodler yet, now is a great time to start! And for those of you backing us for the second time, thank you again!\nThank you from the 3Doodler Team!\nIs there anything else you need to know?\nYes! To help with this we\u2019ve compiled an extensive FAQ section below, covering everything from the plastics that will ship with your 3D pen, to the shipping methods we\u2019ll be using, details relating to taxes & duties (*sigh*), product safety, as well as the procedures for claiming the School Set pledge level, and much more.\nWe\u2019ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and we\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall.\nAnyone who backed the original 3Doodler will tell you that we\u2019d much rather reply to your messages than sleep, so please feel free to reach out to us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe worked on the original 3Doodler for almost a year before we launched our first Kickstarter. Since then we\u2019ve had two additional years of production experience, our team has also grown, and we\u2019re doing things better than ever.\n\nWe\u2019re ready to begin full production on 3Doodler 2.0 as soon as this campaign ends, but as with any physical item there are challenges to getting it right and there is always the possibility of delays (sometimes due to factors outside of anyone's control!). In our efforts to avoid delays and produce the best 3D pen possible, we are selective in how we choose our partners, conservative in setting our timelines, and, as always, we intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n\nFortunately the 3Doodler 2.0 and the JetPack have already been FCC and CE approved (so that's another hurdle out of the way!), and our plastics are amongst the best certified on the planet, having passed full toxicological risk assessments and heavy metal testing.\n\nQuality control remains a major focus for us. We have implemented systems to catch as many product issues as possible before your pens make their way into your hands.

We want to talk. Give us a shout here to talk about how The Public Radio could fit into your next fund drive!\nIt's radio monogamy.\nOur interaction with FM radio today is simple - we just turn on and off the power. We rarely change stations, and *never* use those seek and scan buttons.  \nWe've gotten rid of all the parts of FM that are now obsolete, leaving only what matters. The Public Radio has all you need - just an antenna and a volume knob.\nHow it works \nLet's get one thing clear: The Public Radio only tunes to one station - your favorite one. When the campaign ends, we'll ask for your station's frequency & call letters, and will tune your Public Radio to that station before it ships.\nThe Public Radio is secured in place with the Mason jar's screw-on ring. The telescoping antenna screws through the lid, and batteries are accessed by removing the radio and installing them inside.\nTech Details\nAt the heart of The Public Radio is a Silicon Labs Si4831 FM IC. Its output is passed through a Texas Instruments TPA2005D1 class D amplifier which drives a 4 ohm 1.25\u201d speaker by Dayton Audio. The Public Radio is built on sturdy FR-4 printed circuit board, and houses a couple custom components, including a switched audio taper potentiometer and a seven segment telescoping antenna. The entire assembly is sandwiched together with our stamped stainless steel lid.\nWe spent a lot of time trying different assembly configurations and hardware specs. If you've got a hankering for details, shoot us a note - we're happy to geek out about it :) You're also welcome to check out our GitHub page, which has open-source versions of our EagleCAD files.\nSo... Why a Mason jar?\nHonestly? It was an accident. At first, we imagined an enclosure with a more contemporary aesthetic. But we needed to evaluate speakers in the meantime, and used a jar and a piece of cardboard as a stand-in. After trying it for an afternoon, we realized that it was just more fun to use something that was *literally* on our shelves.\nThe standard version of The Public Radio comes with its own 250mL square (ish) Ball jar, but you can swap the hardware out into any wide-mouth jar that you like.\nProject History\nWe've been working hard on the Public Radio for the past eighteen months, iterating our designs and building on feedback we received from our beta launch on Grand St. We've gone through seven PCB revisions to date, and have learned a *ton* about FM reception and circuit design in the process.\nFor the last three months we have researched, designed and ordered a handful of the custom parts necessary to make a small production run of The Public Radio. This includes the radio's custom potentiometer and antenna, both of which we received this June. We've also spent countless hours poring over our bill of materials, searching for ways to drop costs - and have researched & vetted our supply chain along the way. \nSome of the radio's hardware components (such as the custom lid) require big setup fees, and we need your help to cover them. Support the project by pre-ordering your own Public Radio and help make this a reality!\nWho we are\nWe're Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright, two childhood friends now living in Brooklyn. We ran around together as kids, and then went on to be hardware design, project management, and audio aficionados. After taking MIT's circuits & electronics class, we started hacking together on weekends, and eventually came up with a fun, compelling idea - that we finally had the skills to complete. \nWe had *tons* of engineering help from Todd Bailey and Andy Warner. Special thanks to Alexis Arkus-Duntov, Jonathan Bobrow, and Daniel Fishkin for their concepting help, and to Colin Reilly for cinematography. \nWe also couldn't have gotten this far without the help of our beta testers - thanks to Robert K, Ross W, Kristen S, Elana O, Harry J, Shawn F, Tracy L, Greg A, Ada P, Jacob C, Robert C, Paula P, Janna L, Cheryl R, Linnea J, Saralyn C, Robert L, and Henry L!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident with our mechanical and electrical design, but some logistical questions remain. Foremost in our minds is building a system that allows us to tune and then track unique radios to each of our backers as they come off of the production line. It'll be a bit tricky, but our fabrication partners are aware of the issue and have a preliminary plan to deal with it.\n\nWe're also anticipating some work in the management of vendors and manufacturers of our custom parts. We have parts coming from about a half dozen suppliers, and tracking their progress and dependencies will be a full-time job. But we've managed jobs of greater complexity before, and ultimately this will not be an impossible task. \n\nAnother expense (and logistical hurdle) will be the FCC tests that we're subject to. These will cost a few thousand dollars and will inevitably require a bit of effort and management. But ultimately, our production and testing partners are well-versed in this territory (and the specifications we need to pass are relatively easy), so we feel confident that it won't be a major issue.\n\nWe also need to find a clever use for all of the standard Mason jar lids that will come with the Public Radio's jars. We'll probably end up using them to make pickles, and there's always the chance that we ship out jars of those instead of the radios... but we're pretty sure we can keep them straight ;)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Holiday sale + an open report on The Public Radio's operations", "update_content": "Friends-\nOn this Cyber Monday - really the most American of holidays - we've got two things to share with you.\nFirst, one that should be a pleasant surprise: For everyone (you!!) who backed our first Kickstarter campaign, we're offering a whopping 35% off all orders when you use the offer code \"LONGTIMEMONOGAMIST\" at checkout on our website: thepublicrad.io/purchase\nSecond, and perhaps less expected: As part of our ongoing effort to bring transparency to our operations, we published , as well as on our end.

When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

Unfortunately the typical designs are extremely outdated and until now the best skillets have all been antiques.\nThe US produced the finest cast iron cookware in the world before space age aluminum pans took over. FINEX\u00ae is now making heirloom quality cast iron cookware in America for the first time in over half a century!\nA Modern Heirloom Quality Skillet in Every Kitchen\nFINEX is a completely new approach to the traditional cast iron skillet. Typical skillets have a handle that is pretty much designed to burn you - they are flat and narrow and get just as hot as the pan.\nThe FINEX skillet has an ergonomic \"Speed Cool\" polished stainless steel spring handle with a brass cap for easy hanging. The spring design allows the handle to cool much quicker than a standard skillet and it's shaped to fit the natural curve of your hand.\nErgonomic \"Speed Cool\" Spring Handle\nTypical skillets are just too rough and food sticks to rough surfaces.\nThe FINEX skillet has an ultra-smooth computer machined easy release cooking surface.\nCNC Machined Easy Release Cooking Surface\nNo other skillet on the market has this feature and it's one of the reasons antique skillets are so sought after - they are finally smooth after decades of use. Yours is smooth out of the box.\nAnother Smooth Move\nTypical skillets are awkward to pour from when loaded with food.\nThe FINEX skillet has our patented octagonal \"Multi-Pour\" design for 6 pouring directions. This distinctive shape creates natural angles and even makes it easier to slide a spatula under your food when cooking.\nPatented Octagonal \"Multi-Pour\" Design\nJust Like Its 12\" Big Brother\nOur 8\" FINEX skillet is lighter but no lightweight in the kitchen. It has all of the benefits of our 12\" skillet in a more compact size. The outer diameter of this 8\" skillet is 8.75\" from rim to rim.\nDialing in the CAD Model Before 3D Printing\nThis is your perfect everyday skillet and the design will make you want to give one to all your friends and family members to share the joy of cast iron cooking.\nCarefully Assembling the 3D Printed Prototype\nOur 1st skillet, the ultra-smooth 12\" FINEX shown below with the 8\" 3D printed prototype for comparison, was a runaway success on Kickstarter last winter with over 1,500 backers.\n2/3 as Big with 100% of the Performance\nThousands of FINEX No.12s are now in use around the world doing what cast iron does best - perfectly searing, grilling and saut\u00e9ing your families favorite foods.\nThe Iconic FINEX No. 12 (Included for $240 Pledge!)\nBut Where Can I Place My Hot New FINEX Skillet?\nOur team has your back, so we created this beautiful, laser-cut American cherry wood trivet to showcase the exceptionally clean and timeless FINEX logo created by iconic graphic designer Aaron Draplin.\nCherry Wood Trivet Dimensions: 8\" wide x 8\" tall x .5\" thick.\nFunctional art for your wall or table - this cherry wood finished trivet has precision laser cut detail, cushioned feet and is available in limited numbers for a $35 pledge.\nThe 12\" FINEX Cast Iron Lid is Coming Soon!\nTesting the 12\" Cast Iron Lid Prototype\nAre You Cast Iron Crazy?\nNo doubt about it! I'm passionate about cast iron because every pan tells a story. Each skillet holds an entire history of meals and memories. 20 years, 30 years, even just one year, all imbued with flavors, experiments, laughter and conversations. Your history is built one meal at a time and it deserves to be made in a premium American skillet.\nBy pledging towards the innovative 8\" FINEX skillet you'll personally bring heirloom quality cast iron cookware back to America.

In order to give you precise and sharable wind readings on the spot, we created the first Vaavud wind meter and launched it here on Kickstarter. People loved it!\nNow we are back to launch the world's first handheld wind meter that actually measures wind direction, as well as of course wind speed.\nThis is made possible by our unique asymmetrical rotor design (for further details scroll down to the technical stuff).\nWe have gone through countless iterations on the rotor design and we have obsessed about every little line and detail, to make sure that both performance and looks are second to none.\nThe Vaavud app\nThe new device will work with the popular Vaavud app, which features the world's first real-time graph on a handheld wind meter; a global live map; your personal measurement history and much more to come.\n              Device compatibility\nCurrently we have confirmed the new device to work with the following phones and tablets, and the list keeps growing!\n\n*iPods do not have a compass, so on those the app will show wind speed, but not wind direction\nTimeline\nWe are working towards a shipping date in November 2014, and so far all is set to achieve that target\nRewards\nStretch goals\nColour choice: The third colour will be the one that gets the most votes from all backers, once the campaign is over. More info on this will follow when we get there\nMount + data export: The mount will be printable on most common 3D printers, and will be designed to work with a standard jack-stick extender cable. The design files will be made available, so you can do all the modifications you want to. The data export feature will upload a time series for each measurement as a CSV file to a dropbox folder of your choice\nSpecial carry case: This will be a neoprene hard case similar to the ones known from Oakley sunglasses etc. but tailor made to the Vaavud wind meter. We are quite happy with the current neoprene bags, but this will be something special; a snug fitting, robust, exclusive case made just for your Vaavud V2.0\nWelcome on board!\nOur Kickstarter legacy\nComments from backers and press about our first Kickstarter campaign\nThe technical stuff\nWe are using an optical sensor that measures 40.000 times per second, so we can detect even the slightest variation in rotation speed. By making the rotor of the wind meter slightly asymmetrical we get it to accelerate a bit when the largest part is hit by the wind. We can then compare the point with the highest speed to the compass direction and derive the wind direction. At the same time, data from the highly accurate sensor can be used to derive the average rotation speed and thereby the wind speed.\nThe graph below shows the change in velocity during one full rotation for one of our prototypes. For this one the difference in speed is a bit more than 3%, and the maximum speed is reached at about 45 degrees from start.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny hardware project faces risks - there is no denying that. But we are at a point, where we have eliminated practically all technical risks, so now it is a matter of getting the final design details in place, source the components, and get production started.\n\nThings can of course get delayed in the production process, because rework is needed after seeing the initial production samples, or because a component from a sub-supplier is delayed or turns out not to be in the right quality etc. etc. etc.\n\nHowever, we learned a lot from launching our first product here on Kickstarter. It went pretty smooth, but we can also see lots of big and small things that we can improve. Furthermore we have teamed up with a great design & engineering company here in Denmark, to help us with finding and managing suppliers - something they have a lot of experience with.

My friend Joe, from Scout Leather Co., has been telling me for months that I should make a top. My response was always, \"I make tools, not toys.\" But I was intrigued. Who doesn't like tops, right? \nOne afternoon I had a few hours to play around on the lathe. I had no plan, I was just cutting a top free-hand on the lathe. No measurements, no design drawings. Instead of cutting a cone for the tip, I dug around in an old project box and came up with a ruby sphere I bought for another job. The first time I spun the top it was obvious that I created something totally different in performance and physics from anything I had seen before. \nI showed the prototype to a few people and the most common response was, \"Wait, it's still spinning? Are you sure? It doesn't look like it's moving.There is no way it's still spinning.\" No one else had seen anything like it either. I thought that was pretty awesome, and I believe awesome is worth sharing. \nIf you know my work, you know I don't mess around. The Lambda is not intended to be a record breaker, but rather an expression of how I see the world: the ideal balance of performance, physics, and aesthetics. However, you are going to have a really hard time finding something is the same size/weight class that will outspin this top. \nEnough chit chat; I present the Prometheus Lambda top.\nYes this is a video...it's not a still image! If you stared at it for a few seconds and then said \"woaaah,\" we are on the same page. Welcome to my project :) \nThe secret ingredient (beyond a solid design based on Newton and \"the physics\") is the instrument-grade ruby sphere. You heard me right, I said ruby. \nThis type of manufactured ruby is used in things like Rolex watches, super-precision measuring instruments, fiber optic transmission lines, and other really expensive and/or sciency stuff. The hardness is 9 on the Mohs scale. Diamond is one of the few harder materials and scores a perfect 10. That alone is awesome! \nFrom the manufacturer: \"This material has five times more abrasion resistance than carbide, zero porosity, high temperature tolerance, extreme chemical resistance, and extreme hardness.\"\nI know, I know. How tough is it? THIS tough. \nThat's a ruby smashed between the steel top of my bench-vise and a 16oz. dead blow hammer. Yes, I hit it really hard. Yes, it did break. It's tough...not indestructible. Just treat it like a ruby and you should be fine. If you treat it irresponsibly...it will break, as demonstrated above :) \nSphericity: \nThe \"sphericity\" of the Lambda's Grade 25 ruby is 25 millionths of an inch. Take an inch. Divide it into one million (1,000,000) slices. The amount of error is less than 25 slices...out of a million. The majority of machined parts are manufactured to within about 0.001 inches. I created the chart below to make blowing your mind easier on your brain. \nYes, I know that's not \"perfectly\" round, but it makes for good reading right?\nSurface Smoothness:\nBelow is an electron micro-graph that will give you a reasonable comparison between a metal \"machined\" surface and the surface of an instrument ruby. The image on the left is the ground edge of a razor blade. This is probably a much smoother finish that you will see with machining. However, compared to the surface of a ruby sphere at the same scale, it looks like the Grand Canyon. \nLet's agree to call it a cone. A cone isn't a very good shape for the contact point because you are always on one side of the point...or the other. This means the top will have a hard time balancing upright, wasting energy during the early spin, and then falling over early during the late spin when the top is losing RPM. It's inherently imprecise. \nThe perfect sphere means there is always a perfect point of contact with the surface, wasting less energy and spinning longer. It also means the Lambda is better able to spin along its axis; therefore, it does not exhibit the large amount of precession (angular wobble) that you see in a traditional top (above). \nThe Lambda name is derived from the Greek letter \"L\" which is the physics symbol for angular momentum; the Newtonian principle that keeps a top from falling over. I'm not a physicist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express at some point during college. Here we go: \nANGULAR MOMENTUM (L) = RADIUS (MASS x VELOCITY)\nThis equation is all you need to know about tops. For a given top, the size (radius) and weight (mass) are fixed, so your only variable is velocity. If you want more spin, you need more speed. How fast can you spin it? \nThe (major) factors that reduce spin time are friction and the geometry between the top's \"contact point\" and the target surface. You get to pick the surface, but I get to pick the contact point :)\nPOLAR MOMENT OF INERTIA (Ip) = p(r)r^2dV\nDon't sweat the details. That just means a unique feature of the Lambda is the use of 2 different materials in the design. It looks awesome and it increases performance. \n6061 aluminum is used for the spindle to decrease the polar moment of inertia...in other words, reducing the amount of force it takes to get the top up to a given velocity. If you remember, the more velocity the more angular momentum...and a longer spin time. \nSolid brass is heavy, really heavy. It also machines beautifully. If you recall, mass is another important component to angular momentum, making brass an ideal material for the outer ring. \nIt depends...on a lot of different factors. How long \"will\" it spin is entirely up to you. How long \"can\" it spin is entirely unknown. My personal record (unofficial) is over 12 minutes. Check out the video below for a \"bar-setting\" unedited 10 minute spin. \nCan you beat me? It's gotta be on video! Submit your \"video response\" to my 10 min spin on the YouTube page (link) !  \nYour spin-time can (and will) vary. However, I'll leave you with the guesstimates below. These are based on my personal experience, and observation of other people testing the Lambda. If you can't seem to hit the numbers below, give it a little more \"wax on, wax off!\" That means \"practice\" in case The Karate Kid was after your time. Not the new one, the old one :) \n6 Minutes: Most people should be able to hit this without trying too hard. You have to have a good surface where the top can actually stay on it for that long. Try a plate or bowl to keep your top from falling off the table. \n8 Minutes: Put in a little practice and 8 minutes can be reached...some of the time. This was the first big milestone. To go past 8 minutes you have to have a good surface...and good technique. At this point I can break 8 minutes almost every time. \n10+ Minutes: If you practice a lot, you'll start seeing spins over 10 minutes...but that is very hard to do. Even now, I might get 1 out of 5 spins that are over 10 minutes. \nJust keep in mind that trying for a long spin is one way to enjoy your Lambda, but it's not the only way! \nI tested a lot of different surfaces in search of the best one. I tried marble slabs, granite surface plates, glass dinner plates, ceramic bowls, various mirrors, optical lenses, and chemistry lab glass.\nThe Lambda may spin for so long that you won't have a flat enough surface unless you work in a laboratory or machine shop. After a couple minutes it will \"drift\" and eventually fall off the edge. The best thing to use is any kind of concave dish. However, I had a hard time finding anything in my kitchen where the center of the plate/bowl was actually the lowest part. Most had a raised or uneven area in the middle and this throws off the top. \nRight now my favorite surface is a little 5\" shaving mirror (12x magnification) that you can buy from Amazon. It's a reasonable size, is fairly durable (for a mirror) and has a flat back so you can set it on a table. The smooth curve of the mirror means you don't need a perfectly flat surface, the top will naturally find the lowest point. \nYep, I'm making this one easy for you: one reward. \nI could type out a long explanation, but I won't bore you. The bottom line is, all things considered, I think this is the best way to make a top. Any less would be too little. Any more would be too much. \nIn the words of architect Owen Jones, \"true beauty results from that repose which the mind feels when the eye, the intellect, and the affections are satisfied from the absence of any want.\"\nFulfillment requires that you use BackerKit: \nAs with my other two projects, I'm using a platform called Backerkit to manage the fulfillment process. Participation is not mandatory...but greatly appreciated :) My experience demonstrates that Backerkit is a critical tool in delivering the right reward to the right person at the right time. \nYou may choose to opt out of Backerkit, but it may delay the delivery of your reward. Fulfillment and data tracking is exceedingly difficult on a large project. Manually managing contact information is time consuming. This is time spent at the computer and not in the shop making tops or shipping them out. It will also hurt other backers because of the same reason. \nYou'll be asked to confirm your pledge information and provide your shipping address through BackerKit. It also puts you in control of your pledge by allowing you to manage your own order quantity and shipping address. \nYou will not receive a Kickstarter survey requesting this information. \nWant more than one top? You are awesome!  \nI'm happy to accommodate. Remember BackerKit? When the campaign ends you will receive your BackerKit invite. When you accept the invitation you'll have the opportunity to add more tops to your pledge, at the level you pledged. *** \nKickstarter does not allow project creators to offer \"multiples of the same item\" during the campaign. I know, people do it all the time. I'm just not the kind of person who is willing to be dishonest in order to make a buck. So...that's why I'm not offering multiples in the KS campaign, but you can modify your pledge after the campaign ends, via BackerKit.  \nAlso, if you opt out of Backerkit, you will not have the option to modify your reward quantities. \n*** Please note: the \"Tops for Pops\" reward tier is limited to one top per backer. TfP backers will have the option to add other tops at the \"early bird\" reward tier. \nPlease keep the weight and diameter in mind when comparing tops. Ignoring other factors, increasing the mass and/or diameter will increase the potential spin time. That's just physics. A big top will spin longer than a small one. A heavier top will spin longer than a light one. \nMaterials: Brass ring, aluminum spindle, ruby tip\nSome of the photos show a black ring. This was an early prototype and not offered as an option. \nMy prototype tops are manually machined on my Hardinge HLV-H toolroom lathe. Check out the video below for a quick montage of making the very first Lambda top. \nFor the Kickstarter project, the Lambda top will be made in-house on the Haas CNC lathe I purchased with the funds from my first KS campaign. All of the raw materials, including the instrument-rubies, are domestically manufactured. \nThe following schedule is an estimate, it is not a guarantee. \nIn manufacturing, there is always a chance for unexpected delay. In fact, you should expect it to happen. In the past I have dealt with this by doing my best and communicating early and often. No one is forcing you to back this project, so I consider your pledge an agreement (on my end) that I will \"do my best\" and that (on your end) you'll be okay with that. \nPlease see the \"risks and challenges\" section for more detail on production and scheduling. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge with this project is meeting the Father's Day deadline for the first 100 tops. That schedule is exceedingly ambitious so I can't guarantee delivery, but I'll try my hardest. I've already purchased (out of pocket) all of the specialized tooling and materials to run the first 250 tops...including 250 instrument rubies. \n\nProduction will begin almost as soon as the campaign goes live. I will not wait until the campaign ends. This is one big advantage of doing all the work myself and in-house. \n\nHowever, there will only be about 2 weeks from the campaign close until Father's Day. Normally any campaign takes about 30 days before shipping begins. 2 weeks to process all the payments and 2 weeks to deal with sending/collecting surveys. \n\nI \"think\" we can get the first 100 shipped by June 7 (this only applies to the \"Tops for Pops\" reward tier) if you help me with three things: \n\n1) Make sure your credit card is in good standing\n2) Fill out the survey immediately when you get it...probably 2 days after the close of the campaign. I will post an update letting you know when the invites have been sent. The invite will be emailed directly to you. Please check your spam folder. Spam folders LOVE to eat critical Kickstarter messages. \n3) Double check the mailing address you give me (like Santa does). You'd be surprised at how many people mess this up! Well, I'm surprised at least ;) \n\nThe backup plan (or for those that don't make the \"Tops for Pops\" tier) is a gift card (PDF) that you can print out, stick in an envelope, and deliver with a ceremonial flourish to your Dad on Father's Day.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Check out my latest campaign: Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen :-)", "update_content": "Good day previous backers! \nIn case you're not following me on social or thru the newsletter I wanted to let you know about my most recent campaign for this Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen.

Maha Yodha is simple to learn yet has a lot of strategic depth, making it interesting for both new and seasoned gamers.\nBy unlocking these ancient Indian stories and unleashing these warriors of yore, we have created a strategic card game with an unique theme, that is both brand new and several millennia old.\nA video review of Maha Yodha\nWhat are reviewers saying?\n\"Maha Yodha is an excellent two-player game. It breaks new ground with the theme, and it is easy to learn... If you're looking for a two-player card game, Maha Yodha is worth trying\" - Jonathan H. Liu, Geek Dad\n\"Maha Yodha is the first card game I've seen in a year or three on which I actually want to spend some money\" - Matt Drake, Drake's Flames\n\"The cards are beautiful, and the artwork is stunning. I haven\u2019t really seen anything like it before, and this theme could really put this game on the map. Of course a pretty face isn\u2019t everything, so how does it play? One word. Awesome.\" - Robert Kalajian, Purple Pawn\n\"Maha Yodha has a fascinating and unique theme, with card work that is beautiful and gorgeous! It's a solid and interesting game!\" - Doug and Shelley Garrett, Garrett's Games and Geekiness\n\"Maha Yodha is a 2 player card game with some familiar (and some not so familiar) mechanics that plays in 20-30 minutes and is very easy to learn, with stunningly beautiful artwork and fun history and facts.\" - James Campbell, I Will Never Grow Up Gaming\n\"The game required a lot of advanced strategy that I found challenging at times, despite my experience.

During the day he works as a social enterprise consultant, but after dark he moonlights by helping Maha Yodha get to market and monitoring our finances and project timelines.\nFinally, we have Sarada who is helping us with keeping track of our finances and providing management support to our Kickstarter campaign.\nWe also have an energetic team of friends and family helping us to dot the  i(s) and cross the t(s). \nAgent Maha Yodha\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've invested our savings into game design, prototype printing & creating sample artwork for the game. Most of the artwork for the base set is complete. With the funding goal achieved we will be able to complete the artwork and take the idea to production.\nFor us, Kickstarter isn\u2019t just about the funds, but very much also about the community. We are hoping to make Maha Yodha a truly crowd-sourced game in terms of content and gameplay too. \nHindu mythology is a storehouse of hundreds of characters and stories. We will be honest.

We have tied up with a fabulous local outfit, Parksons CartaMundi (http://www.parksonsgames.com/) in Mumbai, India, to help us manufacture the game. This outfit is one of largest playing card manufacturers in the world and as it is also local, we will be able to oversee the production process and iron out any kinks quickly.\n\nOur t-shirt vendor sources blanks from India's foremost Fairtrade cotton sourcer, Shop For Change (http://www.shopforchange.in/) that works directly with over 6000 small and marginal farmers in a sustainable manner (http://www.shopforchange.in/Aboutus_5.asp), so we're very confident that we will not have any issues in sourcing all the t-shirts required and that the t-shirts are ethically sourced.\n\nFinally, all the original handmade Pattachitra artworks are produced by clusters of artisan families in a few villages in Odisha. These artisans have been producing Pattachitra through generations, using only natural colours and handmade cotton canvas.

Most people have never tasted the exquisite flavor of an In-shell Scrambled Egg. \n'Golden Eggs' can be enjoyed hard or soft boiled, deviled or in egg salad, fried, pickled, atop noodles, or as a surprise on Easter Sunday. There are many preparations yet to be discovered, perhaps you will be the first to invent a new recipe?\nGolden eggs are known to be a delicacy, but you'll have trouble finding a restaurant serving them and there are no utensils designed to create Golden Eggs... until now!  \nIntroducing the Golden Goose\nThe Golden 'Goose' is a low-tech, hand-powered kitchen gadget. It has been meticulously designed and tested to smoothly scramble the contents of a shell egg. The device uses \u2018centrifugal force\u2019 to scramble an egg without breaking the shell.\nIt works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth. This mixes the white and yolk inside the egg-shell without introducing outside air. It is easily used at any angle. The flavor profile is fresh and delicious, and there is no 'whipping' or bowl needed if you enjoy scrambled eggs on the stove.\nThe Goose was developed with the home cook in mind, but can just as easily be used by anyone. In fact, some users have suggested it's a good way to store scrambled eggs in a restaurant kitchen.\nCreating with the Goose\nWe've made some delicious treats and shared them to the amazement of our friends.\nI had never eaten soft boiled eggs until now.\nIf you're feeling creative, you can substitute golden eggs anywhere regular hard boiled eggs used to be.\nI think we might actually be the first folks to eat a fried golden egg!\nGolden eggs go nicely with salads too...\nBut let's switch gears and talk about how we arrived at the final Goose design.\nDetails of the Goose:\nThe Goose features lightweight & recyclable materials, comfortable handles, and the highest quality 1/8\u201d\u201d abrasion resistant cordage system. The Goose main shell is hinged during manufacturing, as part of the Polypropylene shell, to provide ease of use and keep the halves together. The ring turns 12 degrees to securely lock the shell together with an audible 'click'. The Goose features an elastic food-safe & dishwasher-safe 'egg cradle' designed to fit the variable sizes and shapes of eggs. It features specially designed fins to balance the egg and adjust the center of gravity providing smooth and efficient motion.\nWe never intended to develop a Goose. In fact, when we first heard that it was possible to scramble an egg in its shell, we were so curious that we stayed up until 4-am breaking every egg in sight. \nThe following day I was reminded of an old Victorian Era toy that rotates back and forth, so I stole the shoelaces from my tennis shoes and combined them with a plastic jar to create the first rough prototype.\nWe knew there had to be a better way for us to make Golden Eggs without struggling, and that\u2019s when Y Line Product Design hatched a plan to create The Golden Goose!\nThe design process took months of careful exploration and testing. We did loads of sketches and built functional and aesthetic models by hand and on the computer.\nSome of the prototypes worked better than others, so we incorporated the use of computer aided modeling and 3D printing to refine our performance criteria and eliminate unnecessary features. We eventually dialed-in the performance, feel, and look of the Goose.\nThe Goose is designed to be effective, and easy to use:\n It only takes a minute to learn, and even kids like doing it.\nNest an egg in the cradle\nClose and turn the ring until you hear a click\nSwing, then pull the handles to spin it until you hear the egg scramble\nPurpose:\nThe Goose is for Fun. It\u2019s not going to change the world. The Goose is a kitchen utensil that empowers the user to create new recipes, and hopefully creates unique and enjoyable experiences. \nIt would be cheaper to manufacture with other materials, but we chose Polypropylene, Nylon, and TPE because they meet our criteria, and are recyclable.\nThe Goose is easily assembled & disassembled. This means that we save cost and energy in the making of a Goose. We did extra work to ensure it can be easily taken apart so folks could wash or replace parts easily. We hope that users will be empowered to recycle the Goose many years from now when it reaches the end of its life cycle.\nThe Rewards:\nHonkers: Pledge $10 or more\nDon\u2019t need any more kitchen gadgets, but still curious?

He is an innovator with more than 15 years of experience in the Design field. In his professional career he contributed to more than 60 Design and Utility Patents. His work is awarded, and featured in the press, blogs, magazines, for sale, and in homes.\n-\"It has been hard work and long hours, but anybody who is curious at heart is going to have fun!\"\nI've recently \u2018hung a shingle\u2019 in Chicago with the introduction of a small design studio, Y Line Product Design. In my 'free time' I'm a 3D printing enthusiast, so I want to share the Goose with other enthusiasts. That's why we are offering, as a reward, the option to download and print your own Goose!\nMore on the egg itself:\nWhat does it taste like?\nThe short answer is \u2018scrambled\u2019, but that\u2019s not entirely accurate. The flavor is rich and subtle. If you are a fan of eggs, and a fan of scrambled eggs, then there is no better way to enjoy them. The science behind it is based on how proteins and fats react to each other inside of the egg without the intrusion of outside air.\n\nThe texture is silky, and depending on how long you boil, or at what temperature, you can create a range of flavors and characteristics. In addition, it is a great way to scramble eggs without dirtying a whisk and bowl, and golden eggs poured directly into the frying pan taste better than any scrambled eggs you've ever had...\nHow else can I prepare a Golden Egg?\nKnown methods include hard-boiled, soft boiled, deviled, scrambled, egg salads, Scotched, served with Ramen Noodles... and so on...but there are dishes yet to be discovered by the intrepid explorer!\nOK, so how do we produce it?\nThe Golden Goose is not a product, so we have to make it a reality by investing in manufacturing tools & materials. We need to fund both the manufacturing and assembly of each Goose. The design is finalized, and we have quotes from manufacturers domestically and in Asia. The plan is to mold the Goose parts in Asia and assemble them in the US.\nHere is a breakdown of our target time-line:\nJune: Pilot production samples and proofs\nMid-June: Shipping schedule and assembly procedure\nJuly: Travel to factory for pre-production confirmation\nMid-July: Final samples approved\nAugust: Pilot Production run\nMid-August: Shipping to US\nSeptember: Product received & Assembled - Bumps receive rewards!\nMid-September: First production run rewards shipped\nEarly October or Late September: Second production run rewards shipped\nThese are general targets for production and shipping, but we will get the rewards to you sooner if possible. All non-manufactured rewards will ship ASAP. \nEither way you slice it, your donation will help us achieve a concrete goal, and you will be rewarded with gold!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is the world\u2019s most successful funding platform, but that doesn't mean there aren't inherent risks involved in a project. \n\nNothing is for certain, but I can guarantee that there are experienced and smart people working to make the Goose project a success. \n\nInjection molding is far from an exotic manufacturing technique, and our design has been carefully crafted to be produced efficiently and assembled quickly and easily.\n\nAs we encounter challenges or setbacks we will address them methodically and creatively. When we reach our funding goal, we are going to do everything humanly possible to ensure the Goose takes flight!\n\n8 Iterative rounds of prototyping and design refinement have culminated into the production ready model. We have secured competitive bids from two of the largest and most reliable manufacturers in Asia, and we have been promised lead times of 40 days or less.\n\nThe parts produced will be made from high quality materials.\n\nWe will confirm our pilot models prior to committing to production, and I will personally inspect the production samples for quality before committing to manufacturing the rewards.\n\nWe'll package your Goose with care, and maximize the density of Geese for shipping to further reduce fuel use and our environmental footprint.\n\nY Line Product Design has invested a great deal of time and energy into the development of the Goose.

Desire of keeping beautiful empty glass bottles to make a second use of them made us start working on this idea. To begin with, we did some research and found out that bottles can be cut. As this idea caught our eyes, we started to experiment with it. Lots of damaged bottles and different prototypes were made until we got to the point, where we had a useful bottle cutting tool. After showing it around and giving to some people handmade gifts, made from old bottles, we were ensured by others that this could be something more than just a home project for ourselves. We did some improvements on the technical and visual side and now the C&C Bottle Cutter is ready to meet the crowd. To make it as successful as possible,  we are asking your help and support to start manufacturing. We are really excited to share it with you here, on Kickstarter.\nC&C is a glass bottle cutter, which is designed to cut any diameter bottle super easy, fast and precisely at home.\nWith C&C you can create glasses, vases, candlesticks, lamp pendants, ashtrays and even aquariums.\nC&C is made from durable laser cut plywood. Precision of laser cutting guarantees the strength to all connections of plywood parts. After laser cutting, parts get hand sanded or stained brown. Both options provide a beautiful finish. Then assembled together with a custom made cutter and screws. \nOur first prototype was made only for one reason - to ensure that the glass bottles could be cut. Actually, it worked way better than it looks - even with non-adjustable cutter blade position, we were able to cut bottles. \nOf course, in the beginning there were many failures, so we decided to create another design - with adjustable cutter blade positions. Our second prototype already was drawn on SolidWorks and plywood parts were laser cut. It was way better in the sense of cutting, but still with some flaws. The design was not as good, as we expected it to be, so we set up a new goal - the bottle cutter not only should cut perfectly, but also should be a perfect bottle holder. We made completely new aesthetic design and improved technical performance. After some last corrections we are finally ready for production.\nThere have been bottle cutters out in the market before, so why should anyone need exactly C&C? This was the main question that we asked for ourselves, when creating our product. We did a research and found out that non of them is perfect. Our goal was to make it as handy and perfect as possible, so this is what we got:\nComparing with other bottle cutters, that can cut only standard diameter bottles, with C&C you can cut starting from very small diameter bottle necks up until  3L jars. In addition to that, you can adjust the cutter length and keep it for the next bottle, for example, to create sets of equal glasses.\nComparing with other bottle cutters with only one cutter blade, you won't need to worry about buying new ones for a long time.\nC&C does not only work perfectly, but it also looks great. Comparing with other bottle cutters, that can be used only for cutting, C&C works also as a beautiful wooden bottle stand. Different color variations are available.\nWith a single screw you can adjust the lenght of the cutter. You don\u2019t need to fit in the bottle somewhere, just put it on the C&C and it\u2019s ready to use. All step by step instructions how to use the C&C are added.\nWhat you should know is that the C&C does not actually cut the bottle. It creates a score line on the bottle at the exact place where you need it to be split. By adding boiling and ice cold water, a thermal shock is caused and the bottle is split.  \nIt takes only three steps to cut a bottle: \nTake a round bottle and simply put it on the C&C like it is shown on our campaign video and instruction. Adjust the cutter to the place where you want the bottle to be split. Make one full circle by slowly rotating the bottle and keeping it in place. Do not add too much force. You should hear the glass cutter scratching the line. The score line should be slightly seen and continuous.\n Slowly pour boiling water on the score line, then the ice cold water from the faucet. This action will cause the bottle to crack along the score line. Bottle may split at the first try, but it is possible that you might have to do it again, depending on the thickness of the glass. Better to add smaller amount of water many times than trying to do it with the first try and spoiling the glass. The water is supposed to get only on the score line and a bit around it. The rubber ring, included in the kit, helps to do that.\nAfter splitting the bottle there is a sharp edge on both halves. Finish the sharp glass edge by using sandpaper. There are three different grit size sandpapers included in the kit (60, 120, 180). You should start with 60 grit sandpaper, that will remove the sharp edge fast. For smoother result use 120 and 180 grit sandpaper. After using the 180 grit sandpaper the edge is perfectly smooth for simple use. If you still want it smoother, you can buy higher grit sandpaper in any local store.\nBy supporting us and using C&C, you are helping the environment. Extend the life of glass bottles by creating new accessories, lamps and many other things instead of throwing them out. Give a second chance to empty bottles and jars.\nIt all started just as an idea of making some random glasses from empty bottles. By experimenting with C&C our team created a lot more. Get inspired!\n\n \nAlso instructions and tips are included.\n\nYour pledge makes everything possible. 100% of the money raised will go towards the first production run of the C&C. Back our project and help us to meet minimum production requirements.\nYou can take a part in our project simply by sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest etc. It will mean a lot to us.

Jeans made using these materials, craftsmanship and quality often cost hundreds of dollars, even when mass produced overseas.\n\n2 - A smarter way to shop. Why pick from the pile no one else wants like in a store - or pay extra for the ones they made but aren't going to be able to sell - when you could have a custom pair made just for you!\n\n3 - A better way to manufacture - right here in the USA! By retooling our American denim factory for this kind of bespoke making, we can shorten the supply chain, add value, and build a stronger connection between buyers and makers all at once. \n\n4 - A game changer. No more competing with fast fashion. Let's slow down, make things worth keeping, back them with a better level of service and change the game!\n\n5 - Backed with our BONUS BUY-BACK PROGRAM.\nBecause jeans like these are engineered to get better with time, if after a year of wear, you decide you'd rather have a new pair, we'll credit you back 50% of what you paid towards the new ones when you send the old ones back. \nWhy? Jeans like this actually increase in value when properly worn in! It would be our pleasure to find them a new home.\n==============================================================\nJeans like this, even bought off the shelf and/or made overseas routinely cost $200+. These guys are made in New York's oldest jeans factories using only the highest grade materials.\nHow do we do it for so much less without cutting corners? \nBy eliminating waste in our supply chain, there's no more picking from the pile no one else wanted like in a store, and you're not paying more to help cover the costs of the ones we make but can't sell either. It's a smarter way to shop and a better way to make things. \nBest of all, these are your jeans not ours, made just the way you love them all the way down to the smallest of details. \nFor now, we're featuring 3 incredible selvedges: Cone White Oak 13.5 oz 1968 Indigo Memphis made at Cone's world famous White Oak mill in Greensboro, NC. Cone White Oak 13.2 oz W966 Black made at Cone's world famous White Oak mill in Greensboro, NC. Kuroki 12.9 oz Jetsetter Gray imported from Japan where the finest \"novelty\" selvedges of this nature are made.\nBONUS: We've just got the very last shipment of Cone's 12.75oz Natural selvedge that will ever be produced. Once it's gone, it's gone. Because of the limited supply, only 400 pairs are being made available at this time. It's a unique product, with a red, natural and blue edge, that's going to make for a truly incredible pair of jeans you're going to love.\nWhat is selvedge denim? High quality selvedge denim like the ones we're offering are made on narrow vintage shuttle-looms and feature continuous yarn construction. It makes for a tighter weave, finished at both edges with a contrasting stripe that jeans enthusiasts prize.\nWhat makes it better? Raw selvedge, like we're offering, takes less maintenance (we encourage you to go months before your first washing and, even then, months or years between there-after) as the denim will stretch, mold and contort to your body more and more with every step getting better with age. Creases at the back of the knees and just below the front pockets greet you like old friends.\nHow will I know which fit will fit me best? Never you fear; while we're asking you to select your denim now (so we can get the mills spun-up) we'll send you all of the info, measurements, and pictures needed to find your perfect fit when it comes time to order after the funding period closes. \nWhat sizes will be available?\nFor men, we're offering a huge spread, so even the hardest to fit guy will find his perfect match.

Super bold. Super unique. The unique hand-feel of rubber over top of metal is something you're going to love.\nThe Raw Split Hide -As your denim changes, so too will your untreated leather patch, picking up a patina that tells the story of where you've been. This is the standard; Let us do the picking and this is what you'll get. Customers selecting \"extra custom\" could have this, or the other options. \nGunmetal Gray- A modern elephant gray made of fine top-grain leather. \nBurnt Orange - A bold orang-y high brown made of fine top-grain leather. \nDeep Brown - The timeless standard.

The intrigue unfolds through interviews with the characters closest to Vincent and through dramatic reconstructions of the events leading up to his death.\nHere are some stills from our concept trailer:\nLoving Vincent features over 120 of Vincent Van Gogh's greatest paintings. The plot, drawn from the 800 letters written by the painter himself, leads us to the significant people and events in the time leading up to his unexpected death. Vincent wrote in his last letter: \u201cWell, the truth is, we cannot speak other than by our paintings\u201d, and that is what we are doing- letting his paintings tell the story of what the painter had inside his heart, and ultimately, what happened to him.\nALL OF THAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF YOUR FAVOURITE PAINTINGS!!\nWas it suicide, or was he shot? And if it was suicide, what would have led him to such a dramatic act, when he at last was gaining recognition for his work?\nEvery film you see is actually a collection of still images, played back at a speed that makes it appear to be moving. In our film about Vincent Van Gogh, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE individual images will be a painting in the style of Van Gogh. That means our 40 painters (which we will be able to train thanks to YOUR support) will create 56,800 PAINTINGS to make this film!! To make this possible OUR WONDERFUL TEAM created PAWS (Painted Animation Work Stations) that allows us to make the demanding process of stop-motion painting as efficient as possible, by allowing our artists to focus on the painting as opposed to the animation. In fact, over the past 18 months of R&D we've managed to halve the painting time of each frame, while maintaining the individuality of the painters.\nTHIS IS WHAT \"PAWS\" LOOKS LIKE:\nVincent Van Gogh is often cited as the father of modern art, and his painting Starry Night is regarded as the most famous painting of all time, after the Mona Lisa. He is known for struggling with mental illness and cutting off his left ear, and also for only ever selling one painting in his lifetime and for shooting himself at the age of 37. What isn't widely known is that Vincent only picked up a paintbrush a mere 8 years before his untimely death, after failed careers as first an art dealer, a book sales clerk and then a preacher.\nIn his short career as a painter HE MANAGED TO PRODUCE AS MANY OR MORE paintings than great masters managed over careers spanning many decades. He went from being a jobless 29-year-old living in a barn in a poor mining area, having never picked up a paintbrush, to, at 37 years old, being proclaimed by one of Paris's (and therefore at the time the world's) most influential art critics as:\n\"a messiah, a sower of truth, who would regenerate the decrepitude of our art and perhaps our imbecile and industrialist society\"\nIMPRESSED? WE WERE!\nThe most important thing for us is to bring this really amazing story to life. We would like to SHARE with you our feelings on the work and life of this extraordinary and inspiring individual.\nWe are an Oscar-winning animation studio (Founder Hugh Welchman won the Oscar for Best Short Animation for Peter and the Wolf). From the very beginning, our recipe for success has consisted of finding stories and ideas that passionately move us and then going further than anyone else would reasonably expect us to go to make them a unique and brilliant experience for the people watching them.

These projects became a precious opportunity for local artists and architects to express themselves. Instead of one standardized design we find 1000\u2019s of unique and sometimes whimsical creations. They represent a mix of styles, shapes and sizes, from swirling tile mosaic pieces, to elegant geometric forms, to miniature temples of symbolist expression.\nTHE BOOK \u2013 hardcover, landscape A4 \u2013 128 pages\n\u201cA book of Soviet bus stops?

Pre-order your copy of this limited edition book now and make this project a reality.\nTHE JOURNEY AND THE OBSESSION\nBy chance I discovered a phenomenon that set in motion a photographic journey that would span 12 years and 13 countries. Hunting for the most amazing road side bus shelters in the former Soviet Union would become my muse and my reason to travel.\nDuring a cycling trip from London to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 2002 I set myself a photographic challenge to take one good photo every hour. It was on this trip that I first paid attention to the bus stops. The long hours in the saddle and slowly changing landscape along country roads in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Russia provided the setting for my discovery and the birth of my obsession. Here the designs mainly played with purely graphic shapes, each different stretch of road revealing a new set of creations to break up an otherwise bleak landscape.\nBetween 2003 and 2006 I lived in Kazakhstan, and I explored the five \u2018Stan\u2019 countries and former Soviet states of Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Along these silk routes I found more fascinating bus stops, often appearing in the middle of the desert, steppe or countryside, with no other sign of human settlement in sight. It was as if the earth was its pedestal and nothing else on the endless horizon could compete with the bold statement it was making.\nKyrgyzstan, Armenia, Abkhazia\nMy obsession grew and saw me hit the road further to visit five more former soviet countries: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and later to revisit the Baltics, travelling thousands more kilometres by bus, rental car and taxi with the specific task of hunting down the very best bus stops. I was possessed. On a mission. Nothing was going to deter me from my hunt. I searched travellers\u2019 blogs for clues, interrogated bus and taxi drivers and even scanned over the roads on Google Earth to plan what I believed would be most effective routes. I was not disappointed as each new discovery pushed to outshine the previous.\nSeveral of these countries have little freedom of press and expression. Tourists are rare. Visas for photographers were hard to come by. I often had to instead go into the countries on tourist visas. Despite my efforts not to arouse suspicion I was, on several occasions, accused of being a spy and only narrowly avoided getting caught up in something rather awkward. With reluctance this added to the adventure and made each new discovery even more precious. In Abkhazia my driver accused me of being a Georgian agent and photographing sensitive material. He demanded a bribe, otherwise, it would be \u201cstraight to the militizia and a firing squad\u201d. Needless to say, he was not convinced by my story that \u201cI have only come to your country to see your pretty bus stops\u201d. I was happy to escape from the journey with relatively little drama, and even happier to have captured some of the most beautifully insane bus stops I had ever encountered, safe on a memory card tucked into my underpants.\nThis photo series is likely the largest collection of Soviet Bus Stops ever assembled. A tenuous claim to fame, I admit, and a strange obsession to have. But still, it\u2019s one that I am proud of and I hope it will help to preserve this unique and historical art form.\nSigned Archival Prints", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge of finding the bus stops and taking the photos is done.

If you are passionate about taking pictures with your phone we believe you are going to love these two Moment lenses.\nBeautiful moments are everywhere. From capturing the unforgettable to the everyday, our phones allow us to quickly preserve these memories wherever we go, whenever we want. But their convenience comes with a lack of precision and control. As active picture takers we understand that with the right lenses, we can have creative freedom of what's most important \u2014 capturing life's most inspiring moments with the quality they deserve.\nThat's why we created Moment lenses - the world's best lenses for your phone.\nWe were tired of sacrificing quality for convenience, so we made lenses that put photographic finesse in your pocket. Designed from the ground up, Moment lenses are amazingly sharp, portable and easy to attach. Created with the highest quality in materials, our purpose is to empower mobile picture takers.\nWe're thrilled with the product and we think you will be too. If you are a mobile picture taker with a passion for capturing beautiful images, please help us make Moment a reality.

They also exhibit significant chromatic aberration and in most cases, significant geometric distortion.  \nThe Moment optics are different:\nWe optimized multi-element designs using the same recipe in designing professional cinema glass for HD film. We then fabricate the lens elements in the same high precision optical manufacturing facilities that produce lenses for 4K cinema.  We believe we are the first company to integrate such high end glass into mobile lenses. \nWhat makes the Moment Lenses the best on the market?\nLens construction: Multi-element designs with high efficiency broadband coatings.\nNo Distortion: Advanced lens designs minimize geometric distortion to fractions of a percent.  No photoshop required!\nMinimal Chromatic Aberration:  Minimized via expert glass selection and expert design forms\nBetter MTF Performance: We allowed slightly larger lens diameters to fully optimize the quality from the center of the frame to the edge of the frame\n*Note: KS lowers the quality of the images we have uploaded.\nOur engineering mantra was to maximize image quality, while not degrading the resolution of the native camera.  We broke barriers that limit the quality of the existing products on the market and the result are the sharpest, lowest distortion lenses on the market.  \nWe designed these optics to be an extension of your mobile phone camera instead of an afterthought accessory. \nDesigning an Experience\nFrom the beginning, we have focused on mobile picture takers. By working with everyone from professionals to enthusiasts, we set out to design a product that people would carry with them everywhere.\nWe started by creating dozens of prototypes, testing size, weight, and convenience to carry. Constantly putting the prototypes in peoples hands, we observed how they carried, installed, and used the lenses on their phone. \nDuring the process we discussed trade-offs between size and quality. Knowing the larger we can make the lenses the higher the quality they could be, while at the same time wanting to stay true to the portability of our phones. \nUltimately, we designed a lens that gives you confidence in its quality and while remaining an efficient size. \nFinding inspiration from the history of lenses we spent a lot of time working on the details of each lens. Prototyping a variety of finishes, shapes, and markings we ultimately decided to keep the lenses as clean as possible, enabling the glass to speak for itself.\nSmall on Size, Big on Quality\nYou'll instantly feel the quality of these lenses, and that's not an accident. With a perfect balance of size and weight, they're proportional to your phone and extremely minimal. Clean lines and a machined metal barrel let the glass speak for itself.\nThe two lenses are similar in size with the only major difference being the lens hood on the front of the Wide lens. The hood protects the glass when you set it face down and it provides a first line of defense against the sun.\nWorks With -OR- Without A Case\nMobile photography is about speed. You never want to miss a moment. Because of this, we invested in making sure Moment lenses are fast to attach and easy to use. \nAfter dozens of mounting prototypes, we arrived at a two part solution. \nA thin metal plate adheres to your phone with a rubber based double-sided tape adhesive, which provides strength but doesn't damage your phone at all. About half the thickness of a credit card, you then put your existing case over the top. If you have multiple devices we will be sure to have multiple plates available so you can easily move your lenses from phone to phone. Now your phone(s) will always be lens ready. \nTo then attach the lens, there is a simple bayonet interface (think smaller version of a DSLR camera lens attachment) that allows the lens to rotate securely into place. Made from stainless steel, the interface is easy to use, but strong so your lens will stay in place. The current prototypes rely on pressure to hold the lens into place and we are still iterating to achieve a \"locking\" experience.\n\nPLAY\n\nAlways With You\nJust like us, these lenses like to travel. We didn't want anyone to have an excuse to leave them at home so the compact design fits well in your pocket, bag, or purse. A compact carrying solution is in the works as well. Just click off the lid, pop out the lens and get shooting.\nCompatible Devices\nMoment is about empowering mobile picture takers everywhere so we focused our preliminary efforts on the largest platforms \u2014 iOS and Galaxy. \n\nThe lenses in this Kickstarter campaign have been engineered and tested to work with iPhones, iPads, and Galaxy phones. We are still prototyping mounts for Galaxy phones and iPads and our goal is to have these mounts ready to ship with your order. \nIf your phone is not listed on this chart, please help us collect data on which phones you would like to see supported next by taking a quick survey.\nTech Specs\n*Note: Resolution measurements performed on JPEG file from iPhone 5S via Hyperion Development Slant Edge MTF software. JPEG image processed and includes moment lens, iPhone 5S lens and sensor, and effects of iPhone image processing.\nWe started Moment because we believe the future of photography is in our pockets.\nWe love taking pictures and over the years we have found that the camera we rely on the most, is our phones. What we love about our phone is that they are available, connected, and accessible. But despite their convenience we miss the creativity of what traditional lenses can provide.\nSo we set out on a mission to make the camera in our pockets, the best that it can be. By empowering mobile picture takers with better lenses, we believe that together we can continue to make the world a happier place, one picture at a time. \nThank you to this diverse set of builders who have helped bring Moment to life. \nMarc Barros - Entrepreneur, picture taker, and happy new dad.\nErik Hedberg - All things design and photography.

Just this week Keen has been declared one of the \"Top 20 Irish Food Finds to Watch in 2014\".  There's nothing better than being a food producer in Ireland - the industry is absolutely buzzing and if you take a look at the Top 20 you'll see what incredibly innovative products are being produced.    \n\nEven with all the success Keen has experienced, I'm still a small food producer and I make nut butter because I believe the product is amazing and better than anything you can currently buy - not for the money (money?). As with most food producers in their first year of business, there's literally no room for 'extras'. \nWhich brings me to the reason for this Kickstarter Project: I would love to enter Keen Nut Butter into the Great Taste Awards. As a small producer, being awarded Great Taste stars is truly a sign that you are producing a product that is top notch and one that needs to be shouted about. \nYes, yes yes. We (you and I) already shout about Keen Nut Butter because we know it's a fabulously delicious alternative to peanut butter. But think about how much louder we would be heard if our megaphone was covered in twinkly Great Taste stars? \nLast year, I was a touch too late to enter the awards but as Keen Nut Butter is preparing to launch into mainland UK in the next couple of months, it seems like the perfect time to gain a bit of recognition for our artisan products.  I think Keen stands a chance of really shining at the Great Taste Awards in 2014 and if you think so too, then please make a pledge to help me enter.  \nWhat the Project Goal covers \nUpdate: We've hit this goal!  Pat yourselves on the back! \nThe cost of entering 5 different products in the awards, thus increasing our chance of making a huge splash if we win several stars. We're star-greedy. The flavours entered will be: Almond Smooth, Almond Crunchy, Almond Cinnamon, Hazelnut Cinnamon and Pecan Maple.\nShipping costs to ship the tasters to the judges. 5 products x hundreds of judges can add up! \nCost of a roller banner and new display boards to use at GTA events.  \nCost of new labelling to highlight stars awarded.  \nCost of flight and hotel to UK to attend GTA ceremony. \nRewards for all of our beautiful supporters. \nHow the Great Taste Awards are judged\nThe thing that I really like it about the GTA is that each product isn't competing against similar items.  They're judged individually and given 0-3 stars based on the deliciousness of that particular product.  This means that by entering all 10 of our commercially available flavours we're not competing against ourselves, each product just needs to be wonderfully tasty. Which they are (yay!).  \nTo read all about the Great Taste Awards, you can visit their official website.  \nStretch Goals\nUpdate: We've hit every one of these stretch goals!  I'm very proud of the foodies in Ireland, the UK and Canada for spreading the work and making this happen! Well done you.\n\u00a3900 - I'll enter our Macadamia White Chocolate Nut Butter. \u00a3950 - I'll enter our Almond Vanilla Nut Butter. \u00a31000 - I'll enter our Hazelnut Dark Chocolate Nut Butter. \n\nSuper Stretch Goals\nTime for some super stretch goals then, eh? \nSuper Super Stretch #1 \u00a31,600: Cover the costs of going to the Harrogate Speciality Show  This is a trade event with with thousands of food hall buyers and independent retailers hoping to find the next delicious taste to bring into their shops. That delicious taste could be Keen! This would cover the basics for the event: stall fee, pallet delivery of goods and travel.   \nSuper Super Stretch #2 \u00a32,050: Cover the costs of going to the Balmoral Show\nIreland's largest agricultural and food event. This would simply cover the cost of a stall in the NI Food Pavillion.\nSuper Stretch #3: \u00a32,500: EITHER cover the costs of going to London's Speciality Food Show in September OR providing our products for the April Flavr Box.  It's your choice - let me know which you'd prefer in the comments.  Either opportunity is a great way to promote Keen within mainland UK. \nWhy I want to enter as many flavours as I can...\nWhen people are taste-testing our nut butters, it seems like everyone has their favourite.  William will argue passionately that Almond Vanilla is the best, but Katie is a staunch Almond Smooth supporter. This makes it hard to select just one or two flavours - imagine if I entered Almond Crunchy and the judges were all Smooth lovers!?  The shame. \nFrom a business perspective, winning stars opens doors.  Simple as that. Just as an Oscar win raises the profile of an actress, GTA stars make products very appealing to both consumers and buyers from those gorgeous food halls we all want to be in.  \nWhat if Keen doesn't win any stars?\nIf Keen doesn't win any stars (really?), then the money pledged towards the promotional materials, packaging and flight will go towards attendance at one of the BBC Good Food shows.  \nWhat if Keen wins a whole she-bang of stars? \nIf that happens, it will be because of the support you've given me. Hence, it's only sensible that you're rewarded in kind (I'm sure you'll agree, yeah?) Check out the bonus rewards that I'll send out if we start raking in the stars...\n\n5 stars - every supporter will receive a bonus mini-jar of their choosing. \n10 stars - every supporter will receive a full-sized jar of their choosing.  \nWhy haven't I done a video for this Kickstarter project?\nAs fun as it was to create the video for the last Kickstarter project, we just don't have the time to put towards it this go-round. Our Keen Nut Butters are in such high demand that I'm working about 20 hours a day trying to fill orders. Any video created would be a blur of smooshing and tiredness!  To boot, I used up my video editing favours for the last project and fear that asking again would only result in my husband imploding from work stress. \nThe delicious world of Keen\nIf you're debating over which reward to choose, perhaps a browse through the list of flavours might help? \n\nStandard (190ml Jars)\nAlmond Smooth \nAlmond Crunchy\nAlmond Cinnamon \nAlmond Vanilla Pod\nAlmond Dark Chocolate\nAlmond Sour Cherry - Kickstarter only flavour!\nAlmond Espresso - Kickstarter only flavour!\nAlmond Honey - Kickstarter only flavour! \nHazelnut Cinnamon\nHazelnut Dark Chocolate\nThree-Nut (Almond, Hazelnut & Cashew) - Kickstarter only flavour!\n\nPremium\nPecan Maple\nMacadamia White Chocolate\nCashew Dark Chocolate - Kickstarter only flavour!\nMacadamia White Chocolate Cranberry - Kickstarter only flavour! \nWe've got Add-ons! \nThese are great if you just want to add another flavour to your pledge! Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. \n\nUK Shipping Add-ons (includes price of shipping): \n\u00a312 - Any Standard Jar of Nut Butter\n\u00a315 - Any Premium Jar of Nut Butter\n\nOutside UK Add-ons (includes price of shipping):\n\u00a318 - Any Standard Jar of Nut Butter\n\u00a321 - Any Premium Jar of Nut Butter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI know the ins and outs of the Keen supply chain well enough to be confident that I can fulfil the rewards during the month of March.

HOWEVER...\n www.JapaneseTheGame.com\nI lived in Japan a decade ago and, through hard experience and hard work, I learned how the Japanese Language works.  I had taken college classes, tried to study on my own, and even moved there, but I was still struggling to say everyday things like \"That soup was delicious,\" and \"Actually, I'm too short to play football.\" Eventually I got a good grasp of the language and got rather fluent, but I felt terrible for the other English speakers who were new or never seemed to catch on.\nWhen I got back to the States, I saw that a lot of good programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur were available for a whole lot of money and people were still buying them up, spending hundreds of dollars at a time. But what if you don't always have a computer or CD player with you, or what if you want to learn with friends? And learning certainly shouldn't be so expensive. So to make it easier for the rest of the world I cracked the code for you, breaking almost the whole language down into manageable concepts. It took a lot of time and failed attempts, but after six years of rethinking, simplifying, and revising, I've created this card game that makes learning Japanese fun, fast, and easy!\n The cards in this game have Japanese words on them, along with markings that help you put them together in complete, grammatically correct sentences every time. Here's an example sentence:\n These cards come together to make a sentence that means...\n...\"The cat sniffs.\"  Swap out nouns, verbs, etc., to make your own sentences.  Be smart or silly and have fun with it.\nAs you can see, the cards have English letters on them, so you don't have to know Japanese at all to play a fun, fast game and learn some Japanese vocabulary and grammar almost by accident. Here's a close-up sample of the card for Dog:\nThe First Edition will have fresh background images. A dog, for instance.\nThis game puts the language right in your hands, helping you learn at your own pace.  Even my 11-year-old cousin is pretty good at it. I want everyone who is interested in learning Japanese to be able to take a deck anywhere they go and share the Japanese language with their friends.\nFor students who happen to be learning the Japanese writing systems of Hiragana and Katakana or Kanji, this game is an excellent help. In fact, if you're studying Japanese, there's even a pledge level at which I will turn your vocabulary list into a deck! And you can get enough for your whole class, or have them join you in a pledge to pool your resources and benefit the whole class.  Each deck has 52 cards, which is enough for two players (because you need at least 25 cards per player).  The 36-cards expansions enable one more player to join the game while bringing you more vocabulary, grammar, and even strategic dimensions!\nThe game is played like a live-action version of Mad Libs.  The cards in your hand are words, and you use them to make sentences.  You can play with a shared deck or players can bring their own.\nSolo Mode - Build sentences to get to 20 points in as few turns as you can, or go until you've used every card in the deck!\nCollaborative Mode - Get together with a friend or two or three and take turns building, expanding, splitting, and re-building each other's sentences!\nCompetitive Mode - Every card you play can increase the number of points you have on your side of the table.  You can use the points you place on your side within a given turn to eliminate opponents' cards--end even complete sentences--to set them back while at the same time you make progress toward your own goal!  \nI've made a rather silly, roughly 10 minute-long video of this mode, which you can watch below. (You can get the feel of the game in about three minutes, though.) It may be a little loud depending on your computer.\nPLAY\n\nI believe breaking down the language barrier will increase love and understanding between Japanese and English-speaking cultures.  There is so much to be gained by bringing our world-leading cultures together in friendship.  So if you love games, love Japan, or love languages, it's time to learn, grow, and increase peace!\nI'm doing this Kickstarter to pay for printing the first complete edition of the game and six expansions: Japanese Food, Anime, Travel, Business, Monsters (Kaij\u016b), and an intermediate-level Conjugations Expansion!\nIf you want, the limited Sh\u014dgun backer level allows you to pick what words you want to be in a deck or expansion!  Do you want words to form a certain phrase?  \"You are my sunshine.\" \"What does the fox say?\" \"I am the one who knocks.\" \"Objection overruled.\"  You can have it!  The more funds we raise, the more cards we can put in the core deck and the more expansions we can afford to print.\nI will also use some funds to make a truly excellent series of free Japanese Instruction videos.  These lessons and question-and-answer sessions will allow learners to get more familiar with the language, regardless of whether they've even heard of the game.  Naturally I'll make videos for the game as well, but I feel like I've been given this amazing gift and I really want to share it.  For this, I'll need better video and sound equipment.\nThis is the updated break-down for the backer levels available in this Kickstarter:\nNote: The $1 Donation pledge level now gets a Print-and-Play First Edition Core Deck instead of the Beta because of a stretch goal we met.\nI hope this chart makes sense.  If it doesn't, please message me directly.\nWe've funded successfully, AND beaten our first through fourth stretch goals!\nUNLOCKED!! $7,000: A 5-card \"Politeness\" mini-expansion right inside the box that will enable you to make any sentence in the game into a Formal one.  That will make the Japanese teachers happy, along with everyone you meet if you should venture to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nUNLOCKED!! $20,000: Everyone who backs at $10 or more will get a Permanent Subscription to a Print-and-Play PDF of every Core Deck and expansions we ever make!  This will never happen outside of this Kickstarter campaign, so take advantage!\nUNLOCKED!! $25,000: I will add a blank sheet of cards to the Print-and-Play so you can make cards to suit your own vocabulary goals!\nUNLOCKED!! $42,000: I will make a Business Expansion with words like Office, Commute, Co-worker, etc.  More details here.\nUNLOCKED!! Reaching 1,000 Facebook Likes has unlocked a Free Android and iPhone app that reads your cards and speaks the native Japanese pronunciation!\nUNLOCKED!!: $64,000: We will get a MONSTERS (Kaijuu) EXPANSION with art by professional Japanese monster artist Micah Hornung. More details here.\nUNLOCKED!!: $85,000: I will create a Conjugations Expansion Deck so you can learn how to put verbs and adjectives into other tenses and forms like past, command, negative, likely, apparent, and others. This will train your brain to use more sophisticated Japanese. You might consider this an intermediate pack.\nUNLOCKED!!: $96,000: Unlocked the Daimy\u014d backer level with one Core Deck, all six Expansions, and a free Japanese: The Game Two-piece Card Box. It's 9'' long (28cm) so it will hold all the cards in the backer level along with a few more expansions as you continue to build your vocabulary.  The card box is also  available as an add-on; you just increase your pledge amount by $12 to get one.\nUNLOCKED!!: 2500 Backers: Everyone will get four more cards in the Core Deck AND all the $1 Backers get the First Edition Print-and-play instead of just the Beta. (They don't get a Print-and-Play of all the Expansions, but every level $10 and up does.)\nFINAL ROLLING STRETCH GOAL!!: I increased the deck by one card at $110,000 and will continue to add one card for every $2,000 we raise thereafter.\nI thank you all for your tremendous support! This has been a runaway success and I can't wait to deliver your cards and make more Japanese: The Game throughout 2014 and hopefully forever!\nThis game has a lot of expansion potential to help you learn the language and culture of Japan, so I'm going to keep going on this. Now that we've funded successfully, I'm going to fulfill this project and go on to make expansions for People, Numbers, Grade-level Kanji sets, The JPLT and BJT regulation langauage tests, and more!\nI'd love to hear from you, even if you don't back my project, about why you did or didn't, and I'll be contacting every one of you who backs me to thank you personally because this is something we're doing together.  It's a big undertaking, but I've already done most of the work and with your backing, we'll be able to make this a great game for anyone to study Japanese in groups in a way that's fun and engaging... so we can share the excitement of learning a new language and culture with everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenge: Creation logistics\nIt takes a lot of work hours to get new vocabulary turned into cards. With the Teacher and Professor contributor levels, fulfillment times are extended beyond the normal project for this reason. But even with the couple expansions we're making, a hundred or so new word cards will need to be created. Fortunately, I have written software that creates the cards after I populate a spreadsheet. I've already created about 60 cards this way, so the challenge is largely conquered.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Our Mascot Naming Contest is on!!

And what makes it a great story to experience is the intriguing, tragic, and inspiring story of Vincent Van Gogh himself.\n\n[NEW REWARDS!!!! - SCROLL DOWN]\nImagine yourself in a journey that you could never experience before...\nLoving Vincent is an investigation delving into the life and controversial death of Vincent Van Gogh, one of the world's most beloved painters, as told through his paintings and by the characters that inhabit them. The intrigue unfolds through interviews with the characters closest to Vincent and through dramatic reconstructions of the events leading up to his death.\nHere are some stills from our concept trailer:\nLoving Vincent features over 120 of Vincent Van Gogh's greatest paintings. The plot, drawn from the 800 letters written by the painter himself, leads us to the significant people and events in the time leading up to his unexpected death. Vincent wrote in his last letter: \u201cWell, the truth is, we cannot speak other than by our paintings\u201d, and that is what we are doing- letting his paintings tell the story of what the painter had inside his heart, and ultimately, what happened to him.\nALL OF THAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF YOUR FAVOURITE PAINTINGS!!\nWas it suicide, or was he shot? And if it was suicide, what would have led him to such a dramatic act, when he at last was gaining recognition for his work?\nEvery film you see is actually a collection of still images, played back at a speed that makes it appear to be moving. In our film about Vincent Van Gogh, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE individual images will be a painting in the style of Van Gogh. That means our 40 painters (which we will be able to train thanks to YOUR support) will create 56,800 PAINTINGS to make this film!! To make this possible OUR WONDERFUL TEAM created PAWS (Painted Animation Work Stations) that allows us to make the demanding process of stop-motion painting as efficient as possible, by allowing our artists to focus on the painting as opposed to the animation. In fact, over the past 18 months of R&D we've managed to halve the painting time of each frame, while maintaining the individuality of the painters.\nTHIS IS WHAT \"PAWS\" LOOKS LIKE:\nVincent Van Gogh is often cited as the father of modern art, and his painting Starry Night is regarded as the most famous painting of all time, after the Mona Lisa. He is known for struggling with mental illness and cutting off his left ear, and also for only ever selling one painting in his lifetime and for shooting himself at the age of 37. What isn't widely known is that Vincent only picked up a paintbrush a mere 8 years before his untimely death, after failed careers as first an art dealer, a book sales clerk and then a preacher.\nIn his short career as a painter HE MANAGED TO PRODUCE AS MANY OR MORE paintings than great masters managed over careers spanning many decades. He went from being a jobless 29-year-old living in a barn in a poor mining area, having never picked up a paintbrush, to, at 37 years old, being proclaimed by one of Paris's (and therefore at the time the world's) most influential art critics as:\n\"a messiah, a sower of truth, who would regenerate the decrepitude of our art and perhaps our imbecile and industrialist society\"\nIMPRESSED? WE WERE!\nThe most important thing for us is to bring this really amazing story to life. We would like to SHARE with you our feelings on the work and life of this extraordinary and inspiring individual.\nWe are an Oscar-winning animation studio (Founder Hugh Welchman won the Oscar for Best Short Animation for Peter and the Wolf). From the very beginning, our recipe for success has consisted of finding stories and ideas that passionately move us and then going further than anyone else would reasonably expect us to go to make them a unique and brilliant experience for the people watching them.

And we need your help! Your contribution will not only help us train painters in animation, but will show others that this is a film people want to see happen!\nIf we achieve our Kickstarter goal, we'd have the opportunity to TEST OVER 200 PAINTERS AND TRAIN 60, preparing them to work on the project. Your contribution will also help us FINALIZE PRE PRODUCTION AND START PAINTING THE FINAL FILM.\nThe painters we are auditioning - each audition takes 3 days - are all highly qualified painters, many of whom are working in temporary jobs or jobs that in no way use their specialist skills. Your support will not only be helping create the world\u2019s first painting animation feature film, not only be bringing great paintings of Vincent Van Gogh to life, you will be helping talented painters, young and old, find a suitable outlet for their artistic flair.\nYou are the person that can help make this happen! if you like the project, it's just a choice of pledge. And remember \u2013 a pledge of even one pound is not just about the money: It\u2019s about showing support to get this film made!\nTAKING PART is EASY. It's just a few simple steps:\n1.

It will include the movie itself, both with full of special bonus videos, produced during the production process and A SPECIAL THANKS VIDEO from the Producer and the Director of the movie!!\nThe video is available as a separate reward and it's also included AS A BONUS in all the rewards \"+150 GBP\". If you want the DVD, but you had already pledged less; you can always add to your pledge the amount of \"+40 GBP\" to get your chosen award AND DVD...\n ATTENTION! We had previously only included rewards that we knew we could deliver, if the Kickstarter campaign is a success, and completion of the film is definitely down the road once financing is raised. However, due to your requests, we have chosen to include THE LIMITED EDITION KICKSTARTER DVD as a reward, as so many of you had requested it... but YOU SHOULD BE AWARE that this reward is a bit risky, as it is going to be delivered after the production of the movie is over, so in case the film doesn't get made, we unfortunately won't be able to deliver it. To cut a long story short - if you pledge for this reward, you do it at your own risk. We do believe we are close to gathering the production financing, but until everything is signed, on the dotted line can't guarantee that it will.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find out more about the project here:\nWWW : www.lovingvincent.com \nFacebook : www.facebook.com/lovingvincentmovie\nYouTube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3LSfvcmrf0\nIMDb : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3262342/\nOver the year since we\u2019ve announced the project, the press and bloggers all over the world have been writing about \"Loving Vincent\"!

That means you won't be seeing the same old-same old when you open this book. The tales are not watered down versions, but the real deal. The dark stuff is not edited out for mass consumption, but it is illustrated in a tasteful way to make the comics suitable for both kids and adults. There are three artists on this collaborative project, Gina Biggs, Louisa Roy, and Elle Skinner. Each have their own distinctive style and each of these ladies takes a turn at illustrating one of the tales.\nThose of you who are new to Erstwhile please feel free to read the ENTIRE series online for FREE! If you like what you see, come on back and support our kickstarter.\nFollow us at: ERSTWHILE SITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK\nErstwhile volume 2 is a FULL COLOR HARDCOVER book weighing in at 176 pages. Volume 2 contain six completed tales; Brother & Sister, Iron Hans, Snow White & Rose Red, Death of the Little Hen, Doctor Know-It-All, and The Worn-out Dancing Shoes (aka The 12 Dancing Princesses). Each volume of Erstwhile contains its own set of completed stories, so you can jump in at any time to enjoy. \nErstwhile volume 1 is also available in some pledge levels or you can include it as an ADD-ON item (more info below). Volume 1 contains the following stories: The Farmer's Clever Daughter; A Tale with a Riddle; Maid Maleen; The Bird, the Mouse, & the Sausage; All Fur; The Little Shroud; The Old Man & his Grandson; and The Sweet Porridge.\nSnow White & Rose Red introduces us to two sisters who are as different as night and day, but love each other dearly and always promise to share everything between them. Everything goes as planned until a kindly talking bear and an evil dwarf change their lives completely.\nBrother & Sister tells the tale of two abused children who run away from home. Once alone in an enchanted forest the brother falls under a curse, transforming him into a wild creature, and the sister finds herself wooed by a king.\nIron Hans is a story of growing up. A young spoiled prince accidentally frees the wild man, Iron Hans, while selfishly trying to acquire his lost golden ball. He runs away from home, fearful of punishment, but once on his own finds both pride in his work and meaning to his life.\nDeath of the Little Hen follows the hilariously morbid tale of a Rooster and his selfish wife, Hen. The biggest nut on Nut Mountain is greedily gobbled up by Hen and leads to her death, but the tragedy only leads to more mayhem as Rooster and friends travel to the funeral.\nDoctor Know-It-All is a man who knows everything, or at least appears that way. The poor farmer in disguise finds himself in over his head when a wealthy merchant hires him to discover the mystery behind the thefts in his household.\nThe Worn-out Dancing Shoes (aka The 12 Dancing Princesses) tells of twelve royal sisters who awake each morning with their shoes worn to shreds and their bodies worn to exhaustion. The king declares whomever solves the mystery will succeed him to the throne, but whomever fails will get the axe.\n_____________________________________________\nADD ONS\nIf you want to add an extra copy of Erstwhile Vol.1 or Erstwhile Vol.2 to any pledge level you can do so.

We need your support to create the 21 Revolutions publication and have lovely rewards to offer in return.\nIn 2012 Glasgow Women\u2019s Library (GWL) celebrated its 21st birthday. To mark two decades of life-changing work, GWL commissioned 21 internationally renowned artists and 21 published writers to create new works inspired by our unique museum, archive and library collections. The resulting fine art prints, poems and creative writing are being brought together with the sources that inspired the work in a superb book alongside essays by Fiona Bradley, Director of the Fruitmarket Gallery, writer and journalist Lesley McDowell, and co-founder of Glasgow Women\u2019s Library Adele Patrick.\nAll the created art works have been exhibited at the prestigious Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh and CCA, Glasgow\n Why is it needed? \nThere is no other publication that includes work by Scottish based contemporary women artists and writers. GWL aims to celebrate the hidden history of Scottish women and promote contemporary women\u2019s achievements. This publication does both. Although Scottish women artists and writers have gained increasing prominence over the period of the Library\u2019s life there is still no women\u2019s magazine in Scotland, no anthologies of women\u2019s writing and no survey of contemporary women\u2019s art. This publication spotlights gems from the historic records of women housed by GWL through the lens of 42 contemporary women creatives.\nWhat is the publication like? \nIt is unique! It is a beautiful, lushly illustrated, enlightening and readable book. It is a large format paperback with the highest quality reproductions throughout, with fascinating new creative writing and scintillating essays. We have included artists' and writers' biographies, information about how they approached making their creative responses, as well as a detailed survey of numerous resources from the collection used in the creation of these 42 new works.\nMembers of the GWL team wearing fabulous National Museum of Roller Derby t-shirts available as part of the '21 Revolutions Fans' Goody Bag reward\nWhy do we need your support?\nCreative Scotland generously funded 70% of the production of the 21 Revolutions publication but a remaining \u00a35000 needs to be raised to ensure its successful publication. \nWhat is the future for GWL and 21 Revolutions? What difference will my support make?\n21 Revolutions is testimony to the achievements of Glasgow Women\u2019s Library. 42 of the most significant women artists and writers working in Scotland today agreed to work with the collection and create work that could be used to raise awareness of the Library\u2019s life changing work and resources. Your support of this project will ensure that a fantastic project has a tangible lasting public outcome, that we have a further beautiful work that we can share to promote the history of contemporary women artists and writers and the Library\u2019s resources and that we are able to embark on an exciting and landmark project to develop an imprint at GWL.

We are an accredited Museum with a wonderful treasure trove of books, artefacts and archive collections contributed by thousands of donors that celebrate the lives, histories and achievements of women. Learning is at the heart of what we do and we aim to widen horizons with  programmes of inspiring events and activities from film screenings to literacy support, heritage walks and exhibitions. We are an enterprising charity specialising in working with a very diverse range of women including BME women and women remote from learning.\nInternational Postage Options\nAlthough our pledges specify that postage is restricted to 'Shipping within the UK only', International postage is available through email correspondence with GWL.

Sure, it's a floodplain, but friends who had farmed there for years assured us that the soils were rich and the floods were rare. We were excited. \nIn 2010, our first season with 2 acres in production, our pasture flooded in November. In 2011, following the heaviest snowfall on record and the wettest Spring on record, Lake Champlain covered our farm from mid April until mid-June. We plowed on, growing six acres, until Tropical Storm Irene flooded us with nearly seven feet of water on August 29. \nBut hey, 2012 was great! One of the best seasons I've ever seen, and our 12 acres of veggies yielded amazing crops to complement our pasture raised pork and eggs, grass fed beef, and lamb. We thought the worst was behind us. Maybe we could stay?\nThen 2013. The farm experienced mild but persistent flooding in May, June, and the grand finale on July 5. This year alone we lost an acre and a half of potatoes, a half acre of Spring carrots, an acre of Spring broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, an acre of tomatoes, and two acres of winter squash. We cannot survive another season in this new climate. Climate change has brought massive rainstorms, thick snowpacks, and a river with wanderlust. We need to move out of its way. \nSalvation! We've found 20 acres of prime agricultural soils in the high meadows of lovely Plainfield, VT! Best of all, they are well drained sandy loams! Now we need to move there.

The spare-parts kit will include an extra thumb screw and three extra-bezel screws (in case you unscrew and drop them), and an extra set of screens.We don't think your Searzall screens are going to break --ours don't-- but they are replaceable should they ever warp too much under years of use.  \nIf we can raise $300,000 then all backers that gave $55 and up will get a Searzall recipe book and those who already receive a recipe book will be upgraded to an exclusive, Kickstarter-only, extended recipe book.  \nIf we can raise $400,000 then we will unlock the ability to add the Searzall clamp to your reward. Backers at the 55 and 65 dollar level will be able to get the clamp by increasing their pledge by $20. Backers at the $90 level and above will get the clamp automatically.  \nThe Clamp:\nThe reason we only support 16.4 ounce camping bottles of propane is because it is the most stable small cylinder you can buy. We have designed a patent-pending clamp that can stabilize any cylinder --in fact any round thing-- between the size of an Iwatani butane can and a 16.4 ounce propane cylinder. Our motto is: if it is round, it won't fall down! Not only will this stabilize your torch, it will stabilize your wine bottle on a boat or picnic --it will even stabilize your champagne glass if that is what you need. The picture below shows a prototype we had made in SLS nylon. The real version will be slightly different --the feet won't be big and goofy-- but the pictures are a pretty close representation of what you can expect. We intend to have it injection molded out of glass-filled nylon, but the materials are still open to a bit of debate. The reason we didn't offer the clamp from the beginning is we didn't want to take on the problem of making the Searzall and the clamp at the same time. If we reach a goal of $400,000, we will be making enough Searzalls that we'll have the resources to also take on the clamp simultaneously. We will finish the prototyping and get production molds made so that the clamps will ship on time with the Searzalls.\nAlso, here's a look at what the Searzall shirt might look like:\nWHAT IS IT?\nThe Searzall is a revolutionary hand-held cooking tool for the professional and home cook. It gives you the power of raw fire but also the ability to moderate and control that power. It's a carefully engineered attachment that fastens onto a common blowtorch and shapes and moderates the torch flame to make it far more cooking and flavor-friendly. The Searzall puts the power of a bed of hot coals in the palm of your hand \u2013instantly.\nTorches are great for soldering, but are problematic in the kitchen. They give food a fuel-like off-flavor known as torch-taste. The Searzall eliminates torch-taste by forcing the torch\u2019s flame through two layers of fine, heatproof alloy mesh converting the majority of the flame to infra-red, radiant heat \u2013a cook\u2019s best friend. Now you can have high-quality finish for sous-vide and low temperature meats and other foods without the unsavory aromas typically associated with a blowtorch and without breaking the bank for large and expensive pieces of professional cooking equipment.\nWHY IS IT NECESSARY?\nThe backbone of the modern culinary revolution is sous-vide and low temperature cooking. By using very accurate cooking equipment like the immersion circulator you can now cook a product all the way through with flawless consistency. The problem is, sous-vide leaves the surface of food pale and crustless. Professional chefs have long known that the best way to get a really good crusty-cooked surface on a piece of succulent sous-vide meat is by using fire \u2013very hot fire. Unfortunately, that sort of heat isn\u2019t available to most people \u2013especially at home. Booker and Dax founder Dave Arnold thought long and hard about this problem during the years he spent teaching sous-vide and low-temperature cooking to thousands of students at the French Culinary Institute. The Searzall was his answer. While sous-vide / low temperature cooking was the original impetus for Dave's invention, it's not the only reason to use one. The Searzall's power is instant and portable. Carry it to a picnic, a catering event, or your mom\u2019s house at the holidays and be searing in seconds. Whether you are cooking a fish at the beach, toasting the cheese on a burger at a cookout, fixing up the holiday roast, or finishing off that 6 hour sous-vide rib-steak, the Searzall will be your buddy.\nTORCH TASTE:\nAnyone who's used a torch in the kitchen is familiar with the unpleasant phenomenon of torch taste. Torch taste is bad. For years we assumed that torch taste was caused by the fuel itself \u2013by propane and butane and the chemicals added to them. Not true. Tests run for us at UC Davis indicate that torch taste is caused by the creation of new, unpleasant, chemical compounds on the food when the heat is too high. We did a chemical analysis of food cooked with a naked torch and with a Searzall, and found that the Searzall did, in fact, eliminate torch-taste (see chart below). We also did a lot of taste tests which showed the same result.\nThe flame from a regular blowtorch is designed for soldering and welding, and its intense, focused heat can be far too aggressive for food. Even in the hands of the most experienced cooks, the torch is notorious for charring food in some spots while leaving other underdone. With the Searzall, the temperature is high enough to create a great sear, but it's more even and more controlled. The heat is spread out and softened, and the results are predictable and delicious.\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nThe Searzall is a patent pending cone-shaped metal chamber that sits in front of the flame of a torch. The torch flame passes through the cone and hits a layer of super-high temperature alloy mesh that spreads out the flame and converts some of it to infra-red radiant heat. A second layer of high temperature mesh evens the heat out and produces the characteristic burning orange eye of the Searzall. The interior of the cone is lined with high-temperature light-weight ceramic insulation and more mesh. The insulation capture the heat that would be radiated towards your hand and re-radiates it out the front of the cone, increasing efficiency and your comfort. The result: a hand-held radiant broiler. Because the Searzall is made of lightweight materials, it heats up very quickly, and it doesn\u2019t stay hot too long. Around the outside of the Searzall is a wire safety cage that prevents the hot cone from touching you or catching your counter on fire if you drop it.\nRadiant heat is much gentler and allows for more even cooking than direct heat. Click on the photo to read the Cooking Issues blog post on the Searzall.\nThe Searzall needs to be held much closer than a traditional torch to the item being seared. Typically 1-2 inches works best.\nWHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?\nHere are just a few of the foods we've cooked with the Searzall:\nsteak\nscallops\nburgers\nreheating pizza\ns'mores\nfoie gras\ngrilled cheese\nfish\npoultry\nwhatever else you got\nOur friends Phil and Rachel searing s'mores in Central Park.\nWhether you're finishing plates at a catering event or making a quick, alfresco lunch, the Searzall's power and portability make it the ideal finishing tool.\nSEARZALL VERSUS THE COMPETITION\nNaked Torch: The naked torch is no good for meats or breads, cheese, or most foods with fats. We still use a naked torch for cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\nElectric Heat Gun: The heat gun does not produce a torch taste, but has a lot less power than the Searzall and is tethered to an electrical outlet.\nPan: Professional restaurant ranges have burners that burn in excess of 30,000 Btu's per hour of gas. These burners can adequately sear meat in a pan. A range will also allow you to cook much more product and doesn't need the constant attention that a Searzall requires. Unfortunately, panned meat tastes different from broiled meat. Even restaurant ranges are not as good as a Searzall for applications like foie gras, and a pan can't toast cheese. Pans on home burners can never match the Searzall. \nBroiler: Broilers can cook a lot more product at once than a Searzall can, but home broilers have inadequate power for cooking fish and finishing low temperature and sous-vide meats. Home broilers are good for melting cheese, but the Searzall is often more convenient. Restaurant Salamanders have adequate power for most applications except finishing sous-vide and low temperature meats, but are not portable and are expensive. Commercial Deck broilers are awesome, but most people don't have access to one.\nPROJECT STATUS\nToday, there are a couple of dozen prototype Searzalls, made by the three of us. We've loaned those prototypes to chefs and power users including:\nDavid Chang and his team at Momofuku\nWylie Dufresne of WD-50 and Alder\nNathan Myhrvold and the Modernist Gang\nPaul Adams Online and Food Editor from Popular Science\nNils Noren from Red Rooster\nMark Ladner from Del Posto\nMichael Natkin, popular vegetarian cookbook author\nDaisuke Nakazawa of Nakazawa Sushi\nMicheal Anthony of Gramercy Tavern\nThe feedback from these testers and others was essential in shaping the product, determining its strengths and weaknesses, and helping us improve.  \nOur prototypes work very well, but we need to finalize the design for production. Twenty beta testers (you could be one!) will help us pin down the finishing touches and secure safety underwriting, after which manufacturing will begin.The finished Searzall will arrive in your hands in June 2014.\nWHAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION PAYING FOR?\nWe have invested thousands of dollars and thousands of hours creating the Searzall. We've been making them by hand in the Booker and Dax basement in NYC, using repurposed pieces of steel cocktail shakers and old broilers. We burned through hundreds of mesh samples made from ten different heat-resistant alloys before settling on a material, more commonly used inside jet engines, that can withstand extreme heat over prolonged use.\nAfter a lot of research, we've located the factories that can meet our standards. To get the production line moving we must make a big investment in tooling, die-making, and travel. The $80,000 from Kickstarter will make this possible. \nFAQ\nQ: Will it work on my existing torch?\nA: We strongly recommend the Bernz-O-Matic TS8000 for maximum output. It provides 14,282 Btu per hour (with propane). The Searzall also fits the TS4000. We don't recommend it for Iwatani butane torches yet - we are working on a specialized tank clamp to provide the required stability.\nQ: What kind of fuel tanks should I use?\nA: We only recommend using 16.4 ounce camping tanks of propane. Thinner cylinders are not stable enough.\nQ: How long will the Searzall run on a tank of propane?\nA: With the recommended Bernz-O-Matic TS8000 the Searzall will run for an hour and 45 minutes on a 16.4 ounce tank. That is a lot of toasted cheese.\nQ: Is it dangerous?\nA: Kitchen equipment is inherently dangerous. Knives are sharp; torches are hot. The Searzall has safety features built in to mitigate potential injuries, but it uses a very hot flame -- so use common sense.\nQ: How long does the Searzall take to cook something?\nA: That depends. We usually sear steaks from 1-2 minutes per side. Foie gras is done in under 30 seconds per side. Bread toasts in 30 seconds or less. The Searzall's heat is powerful,but  its cone is small. You won't use it to sear 50 steaks at once, but you'll love it for two or three at a time. We have put out a plated dinner for twelve using 2 Searzalls (double fisting).\nQ: How do I assemble the Searzall?\n\nA: Watch this simple how-to video!\nPLAY\n\nQ: How long does it take after you turn on the torch for the Searzall to be ready to sear?\nA: A couple seconds. Here is a video:\nPLAY\n\nQ. What about the Iwatani Torch, can you please support it?\nA. We would love to, but the Iwatani has several features that make it very difficult for us to support. Look at the picture below:\nThe Searzall cone was, in fact, designed to fit the Iwatani, and as you can see in the upper-right inset, the Searzall runs on the Iwatani like a champ. Now the problems. The torches we recommend have triggers that control both the gas and the ignitor. Press button: get fire. Release button: turn off fire. On the Iwatani you have to turn on the gas (A) then pull the trigger (B) to ignite. When you release the trigger, the flame persists till you turn off the gas valve. This is not ideal for Searzall use. More alarming:\nThe Iwatani fastens to the butane bottle via a quarter turn adapter (D) with no lock. We don't like that\nThe air intake adjust (C) is very easy to accidentally mis-adjust\nThe piezo ignitor (E) is exposed at the end of the flame tube and tends to melt when using the Searzall making it necessary to light the Iwatani with a second flame source\nEven not attached to a Searzall the end of the flame tube tends to cherry up (G). This is exacerbated by the Searzall. The Iwatani also has flamelets that come of the end of the flame tube (H) that tend to lap on the back of the Searzall cone. To fix this we'd have to enlarge the inlet hole, which would increase backwards radiation (I), furthering the problem of melting the ignitor.\nIn short, we can fix the quarter turn fastener problem, but we could only support the Iwatani by telling you we are going to ruin the piezo ignitor, and we aren't willing to do that.\nQ: Can you show us a video of searing something from start-to-finish?\nA:  Sure! Check out our video!\nPLAY\n\nQ: What are the performance differences of the Searzall when used with different torches and gasses? Will it work on my torch with my gas?\nA: We have made a video comparing searing a raw hamburger with the Bernzomatic TS4000 and TS8000 using both propane and MAP//Pro (propylene, real MAPP no longer available) and, for reference, the Iwatani running on butane. Everything was seared \"to eye\" just as you would do it at home. Interestingly, the Map//pro provided very little speed advantage on the TS8000, but a significant advantage on the TS4000.\nPLAY\n\nWe will post a list of all torches we have specifically investigated. For us to officially support a particular torch, we would need to test it. In general, torches need to meet some fundamental requirements:\nHave an equivalent power between the Bernzomatic TS4000 and TS8000 (Btu's don't really tell the story, but for some idea, the TS8000 burns 14282 Btu's of propane per hour, the TS4000 burns 6732 Btu's of propane according to Bernzomatic) and an equivalent flame shape.\nCombination trigger gas valve and ignition.\nNozzle diameter between 0.625 inches (15.9mm) and 0.610 inches (15.5mm) at the point of clamping (smaller sizes could possibly be adapted) OR between 0.872 inches (22.15mm) and 0.856 inches (21.75mm) at point of clamping.\nMinimum clampable nozzle length measured from end of nozzle: 1.73 inches (44mm).\nOperate properly at an angle that places the Searzall screen parallel to a horizontal surface.\nBe stable\nQ: How fast does the Searzall cool down?\nA: Our friend Paul took some infra-red photos of the Searzall as it cooled off over the course of 7 minutes. How to read the photo: \nThe numerical degree shown in each thumbnail is taken where the cross-hairs are and corresponds to the interior screen area of the Searzall. Not a place you will touch. \nPaul's camera maxes out at 270C, that is why the first photos say 270. The front end of a running Searzall is considerably hotter than that.\nNotice that the safety cage --the part that you would touch-- is safe within about minute --the inner cone a couple minutes later. The interior stays hot about 3 minutes, and warm about 7 minutes.\nIf you get a lot of flame lapping on your Searzall when doing fatty foods like steaks, your initial outer cone temperature will be higher than shown, but the cage will cool down just as quickly. That is why the cage is only wire --lighter weight cools quicker and burns less if touched when hot.\nQ: Will the Searzall finish chicken cooked low-temperature?\nA: It sure can. Check out this video:\nPLAY\n\nWe circulated the chicken breast at 63 degrees Celcius for one hour then removed it from the bag, patted it dry, brushed it with oil, sprinkled with salt and seared.\nThe Searzall needs to be held slightly farther away from the chicken breast than a steak because the skin is more delicate and will burn. \nTHE TEAM\nDAVE, basically he's spent his whole life gearing up just to bring you the Searzall.\nNASTASSIA has worked with Dave for four years, starting at the FCI, and helped him start Booker and Dax in May 2011. \"I just make sure everything runs smoothly.\"\nPIPER started with Dave as an intern at FCI, then worked at WD-50 and food ingredient manufacturer CPKelco, before coming on full-time to manage the Booker and Dax lab in October 2012. \"I make the Searzalls, I test the Searzalls, I cook the meat.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Searzall is a product that is designed to withstand and contain intense heat yet be lightweight. The mesh that we use is operating at the very limit possible with high-temperature metallurgy. We have been testing many different versions of similar alloys and have found one that can take it. There is always a possibility that our manufacturer can mess up a run of mesh. Such an occurrence would not be insurmountable, but would set us back. Additionally, there is the hurdle of independent lab testing to jump over. It is not completely clear how that process will go because labs can only be approached to test finished production products. We have tried to minimize this potential problem by not manufacturing the torch itself. By only manufacturing an attachment for a torch, a lot of the testing necessary for a product that deals with flames is obviated. \nEnsuring that the Searzall is manufactured with safety and reliability in mind is paramount. Proper inspection and testing will take place before the Searzall is ready for commercial sales. While unlikely, some unforeseen safety issues could arise on inspection that could set back our schedule. We will not release a product we would not sell to our families.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Searzall forum update", "update_content": "Hey Backers, \nWe've been getting some feedback that the forum link in the last update has stopped working, so here's the direct link: http://searzallforum.freeforums.net\nHappy Searing!\n-Booker & Dax Lab"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Searzall Forums Now Open!", "update_content": "Howdy Backers,\nWe've now created a place for Searzall backers like you to discuss techniques, tips and ideas with other Searzall fans.

Humans have poor night vision compared to many animals, in part because the human eye lacks a tapetum lucidum.\nSpectrum of visible and invisible light\nHuman vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light.\nSnooperscope enables the user to see objects in the dark by illuminating the object with infrared radiation and converting the reflected radiation into a visual image.\nThe resulting scene, which is apparently dark to a human observer, appears as a visible image to the Snooperscope, and this image and video are sent wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet.\nThe rewards\nApplications and experimental uses\nSnooperscope has virtually unlimited applications in experimental projects.\nSnooperscope Labs: some experiments made with the Snooperscope\nHere are some applications you can use with your Snooperscope:\nNIGHT VISION\nSnooperscope can maximize your smartphone and tablet in the dark, and improve visibility in low light conditions!\nUse Snooperscope if you are frequently alone at home and you feel uneasy when you hear strange sounds outside. If it is a cat or a dog, you can relax; if it is a two-legged prowler, you can call the police who can cope with the unsuspecting intruder!\nThe Snooperscope infrared light is not visible to the human eye\nIf you live in an area where it is wise to check the identity of a night visitor before opening the door, use the Snooperscope as an invisible security guard through your home windows, or position it where it can illuminate the doorway, and you can secretly observe the location. You can thus identify the visitor without turning on outside lights.\nA more pleasant theatre application of the Snooperscope, in both professional and amateur productions, is to study audience reactions in the dark as the play or other performance progresses. These observations may provide clues for smoothing the production.\nCreate eerie scenes inside a family household! With Snooperscope you can see the infrared tracking dots, a feature of the Kinect, like seen in the movie Paranormal Activity 4. Test it out to see how it really works and how it would look on Snooperscope. Turn off all the lights, turn on the Kinect, aim Snooperscope away from the Kinect and you will see there's this stuff going on in the house that you can't see.\nTheatre application for audience reactions and Kinect tracking dots\nAnd with Snooperscope right at home you can perform some starling theatrics. Hide the device in a convenient closet or cupboard before your guests arrive. When all are present, seat them at one end of the room and turn out all the lights. In the pitch dark, you can describe every little action of each individual on the far end of the room. Most people are unfamiliar with the Snooperscope and the night vision, and will be dumbfounded by your ability to see in the dark!\nPAINT\nSince the infrared reflection of pigments in paints and inks is different from that of white light, it is possible to detect forged paintings and checks by the way the color appears.\nSnooperscope is able to create revealing images using reflected infrared light, internal defects that are not evident in visible light, the use of different materials, and sometimes the artist's pencil.\nINFRARED TRANSPARENCY\nSome objects appear opaque in daylight, but with Snooperscope they are transparent!\nA jar of jam nuts appears transparent! A coke with an inscription hidden in the back of the bottle not visible in daylight as appears with the Snooperscope!\nJam and coke in the darkness are completely transparent!\nWith Snooperscope, Teddy's glasses appear transparent and he has bleached white tie and feet: nice effect!\nCRIME AND FORGERIES\nCrime detection laboratories are now using similar equipment for reading through certain types of material. You can attach Snooperscope to a microscope and greatly broaden your observation because many substances react very differently to infrared light than they do to visible light. Snooperscope's infrareds can penetrate deeper into some materials (e.g. animal tissues) and permit examination below the surface. Document forgeries can often be detected with infrared and many colored objects react strangely to the invisible light.\nWith Snooperscope you can see what is written under inks\nIn this example we have spotted some India ink on a page over some writing. Your eyes will only see the blackened spot, but the Snooperscope will peer through the top layer of ink and reveal the writing just as clearly as if there were no top coating. This method permits instantaneous examination which often is often of great convenience.\nNOCTURNAL AND WILD ANIMALS\nUse Snooperscope to study the behaviour of small nocturnal animals in total darkness. Naturalists and campers will find the Snooperscope an ideal instrument with which to study the habits of nocturnal wildlife. Unlike an ordinary flashlight, the invisible infrared beam of the Snooperscope will not frighten away the animals under observation. Another useful application is in photography of wild animals. Snooperscope can be used as part of your mobile device and it can be a valuable observation device. Many wildlife pictures can now be made by observing the animal from a distance and tripping the shutter when the creature is in the best possible position. Even a video can be made better. Farmers and ranchers may find Snooperscope a practical device for observing predators that harass livestock, chickens, etc. Ordinary lights will scare off such pests before they are properly identified, whereas their movements can be easily observed with the Snooperscope and more effective countermeasures can be taken.\nBOTANICAL\nUse it with a micro-lens to study bacteriological and botanical specimens under infrared rays. Certain large molecules may now be examined in a different way, since they become transparent using Snooperscope.\nENVIRONMENT\nSnooperscope can be an infrared optical air quality sensor, designed to sense dust particles. Snooperscope is especially effective at detecting very fine particles like cigarette smoke, dust, pollution and other particles in the air, and can be used as an air purifier system.\nTEXTILE\nMany colored textiles will appear in different colors; for example, some black or red textiles will appear white when viewed with the Snooperscope, while others appear very dark. The difference is due to the use of different types of dyes in coloring the materials. Uneven, poor-quality dyeing of fabrics can often be spotted.\nColored textiles and fruits-vegetables as they appear with the Snooperscope.\nCOMMUNICATION\nWith two sets of Snooperscope you can blink invisible Morse code signals over a distance of a mile or more. Momentarily cover each Snooperscope with your hand and then blink the invisible signals, which your distant partner can detect.\nSnooperscope has standard threads for installation on tripods, car mounts and universal stands\nThe story and the evolution of Snooperscope\nThe Snooperscope were designed originally for military use to enable infantrymen to secretly observe the enemy and aim rifles accurately in total darkness.\nWhen the infrared light source is turned on, the user, by employing a special eyepiece, can see in the area covered by the light, although to the naked eye total darkness still prevails.\nHowever, these same devices have countless peacetime applications, having nothing whatsoever to do with guerrilla warfare.\nThe Snooperscope has a lot of practical applications:  night vision, communications, botanical, environment, paint, observation and lot of others.\nAnd with this project, we are reinventing the Snooperscope for the 21st century using your mobile device or tablet.\nEvolution of Snooperscope, infrared and camera sensor, battery and power supply\nThe Snooperscope App\nThe Snooperscope App is available for iOS and Android.\nThe App is really easy to setup and use:\ndownload it free from the App Store or Google Play\npair Snooperscope with a direct Wi-Fi connection to your smartphone or tablet (no router needed)\nopen the App and you are done!\nWant to capture what you're seeing on your smartphone?\nSimply click the snapshot icon on the App to take still pictures or click the record icon to record an actual video and save it.\nThe snapshots will come up so it's easy to save them as a JPEG in your smartphone.\nThe recorded video will automatically save as an MPEG.\nSnooperscope: how the prototype works\nDevelopment Process\nSketches and 3D rendering\nMolding prototypes\nCamera sensor, lens, infrared leds: work in progress!\nAntenna prototypes, camera sensor testing with Arduino, the wifi chipset\nFirst and second version hardware prototypes\nSnooperscope technical specifications\nSnooperscope runs through a Wi-Fi peer-to-peer connection, meaning it's protected with a secure video feed.\nSnooperscope uses H.264 video compression.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story? Send us an email with your story idea(s) and if it's a story that fits the bill (and we have the # of backers to do it! ) we'll send our high-end video production team around the country to capture the best of best. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur 10-Year Hoodie project taught us that making a great product in a bunch of colors and sizes can get pretty complicated.

Thanks to you we've raised enough to make 3 more Morph episodes! Scroll down to see our next stretch goal!\nWe love Morph here at Aardman. He\u2019s one of the first characters we created when we started out in the crazy world of animation.  He was originally in a programme called Take Hart, where he lived on the desk of the artist and presenter, Tony Hart. He was a simple clay character who would mess up Tony\u2019s desk and get into all kinds of mischief while Tony wasn't looking. Due to his metamorphosing capabilities, we decided to call him Morph!  Here are some of his classic moments from the show:\nPLAY\n\nI\u2019m amazed and humbled that even though it has been over 30 years since his birth, the little guy still has such a passionate following on Facebook and YouTube. We\u2019ve had so many people asking for him to make a comeback that I thought it\u2019s about time we start hatching a plan.\nThe world has changed a lot since Dave (Morph\u2019s co-creator) and I were first sat in a tiny studio, away from civilisation, making little films about a clay character that messed up Tony Hart\u2019s desk and simply hoping that an audience would like them. Something wondrous came along called \u2018the Internet\u2019 which broke down the divide between programme creators and their audience so that nowadays we don\u2019t have to second-guess what our audience want, we can just ask them! \nOne from the album: Dave and I working on Morph's original adventures!\nI love the idea that Kickstarter can give us the creative freedom to fundraise and work directly with our audience.  After checking with Morph\u2019s Facebook fans it seems that they\u2019d be interested too, which is a great start!  So now\u2019s our chance, yours and mine together, to see how this can work out and how we can make some great new Morph films.\nRight, let's get on to the fun bit! If you help us reach our Kickstarter target, here\u2019s what we plan to do with the money:\nWhat? Morph\u2019s adventures have always worked best as short films, and so we plan to make 12 new one-minute episodes, which we will release online for everyone to enjoy.\nEarly sketches: the 'magic hole' gag\nHow? Staying true to the original format, we plan to shoot the episodes using clay and traditional stop-frame animation, in Morph\u2019s original home at Aardman studios in Bristol. I will be dusting off the director\u2019s chair and there\u2019s an eager team of expert animators ready for the challenge.\nMaking Morph: each Morph puppet is sculpted by hand out of clay.\nWhen? If we reach our goal, production will start in January with the aim of finishing the episodes and releasing them online by July.\nAnd what about storylines? I have plenty of ideas up my sleeve for new Morph adventures and scripting would start in January.  I\u2019m very keen on keeping the humour, slapstick and surrealism of the originals, whilst at the same time bringing Morph slightly more in line with the modern world....\nYou're invited! The exciting part for us, something we\u2019ve wanted to try for a while, is that we can ask you to be involved in the production as we go along. We want you to have a window on to the production floor so you can see the episodes taking shape, ask us questions, submit ideas, be part of the Morph crew! If we get our funding, production will start in the new year, so get your thinking caps on!\nAfter asking Morph\u2019s Facebook fans what they\u2019d like to see, hopefully we\u2019ve come up with a juicy package of rewards that will tantalise the taste buds of Morph fans old and new.\nWe want to work with you to make the episodes you want to watch, so all levels of backers will have access to a private production blog.  From here you\u2019ll be able to follow the production from its beginnings in script, to storyboards, animatics, animation and release, but more importantly than this, we want to invite you to comment, vote and submit ideas as we go along that will shape the final episodes.\nAdditionally, if you\u2019d like to pledge more to the production, we\u2019ve got a host of exclusive goodies to offer - from crew t-shirts and special edition prints, up to studio tours and your very own Morph models.  I\u2019m extremely excited - we\u2019ve never opened up our studio in this way before and I hope you all find something suitable as a memento of your contribution to the project.\nIf there\u2019s a reward you would like that isn\u2019t listed, leave us a comment and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\nYOUR MORPHNESS\nA few of you have been asking what an earth a Morphness is! Well, we will make a version of you (or your favourite celeb) into a Morph figurine, including hairstyles, accessories \u2013 the works!\nTo give you a better idea of the process, here\u2019s a video of our chief model maker Enty creating a Morphness. There was no question when it came to picking a famous personality to recreate - it had to be legendary artist, presenter and our dear friend, the late great Tony Hart.\nNEW REWARD!\nIt\u2019s safe to say that my brain has been swimming with Morph ideas lately, and it\u2019s all been spilling out into my sketch pad. I\u2019ve decided to offer some of these up as rewards on our page, including the one below, in return for your generous pledges.\nRight then you lovely lot! Thanks to YOU we\u2019ve fully funded our campaign to make 15 new adventures of Morph. Huzzah!\nThere's still time left on the campaign and we have plenty of juicy rewards left. If Morph\u2019s fans would like to keep pledging, we\u2019d LOVE to make some more Morph adventures! After batting my eyelids and telling our accountant that he looked very pretty, he\u2019s allowed us to add a contribution towards the production costs of the extra episodes - but we\u2019d need the following amount from you to make it happen:\n...and you will of course get a copy of any additional episodes created as part of your digital download or DVD reward.\nSo I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again for all your support and I hope you like the new part of our plan! You thought you were getting 12 episodes, but thanks to your amazing efforts, it looks as if there'll be more!

With PowerUp 3.0, we are pushing the limits of Bluetooth Smart technology.\n\nIn comparison, our iOS code has been tested and perfected over the past 1.5 years as we have worked with Apple in finding and fixing problems in Apple\u2019s own Bluetooth implementation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Guess What?

This kind of device is called an intervalometer. Michron is special because it has no buttons or screens; instead the user interface is the Michron App on your smart phone (Android or iPhone). \nOnce you\u2019ve created your settings in the app, upload them by plugging your phone into Michron with the programming cable. After you have uploaded your settings, you can disconnect your phone. Michron will perform completely on its own. Once Michron is plugged into the trigger port, it will tell your camera to take photos according to your settings. And don't worry, Michron's battery has a life of over 2500 hours, meaning you will probably never have to replace it (and if you do, it's easy to replace).\nWhat is a timelapse?\nA timelapse is a collection of photos taken over a period of time that are then compiled together to create a video that expresses time in a way not normally seen. Timelapse photography gives you the freedom to visualize the passage of time as you want, allowing for infinite creativity. To see one of the many videos that got us inspired by timelapse photography, check out http://vimeo.com/23237102\nWhich cameras does Michron work with?\nMichron works with any camera with an external trigger port. This includes almost all DSLR's and a growing number of point and shoot cameras (to see the full list, please see our FAQ). We will confirm your camera make and model when we send out our survey to ensure that you get the appropriate cable for your camera. \nHow do you turn the photos into a video?\nMichron tells your camera to take photos at the interval you designate in the app. After you are done collecting the photos you can open them into any one of a handful of free or purchased programs (Timelapse Assembler, Lightroom, etc) which will quickly turn your photos into the final video. Although it is straightforward, we will also provide a short video showing how to use these programs as part of our manual.\nTutorials:\nWe will provide a few tutorial videos to help you get started taking timelapses. In these videos we will show you how to use each individual feature of Michron as well as share some tips and tricks that we have learned from our experience on how to take better timelapses.\nMade In America\nMichron will be manufactured and assembled in the United States, although certain items such as accessory cables and electronics components may be sourced through non-domestic channels since many of these items are not made in the United States. \nFeatures\nMichron is programmed by your Android or iOS device (If you don't have one of these, check our out FAQ for some more information), allowing us to program in some cool features not feasible on a device sporting an LCD screen and a few buttons. \nAutoTimelapse\u2122:\nIf you are completely new to photography or timelapse this optional feature is for you! Put your camera in Landscape mode (or Portrait, Night Scene, etc) and pick a pre-made setting on Michron: People, Clouds, Landscape, Cityscape, Stars. From these presets, Michron creates all the settings for you and works with your camera as it shoots in Auto.\nIntervalometers typically require the photographer to shoot in Manual (meaning the user adjusts the camera exposure) but many people do not know how to do this. AutoTimelapse fixes this problem and makes timelapse accessible to all photographers.\nInterval Ramping:\nInterval ramping allows users to change the interval between shots during the timelapse. For example: most timelapses are taken at a fixed interval, such as one photo every 30 seconds for 2 hours. With interval ramping, you can start at 30 seconds, then speed up to every 5 seconds at the one hour mark, and then slow down again to every 60 seconds for the last 15 minutes of the timelapse. (See the clock shot in the video!)\nBulb Ramping:\nBulb ramping allows you to make smooth light transitions. Michron will continually adjust the shutter speed of the camera according to your settings. This feature is extremely useful in shots with dynamic lighting such as a sunset or sunrise. Michron is designed to work with or without a PC Sync cable. \nHDR Bracketing*:\nThis feature allows you to make multiple exposures for every photo you take in your timelapse. Instead of taking a single photo after each interval, your camera takes a set of three closely-spaced photos, each at a different exposure. You can then later edit each batch of three photos into an HDR image in your photo software of choice and compile an HDR timelapse.\n*HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, meaning an image that has very dark parts and very bright parts. Bracketing means taking multiple photos of the same image at different exposures.\nExternal Trigger:\nThis is an awesome little feature. For new photographers, this is something you want to have. For experienced photographers, it will be nice to know you have an extra one in your camera bag. This feature allows you to take a photo on your camera by triggering it through your phone, from a distance of about two feet. This eliminates camera shake, allowing you to take sharper images (no blur!).\nPortable:\nWe've made Michron as small as possible, so that you can take it wherever you go without even realizing it's there. And, since it's designed to sit in your camera's hotshoe, it will stay out of the way when in use. \nStretch Goal!\n 2500 Backers- Photo Booth:\nThis feature will allow you to take easy group or self portraits, even when your camera is far away from what is being shot. Many cameras already have a self timer feature for taking photos such as this, but typically the delay is only for 10 seconds and does not let you control how many photos are taken. This was a big complaint of Steve\u2019s after spending 20 minutes trying to get a group shot on top of a rock (there was lots of running involved) so we\u2019d love to add it into Michron.\nGoofy Poses Optional\nWith the Photobooth feature, you can set how long the delay is, how many photos to take, and how long between each photo. That way, you have plenty of time to get into position and take all the photos you want. Basically, Photobooth is everything you wish you camera self timer could do.\nNot just for timelapse:\nMichron was designed to be as flexible as possible because we know what creative people can do with a tool like this. Because Michron is, at the heart of it, taking numerous still photos at a set interval, it can be used for a few other things as well, although we are sure you will think of many more:\nEasily take multiple photos for self portrait and group shots\nStop motion and claymation\nPhoto stitching\nThe Project:\nWe have been working on this project for several months now and are ready to launch. We have finished our R&D and have a refined prototype that is sourced and ready to manufacture. However, manufacturing and delivering a physical product is not cheap, which is why we are really excited to be here on Kickstarter asking for your support. This money will fund the first production run of the Michron. The money raised here will go to the following: \nUp-front, one-time manufacturing costs\nPer unit manufacturing cost and accessory cables\nShipping \nThe App:\nThe Michron App is a licensed and adapted version of the Android- and iPhone-compatible smartphone interface originally developed by Alpine Labs for Radian. The app is free and will be available for download through the Google and Apple app stores. The app is compatible with all Android devices newer than 2.3 (aka Gingerbread), and all iOS devices running iOS 5.0 or newer.\nHow Michron Got Here\nMichron has come a long way from Steve's first sketches drawn in the back of a taxi in China. \nUtilizing 3D printing, both on a home printer and using commercial services, we were able to rapidly iterate the mechanical design, to create a package that is both compact and functional. In addition, we have worked extensively with the company that will be producing our injection molded parts to ensure that the Michron enclosure can be made to our specifications.\nIn addition to the mechanical design and iteration (the visible parts) significant work went into miniaturizing the printed circuit boards to help us shrink the housing even further. Fortunately, the first PCB we designed worked great, and shrinking it down went smoothly as well. We've since moved the ports around to improve fit for our V3 boards, which are in the mail. \nOnce the printed circuit boards were working happily, we had to nail down the firmware (the code that runs on Michron) so that it plays well with the smartphone app, and could execute all of our advanced features. Ultimately the Michron to phone interface went smoothly, thanks to Steve's past experience with Radian, but it still took a good deal of time, and we are still adding and altering some small features as we continue to get feedback from our users. \nTimeline\nAs soon as we reach our funding goal we will order the molds for Michron's housing (this is one of the slowest steps in manufacturing). This will allow us to start a major part of the manufacturing process before the campaign ends, enabling us to deliver the Michron to you even faster. Barring any unforeseen manufacturing issues (explained under \"Risks and Challenges\"), we expect to package and ship your Michron in March.\nAccountability\nWe will email our backers with regular updates regarding the production process as well as provide behind the scenes footage from the manufacturing floor. We promise to run a transparent campaign and to keep our backers up-to-date and informed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects, there is the possibility for issues outside of our control to appear. While we have done everything in our power to ensure that Michron is completely ready to go, there is always the chance of delays in manufacturing due to the following: \n\n- Firmware Bugs: although we have thoroughly tested the firmware, bugs could pop up as we continue to test and refine all features based on user feedback.\n\n- Manufacturing the housings : We have confirmed with our molder that the design can be easily manufactured, but it is possible that it takes longer than expected to produce parts that meet our quality standards.\n\n- PCB Component Lead Times : We have ensured that all electronics components are common and widely available, but there is the possibility of a sudden shortage of certain parts.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Spark is Live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Hi backers!\nIn case you missed it, we recently launched the latest addition to the Alpine Labs product family - Spark!

Throughout the world, the classic six-sided dice (d6) symbolize not only gaming, but also play and luck. \nSome say dice originated from the ankle bones of hoofed animals. But once the die developed into the pipped cube, the d6 stopped evolving.\nIsn't it time for a new spin on a classic? By making the d6 a dodecahedron, the die will not only roll better, but be more weight-balanced as opposing sides have the same number of engraved pips.\nDoublesix Dice can also be the perfect gateway accessory: Swap in your Doublesixes for the stale dice in your non-gamer friends' games (like Monopoly and Backgammon), and soon they will be wanting to take on Advanced D&D.\nIf you pledge to get your own Doublesix Dice and help this humble intiative, I pledge to provide you, in return, detailed transparency of the process, and satisfaction guaranteed (or your money back).\nWe will start with Black engraved pips on Ivory.

My name is Craig. I'm a designer who is passionate about words. In the case of this project - the words of the Gettysburg Address.\nThe words Lincoln spoke in November of 1863 hold as much significance today as they did 150 years ago. They should never be too distant or out of sight.\n\"...dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\n\"...we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\"\n\"The world will little note nor long remember what we say here...\"\nIt's that last statement that I'd like to address (no pun intended) with this project. I'd like to craft tangible pieces printed via letterpress that help to spread Lincoln's words in 2013.\nI was fortunate to acquire my first letterpress equipment four years ago from a retired printer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. What began as an unanticipated purchase has grown into a print shop with several presses and hundreds of cases of metal and wood type.\nThe print shop has functioned primarily as a weekend workshop space for students and friends. I'd like to try to extend its reach a bit farther with this Kickstarter project.\nThe History\nI live and work in a historically rich region of the United States. This past summer I was asked by a local writer to identify five design-minded things/places in central Pennsylvania that go unnoticed by most people. After several days of careful consideration I reacted with a list of five cemeteries, one of which was the Gettysburg National Cemetery; I have authored two blog posts about the topic on the RockPaperInk design blog:\nhttp://www.rockpaperink.com/content/column.php?id=599\nhttp://www.rockpaperink.com/content/column.php?id=670\nMy recent fascination with the design of memorials and cemeteries has rapidly grown into a heightened awareness of just how little attention we pay to the lessons of our shared history.\nThe Gettysburg Address in Lincoln's Handwriting (Library of Congress public domain image)\nI'd like to revisit the slower, hand-crafted letterpress printing techniques of the Civil War era. I desire to print pieces that will not only help to breathe life into the presses in the print shop but will also help spread the meaningful messages of the Gettysburg Address well past its 150th anniversary.\nThe Inspiration\nI have visited the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. and have made several trips in recent months to Gettysburg. My desk and messenger bag overflow with research. There are three core elements that sparked inspiration for this project:\n1) Lincoln's promising and powerful statements within the Gettysburg Address;\n2) Visits to historic sites in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania;\n3) The hand-carved typography of the full Gettysburg Address sculpted by Evelyn Beatrice Longman on the south wall of the Lincoln Memorial.\nGettysburg Address on the South Wall of the Lincoln Memorial (Library of Congress public domain image)\nThe Prints\nThe finished typographic composition of the entire Gettysburg Address will be printed by hand on a vintage Vandercook cylinder press. There will be two color options for the 12\"x18\" artwork: \n1) Black Ink on Crane Lettra Pearl or Lettra Ecru paper stock;\n2) Metallic Silver Ink on Crane Lettra Pearl or Lettra Ecru paper stock\nBlack and Metallic Silver on Lettra Pearl\nBlack and Metallic Silver Ink on Lettra Ecru\nThe font used will be Goudy Trajan Pro which is based on drawings from Frederic W. Goudy, one of the most prolific American type designers. The forms of the characters align well with the hand-carved inscription on the south wall of the Lincoln Memorial. However, its similarity in form to the inscription type is not the only reason I've chosen this font. There is serendipity in the fact that Lincoln, Illinois is the geographic midpoint between Springfield, IL (home of the Lincoln Presidential Library) and Bloomington, IL (birthplace of type designer Frederic W. Goudy).\nTo work close to the printing processes of the 1800s I am planning to print the completed art with a copper plate.\nThe Notebooks\nHandset metal type will be used to imprint key phrases from the Gettysburg Address on Moleskine\u00ae Cahier notebooks. Printed by hand on a vintage Chandler & Price platen press.\nMetallic Silver Ink will be used on three notebook colors: Black, Civil War Blue, and Civil War Gray - make sure to pay close attention to the color options if you select notebooks as your reward.\nMoleskine Cahier Notebooks in Three Colors\n24 pt Spartan Heavy Italic metal type\n30 pt Century Gothic Bold metal type\nThe Rewards\nAll of the rewards are being printed as limited editions of 150 pieces to correspond with the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address.\nEarly Bird options are available.\nYour order will be packed carefully.

I crossed the border into a country whose diverse cultures, landscapes and geographies were utterly compelling and challenging at the same time. Only a month earlier the world had been unmistakably transformed by Al Qaeda\u2019s attack on the World Trade Center in New York. Even then it was clear that the events of 9/11 would shape global political and military action for years to come. Over the next decade, I would keep returning to Afghanistan to visually report on this war-torn country.\nAn Afghan woman with severe burns on 45% of her body from self-immolation shows her scars at a hospital in Herat.\n\nPlease take a look at my Afghanistan book preview presentation on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/75869121\nAn elderly Afghan man holds his grand daughter at a makeshift refugee camp after their village was bombed.\nAfghanistan: Between Life and War is a book project which seeks to dispel the mystique that too often surrounds this much reported but little known country that spans Central and South Asia. While I was embedded with US forces on occasion, this project draws exclusively on my independent photography from the war-torn country. Through these pictures I attempt to show how Afghan people constructed and lived their lives against a backdrop of an unceasingly violent war and brutal Taliban insurgency. This is a story that spans the full spectrum of human experiences and emotions. Throughout the book I also focus on stories that give voice to people who have none.

Thanks to you, our backers, we have reached an amazing 800%+ of our goal! \n The Finex team and I will strive to live up to the level of confidence you have shown for us and the product. \n Please stay in contact by going to www.finexusa.com to continue to get information, and sign up for our newsletter. \nAgain: THANK YOU! \nMike Whitehead\n                                                                       A NOTE to the media: A full press page (with full resolution images) is available at www.finexusa.com/press-resources\n    Why did I start this?\nI love cast iron skillets but the well-finished ones are commanding an outrageous premium on Ebay, and they still have the old-school integrated handles that are too hot, too flat, and too small to use effectively. \nYou see, the newer skillets are just quickly cast and then tossed out for sale.  The insides (where the action happens!) are rough and build up a kind of gross burnt-food surface -- completely different than the wonderful carbon-based, inherently low-stick surface that a great cast iron skillet gains as it seasons.\nYou see, the inside of the newer cast iron skillets are NOT machined - they are left rough and rugged, which is a problem for serious cooks. They just don't release the food easily (leading to 'fractured foods'), nor do they allow that wonderful crispiness that forms on the bottom of skillet-cooked food to be picked up by a spatula and be transferred to your waiting plate. \nI decided that I needed to machine the inside of my skillets - despite the cost - because the surface finish on the skillet equaled the finish on the food.\nRe-designing a classic can seem brash\nI've completely re-worked the design. But, fear not! I've kept the best parts and then carefully added just the features that were really needed to upgrade this classic.  And, I got to use the best of current casting and machining technologies to really put it a 'step-above'!\nMade in the Pacific Northwest\nSourcing locally:\nOne design goal for me was to source everything in the US and to keep the sources close to my home city of Portland, Oregon. \nThis allowed me to use my existing sources of supply from my 'day job' (the ones I knew could, and would, perform well), and it let me keep a close eye on things and intervene with an on-site visit when needed (or when I wanted to watch industry-in-action!)\nPortland is known as a design and food-lovers destination - perfect for this skillet!\nIt's really hard to not love food when living in Portland. We've had the highest ratio of restaurants to population for decades. And, we were one of the earliest places for startups in the micro-brewery industry.\nInnovative Octagonal Shape\nThe octagonal shape lets you put the skillet on its side (like for drying it after washing) and it won't roll around like those 'other' skillets.\nPlus, it gives 6 directions that you can pour from, because each 'corner' becomes a pour-spout - it's a little bit like magic.\nThose flat sides also allow a spatula to slide in easily for getting under pancakes, fried eggs, etc.\nSpring Handle for Cooling and Comfortable Grip\nThere are three problems with the old-style skillet handle:\nThey are too small\nThey are too thin for comfort\nThey stay hot too long\nFinex has solved these problems!\nThe Finex spring handle harks back to the classic woodstove handles that kept us from burning our hands when stoking the fire. The spring design is both tried-and-true and brilliant.  \nThe spring handle has lots of air space so it cools quickly after being used in the oven or on a gas-burner stove-top.  \nPlus, its naturally curved shape fits in your hand giving a secure and comfortable grip, which is important when pouring or moving it around the kitchen with food in it. \nAnd, of course: it looks great!\nYou'll see that the handle is heavy-duty - it's made from 1/4\" diameter stainless steel. That makes it solid and easy to grab, yet open enough to cool quickly. \nThe bronze end-cap is a signature part of the skillet. It will also put up with anything you can throw at it in a kitchen environment. Bronze melts at 1,742 \u00b0F so unless you cook like my friend Charles, you'll be fine. (just joking about Charles' cooking!) :-)\n\nHere's a video of the prototyping prove-out run that we did at the spring house:\nCNC Machined Smooth Interior\nThe inside of the FINEX Skillet will be CNC machined. What this means for you is the inside will be very smooth - this makes it naturally less-stick, and easier to clean.\nPlus, it won't build up that scary-looking burnt-food 'ruggedness' that cheap import skillets grow over time - instead, it will season to a beautifully smooth carbonized surface that will cook like nothing else in the world.\nThis is what separates the great cast iron skillets from the 'cheap-os'. It adds cost and complexity to the manufacturing process but the results are stellar!\nManufacturing the Finex Skillet:\nThe Finex skillet will be cast using the oldest method around: SAND CASTING.  It may be the oldest method, but it's still the best for short-runs like this skillet! \nThe first-article pour will be streamed LIVE!\nOf course, over the last 2000+ years, sand-casting has improved dramatically, as have the alloys of cast iron. I'll be using one of the Northwest's premium sand-casting houses to pour these beauties, and I'll be on hand for the first pour, which we'll be streaming live as it happens. \nHere's a quick overview of how sand-casting is done:\nFirst, the design must available in digital form. Since the skillet was designed in CAD, that's already done.  \nThen, the CAD file is turned into toolpaths for a CNC vertical machining center to mill the pattern from a solid block of aluminum. \nUPDATE:\nThe Finex Skillet mold is being made from a polyurethane block that will then be embedded in an aluminum plate. Willamette Pattern chose to use the polyurethane board because it machines more easily and for the skillet it is a better choice.\nHere's a video of the mold being machined on Nov 5, 2013:\nAfter it is machined, the finished pattern mold is placed between two casting frames (called the flask, consisting of the the cope on top and the drag on bottom) and has the sand rammed in around it. The aluminum becomes the negative space that the molten cast iron is poured into.\nProject Timeline:\nThe Finex Coaster - a 'Thank You!' for our supporters\nWith over 90 craft breweries in the Portland area, it's hard for us not to appreciate a great coaster, and cork is the classic material, just like cast iron is the classic material for skillets.\nI offer these as a 'Thank you!' for supporting this project at $25.\n This cork coaster will be offered ONLY through Kickstarter for our backers.\nYES!  All Finex skillets will be lightly pre-seasoned\nSince launching the project many people have asked: \"Will it be pre-seasoned?\" The answer is \"Yes!\":\nYour Finex skillet will arrive lightly seasoned and include instructions for maintaining or re-seasoning it at any time.\nThe Finex skillet is seasoned with nature's ultimate oil - organic flaxseed oil that is cold-pressed and unrefined. Flax seed oil is fantastic at creating a hard, slick surface on cast iron that is the essence of cast iron's naturally low-stick cooking surface.\nIf you burn something in your skillet or a guest scrubs it with steel wool and soap (yipes!) - DON'T WORRY. Just use a little extra oil the next time you use it. When the cooking surface is this smooth it really takes the mystery out of seasoning the surface - that's one of the reasons we will be CNC machining the inside!\nHow much will the Finex Skillet weigh?\nThis is another question we've been getting and it points out that the (all-too-common) cheap import skillets are heavy! \nWhy? Because they use inferior alloys of cast iron, less fine-grained sand for casting, and don't machine the inside.\nAll of those bits of extra attention to detail and specifications will make the Finex Skillet weigh in at around 6 to 7 pounds vs. a 'cheapie' skillet at 8+ pounds.\nWe don't have exact numbers yet because the first round of actual cast iron casting will take place (with YOUR support!) in mid-November. But we can assure you that the Finex will be much easier to handle and work with on a regular basis than the cast iron skillets you can buy off the shelf currently.\nWe can tell you that the CAD system calculations say the skillet is right about 6.75 pounds and we've weighed the prototype spring handle at 1/2 pound, so that's a total of 7-1/4 pounds without the bronze knob at the end of the handle. \nThat's comparable to the weight of the best old-style skillet ever made, the Griswold 12\" (which has the problematic handle).  So, the Finex with that lusciously large handle will be a breeze to maneuver!\nIs a lid being planned?\nYes! A Finex skillet lid is being planned and we will announce it sometime after the first of the year.\nWe are making absolutely SURE that we do a great job of supporting our backers on this skillet before we take on more projects! \nHowever... we are excited about the lid as the Finex 8-sided design allows the lid to out-baste our competition with it\u2019s almost air tight fit and it doesn\u2019t have any air gaps where traditional pour spouts leak steam. \nMany people have asked about it scratching a glass stove top...\nCast iron is absolutely wonderful on smooth top ranges (glass and inductive heat).\nThat said, you are working on glass so I recommend minimizing how much you drag, slide or drop any cookware on glass topped ranges.\n A little bit about the team behind the Finex Skillet:\nDavid Lewin - Finex Industrial Designer\nDavid Lewin\nMike Whitehead approached David Lewin (http://www.lewindesigns.com/) with a gift of probably the hardest challenge an industrial designer could ask for -- create the ultimate functional product, using natural materials and local labor. Something that will literally last forever. \nDavid undertook shaping the skillet with respect to the traditions, added skillful insights and empathy for the everyday user. The result is a skillet that is elegant, versatile and a practical contribution to chefs everywhere.\nThank you, David!\n.\nKip Buck - Finex 3D modeler and drafter\nNike, Adidas, Keen, FILA, Lewin Design,Specialized, I Generator, ARIAT, Leupold are companies that Kip has had the pleasure to work with.

The vivid and colorful light created by the Sebbo lasts for hours on a single charge. It was invented by Sebastian Asvarksh (hence the name \"Sebbo\") and further developed into a professionally designed product by Erick Calderon. \nTake a Sebbo with you to any night time activity whether it be as a safety device or an extra bright fashion accessory. Bring a Sebbo to a sporting event programmed with your favorite team's colors! \nStrap a Sebbo onto your bike for increased visibility or keep it on your wrist for an evening run. Sebbos are great for music events, especially large music festivals! Or for the light artists out there the Sebbo can be used to take gorgeous long exposure photos.\nDesigned with aesthetics in mind.\nFrom the very first prototype, we designed the Sebbo to be an aesthetically driven product that is not just another generic \"light toy\". The Sebbo looks good both when illuminated as well as with the power off, and unlike a glow stick, the light intensity remains constant for the entire life of the battery.\nThe Enclosure   \nOne of the most complicated parts of developing the Sebbo was creating an enclosure for it that was both durable and easy to clean. The original hand made Sebbos were sealed in food saver bags and enclosed in spandex.\nNeedless to say they were filthy by the end of an action filled night. We experimented with many ideas, including the ability to remove the enclosure to allow for washing, but in the end we realized that taking the electronics in and out of the enclosure was cumbersome and rough on the circuitry. So after a troubling few months trying to find a suitable enclosure, we bit the bullet and hired Design Edge, a professional industrial design firm in Austin, TX, to help us come up with a solution. The results were enlightening. \nDesign Edge created a multi-layered enclosure consisting of black neoprene on the underside where the wristband contacts your skin and a special silicone backed rip-stop nylon fabric layer on the surface to diffuse the light. The result is a durable and light weight wristband that is easy to clean and maximizes light output.\nWe are super excited about this enclosure and think you will appreciate how comfortable it feels on your wrist.    \nThe Electronics\nLike circuits? Pledge at the $15 level and get an original signed and numbered screen print of the Sebbo circuitry!\nAlthough the final electronic component design of the Sebbo has been refined through collaboration with TenX, a professional electronic engineering firm in Austin, TX, the basic components have not changed from the original prototype. \nSebastian's original sketch of the Sebbo from our Arduino class.\nHere's how the original Sebbo prototype came together:\nAfter a few revisions, TenX took our bulky design and condensed it all onto a single flexible circuit, eliminating various unnecessary wires and soldering while creating this more reliable and efficient final design:\nThe Battery\nThe Sebbo uses an 800mAh Lithium Polymer battery for power. We've incorporated features that ensure safe operation including a protective case and safety circuit. Lithium Polymer batteries, however, can be dangerous if handled incorrectly. For this reason we're suggesting the Sebbo for ages 12 and up unless supervised by an adult. \nThe Firmware \nThe Sebbo is completely open source and Arduino compatible. Each Sebbo will come out of the box pre-programmed with the classic color cycle pattern like what you see in the videos plus various other patterns including an easy to use color picker mode.\nHere's a video that shows how the button works to switch banks and also to add and select colors in colorpicker mode: \nFor those of you that want to customize their Sebbo you'll be happy to know that you can upload your own Arduino sketches to the Sebbo through the standard Arduino interface.\nThe Sebbo Lights Kickstarter Launch\nWe have spent many hours and a fair amount of capital on every little detail of the design of the Sebbo. Now we just want them in our hands and we want them really bad. This Kickstarter campaign is going to allow us to put together a sizable enough initial order quantity to make the Sebbo viable for full scale production. We need to produce at least 1,000 units for any factory to even consider taking our order and we need your support to raise enough money to do that! Check out the rewards below to see how you can help us reach our goal.\nThe Rewards\nThe Party  \nIf you end up snagging a ticket, the Sebbo launch party will be an unforgettable experience that we think might even change the way we look at event lighting. For a long time Sebastian and I have toyed with the idea of a party where the only lighting comes from the guests. But the problem is that making enough prototypes for this idea to happen is cost and time prohibitive. So our Sebbo launch party will be a dream come true. We'll throw a warehouse-style party and every guest will receive a fully charged Sebbo as they walk through the door. \nOur vision is that the Sebbos on everyone's wrists will light up the entire room in a way that has not been done before encouraging an epic dance party! Of course a party is not complete without great music so you can count on us bringing in some great talent to keep the Sebbos in the air all night! Afterwards everyone will get to take their Sebbo home with them and they will be the first people to get their Sebbo. \nManufacturing Plan\nPart of making a project a success is having a solid manufacturing plan in place. The Sebbo will be manufactured in a few stages. \nWe've established a relationship with a shop in China that will make our circuits turnkey. They have been a valuable resource because not only are they printing the flex circuits but they are also sourcing all of the components and assembling the dozens of tiny pieces in the circuit in house. \nFrom there the Sebbo circuits will be air mailed to the USA where the battery will be soldered on and the firmware will be uploaded to the processor. We have secured quotes from local shops in Houston to do the work. Each unit will take approximately 2 minutes to solder, upload the code, and test to make sure the lights are working properly. \nThe last major stage in production is the assembly of the enclosure. We are working with a soft goods shop in Matamoros, Mexico for fabric related production of the Sebbo. They have been involved in the industrial design process and have given input so that we'll be able to make a smooth transition when it comes time to wrap up the circuits. They are also a turnkey shop so they will be sourcing the fabrics, magnetic enclosures, and silicone diffusion layer after which they'll assemble the finished product. We intend to provide them with the finished packaging so that by the time we get the units back from the shop they're ready to send. \nTimeline \nIf we secure backing for between 1,000 and 10,000 units:\nThe initial assembly of the circuit will take 8 weeks on the low side and 12 weeks on the high side depending on number of units. The circuit manufacturer has inquired into the lead time of each of the individual components on the board and has given us that estimate based on the tougher to source components. Shipping those circuits will take 1-2 weeks and the soft goods shop has offered to assemble up to 10,000 units in three weeks. \nIf we secure backing for 10,000+ units:\nWe would fulfill as many Sebbos as possible on the promised delivery schedule then start promising subsequent backers slightly extended delivery dates to accommodate the increased demand. This extra month would enable the circuit manufacturer a little extra time to locate components and allow the component manufacturers a little extra time to manufacture the individual components given that the demand is higher than their production capabilities. Even up to the 100,000 unit mark (that's 1.8 million LEDs, 900,000 shift registers) we are not requiring more components than manufacturer's monthly supply capabilities.\nThe Team\nSpecial Thanks\nRamping up for this Kickstarter Campaign has been a ton of fun and it would not be possible to be where we are without the help of a few key people! So I wanted to take a minute and send out a special thanks to a few people.\nI want to thank Bryan Lozano for his extreme patience and constant enthusiasm in filming and editing our Kickstarter video. It was a daunting task and he made it seem all too easy. Pete Molick was also a part of this process and I'm super grateful for the time he took to both help out with the filming as well as being part of the video!\nThen there are all the people that took time out of their busy days to participate in the Kickstarter video. Emma Vaudeville, from Lazuli Productions, spent an entire evening dancing with the Sebbo on the top of a parking garage. I think her part in the intro does a fantastic job showing what the Sebbo is all about. \nOur awesome video soundtrack came from the incredible guys in Raceway (www.soundcloud.com/raceway)! Check them out I think their track \"Constants are Changing\" really made the video come together!\nBesides Emma I want to thank Jeff Ewin, Lindsey Paulson, Tarah Henderson, Jamil Madni, and Jen Burk for their cameos in the video!\nDaniel Shchaeffer really put together a sweet initial firmware for the Sebbo. He added a ton of functionality that would definitely not had been there without his help and patience. \nAnd then there's Kit Morris and Chris Owens from Design Edge in Austin, TX for their awesome collaboration throughout the entire industrial design process. Also Daraius Hathiram and Andrew Polcik from TenX Precicion in Austin, TX for their awesome work on the circuitry. I would recommend both companies to anyone looking for professional assistance making their ideas become reality.\nAnd last but not least I would like to thank my amazing fiance Mara McCumber and my family for their undying support over the last few months preparing for this Kickstarter campaign. Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy putting this much time and effort into an LED wristband, but they constantly remind me to stay on track and keep moving forward because if I believe in something this much it must be worth it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPart of our investment into the professional electronic and industrial design of the product consisted of securing our suppliers and streamlining the process of manufacturing these pieces of light candy. So we've already established and secured our production channels and are confident we should be able to follow through with our expected delivery date. Of course, dealing with multiple suppliers in various parts of the world can lead to unexpected surprises, but we've gone out of our way to ensure a smooth initial production of the Sebbo.\n\nHaving been in the importing business for over 10 years, I have a firm grasp of the potential hiccups that can happen when working with foreign suppliers. I am very well aware of the likelihood for delays and production bottlenecks and have for that reason given a delivery date that provides me with some extra padding in case things go wrong. It is likely that you will all receive Sebbos before the promised ship date, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI have agreements in place with suppliers for different production quantities, each with a specified lead time, and have discussed the roadmap with suppliers for each production quantity. In the event that this campaign is so successful that we exceed those projected quantities we will begin to add reward levels with extended delivery time promises. This will help us (and the suppliers) accommodate a higher than expected demand. \n\nI've been in business for myself for ten years now. You can imagine I've dealt with just about anything under the sun. Of course there are going to be surprises, but you can count on my experience, problem solving abilities, work ethic, and determination to resolve any issues and get these little pieces of light candy onto your wrists as soon as possible!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Almost.

Missed out on the Kickstarter campaign? Don't worry, you can order now at threadandleather.com. New orders will ship as soon as Kickstarter backers have received their Wrap Wallets. Order yours now!\nHey Kickstarters! It's West Coast Dave from Coffee Joulies. I'm back after two and a half years to bring you my next product, the Wrap Wallet by Thread & Leather.\nI've spent the past year prototyping, designing, testing, and redesigning to make not only the best wallet available, but the best wallet possible. (patent pending)\nThe Wrap Wallet is better because it wraps your bills around your cards to create the smallest footprint possible. This eliminates extra layers of leather that would add bulk.\nThe Wrap Wallet is truly international, fitting all currencies. No \"Euro\" versions needed.\nI prefer having my ID on the outside so it's easily accessible at airports, bars and clubs.\nThe Wrap Wallet can also be assembled so the ID is on the inside and the credit card pocket is on the outside for easy access - slide card out, swipe, slide back in.\nMaterials\nLin C\u00e2bl\u00e9 Linen Thread\nI've found the finest linen thread in the world. Produced in France, Lin C\u00e2bl\u00e9 thread is made of three waxed strands of linen twisted and then retwisted for extra smoothness, then moistened and smoothed for maximum strength and durability. Thread diameter is 0.025\" (0.63mm).\nBookbinding Goatskin Leather\nI'm working with Richard E. Meyer and Sons Leather to produce the perfect leather for the Wrap Wallet. The Meyer family has been tanning leather since 1550 in Eisenburg, Germany. Production moved to Philadelphia in 1830, then North Bergen, New Jersey in 1856, and finally settled in Montgomery, New York in 1981.\nWe've selected bookbinding goatskin (also called \"kidskin\") for the wallet. Goatskins are harvested as byproducts of meat production. Goats are free range; because of this goatskins can have more natural defects, including scars, which lend character to the leather. Goatskin is tough and durable, able to withstand heavy use. This leather is tanned using a chestnut vegetable tannage and formulated to satisfy requirements for the bookbinding and conservation fields. Leather thickness is 0.031\" (0.8mm).\nProduction\nThe Wrap Wallet was designed with ease of assembly in mind.\nPLAY\n\nThe entire wallet is laser cut, including the stitching holes.\nThe leather pieces are so precise that you can easily sew them together yourself. We are using hand-sewn saddle stitching with back stitching because it is by far the best way to sew leather.\nDimensions\n3-7/8\" long x 2-1/2\" wide x 1/4\" thick x 1/2 oz\n(9.8 cm long x 6.4 cm wide x 0.6 cm thick x 14 grams)\nOnly 1/2\" longer & 3/8\" wider than a credit card; 1/8\" narrower than a dollar bill.\nCapacity\nUp to 15 bills and 10 plastic cards plus a few business cards. No minimum number of cards or bills required.\nI have two IDs, a Clipper card, a MetroCard, a AAA card, a health insurance card, two credit cards, one debit card, a Zipcard, two business cards and 14 bills in my Wrap Wallet right now. I'm not proud that I have this much crap in my wallet, but I am proud that this much stuff fits into the Wrap Wallet. Even with all this my wallet is ~3/4\" thick.\nWith 4 cards and 5 bills the Wrap Wallet is only 3/8\" thick (about the same as an iPhone with a thin case).\nRewards\nWrap Wallet Kit - $29\nFor $29 you get a Wrap Wallet Kit in any of the standard color combinations. This includes the two pieces of leather, thread, and two needles so you can sew it yourself. Add $29 for each additional wallet kit of the same color combination.\nFor $39 you get a Custom Wrap Wallet Kit, including any standard color leather (you can mix and match the two pieces if you'd like) and any color thread. Add just $29 for each additional custom wallet kit. Please use this reward tier to pledge if you want multiple different standard color combination wallet kits as well.\nAssembled Wrap Wallet - $59\nFor $59 you get an assembled Wrap Wallet in any of the standard color combinations. Add $59 for each additional assembled wallet of the same color combination. These wallets are all assembled with the ID pocket on the outside.\nFor $79 you get a Custom Assembled Wrap Wallet made of any standard color leather (you can mix and match the two pieces if you'd like), any color thread, and your choice of outside or inside ID pocket. Add just $59 for each additional custom assembled wallet. Please use this reward tier to pledge if you want multiple different standard color combination assembled wallets as well.\nLimited Edition Kickstarter Green Wrap Wallet - $99\nFor $99 you get the Limited Edition Kickstarter Green Wrap Wallet, with the Kickstarter logo laser-etched into the leather. This color leather is being custom-made by the tannery just for this project, and will never be available as a Wrap Wallet again. Your choice of outside or inside ID pocket. Add $99 for each additional Kickstarter Green Wrap Wallet, $59 for each additional custom assembled wallet, and $29 for each additional custom wallet kit.\nNote: because this color is being custom-made I can't guarantee delivery by the holidays (but I sure will try!). Any other wallets you pledge for in this reward tier will be delivered before the holidays.\nBespoke Stingray Leather Wrap Wallet - $999\nFor $999 you get a bespoke Stingray Leather Wrap Wallet made by me personally, designed to fit exactly what you want to carry.\nAvailable in your choice of black, gray, light brown or dark brown.\nShips fully insured, in the USA via Priority Mail Express (overnight) and internationally via Global Express Guaranteed (1-3 days delivery). Add $999 for each additional Stingray Wrap Wallet, $99 for each additional Kickstarter Green Wrap Wallet, $59 for each additional Custom Wrap, and $29 for each additional Custom Kit.\nStandard Thread & Leather Color Combinations\nBlack Thread & Leather\nRich Mahogany Leather & Ecru (natural) Thread\nBritish Tan Leather & Black Thread\nRed Thread & Leather\nBlue Thread & Leather\nBONUS Thread & Leather Color Combinations\nBlack Leather & Blue Thread\nBlack Leather & Red Thread\nBritish Tan Leather & British Racing Green Thread\nGreen Thread & Leather\nNatural Leather & Red Thread (like a baseball)\nMy Background\nWho am I? I'm an inventor, teacher and entrepreneur. I have a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University with a concentration in Design Methodology. I'm currently teaching the Mechanical Engineering Senior Design class at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also co-founder of Coffee Joulies, a project that raised $306,944 on Kickstarter during April 2011.\nWhy am I making wallets now? Basically, I am trained to design creative solutions to difficult problems. I looked everywhere for a wallet that fit my needs, and when I couldn't find one I set out to make my own. My design background helped me come up with a unique solution that had never been tried before, and my engineering background helped me make prototypes and test materials to come up with the best wallet possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first rodeo. Dave and I built an entire production line, tested, manufactured and delivered 40,000 Joulies to 4,818 backers during our last project. I've spent the past year designing, testing, and taking all of the risk out of this project and I have all my ducks in a row.\n\nThe tannery I'm working with already has lots of natural-color hides in stock and will begin dying leather as soon as I reach my goal. They can die enough leather for 300 wallets every two days using just one of their drums.\n\nEvan at E&M Labs has successfully completed and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects already and will begin cutting leather on the laser as soon as it comes in the door.\n\nMy friend Jemma will begin sewing wallets as soon as the thread & leather gets to her home, and she has plenty of friends to help if this thing really takes off.\n\nI only see two risks with the project:\n\n1. The Kickstarter Green color is being specially developed for this project. If it doesn't come out perfectly I will need to find another source. The wallet in the video uses Italian sheepskin leather which can be a backup source, but would mean that the Limited Edition wallet is only assembled in the USA.\n\n2. The Stingray Wallet. I will personally be designing, cutting and sewing these. Each one will be my highest priority, but if they are really popular it could become impossible to finish them all by the holidays. I'll be monitoring pledges and will do my best to create a new tier if I believe I reach a point where I can't guarantee delivery.\n\nThat's it.

When choosing your rewards, make sure you select the one that is appropriate to where you want the items to be shipped. We understand that it makes the rewards area a bit more tedious to follow, but its the only possible way we could offer free shipping to U.S and Mexico, and avoid a surcharge that we thought unfair.\nWhat is it?\nThe Life of Frederick Douglass: A Graphic Novel will be a graphic adaptation of Frederick Douglass\u2019s life based on his two autobiographies: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave and My Bondage, My Freedom. The graphic novel will be composed of three 50-page volumes and will feature gorgeous watercolor art. The goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to finance the first volume.\nCover mockup (not an actual product shot)\nWhy Frederick Douglass?\nWith each passing year, Frederick Douglass slowly fades from our collective memory. If his testimony disappears, a powerful witness to American slavery will be lost to the past. We need to keep his voice alive as a reminder of our past and a guide for the future. We must promote his testimony in a way that is relevant to our times and that is not constrained to history books and dusty archive rooms.\nHis story teaches us to recognize evil in our own time. One aspect of his life that is shocking today is how slavery was a matter of debate in pre-Civil War America. We tend to think that any decent person at the time could recognize the evils of slavery, but it was just not true. Reading about this period can help us identify the injustices in our own time.\nHe is an incredibly positive role model. His quest to overcome his painful beginnings and become a free man is powerful and inspiring. An unquenchable thirst for knowledge, dedication, hard work, and belief in himself are the virtues that set him free.\nCharacter Design study: Fred, 13 years old.\nWho are the authors?\n                      We are Audran Guerard and Daniel Roy, two professional freelance artists who love to work together. We have proven track records in our respective fields as hard-working, dedicated, and always striving for excellence.\nAudran Guerard is a visual artist with prior experience as an art director for Ubisoft and Electronic Arts. His game credits include Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell Double Agent, Assassin\u2019s Creed 2, and Dead Space 3.\nDaniel Roy is a creative writer with prior experience as a producer for Ubisoft and BioWare. He worked on Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell Double Agent, and an unreleased original game from BioWare.\nWe met while working on Splinter Cell Double Agent and have dreamed of working together on a meaningful artistic endeavor ever since.\nCharacter studies: Left to right, Aunt Katy, Edward Covey, Aunt Esther\nWhat will this Kickstarter campaign finance?\n                      The Life of Frederick Douglass: A Graphic Novel will be comprised of three volumes. This Kickstarter campaign will finance the first volume, which will cover Douglass\u2019s early life, from his early childhood to his escape from slavery. We hope to finance the next two volumes through the sales of the first one.\nEach volume in the series will share the following characteristics:\n50-60 pages\nFull color\nGorgeous, loose watercolor images\nA story that does justice to the spirit of the original work\nAvailable in digital format, paperback, hardcover, and deluxe hardcover version\nPanel Art\nHow will you use the money?\n                  The financing from this Kickstarter campaign will allow us to:\nFocus our time by taking on less freelance contracts during the production of the graphic novel.\nBuy art supplies.\nPay all editing fees (proofreading, editing, etc.).\nPay for live model fees.\nFulfill all promises to our Kickstarter backers.\nPrint the physical copies of the book.\nPay distribution fees for the printed book.\nMarket and advertise the book.\nPay all fees related to online promotion of the book (website hosting and design, social network promotion, etc.).\nGrandmother studies\nAbout the Rewards\n                      There are two points we want to make about the rewards:\nAll prices include shipping fees for North America. For our backers living in the continental U.S., Canada, and Mexico,  you do not need to add the required overseas shipping fee.\nWe do not, in any way, shape, or form, encourage cheap labor. We work with local partners whenever possible; quality is our primary concern. Printing is done in Canada, Audran\u2019s watercolor tubes are from West Linn, Oregon, and his paper is made in France. We favor responsible companies that are proactively committed to responsible and environmentally-friendly development.\nIt doesn\u2019t help us keep costs down, but that is not the point. However, it guarantees us high value in every aspect of production and a book we can all enjoy with peace of mind.\nDevelopment Blog Access  (Kickstarter exclusive)\nThe Development Blog is how we will keep ourselves accountable to you, our backers.

We realize the historical importance of Douglass's story, and we want to do it justice by providing a thoughtful, poignant adaptation that is faithful to the source material. We need to do this project right, and strive for excellence in every aspect.\n\n- External factors: External elements pose a risk because they are out of our direct control. This includes printing and distribution. We believe this risk is small because the publishing process is well-understood.\n\n- Technical challenges: There are certain challenges associated with producing a high-quality work of art, but we believe we have more than enough experience to tackle this aspect. We have both worked on complicated videogame projects with many technical challenges. For this project, we are a two-person team working on a more traditional medium, so the challenges are fewer than we are used to dealing with.\n\nHow we will mitigate these risks:\n\n- We will consult friends in the visual arts and the publishing industry to help us understand and control the risks.\n\n- We will rely on our experience as videogame creators and managers to assess, plan, and execute our tasks.\n\n- We have a proven track record of maturity, determination, and hard work.\n\n- We will use our Development Blog to communicate clearly to our customers.

I haven't been around for long, but my all-natural butters have already gained a cult following amongst those in the know, including The Food Doctor, Ian Marber, who has called my Almond Chocolate Butter \"too good\".  I'm not sure what this means, but I like it. \nOthers Keen fans would agree: \n\n\"If I had the money I would buy 1000 jars of this and bathe myself in it from head to toe, it is that good.\"\n\"Bought a spoon at the same time as my jar of almond butter - wanted to eat the complete thing in the cab of my van.\"\n\"Just got my first jars of almond chocolate and almond espresso butters - I think I've died and gone to nut butter heaven.  Delish.\"\nSince first introducing the butters at a farmers' market in May, it's been a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and I've gone from making 50 jars a week to making 3,000 jars per month. Despite only having the product available for sale for a few months, Keen is already sold in 52 shops throughout Ireland and is being enjoyed by Olympians (4 and counting!) as well as us ordinary folk. All of my butters are now sold on backorder as it's selling faster than I can make it. \nAs you can imagine, this flurry of nut roasting and smooshing is all-consuming and my house now looks like it should be in a nut butter special edition of Hoarders with supplies in every available spot.  \nMy Kickstarter goal of \u00a310,500 will allow me to build the World's Smallest & Happiest Nut Butter Factory, increasing production from 3,000 jars per month to 15,000 per month and allowing me to move the bulk of production out of my house.  This will make my stockists, my customers and my family much, much happier.  \n\nThe factory will exist in a small structure purpose built to fit my custom smooshing (technical term) machine, ovens and bottling space with an additional storage unit alongside to store supplies.  My goal will cover the entire cost of the project, including: \nSmooshomatic\nDual roasting ovens\nCooling trays and shelving\nStorage units and filing cabinet\nLabelling station\nFood safety consultant to ensure that the micro-factory is built to precise SALSA specifications.  \nReason #1: I don't think the World's Biggest Factory would fit in my garden, which is where this will be built.  With a young family, it's really important to be as close to home as possible.  I may be putting in long days to make Keen successful, but my family needs me too.  So a small factory right outside my door seems like the happiest solution for Keen and my family. \nReason #2: I think when people begin to get successful, especially with a food product, they immediately want to get as big as they can, as fast as they can.  Uncontrolled growth can lead to disaster. I'd rather keep control of production, keep quality high, and continue to grow at a rate I can manage. Raw capitalism is out - balance is in. \nReason #3: Starting a business is like starting a relationship - it takes time to get to know all the ins and outs of Keen, my customers and my stockists.  I want to ensure that I'm not so focussed on pure growth that I miss something important (like you) along the way.  \n All of my nut butters are dairy-free and contain the bare minimum of ingredients so that the beauty of the nuts can shine through.  For instance, my almond butter contains one ingredient:  almonds. I don't like fussy food and I don't like buying food that isn't what it appears to be.

If I reach \u00a325,000 in funding, I'll be able to work with packaging companies to create prototypes and launch the single-serve packets at the BBC Good Food Show 2014.\nStretch Goal \u00a340,000: If this goal is reached, I'll be able to secure a well-branded booth at following events in 2014:\nBBC Good Food Birmingham & London\nScotland's Speciality Food Show\nBBC Good Food Show Winter\nBelfast Food & Drink Show\nLondon Speciality Fayre\nIGD Convention\nIndependent Retailers \nNational Convenience Show\nSainsbury's Trade Briefing Conference\nA presence at these events will allow me to establish Keen as a growing brand within the food sector for retailers and consumers.\nKeen recently won a place on the prestigious Propel Programme, an Invest NI initiative aimed at high calibre entrepreneurs who they feel have the passion and energy to succeed on the international stage.

Please spread the word! \nPlay time: 20 mins. Ages: 10+\nIntroducing Greedy Wizards  - a two-player card game in which a red wizard battles a blue wizard for the right to eat a delicious cake.\nWinning pieces of cake will take you closer to victory - whilst also making it more difficult to claim the next hand. Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other. \nRed vs Blue. Please note: we know our Photoshop skills are excellent, but that lightning was added in order to cover up the fact we've joined two pictures together. It wasn't there at the time.\nMeet the Wizards\nRed Wizard and Blue Wizard are adventuring, like wizards do, when they stumble across the most delicious cake they have ever seen.\nBeing greedy wizards, sharing is absolutely not an option \u2013 so they agree to settle matters the only way they know how: By fighting. \nGreedy Wizards is deceptively strategic two-player game in which players compete in a series of magic duels  in order to win the cake.\nA closer look at three of the cards. The wizards aren't the best in the world, so their spells are somewhat... unorthodox.\nThe nine spells Blue Wizard can cast\nHow to play\nEach wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more \"Greedy\" than \"Gandalf\", their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an \u201cabsolutely massive chicken\u201d or \u201ca woman who shouts hurricanes.\nPlayers take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs. \nHowever, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?\nBeautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it\u2019s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.\nRespond to Blue Wizard's attacks with a woman who shouts hurricanes.\nStrategy\nGreedy Wizards is really easy to pick up and play but incredibly tactical. The double-sided cake cards have to be played as part of the overall hand. Do you play them early? Or late? Do you play them together? Or split them? Can you bluff? And most importantly, can you predict how your opponent will respond?\nAll cards have been played, so we join as a round is being resolved. Blue Wizard has won the first round so is playing with one cake card in place of a spell.\nIn the deck\nThe deck contains 18 individual spell cards, plus three duel and five cake marker cards - each wonderfully illustrated by Anna-Liisa Jones (who you can find here). The cards will be printed on Heretic 305um Black Cored Playing Card Board, plastic coated and full colour, and supplied in a full-colour tuck box, complete with instructions.\n Playtesting\nI'm incredibly grateful to those who have helped me playtest this during development. Without exception, everyone I've showed it to has had a very visible moment when they've realised the significance of the cake twist - and how it affects play. For a game which requires you to lay down nine cards, it's been absolutely brilliant seeing how terrifying each play can be. \nThe Red Wizard spells. There used to be a typo on the toad. If you buy the prototype deck, you'll be able to enjoy our spelling error forever.\n Feedback\nI've been showing the game to a few people during playtesting and I've been lucky enough to gain some brilliant feedback. I'll likely add an update throughout the campaign with some more comments, but for now I wanted to offer a couple of examples from people who know their stuff. \n\"I loved playing Greedy Wizards. Not only is it easy to learn and fun to play, but it's also a great game of wits, bluffing and poker faces.\" - @DanielaOana  \n\"It's really simple to understand and get started, and reminds me a bit of Chinese Poker.

As science attempts to unravel this great mystery, our understanding grows, but so do our questions.\nIn this fast-paced, complex world, keeping in touch with the natural biological rhythms of the Earth\u2019s cycles can be a challenge.\nBetween our desire to know what time truly is and to find our natural place in it, we find ourselves yearning for a deeper connection to Mother Nature and the Universe. Intuitively we know that this will connect us to our own deeper nature within. We wish to bring greater harmony into our lives and into the world.\nFor this purpose, the Perennial Mandala Calendar Poster has been created. Observing and referencing this calendar can assist the process of becoming more aware of the yearly solar cycle and its effects in the natural, agricultural and spiritual worlds. There is an intrinsic order to the flow of time as experienced by us here on Earth. Aligning yourself to these natural rhythms can lead to a more harmonious and fulfilling life.\nSync your daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and annual activities to the cycles of your environment and your Universe. Consider consulting a lunar calendar for the ebb and flow of the moon and an astrological calendar for the planetary shifts. For the solar and seasonal cycles, look no further than the... \nPerennial Mandala Calendar Poster!\nGreetings Earthlings!\nFirst off, thank you for checking out my kickstarter project - I genuinely appreciate it!\nMy name is Jordan Ososki, and I'm an artist, designer, musician, and ecological gardener based out of the metro Atlanta area. I have spent the last two years manifesting this vision that came to me in the Winter of 2010-11. I call it the Perennial Mandala Calendar Poster, and I'm unveiling it to the world for the first time right here on this kickstarter page.\nWhy did I make this Calendar Poster?\nOne may ask, why take on such an endeavor? What purpose does this calendar serve?  \nThe short answer: I desired something like this calendar for personal use, and after a time of searching, determined that it didn't yet exist. As an artist, I realized that the task of creating this calendar fell to me if it was to be real.  \nAs a spiritually and ecologically minded person, I choose to observe and honor the cycles of nature on which my life depends. As a person who works directly with plants and the forces of nature, it is in my best interest to be as consciously (and subconsciously) aware of these cycles as I am able. Finally, I would go so far as to say that it is the very disconnection from these cycles that is the source of so much struggle in the world, and reestablishing our connection to the biorhythms of the Earth is ultimately a necessary step if we are to evolve to survive as a species, let alone thrive.  \nThus, I have created this Perennial Mandala Calendar Poster. I hope that it helps people to become aware of and act on the natural cycles of which they are an active participant. By putting this forth into the world, I hope to help expedite the growth process of humanity remembering and reawakening its inherent interconnection with and interdependence on Earth. Regardless of whether or not a person consciously understands it, I hope that this image will serve as a beautiful piece of art for everyone to enjoy.\nWhat I'm Doing Here\nThe goal of my project is to produce a first print run of this Calendar Poster and make it available to the world! I am very excited to share my creation with you, for I feel it has some very real value to offer. (That's what motivated me to create it in the first place!)\nWhat is the Calendar Poster?\nMy Calendar Poster will be a 2 ft by 2 ft colorful poster that fits on a door. It illustrates the natural cycles of the solar calendar year. It will be printed on high quality 100% recycled paper with soy inks, and it also includes an informative, illustrated 40 page booklet explaining the calendar's contents in detail. \nOne of the best parts about this Calendar is that it's perennial. Meaning... you don't need to replace it, because it applies year after year! This is because it is solar-based, rather than lunar or weekday-based.\nThe images within the panels are all lovingly illustrated by hand in colored pencil. Many laborious hours have gone into making these pictures beautifully detailed. The final image design was assembled and refined using an ancient version of Paintshop Pro. That's right - Paintshop, not Photoshop. (Work with what ya got.)\nHand-drawn colorful images\nWithin the calendar are rings of images, each their own category.\nFrom the center out, the Mandala portrays:\n- The Earth\n- The Yin and Yang of the Year\n- The 4 Seasons\n- The 8 Sabbats of the Pagan Wheel of the Year\n- The 12 Moons of the Farmer\u2019s Alamanac\n- The 365 days of the Gregorian Calendar Solar Year as well as..\n- The 12 Signs of Zodiac in both Tropical and Sidereal positions\nLots of detail in these beautiful hand-drawn pictures\nThe purpose of this Calendar is to allow you to easily locate the day of the year and visually deduce where in the seasonal cycle you find yourself on a given day.\nThis Calendar may be of particular interest to those who would like to feel more connected to these natural rhythms. These may be spiritual and magical-minded folks who celebrate the Pagan festivals of the year or perhaps farmers and gardeners who\u2019d like to become more aware of the seasonal cycles.\nPlease note that this calendar was designed for use in the Northern Hemisphere. \nAlso, the colors of the actual physical poster may vary slightly from the colors you see on your computer screen.\nOld mother wolf wants this calendar to exist. She told me. She was the first to appear in my vision, actually.\nWhat's in the booklet?\nThe accompanying 40 page booklet is a visual and verbal breakdown of the information contained in the Calendar Poster, created to provide a bit of context and background. I wrote and designed this booklet with the thought that I can't be right there with you to explain what exactly it is you're seeing. So the booklet does that for me, and more easily, since many folks are visual learners. \nExample pages from the accompanying booklet\nThe booklet is my way of insuring that anyone who wants to know what it all means has somewhere to start. I also wanted to make sure the Calendar Poster isn't just a pretty picture, but is a practical, useful thing as well.   \nDetailed explanations of each panel's imagery\nThe booklet explains the entire structure and labels of the Calendar Poster for handy reference. The labels on the calendar are small because the goal is to eventually be able to remember the names and dates without needing the labels. Then the image alone is all that's necessary to evoke the information.\nThe more the subconscious memory takes on these patterns, the more your life can be synchronized with the natural rhythms. This is what I want for myself and why I made this Calendar Poster. I figured there would be others who may be interested too. Maybe that's you? :)\nIncludes charts, fun facts, artist's statement & whatnot\nHow is the money being spent?\nCripes! Five grand for a poster, man! Are you kidding me? \nLet me explain...\nYou see, when I decided to make this poster a real tangible object, I decided I wanted it to be an artist quality print of the highest caliber. I also wanted it to reflect the values it represents, like ecological awareness. I decided I wouldn't compromise: I didn't want forests to be chopped down in order to print this. I also didn't want it made out of anything too toxic, so I went with soy inks. As you can imagine, my high standards have made it more costly than it might otherwise be... but if I am going to share it with you, I want it to be the best it can be.\nI wanted to start with a thousand copies because I am confident there is enough of a demand to justify the quantity. It also takes the price per poster down significantly to print at this level.\nNot least of all, fulfilling the rewards for my backers is extremely important to me. I didn't want any problems making sure I kept up my end of the deal, and for this reason I have budgeted accordingly. \nYour generous contribution will allow me to pay for:\n- Poster printing, 1000 copies\n- Booklet printing, 1000 copies\n- Postcard printing\n- Poster poly tubes\n- Poster mailer tubes\n- Shipping on each poster package\n- Kickstarter & Amazon fees\n- Misc supplies, i.e. labels, tape, pens \n- My time (haha... get it?)\nIn Conclusion...\nThank you so very much for taking the time to hear about my project! And for those who contribute: I am eternally grateful!! May our visions manifest a better world for our children and our children's children!\nSpecial thanks to the Creator, the spirits of the Earth, the ancestors, Mom & Dad, Lisa King, and all of my dear friends who have encouraged and supported me to create this art!\nCheers!

Assistance via Kickstarter would provide me with this amazing opportunity to be a part of the Spring Fling artist\u2019s community.\nSpace Hopper", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe unique challenges that I may face after my project is successfully funded are poor attendance by the general public, being overwhelmed by a large amount of print orders and cash flow problems caused by potential over production of artworks for the open studio exhibition. \n\nThe potential for poor attendance by the general public is limited by the excellent publicity generated by the Spring Fling project itself, and the fantastic coverage it receives by the local media. This includes west-sound radio, local television, newspapers and the popular D&G Life magazine. I intend to promote my participation in the Spring Fling by including full details on my personal website, my online retail store and via social media. \n\nTo tackle the potential of a deluge of print orders, I only produce limited editions of 50 prints of each example of artwork. When they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone! If I found myself in this fortunate position, I have a bank of quality original artworks that I plan to produce limited edition prints from. \n\nThe potential cash flow problem is limited as I will only exhibit one example of each limited edition print, and do not need to carry a large stock. I currently produce prints to order and I intend to carry on this practice during Spring Fling. I have access to full print making equipment in my studio space. I feel very well equipped to deal with the challenges which may arise from my successful funding. My time studying for my BDes(hons) degree in Dundee provided an excellent background for business management and marketing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Rewards", "update_content": "Well lovelies, kickstarter are now working their magic in regards to all of your generous donations and I've already started putting together all of your Little Dot rewards!

Just click the button below:\nIt's even better now...\nIf you were impressed by our main video, imagine what the Peachy can do now! Click the button below to see what the Peachy\u2019s currently capable of:\nConnect with us:\nWebsite\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYoutube\nInstagram\nGoogle+\nThe Peachy Printer project went viral! Take a look at the links below to see the best of our exposure:\nIn Writing\nOn TV\nOn Youtube\nOn The Radio\nIn the Forums\nHere\u2019s a few of our favourite tweets and comments that we saw throughout the campaign:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is our project description as it was while our campaign was still active:\nYou know how everyone and their Grandmother has a paper printer? Well, wouldn't it be cool if everyone and their Grandmother had a 3D printer? It definitely would, but this isn't a reality for 2 reasons:\n- 3D Printers still quite expensive.\n- They aren't very simple. Good luck teaching your Grandma how to use one!\nThe first goal of this project is simple, but bold\u2026\nWe want to lower the cost and difficulty of 3D Printing to a point where it's accessible to the masses. We want the 3D Printer to become a household item. We want 3D printing to become a common part of life. We want you to have the choice: Should I buy it or should I make it?\nWith a Peachy Printer (scanner) on your desk, you can choose to make it. This is the world's most affordable 3D printer!\nAnd our second goal...\nWe want to run our business on a set of specific moral principles, some of these are:\n- Using Freedom Respecting software and hardware fully respecting freedoms 0 to 3. We will never close our source! We will never betray our community! We will always respect your freedoms!\n- Being outspoken and informative about the political and ethical ramifications of 3D printing technology.\n- Informing customers of safe practices when using our product and providing proper safety equipment.\nAs you've seen from watching our main video, we've already got this little printer working pretty good. Every object in that video, and pictured below was done with the pre-production prototype featured in the \"How it Works\" video below!\nThis is one of our best prints to date!\nHollow Cube - Estimated resin cost - $0.02\nSolid Cube - Estimated resin cost - $0.10\nDave! - Estimated resin cost - $0.50\nWe know we can make the Peachy do better which brings us to our reasons for using crowd-sourced funding:\n- We need money to invest in improving the product, specifically the software end.\n- We need to make high volume orders of our parts to keep costs low.\nHow does the Peachy Printer work? \nBelow is a detailed video explaining how the Peachy Printer works through explanation and demonstration!\nThe peachy printer is a Photolithographic printer. That means it uses a controlled beam of light to cure light sensitive resin into hard objects. The peachy moves a laser beam along the X and Y axes to create the shape of the object, while using a drip system to control the level of the resin on the Z axis which determines the height of the object.\nThe object you want to print must first become a 3D model in Blender. The software we wrote as an add on to blender takes the data from that 3D model and translates it into an audio waveform. It then plays the audio file out to the printer through the headphone jack in your computer. This waveform drives a pair of electro magnetic mirrors. The higher the volume, the higher the voltage, the more the mirrors move. The purpose of these mirrors is to reflect and control the path of the laser beam. By using the audio waveform generated from the 3D model data to drive the mirrors, we are able to get the laser beam to draw out the shape of the object. That's takes care of the X and Y axes.\nNow let's talk about the drip system that creates movement on the Z axis. The salt water in the top container syphons down to a drip feed. The rate of this drip feed is controlled by a valve. As each drip leaves the feed, it passes through two contact points creating an electrical connection that is detected by your computers microphone jack. The drip continues to fall into the bottom container where it causes the resin floating atop it to rise. The software listens to the microphone level, counting each drip that falls and calculates the resultant level of the resin. This allows the software to send the layer that corresponds with the current Z-level of the resin. This process continues until the print is complete!\nUnder The Hood\nBelow are some detailed pictures showing under the hood of our current prototype. This is the exact hardware that made every print pictured and shown in the videos. Everything we do will be freedom respecting, and unlike some companies we will NEVER make any of our plans or source code non-free.\nA few separate parts, as well as the fully built printer. During the R&D process we have been cutting our housings out of MDF to save on expenses.\nHere you can see one of the mirrors that moves and directs the laser beam.\nIn this image you can clearly see the electro-magnet assembly that moves the mirrors.\nIf you've seen our main video then you already know just how well these new methods work. This extremely unique design has resulted in a very affordable product, however there are many challenges we must overcome to utilize the overwhelmingly high resolution of the Z-level drip system and todays sound cards. We are very confident in our ability to overcome these challenges and develop a great final product!\nHow does the 3D Scanner work?\nWhen combined with a camera, the Peachy Printer also functions as a 3D scanner! The Peachy repeats a back and forth laser pattern that simulates a line laser. This illuminates the profile of the object you are scanning. Your video camera, webcam, or DSLR will capture this happening while you rotate the object a full 360 degrees. The software we wrote in Blender then searches through each pixel in every frame looking for the point where the laser is hitting the object. Next it calculates the distance of those pixels from the objects rotational centre and plots the points and mesh accordingly in 3D space. You now have a 3D model of the real life object you scanned.\nWe're even working on a feature that creates a texture map from the footage and applies it to the 3D models mesh automatically. This gives you a even more realistic looking 3D model.\nMore About Blender\nBlender is 3D modelling and animation software.  It is freedom respecting and available to download for free from Blender's website.  Blender is central to the software side of this project.  All the software that runs the printer will do so from within Blender.  Since Blender can import many file types this actually leaves you free to use practically any CAD program to create your models.  The blender add ons we write will be capable of running many different printers, not just the Peachy.  One unique feature our add on will have is real time processing.  This will enable you to model as the printer prints!  You will be able to make changes to any part of your model that hasn't been printed yet!\nYou may be wondering\u2026 What is our plan when it comes to fulfilling the orders if our campaign is successful?  We have 2 different manufacturing plans:\nManufacturing Plan #1 - Under 5000 orders\nWe will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.\nAfter the R&D process is complete we will start manufacturing the printers on our own CNC routers. We are planning on milling the outer housing, mirror assembly, laser holster, and the coil holsters all out of polycarbonate first-surface mirror (vacuum coated with aluminum) which we have already completed successfully.\nManufacturing our mirror assemblies on the CNC router\nWe also have multiple suppliers in mind - most of which we have already used - for specific parts such as the custom wire coils, earth magnets, and the laser.\nPre-assembled models will be built here in Canada and each one will go through quality control at the end of our assembly line. We will likely have each printer draw out a grid in a dark room. A camera will capture the entire pattern in one image using a long exposure. If the printer is sufficiently capable of drawing an accurate grid, then that grid will be used in a calibration feedback loop for the individual printer that produced it. Not only is this a quality check, it also calibrates your printer to account for any tiny anomalies specific to it. You will receive the test photo and clear instructions on how to perform a re-calibration if you wish to do so.\nManufacturing Plan #2 - Over 5000 Orders\nWe will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.\nAfter the R&D process is complete we will get many of the parts that we are currently producing on CNC routers made with injection moulding instead. This manufacturing process ensures that each printer will be produced to more precise specifications and will be our go to choice if we get enough orders.\nMeet the Team!\nRylan Grayston - Owner, Inventor, Software Developer\nRylan is a 28 year old entrepreneur living in Yorkton, SK.  He has been very inventive and creative all of his life.  From an early childhood he was always taking things apart, starting with his baby gate!\nAfter high school Rylan decided to explore and gain real life experience.  Over the years he worked in as many fields as he could including pottery, mechanics, advertising, 3D modelling and animation, programming, and many more.\nThroughout all of the job titles, only one has really stuck - Inventor.  Rylan is a deep thinker and loves keeping up to date with technology and the ethics surrounding our new found abilities.  He is an active member of the Freedom Software Foundation and the Blender community.\nYou can find some of his recent work here:\nwww.vissesonce.org\nhttp://www.blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?298691-working-blender-motion-control-camera-rig!\nDavid Boe - Owner, Investor, Business Manager\nDavid is a 38 year old certified Heavy Duty mechanic who is currently employed by Edmonton Kenworth in Fort McMurray, Alberta.  He is also a certified Automotive mechanic and has been \u201ctwisting wrenches\u201d on and off for around 20 years.  In between those times, he has owned two small businesses, which taught him a lot, and aligned him with his entrepreneurial spirit.  He has also worked in the insurance industry for a number of years.  Having committed himself to lifelong learning and since one of his main interests is in manufacturing, he started training in the Six Sigma/Lean manufacturing process a couple of years ago after having read numerous books and articles on the subject.  He has also read books and articles on the \u201cTheory of Constraints\u201d logic to manufacturing and found them both to be interesting.\nDave and Rylan met in mid 2012 and instantly hit it off.  They were very interested in each other's ideas and it didn't take long before they were in business together.  Over the past year they have been working together to get the Peachy Printer to where it's at today.\nNathan Grayston - Advertising & Marketing\nNathan is a 21 year old entrepreneur living in Yorkton, SK.  He owns a business specializing in video production and graphic design.  He started creating videos and designs at a young age and began doing it professionally 2 years ago.  \nNathan is a very passionate and dedicated young man\u2026  No stranger to online fundraising campaigns, in 2012 he was a key member of the volunteer team that won the top prize in the Aviva Community Fund bringing in $150,000 for a new skateboard park in Yorkton.  In total, the group raised $350,000 and saw the park come to completion in under a year.  \nMuch like his role in that project, at Peachy Printer he's currently in charge of video production, graphic design, web design, marketing and advertising.    \nJosh Ellis - Owner and inventor of MakerJuice\nJosh is a 28 year old engineer residing in Kansas City, MO.  A lot like Rylan he has been taking things apart, and putting them back together from a young age.  As he grew older he became interested in computers and programming.  These passions led him to attend a mechanical and electrical engineering course at Louisiana State University.  After his time at LSU, he served in the U.S. Airforce for 4 years.  He now holds down a career doing R&D on A.I. Traffic Control Systems for an engineering firm.  \nJosh has been extremely interested in 3D printing as a hobby for years.  After building his own CNC router from scratch and playing around with a RepRap, he started looking into stereolithographic printing.  After doing some searching he was disheartened by the price of resins, and the lack of customer service from the providers.  With a goal of providing the 3D printing community with a high quality, reasonably priced product, he started looking into making his own resin.  After 6 months of testing out formulas and talking to suppliers he launched MakerJuice with 1 formula.  Since then he has been continuously developing new resins and now has 4 products available.\nJosh has been crucial to the development of the Peachy Printer.  His highly sensitive resins have played a key part in attaining our goal of selling the Peachy for $100.  We are currently in communication with Josh, and we will be working with him to develop a special resin formula just for the Peachy Printer.\nhttp://makerjuice.com/\nScott Walde - Circuit Designer\nScott began building electronic circuits at the age of 8. He started programming computers at 10, and sold his first program a year later. Eventually he received a formal education as an Industrial Electronics Technologist with a focus on microcomputer systems and robotic controls. In the twenty years since, he has worked in Information Technology, Television Production, has designed and installed interactive museum displays, and has more recently been designing specialized data acquisition systems for geophysical surveys. In his spare time he plays bass guitar in an 80's band and is crew chief and mechanic for his daughter's junior dragster.  \nScott will be bringing his circuit designing experience to the table and helping with the R&D of the Peachy Pro.\nGage Bush - 3D Modelling and Animation\nGage was raised on the barren wheat fields of Saskatchewan by an alternating family of Prairie Dogs and a Sasquatch.  He was born into it, moulded by it, he did not even see flax until he was already a man.  By then it was nothing but cereal to him.  Gage has been honing his skills in 3D modelling, Animation, and Digital Art since January of 2006.  In 2011 he won bronze at the national level in the Skills Canada competition, as well as another half dozen or so silver and gold medals at the provincial level.  To this day he still spends 5-8 hours a day perfection this trade.\nAt Peachy Printer Gage uses his 3D modelling and animation skills to create videos and help with product design.\nJames Cooper - Senior Software Designer\nJames is a Senior Software Designer at Solido Design Automation in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  There he works on a tool suite used to design integrated circuits. He holds degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Saskatchewan. James works primarily in Python and Qt, though he has experience in many languages, such as C, C++, and AVR assembly. He is an active member of the makerspace Saskatoon Techworks, where he has helped with projects ranging from combat robots to quadcopters. This is also where he met Rylan Grant and became involved in the Peachy Printer project.\nJames has been working alongside Rylan developing the software for this product from the beginning.  One of his latest contributions is a G-code to audio converter.  He will continue to be a valuable team member in the R&D process.\nKurtis Wanner - President and CEO of FingerTech Robotics LTD.\nFingerTech Robotics Ltd is a leading design and manufacturing company of small competition and hobby robotics components.

As described above the Peachy still needs work to reach it's full potential. Some issues and challenges may arise during this process. However, we are extremely confident in our ability to rise above them and deliver a great final product. We've already overcame countless roadblocks to get to this point, and we will continue to use the same out-of-the-box solution based thinking process to take it all the way.\n\n2. The Peachy Printer currently has no set limit on build volume, however we haven't given this adequate testing. Like the beam of a flashlight, the print volume gets larger over distance. We plan to push the boundaries of the Peachy to see just how big we can print... One of our goals is to print a full size (16') canoe!\n\n3. Creating the revenue required to develop and progress Freedom Respecting software can be a challenge. We won't be charging money directly for software that you can clearly copy, modify and redistribute yourself. So how will we raise funds to continue developing our software? We plan to implement a donation system that runs inside the software. You will have the option to donate small amounts towards the development of specific features by clicking \"donate\" buttons right in the program. This idea was recommended by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation. All the money raised through this system will go directly to software development.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "No good news yet.", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nThis project is long overdue for an update.

Although David admitted to everything on camera, he is not talking to or cooperating with the police. Kickstarter is being responsive to the Police and has advised that they obtain a warrant through MLAT (mutual legal assistance treaty) so that Kickstarter can give the police information without breaking their privacy policy. This is the best kickstarter can do, and I find it very respectable that Kickstarter sticks to their privacy policy. After all, the world would be a scarier place if companies volunteered such sensitive information to any police force on earth without due diligence.

It's an 8-min long animated short film, it features a new painterly style we came up with, and it tells the amazing journey of two travelers that must build a bridge to cross over an impossible gap blocking their way.\nAs for us, we are three animators from Montreal who graduated four years ago from the same school. We have been planning to do a short film together for a long time, and now, we're finally doing it. No exterior funding, no distribution deals - just us working on something we believe in. The dream? Win festivals, go viral on the internet, and build a fan base to be able to do more and bigger animation projects in the future. Actually, we believe in this so much that we quit our jobs and have been working full-time on the film since January 2012.\nTHAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE WORKING ON A FILM WITHOUT MONEY...\nIndeed! But with a good mix of planning, saving, and eventually borrowing, we managed to come this far. We expect to see this film finished by the end of December.\nHave a look at our production blog to peak at our progress from the very beginnings!\nSO IF THE MOVIE IS ALMOST DONE, WHY DO YOU NEED HELP?\nHonestly, we didn't plan for this movie to take that long. We've reached the very limits of our budget.\nThing is, we still have the music and sounds to pay for. You know that great score you heard in the trailer? Well it was done by Entropik, a super talented duo from England and we want them to score the final film too. (Check out some samples on their SoundCloud, they are really awesome: https://soundcloud.com/thecellocompanion/sets/composed-by-dan-cullen-cello)\nHOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?\nWe evaluated that the minimum would be 5000$.\nThat's what we would need to pay for the music, pay our sound guy, rent a studio to record foley sounds and master the whole thing. We also have to take into account the Kickstarter fee (5%) and Payments Process fees (3-5%) which would bring this number down to roughly 4500$. That's not a lot, but enough for what we need. If we end up getting more, that will just help us get through the next couple months as we are all tired, indebted, and there's still a lot of work to do.\nHOW DOES IT WORK? I'M NEW TO KICKSTARTER.\nWe came up with all kinds of nice rewards for you to have if you help us finish this film. The more you give, the more gifts you'll get!\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if we don't reach our 5000$ by the 30 days, we will not get any money, and nor will you get your rewards. It's all or nothing. So please share this with all of your friends, we really need the most support we can get!\nNow, we could tell you about the rewards ourselves, but we thought one of our old friend would be better suited for the job. Here goes!\nUne histoire inspirante sur l'amiti\u00e9, les sacrifices et la conqu\u00eate de l'impossible.\n  QU'EST-CE QUE C'EST, LE GOUFFRE?\n\"Le Gouffre\" est le projet le plus ambitieux qu'on ait jamais entrepris. D'une dur\u00e9e de 8 minutes et mettant de l'avant un nouveau style \"painterly\" qu'on a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, le film raconte l'\u00e9pop\u00e9e exceptionnelle de deux voyageurs qui d\u00e9cident de construire un pont pour franchir un gouffre gigantesque leur bloquant la route.\nQuant \u00e0 nous, on est trois gars de Montr\u00e9al qui ont gradu\u00e9 de la m\u00eame \u00e9cole il y a quatre ans. \u00c7a fait longtemps qu'on pr\u00e9voit faire un court-m\u00e9trage ensemble et on a enfin d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le faire. Aucun financement ext\u00e9rieur, aucun contrat de distribution - juste nous et un film en lequel on croit. En fait, on est si passionn\u00e9s qu'on travaille \u00e0 temps plein sur le film depuis janvier 2012.\nC'EST VRAIMENT TR\u00c8S LONG POUR TRAVAILLER SUR UN FILM SANS FINANCEMENT...\nEn effet! Mais avec un bon m\u00e9lange de planification, d'\u00e9pargne et \u00e9ventuellement d'emprunt, on s'est rendus jusqu'ici. On compte m\u00eame terminer le film d'ici la fin d\u00e9cembre.\nAllez jeter un coup d'oeil sur notre blog de production pour voir notre progr\u00e8s depuis les tout d\u00e9buts!\nD'ACCORD, MAIS SI LE FILM EST PRESQUE TERMIN\u00c9, POURQUOI DEMANDER DE L'AIDE?\nPour \u00eatre honn\u00eates, on ne s'attendait pas \u00e0 ce que r\u00e9aliser ce film prenne aussi longtemps. On a atteint les limites absolues de notre budget.\nLe probl\u00e8me, c'est qu'il reste encore \u00e0 payer pour la musique et les sons. Vous vous souvenez de la bande sonore de notre teaser? Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 compos\u00e9e par Entropik, un duo super talentueux d'Angleterre et on veut qu'ils composent aussi la musique du film final. (Allez \u00e9couter d'autre morceaux sur leur SoundCloud, ils sont vraiment g\u00e9niaux: https://soundcloud.com/thecellocompanion/sets/composed-by-dan-cullen-cello\nDE COMBIEN AVEZ-VOUS BESOIN?\nOn \u00e9value qu'il nous faudrait un minimum de 5000$.\nC'est ce qu'il nous manque pour payer pour la musique ainsi que notre technicien en son, louer un studio pour enregistrer des sons en foley, ainsi que faire le mastering. Il faut aussi prendre en consid\u00e9ration la cote de Kickstarter (5%) et les frais de transfert d'argent (3-5%), qui rabaissent ce montant \u00e0 environ 4500$. Ce n'est pas \u00e9norme, mais c'est assez pour nos besoins. Et si on finit par avoir plus, \u00e7a va tout simplement nous aider \u00e0 passer au travers des prochains mois puisqu'on est tous fatigu\u00e9s et endett\u00e9s et qu'il reste encore beaucoup de travail.\nCOMMENT \u00c7A FONCTIONNE? JE NE CONNAIS PAS KICKSTARTER...\nC'est simple, on a trouv\u00e9 plein de r\u00e9compenses pour vous si vous nous aidez \u00e0 financer ce qu'il nous manque. Plus vous donnez, plus vous avez de cadeaux!\nUne chose tr\u00e8s importante \u00e0 garder en t\u00eate est que si on n'arrive pas \u00e0 atteindre le 5000$ avant que les 30 jours soient \u00e9coul\u00e9s, nous n'aurons aucun argent, et vous n'aurez aucune r\u00e9compense. C'est tout ou rien. Alors s'il-vous-plait, partagez avec tous vos amis, il nous faut vraiment le plus de support possible!\nOn pourrait vous pr\u00e9senter les r\u00e9compenses nous-m\u00eames, mais on s'est dit qu'un de nos vieux amis serait mieux en mesure de vous convaincre.\nRisques et d\u00e9fis\nPuisqu'une partie importante du film est d\u00e9j\u00e0 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, les risques que nous ne finissions pas le projet sont assez minimes. Pour avoir travaill\u00e9 avec les musiciens par le pass\u00e9, nous sommes confiants qu'il seront \u00e0 m\u00eame de livrer une musique \u00e0 la hauteur, et nous sommes assez s\u00fbrs d'\u00eatre capables de suivre le calendrier qu'on s'est fix\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr, il y a toujours le risque que notre appartement soit emport\u00e9 par un incendie et que nous perdions tout notre \u00e9quipement, mais nous nous assurons de toujours avoir des sauvegardes du projet entier ailleurs qu'ici au cas o\u00f9.\nAu final, on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 investi tellement dans ce projet que vous pouvez \u00eatre certains qu'on va tout faire en notre pouvoir pour que ce film voit le jour!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince a huge chunk of the movie is already done, the risks that we don't finish this project are rather minimal.

In the barrios of Paraguay, a humble garbage picker uses his ingenuity to craft instruments out of recycled materials - and a youth orchestra is born. Music arises and children find new dreams.\nMaria, Noelia and Tania\nAbout Landfill Harmonic\nA film about \u201cThe Recycled Orchestra\u201d, a group of children from a Paraguayan slum who play instruments made entirely of garbage. It is a beautiful story about the transformative power of music, which also highlights two vital issues of our times: poverty and waste pollution.   \nThe world generates about a billion tons of garbage a year.  Those who live with it and from it are the poor \u2013 like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.  And here they are transforming it into beauty.  Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra as it takes its inspiring spectacle of trash-into-music around the world. \nProduction began in 2010 when we traveled to Paraguay to film the children and the orchestra. We returned to the village in 2011 to film and check on the progress of three young children who recently entered the orchestra. We then resumed filming in 2012. We will also continue to follow the story in 2013. Landfill Harmonic shows how trash and recycled materials can be transformed into beautiful sounding musical instruments, but more importantly, it brings witness to the transformation of precious human beings.\nLandfill Harmonic is not just a film...\nThe Landfill Harmonic Movement will consist of 3 phases, particularly with the funding (CLICK HERE for full goals):\n1. Film Completion to showcase the power of the movement\n2. The creation of the Landfill Harmonic Social Movement and infrastructure to accomplish the goals below and start other chapters throughout the world in areas just like Cateura.\n3. The Recycled Orchestra world tour. This will bring attention to the Landfill Harmonic Movement and inspire other organizations and individuals to join in support.\nShare The Inspiration & Help Us Reach The Stretch Goals Above...\nIf everyone takes a moment to press SHARE below, we have the opportunity to reach MILLIONS of people on Facebook...

Favio grew up in Carapegua, Paraguay, a small village two hours away from Asuncion (the capital). Favio has worked since he was 9 years old, his early work experiences helped him to be the creative man he is today. \nFavio learned to play the guitar at an early age and at 11 years of age he became the choir director at his church. Favio studied environmental technology, and in 2006 he started working on a recycle program at Cateura, where the main landfill of the country is located. Observing the needs of the kids in that area, he decided to open a music school, that was the beginning of his Recycled Orchestra project.\nNicol\u00e1s G\u00f3mez known as \u201cCola\u201d Luthier and garbage picker \nNicolas, grew up in Emboscada, 50 Kilometers away from Asuncion. His father died when he was 7 years old and that's when he had to start working to help his mom who was left with 9 children. \nAfter doing 30 years of hard labor work in construction, he decided to move to Cateura where he was lucky enough as he said, to start working as a trash collector & recycler. This gave him a daily steady income, he says \"there would always be garbage and that means I will always have a job\". It is in Cateura where he meets Favio. Together they start the construction of the recycled instruments. \nThe Kids known as \"The Recycled Orchestra\"\nMost of the kids in the orchestra are from Cateura or close by areas. Cateura is a village essentially built on top of a landfill. Garbage collectors browse the trash for sellable goods, where children are often at risk of getting involved with drugs and gangs. The orchestra has offered these kids and teenagers a new alternative to the life their parents had.  The film follows the story of several kids and their families. \nAda (left) & Tania (right)\nNoelia (left) & Esteban (right)\nMaria (left) & Christian (right)\nThe Recycled Orchestra\nA few years ago, one of the garbage pickers, Cola, an untutored genius of the slum, got together with local musician Favio Chavez to make instruments for the children of the slum.  There was no money for real instruments so together they started to make instruments from trash - violins and cellos from oil drums, flutes from water pipes and spoons, guitars from packing crates.\nWith children like Ada and Tania and with the support of many in the slum, Favio slowly put together one of the world\u2019s most unlikely orchestras.  It is entirely made of garbage.  They call it \u201cThe Recycled Orchestra\u201d.  \nThe Instruments\nTin water pipe, metal bottle caps, plastic buttons, metal spoon and fork handles. Tito Romero, maker\nMetal Glue cannister, fork, used strings, recycled wood and tunning pegs. Nicolas \"Cola\" Gomez, maker\nCateura, Paraguay\nThe children of Cateura, live in one of the poorest slums in Latin America.  Just outside Asuncion, Paraguay, Cateura is the city\u2019s trash dump.  It is built on a landfill. Here, people live in a sea of garbage. \nAnd they live from garbage. Every day, tons of rotting detritus spill from trucks and people swarm over it to pick the pieces of trash that are their livelihood.  The people of Cateura may be the poorest of the poor but they are proud and the life of their slum is vibrant. Family bonds, rivalries and friendships are intense.    Surrounded by stories of drug-violence, alcoholism and destitution, they make herculean efforts to reaffirm their life and dignity. \nHow It All Started\nAlejandra Amarilla Nash (Founder & Executive Producer) contacted Juliana Penaranda-Loftus (Producer) to work on a documentary about the underserved children of Paraguay.  Together, they started an extensive research process in 2009, during which they traveled to Paraguay to interview different leads among them:  the Minister of Education of Paraguay, community leaders, school principals, and children from low-income families.  \nThrough their research, Alejandra and Juliana discovered the Recycled Orchestra. In 2010, they returned to Paraguay to do some initial filming. Since then production has developed strong connections with the orchestra and the community and continue to follow the story to the present. \nTania (violinist) & Alejandra Nash (Founder & Executive Producer)\nGoals & Plans For Landfill Harmonic The Movie\nPlease CLICK HERE for a full breakdown, including the charitable movement.\nMission for Landfill Harmonic The Movie \nTo demonstrate and inspire those all over the world that creative and simple solutions can bring powerful social transformation to the poorest communities.\nThe world's largest Musical Instruments Museum, MIM in Scottsdale, AZ., will set up a permanent exhibition with a collection of recycled musical instruments after the Landfill Harmonic team contacted them about the Recycled Orchestra. These instruments, along with parts of the documentary, will be permanently housed in the Latin American wing of the museum.\nThere are plans to bring the Orchestra for the opening of this exhibition in 2013. This juncture will give the producers the opportunity to partner with like-minded organizations to support a concert tour and make a few more presentations in Los Angeles, New York and other cities in the U.S.\nGoals for Landfill Harmonic The Movie\nInspire general audiences to recycle objects, restore their livelihoods and provide hope for younger generations.\nEducate audience through social media reach about ways to recycle.\nPartner up with environmental organizations to educate our audiences on sustainability topics.\nEncourage other organizations to give opportunities to underprivileged youth to provide alternatives to drugs and alcohol so they can learn news skills.\nMotivate youth to be creative and resourceful as well as re-evaluate their lives by helping them recognize what they have to succeed.\nBring attention to the sanitary conditions in Cateura. Hundreds of families such as the ones that appear in the film live along a polluted creek. This is a sanitary emergency that needs to be recognized by the citizens and the government.\nStretch Goals & Plans\nFilming on location is expensive, very expensive... Our Kickstarter Goal is $175,000 which will allow us to complete the two main production trips. With that, we have created numerous Stretch Goals, that with your support the Landfill Harmonic Movement can be so much more. \nThe dollar amounts below outline what we can do with amounts over our $175,000 goal:\n$175,000 - $250,000 \nWith this additional $75,000 we will be able to set up an international appearance for use in the film and have an extra week to film in Paraguay with the equipment and the crew we need. \n$250,000 - $500,000 \nIt will complete post-production of Landfill Harmonic. This stage includes expenses such as: picture editing, original music composition, recording of the score, music licensing, sound editing, sound mixing, color correction and final online of the movie among other post-production expenses to complete a high end finished product. \n$500,000 - $1,000,000+ \nIt will bring the Recycled Orchestra on a World Wide Tour to share the inspiration. The larger the amount raised, the more cities/ countries they can visit!\nHelp us reach our stretch goals to bring the Recycled Orchestra on a worldwide tour by helping spread the message... \nShare the Facebook Photo linked below from our Facebook Fan Page.

They spent days with Favio and Cola, the garbage picker, who guided the team through the process of creating violins, flutes and drums out of recycled metal drums, tin cans, and plastic pipes. They returned to the village in 2011 with an entire crew to film the progress of the young children who recently entered the orchestra, and then traveled back in 2012.\nThe production team is scheduled to travel three more times under the creative leadership of our Emmy nominated Director, Graham Townsley PhD, and then complete post-production of the documentary by the end of 2013. \nInstrument Drive\nWe have set up an instruments bank in Phoenix, AZ. We would gladly receive your instrument here and given the opportunity, send it to the Orchestra. Also, we would like to let you know that since this project has touched so many people in different parts of the world, the orchestra is looking forward to institute similar programs in other communities around the globe. Therefore, your instruments could end up in the hands of a child in Haiti, or Kenya.

Add the cost directly to your pledge (we will confirm your order after the campaign ends). See HERE for more info!\n-------\n#AirQualityEgg: A community-led air quality sensing network that gives people a way to participate in the conversation about air quality.\nWhere's the data? Look outside your window -- have you ever wondered what the quality of the air is out there? I mean RIGHT. OUT. THERE. 12 inches from your face. If so, you are out of luck. The air quality data collected by the government is likely sampled from far, far away and then applied to you on a regional level -- not very useful from the standpoint of trying to understand or change the local dynamics of pollution that affect you. If you're interested in joining a community of people who are going to change that, you are in the right place!\nWhat is it?\nThe Air Quality Egg is a sensor system designed to allow anyone to collect very high resolution readings of NO2 and CO concentrations outside of their home.  These two gases are the most indicative elements related to urban air pollution that are sense-able by inexpensive, DIY sensors.\nCommunity\nThe Air Quality Egg is developed by a community effort, born out of groups from the Internet of Things Meetups in NYC and Amsterdam.  We are designers, technologists, developers, architects, students, and artists.  Read about the history of the development of this project here and here.\nThe product development conversation, as well as a fair bit of the philosophical arguments, happens in our Google Group.  We also have a wiki. This video also outlines our methodology/philosophy:\nHow it works\n1) Outdoor sensors:  A small electronic sensing system plug into the wall and sits outside your home taking regular readings.  It has an RF transmitter, which sends the data wirelessly to an Egg-shaped base station inside.\n2) Egg base station: An Egg-shaped base station, which gives this project its name, receives the wirelessly transmitted data from the sensor box outside.  It then relays that data to the Internet via a wired Ethernet connection.  The Egg also acts as a User Interface, so it also has an LED light and a button.  These are configurable by applications which will be developed in the future by the community.\n3) Data sent to Internet: The air quality data will be sent in real-time to Pachube, an open data service, which both stores and provides free access to the data.  The service includes embeddable graphs and the ability to generate triggers for tweets and SMS alerts (it looks something like this), as well as a robust API which allows for developers in the community to unlock the potential of this new dataset by building mashups, maps, and applications.\nWhere we are now\nThe Egg's sensor system has been prototyped and refined several times.  The current iteration which will go to production has been designed by Joe Saavedra, building on work from a previous project, Citizensensor.cc.  The wireless system has been designed by WickedDevice, who will also be managing the production of the finished Egg system.  \nAt the Citizen Cyberscience Summit in London in January, we were able to deploy a small number of Egg sensor boxes and saw our first data collection.  We are slowly getting a small run of prototype-level sensor boxes into the hands of beta testers (example: https://pachube.com/feeds/48307).  We are running workshops in London and Amsterdam which will have people building up their own units and bringing them home.\nHow we'll build it\nThe funding level we are seeking will allow us to achieve the necessary volumes to be able to design and tool custom hardware to bring the price into an affordable range.  \nStep 1) 3-6 weeks. The current prototype design will be consolidated into a single board by Dirk Swart and Vic Aprea of WickedDevice, who have already done customized volume runs of the Nanode, the open source microcontroller board which provides the platform for the Egg. The Egg enclosure / injection molding will also be developed at this time, based on 3D print runs we've done and will iterate on. A small run of completed test units will be produced in-house to verify the compatibility of the design.\nStep 2) 5 weeks. Production. The verified designs will go to the same volume manufacturer who has done previous runs of the Nanode board.  A manufacturer for the enclosure will be sourced and contracted at this time.\nStep 3) 2 weeks.  Assembly/Delivery. \nTotal: Up to 13 weeks. Estimated delivery: July.\nWhat's next?\nApplications: Each Egg that comes online contributes data that, in aggregate, will provide what is essentially an \"air quality API\". This will be a platform for web developers who want to apply this information in innovative ways via web apps, mobile apps, visualizations, interactive installations, and more. The Egg base station also has the ability to convey information through a colored light and also has a button for user feedback. These elements can be programmed and re-programmed for all kinds of interactions.\nMobile: Mobilizing sensors opens up an entire new layer of information for people. Development of a solution that incorporates benefits to the community as well as the individual gets more complicated for various reasons beyond just platform, code, and hardware, but we will work through them. \nMore info:\nGood article discussing the AirQualityEgg's implications for journalism by @javaun.\nPress coverage of this project in Wired and Forbes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Shield Firmware Update", "update_content": "A quick update:\nAll the Eggs have shipped!

The Elevation Dock.\"\nTNW: \"The Elevation Dock for iPhone blows away Apple's crap options\"\nCool Material \"The Elevation Dock is, to put it bluntly, perfect.\"\nSilicon Florist \"I... Yeah. I don't even really know where to begin.\"\nAIGA: \"...perfect blend of form and functionality... much like Dyson's fan.\"\n----------\n*Update* Just added Back Multiple Rewards to make it simpler for everyone wanting multiple docks.\nThere is a growing FAQ section at the bottom of the page to help answer your questions. \n----------\nIf you have tried using docks for your iPhone, you have probably felt our frustration: Undocking is difficult, many aren't designed to work with cases, they are lightweight, and are generally made as a cheap afterthought accessory. \nThat's why we designed the Elevation Dock - Simple to use, quick undocking, and it works with or without a case. We didn't stop there - It's beautifully precision machined from solid aluminum and it comes in a gorgeous set of surface finishes, setting a new bar for quality and something that looks really good on your desk. It complements the high-level craftsmanship of the iPhone like no other.\nUndocking is a breeze. Just pull up the phone up - no violent shaking or using two hands to hold the dock down required. This is achieved by a special low-friction connection, the heft of its solid metal construction, and tacky rubber feet.\nCase, no case, doesn't matter. Again, the Elevation Dock is designed to just work. That's why a clever movable support pad allows you to use the dock with or without a case and in a range of case sizes.\nObsessive attention to quality. Elevation Docks are individually CNC machined from solid billets of aircraft grade aluminum, no expense spared. The result is a level of precision that can't be achieve through molding or casting. They feel heavy, strong, durable and look gorgeous.\nWe could have easily made them cheaper with injection molded plastic filled with sand or something, but this is something we want for ourselves and we appreciate good craftsmanship - this probably why we're such big fans of Apple hardware (well... except for those damn docks!).\nGorgeous finishes. We worked with a specialized metal finishing company to help achieve the gorgeous finish you find on Apple's unibody Macbook Pro's and iMacs - its hand buffed, glass bead blasted, electro-chemically micropolished, hard anodized and sealed.\nMakes FaceTime Better. The dock's acoustics make the iPhone sound great and less tinny than when laid on a desk, so speakerphone and FaceTime calls sound better. And its angled back 8 degrees, so you are perfectly in frame of the video.\nPerfect for your nightstand too. Know exactly where your phone is in the dark and be able to just easily grab it. Friends we gave prototypes to loved this and used them more often in the bedroom than at their desk - and they all wanted more than one.\nThe Elevation Dock+\nStep up to the Elevation Dock+ for the addition of a shielded Line Level audio out and a USB wall power adaptor.\nIf you are playing your iPhone through a stereo, Line Level is better than outputting from the microphone jack because it bypasses the iphone's internal amplifier for higher fidelity sound.\nThe Dock+ comes in your choice of the Apple style bead blasted finish or Matte Black. \nThe Matte Black is heavy etched for a true matte finish. Very beautiful how it reflects no light, but watch out for greasy fingers as they will leave fingerprints.  \nCompact USB Wall chargers come with the Dock+ versions. You will have the option for international plugs as well.\nKickstarter Exclusive Finishes\nPledges at the limited edition level can get LimeGreen or SunOrange multi-shade versions. These gorgeous finishes subtly change color depending on the angle you look at them. They are exclusive only Kickstarter backers who have helped get this to market and won't ever be available at retail. They will be individually serialized by laser from 1-999.\nHidden USB\nWe listened - the cord will now be replaceable. But just having a USB port out the back would mean a big plastic USB housing residing there full time and take away from the clean aesthetic.\nSo we designed the USB port to recess inside the housing and the bottom plate will be be machined to fill in around the cord and maintain weight. \nThe result is a  cord that you can now optionally change in length - short if it's right next to your computer, long if it's on your nightstand going to a wall outlet - and easily swap out if it gets damaged. And it maintains the beautiful, minimal look of hard mounted cord. \nMachined & Assembled in Oregon. Not many consumer electronics can say that. Unmatched quality control, speed to market, and the advanced and efficient machining capabilities of machine shops in our area make it an easy choice to manufacture the bodies domestically.\nThank you, thank you. We at ElevationLab design products for a range of industries - from action sports, to hydration, to medical devices - and always see opportunity to make our own, but the upfront cost and risk is overwhelming for our small shop. So we are looking to crowdsource demand upfront through KickStarter and see if we can make a product that would otherwise never see the light of day.\nPlease share with any friends that like well-made products and have iPhones.\n Apple is a trademark of Apple Inc., no endorsement implied.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Elevation Stand", "update_content": "Raise your monitor for better comfort & posture.

Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve build a global community of mappers who use balloons and kites to take aerial photos, and our browser application MapKnitter to stitch them together.  We've put our experience into a comprehensive balloon mapping kit that only costs $85 (shipping included) and comes with illustrated instructions.\n Follow us at grassrootsmapping.org, and check out our map archive at the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science .  this is what a small map can look like (by Jaroslav Valuch, Czech Republic):\nWho is the Public Laboratory?\nThe Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS) is a non-profit and a community of activists, educators, scientists, technologists, community leaders, and organizers that develop and apply open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d techniques, Public Laboratory creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.\nYou've believed in us before and been a major part of our success. That's why we're coming back to the Kickstarter community that gave us our start.  We need your help to initiate large-scale distribution of our tools.  As a fully funded-non profit, we are only looking to Kickstart our first run of balloon kits, and launch distribution and assembly infrastructure that we can then apply to other tools in development.  All money collected beyond our costs will go towards tool distribution to communities in need.  \nWhy balloon mapping?\nBalloons fly low and can be used to take high-resolution images.  Residents of the Gulf Coast are using balloon mapping to produce their own aerial imagery of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  For the first weeks of the disaster a restricted flight zone was declared below 4000ft... but not for balloons.\nThe Gowanus Canal Conservancy uses balloons to track their reclamation work and to discover new aspects of their Superfund waterway.\nMore recently, protest mapping has become popular, with video. Fundacion Ciudadano Inteligente started it all.\nWhat is in the balloon kit?\nA 5.5 foot (170cm) reusable balloon made of a latex/chloroprene (neoprene) mix, making it UV resistant, fairly tear resistant, and excellent at retaining helium.  Two-four days of flights can be had with one filling of helium.\n1000 feet (305m) of 110lb test (55 kilo) Dacron line for tying to your balloon, all pre-wound on our favorite 8\" hoop winder. We tracked these back to the factory and are having them custom wound.  No other winder is sold with more than 500' of line.\nProtective rubberized gloves for handling the line.  Thin, high-strength line can cause burns to unprotected hands.  We ship you a pair of rubber-coated cotton gloves.  With rubberized gloves the line is also much easier to pull in.\nThree high-strength swivel clips.

We\u2019ve perfected the design so that it\u2019s easy to connect playing cards in countless ways. The Skallops themselves are cut out of the highest-quality, sanded and finished birch plywood.\n\nMarshall came up with the basic idea behind Skallops when he was only 8 years old, but because he never had access to a laser cutter, it just sat around in the back of his mind gathering dust. He joined us in California this fall, and together we started working on Skallops as we were finishing up our previous successful Kickstarter project, the Trebuchette (now available at em-labs.com).\nAt last, after many improvements and plenty of play-testing, we're ready to introduce Skallops to the world. We need your help to raise enough money to place large-quantity orders on materials and move into production.\nSkallops Community\nOnce the Skallops have shipped, we'll be setting up a community website where anyone can post their designs and instructions for building awesome things with Skallops. We\u2019ll be asking you, our amazing backers, to seed the gallery with your favorite creations. And we\u2019ll be there too, posting instructions for the designs you see here.\nRewards\nHere's what you get in a Starter Pack:104 Skallops and two decks of cards.\n\nA Junior Pack is half of this: 52 Skallops and one deck of cards.\nA Builder Pack is twice this: 208 Skallops and four decks of cards.\n\nA Junior Pack is enough to make a few simple shapes. \nEnlarge\n\n\nWith a Starter Pack, you can build the wheel shown in our title image or more than 15 base-pairs of DNA. \nEnlarge\n\n\nIf you buy a Builder Pack, the sky (or at least the ceiling) is the limit! \nEnlarge\n\n\nIf you crave even more construction, consider our Architect Pack. Eight decks of cards is enough for the whole family to join in. Plus, we'll upgrade your decks to Ellusionist brand Bicycle Black Ghost and White Ghost playing cards (a $49 value alone)! Normally sold to magicians, these are some of the coolest playing cards we've ever seen.\n\nEnlarge\nFinally, our highest-level backers will receive a Custom Pack with eight decks of high quality, Bicycle playing cards with an image of your choice printed on the back of every single card! Choose a wood-grain image to build a giant log cabin, or surprise your daughter with 432 tiny pictures of her face that she can assemble into an entire city. The Custom Pack also includes an Architect Pack's worth of Skallops. For more info on ordering multiple images, check the FAQ.  Images coming soon.\n\nWhy Skallops are Great\nThey're big. Because they use playing cards, it's quick and easy to build large, impressive structures.\nThey're strong. Using our precision laser cutter, we cut each Skallop to grip ordinary playing cards firmly, and the resulting creations are surprisingly sturdy.\nThey\u2019re gorgeous. We use top-quality, hand-finished birch plywood and genuine Bicycle brand playing cards, creating a new, yet classic, look.\nThey\u2019re flexible. Unlike injection-molded, plastic building sets, playing cards are flexible (and disposable) enough to bend and fold into exactly the design you want.\nThey\u2019re versatile. You can use Skallops with business cards, postcards, company-branded playing cards, etc. Or you can cut out your own shapes from cardstock!\nThey\u2019re expandable. We already have expansion sets planned for future release that are fully compatible with the current design!\nAnd finally, they\u2019re REALLY FUN to build with!\nWarning: Contains small parts.

It is very powerful and flexible for doing time-lapse photography. Beyond that, it will have Low-Energy Bluetooth for connecting with accessories, including newer smartphones.\nIt can interface to Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony, Pentax and Minolta SLR cameras and more (as long as they have a connection for a cable release). The adaptor cables plug in to a 2.5mm jack on the Timelapse+ device. The adaptor cable for the camera you specify will be shipped with your device.  Click here for the latest list of supported cameras.\nWhat you see in the pictures is a prototype. The name has changed since the prototype you see in the photos, and the final design will be injection molded with black ABS plastic. It's still in development, so there's more features yet to come!  Have ideas? Let me know!\nBe sure to check back often for updates and more videos and photos as the development continues! After the project is complete, you can find out more and buy the device from http://www.timelapseplus.com\nWhat makes it different?\nYes, there are other devices out there. Why this one? You can do more. As an intervalometer, you can set a delayed start, the interval, length of exposure in tenths of a second (or let the camera do it), how many exposures per interval (for HDR!) with a different duration for each exposure, and more. And, the firmware will be OPEN SOURCE! So anyone can build upon it and try new things.\nHere are the intervalometer features:\nTake an unlimited number of photos\nTake sets of photos per interval for HDR (up to 10)\nEach exposure in the set can be set to a different duration\n1/10 second resolution for the interval and BULB duration\nBULB ramping - shift exposure smoothly during the timelapse (to be implemented)\nAuto BULB ramping based on the light meter (to be implemented)\nThree important things govern the design:\nEase of use\nFlexibility and Extendability\nDurability\nIt's easy to setup and the large screen lets you see everything you need to know at a glance, yet it supports complex timing configurations.\nThe Low-Energy Bluetooth interface (OPTIONAL) allows for future expansion and support for accessories such as sensors for automatically tripping the shutter and even smartphones. The bluetooth component has yet to be developed so there's a lot more to come in that area. If you have ideas or requests for sensors, I'd love to know about them! Click here for more info on the Bluetooth option.\nWith the IR remote it can trigger the camera without needing to be connected (for cameras with an IR receiver). \nThe light sensor can also be used to trigger the camera (upon reaching a certain threshold, e.g., lightening) or to vary the length of exposure automatically (to be implemented).  It's also used for automatically dimming the screen.\nWhat are the funds for?\nThe funding goal is needed in order to produce the Timelapse+ at a large enough quantity to have an affordable price, as well as to cover startup expenses including FCC approval and injection mold fabrication for the case.\nThanks!\nThanks for taking the time to check out the Timelapse+!
