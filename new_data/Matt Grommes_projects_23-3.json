[{"backer": "Matt Grommes", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Have you ever wondered how Instagram filters work?\nOr, how computers perform face detection in crowds?\nAre you curious how virtual meeting applications blur the background or replace the background with other images?\nHow do self-driving cars navigate safely in a busy city environment?\nAlso, isn\u2019t it amazing how the ball is tracked with such accuracy in televised sporting events such as Tennis, Soccer, and Basketball?\nIf we\u2019ve piqued your curiosity then this course is what you need. Show your support by backing us right away and learn about topics in Computer Vision such as Object Tracking, Augmented Reality, Face Detection, Optical Flow, Human Pose Estimation and many more.\n\n\nUnlike many Computer Vision courses available online, this hands-on course approaches Computer Vision more practically, experientially and intuitively. All you need is a working knowledge of the Python programming language. And, if you are not confident about your Python skills, we will direct you to some of the best-curated resources on Python, so that you come up to speed with Python in the shortest possible time.\nIn short, beginners, coding enthusiasts, start-up owners, Tony Stark fans - everyone is welcome to this introductory course.\n\nOpenCV is the largest and the most popular Computer Vision library in the world. It is utilized by thousands of companies, products and devices, and is tested for scalability and performance every single day. \nWe, at OpenCV.org, are on a mission to educate a global workforce. We have been offering very comprehensive online courses in Computer Vision to professionals, job-seekers and enthusiasts from over 100 countries.\nAfter the success of our first Kickstarter campaign in 2019, AI Courses By OpenCV.org, we want to make the practical knowledge of Computer Vision available to anyone who is interested in entering the world of Computer Vision. All we need is your support!\n\n Designed By Industry Experts: OpenCV For Beginners has been designed by our team of engineers and researchers, currently working in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.\n Powered By Python: The programming language of choice for this course is Python, one of the most comprehensive and widely used languages in AI.\n Foundational & Experiential Learning: This course will help you develop essential understanding and practice of the subject matter before committing to more intermediate and advanced learning paths. This has been done using real-life examples which can be executed using your own data as well. As you proceed through the course, regular quizzes will also keep testing your level of understanding while providing important feedback to you.\n Practical & Intuitive:  The field of Computer Vision contains many theoretical underpinnings which can become a stumbling block for beginners, especially, when courses contain heavy mathematics. With this in mind, we have created this course with an emphasis on understanding through concrete, practical examples and explanations based on intuition rather than detailed mathematics which are covered in our advanced courses.\n\n\nOnce the course begins, we will provide you with extensive forum support in order to get you and your system ready for the course. We will always be there with you to troubleshoot any technical issues associated with software installation or executing any of the code provided in the course. Your questions will be answered by a team of instructors. In addition, we encourage you to brainstorm with your peers in the discussion forum and maybe even find a future collaborator to work with.\n\n\nEach module in this well-structured course contains a tutorial introduction to a particular topic. This is followed by an application example to further reinforce the concepts. In these tutorials, we aim to provide the intuition necessary for true understanding as well as an explanation of the code. The applications developed in this course will be something you can actually use and build upon.\n\n\nThe unique curriculum offered in this course is aimed at providing you with a solid foundation in the field of Computer Vision. We will take great pride in each and everyone who completes it successfully. Upon completion of the course, we will award you with a digital certificate from OpenCV.org. You can showcase it across your social profiles and give a kickstart to your career and continued studies in the field of Computer Vision.\n\nIt\u2019s a lucky day! It\u2019s a lucky course!\nWith just a few clicks, you can show your support to us. In return, we will show our appreciation and let you in on our special Kickstarter deals. These deals are exclusively for our Kickstarter backers and won\u2019t be available once the campaign ends.\nExtraordinary discount on OpenCV For Beginners course\nHeavy discounts on all \u2018Add-Ons\u2019\nAll our popular courses offered as \u2018Add-Ons\u2019 at a flat 37% discount\nNo deadline for course completion; complete the course and earn your certificate at your own pace\n\nThis course also gives you a fantastic chance to win lifetime access to another course of your choice.

Choose your hero, master their abilities, and blow new holes in your enemies with their unique weapons and play-styles!\n\n\u201cHand over your booze, your money, and your guns. In! That! Order!\u201d\nThe reigning king of the biggest bandit clan this side of the District. Formerly a top surgeon on Earth, Hunter Cassidy\u2019s life came crashing down around him when bandit loan sharks from New Montana killed his wife and daughter. In a drunken rage, he hijacked a shuttle, took his revenge, murdered the bandit clan\u2019s leaders, and assumed command of the whole clan as its new king - just in time to wake up with the worst hangover he ever had!\n\nHunter's Gameplay\nDue to his troubled past, Hunter has learned clever ways of getting revenge. He\u2019ll act as a comfortable place for most players to immediately pick up and play, with Recon capabilities and powerful weapons. His signature Rocket Launcher is his pride and joy, but he might break a bottle over your head instead just for fun.\n\n\u201cA dance costs extra, but I\u2019ll kill you for free.\u201d\nThe sharpest shot to ever sling suds. A troublesome teenage genius, Lacey Rose\u2019s bad attitude and cynicism turned an honest life of jumping between minimum wage jobs into a living nightmare. Her zeal for life returned when she heard of the Treasure Rush on New Montana, where she now works as a saloon dancer and moonlights as a treasure hunter, on the hunt for a fortune or an awesome death.\n\nLacey's Gameplay\nLacey brings her moves from the Saloon to the Battlefield and will dance, roll or slide her way to victory. Before the dust settles, she\u2019ll wrangle her enemies or force them to break out in a boogie before ending their misery with her trusty Shotgun.\n\n\"SOMEBODY GET GEARTOOTH A GUN TO EAT!\"\nGeartooth is the human equivalent of a cannonball-sized bullet shaped like a fist, with a heart of gold to fall back on. Once the most decorated (and most cybernetically-repaired) commando in the entire galaxy, a life without war left Geartooth with a whole in his soul. He\u2019s come to New Montana seeking the thrill of warfare, the bounty of treasure, and the constant sound of gunfire.\n\nGeartooth's Gameplay\nTrue to his backstory, the man really does eat bullets and brushes off explosives like flies. Being in the military, he\u2019s seen some tough things, but always knows how to bring up the morale of his troops. And if he ever gets lonely in the jungle, his AI turret, \u2018Milkshaker\u2019 is there to keep him company and watch his 6.\n\n\u201cWill he scratch? Will he bite? WILLY PUNCH!\u201d\nA cat in boxing gloves with an addiction to monster hunting (yes, you read that right.) Willy\u2019s existence is, in and of itself, a complete head-scratcher. Is he the last in a long line of universally renowned beast-hunting cats? Is he the end result of some mad scientist\u2019s experiments that escaped and embarked on a never-ending quest to rid the universe of monsters? Is he God itself? Nobody knows, and if you ever get close enough to ask him, he\u2019ll put out your lights before you get the chance.\n\nWilly's Gameplay\nWilly is little but he packs one hell of a punch. His weapons are his Left and his Right and he truly only wants to hurt people. Watch out for his pounce and uppercut, but you may as well call the morgue yourself if you piss him off. Sometimes he\u2019s cute and will take a nap anywhere though. Strange fella.\n\n\u201cWould you be willing to fill out a survey regarding your death?\u201d\nThe greatest mind in the universe with the heart of a child and an endless hunger to discover the meaning of life, through the study of death. Born in the heart of a dying star with no known creator, the Angel is a hyper-advanced AI entity based on New Montana for one reason: to satisfy her unexplainable fascination with life itself, by gathering test subjects for her experiments into death.\n\nAngel's Gameplay\nA flying Cyborg with precision aim and a real threat to life as we know it, Angel holds celestial power inside of her waiting to burst out. She has some extra mobility layered in to make her quite agile which helps get into great vantage points to give her Sniper Rifle a deadly angle..\n\n\u201cI was born to murder. I learned to charge for it.\u201d\nThe highest-rated, highest-priced assassin in the universe. The last surviving Mechassassin created by a pseudo-religious terrorist sect called the Order of the Dark Light, K-05 racked up over 1400 kills before they said their first word. Due to a glitch in their programming that causes them to envision the extinction of all life in the universe, K-05 currently plots to fund a campaign of omnicide by working as the galaxy\u2019s most expensive mercenary.\n\n K-05's Gameplay\nA killer that moves in silence, or can disappear in a puff of smoke, K-05 is a master of Murder. His Katana slices through enemies quickly from close, but his Sai can pin targets down at range and pull himself in to get a swift kill. The Premier Assassin in New Montana.\n\n\u201cMurderdogs! Murderdogs! Murderdogs!\u201d\nRunaway child of the universe\u2019s richest man and last of the Murderdogs. Born the last of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s daughters, Orion found an escape from her extremely sheltered and strictly-controlled life by joining the New Montana Murderdogs, a hyper-derby team known for their violence. Soon becoming their star player before she was discovered, Tarvos bought and immediately dissolved the team to spite his daughter, for which she burned down his estate and escaped into the night, vowing to take on her own father and everything with his name on it.\n\nOrion's Gameplay \nOrion has a strong penchant to burn everything!..and skate around peacefully while the fire rages. When you\u2019re on her team, she\u2019ll get you back in the fight quicker in multiple ways and when she\u2019s not burning or smoking the place out, she\u2019s picking up penalties for aggressive behaviour.\n\n\u201cToday is the greatest day since yesterday!\u201d\nThe biggest bucket of bolts that ever blew a hole in the hull of a Hypercruiser. A hobby project by an apprentice roboticist/mechanic, Trax is made of all the scrap her creator Trish \u2018liberated\u2019 from bandit vehicles, with a couple of heavy assault cannons thrown in. His personality upload was interrupted by an invasion of Trish\u2019s workshop, during which the half-baked happy-go-lucky Trax blew away the assailants. He now eagerly jumps at the chance to join in the fun with his murderous friends while Trish is away.\n\nTrax's Gameplay\nExplosive weapons for hands means some great zone control tools at Trax\u2019 disposal. Being made of car parts, Trish made sure to keep power under the hood and some Spy Gadgets just in case. If the rocket hands weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s got a few more tucked away for the right time.\n\nGrind on rails, climb up walls, commandeer vehicles and mechs\u2014if you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re doing it wrong! With a million ways to move around the battlefield, you\u2019re sure to find a method of murder that\u2019s right for you!\n\nSlide\nDouble Jump\nHop over rails\nRun on walls\nClimb walls\nSlide down walls\nGrind on rails\nGrapple swing\nGrapple Pull\nGlide\nHang onto ledges\nTeleport using portals\n\n\n\nNew Montana is a beautiful place to live, once you look past the constant death and destruction. Fight in the city, in the desert in the sky, or on the moon, among other scenic vistas! Don\u2019t stop to take in the landscape, or else that castle might be your crypt!\nTarvosham (Old London)\nIn its glory days, Tarvosham was the pet project of Tarvos Wayward, whose love of Victorian aesthetics inspired him to design the entire district of New Montana just a short distance from his front door. Powered entirely by steam (generated by underground nuclear power chambers), Tarvosham was strictly for people of class, sophistication, and proper dress sense. On her way out of the burning Wayward Estate, Orion personally lay waste to Tarvosham until its citizens were forced to evacuate. \n\nHigh Stratos (Sky City)\nUp where the air is clear and the hum of the neutron thrusters lulls you to sleep at night. High Stratos was originally designed to host dignitaries and officials from the Union of Galactic Species on New Montana; with features like luxury accommodation, furnished conference rooms, free WiFi, and a two thousand kilometre vertical separation from the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nOsaka-Ku (Nu Tokio)\nProof that gentrification can happen anywhere, even in space. Osaka-Ku was green-lit as part of a business deal between Tarvos Wayward and macro-industrialist Makemake Gyokai. Gyokai planned to use Osaka-Ku\u2019s economy to buy New Montana for himself, and turned it into a bustling sector for small restaurants and high-rise apartments. However, when Tarvos Wayward began the Treasure Rush and scrapped New Montana\u2019s laws, most of Osaka-Ku\u2019s citizens ditched the planet altogether. \n\nMarauder Mesa (Wild West)\nTechnically not a mesa, but bandits aren\u2019t exactly topography majors. Marauder Mesa started out as little more than a camp for the planet\u2019s first settlers. Once its treasures and history were unearthed, they established Harmony Vale with houses, a general store, and\u2014of course\u2014a brothel.\n\nThe District\nThe District is what happens when the guy who owns the planet you\u2019re building a highway on announces he\u2019s scrapping every law on the planet during your lunch break. The District was originally meant to be an interchange and layover spot along highways across New Montana. When Tarvos Wayward threw all of the already crime-riddled planet\u2019s laws into the fire, the entire construction crew abandoned the site to flee the planet before the carnage began. \n\nThe Golden Wasteland\nBecause of course a planet as worthless as New Montana is half-desert. Don\u2019t let the name fool you; the operative word here is \u2018Wasteland\u2019. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a tumbleweed in this arid landscape. But one thing you\u2019ll find plenty of? Bones. Just below the shifting, never-ending surface of the sand dunes is a graveyard of foolish treasure hunters, mercenaries and people who never learned how to use a map.\n\nCastle of Aarrgh (The Frozen Post)\nEither the owner of this castle died while naming it, or they were just a big Monty Python fan. Not even Tarvos Wayward can explain the existence of this random medieval castle built on a random craggy shore. (Or is it a reef? Maybe a delta\u2026?) The only logical conclusion is that some rich asshole with more time than sanity decided they wanted a castle and spent their life building it. It\u2019s a solid castle, but without a king. Or a kingdom. Or any point to its existence. \nWaypoint Station\nThere\u2019s a Waypoint Station on almost every planet in the Union of Galactic Species; a contract between them and the Wayward Group made sure of that. One of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s thousands of interstellar spaceports, New Montana\u2019s Waypoint Station is built on its moon, Helenia. With space fore even the largest commercial vessels, every Waypoint Station is complete with fuelling points, overnight rooms and a members-only commissary, as well as transports to the planet\u2019s surface. \n\nThe Scarlet Temple (Forest Temple)\nThe Scarlet Temple is a dark red stain on the Union of Galactic Species\u2019 history. Before the UGS claimed the planet that would eventually be named New Montana, it was the base of the Order of the Dark Light, a pseudo-religious fanatical sect responsible for the abduction and slaughter of millions of children across the universe. They built the temple to house laboratories, where they spliced the DNA of their victims to create the genetically-perfect Mechassassin. Only one such soldier, K-05, ever left the temple. \n\nAnam-Ka\u2019Rui (Alien Temple)\nA mysterious, unsettling structure in the heart of the Golden Wasteland. Its name is said to have been whispered by its discoverer, after he fainted upon setting foot inside. Tarvos Wayward has yet to formally acknowledge this citadel\u2019s existence, but theories as to its origin continue to pop up on conspiracy networks across the galaxy.\n\n\nKickstarter-exclusive \"Star Hunter\" skin concept - Make it yours!\n\n3D Glass Sculpture of Hunter\nNOWWA (Now, Winners Announced) is an independent studio run by Yohami Zerpa, which develops casual games for mobile platforms. In 2017, after nearly two decades of developing games for other studios, Yohami decided to go indie and create a game that mixed all his favourite influences from media and culture, ranging from victorian horror to futuristic cyberpunk, talking boxing cats and AI androids, ninjas and pirates. A few months and prototypes later BulletVille was born. Yohami is the main driving creative force, art director and manager.\nNOWWA is comprised by an all-stars team:\n\n Robert brings his AAA experience with networking, replication and server side code, and a vast knowlege of the intricacies of the Unreal Engine, supported by Mohamed \n Lewis polishes the locomotion sets and makes sure everything runs smooth and feels smooth for the players, with an obsessive eye for detail\n Phil and Nicola use their genius in marketing and social media to make sure the world knows about BulletVille\n Garrett works as game designer, level designer and keeps an eye on all tasks and brings structure into the project, with a cool head and a calm hand\n Robbin and Blaze are talented level designers that know how to adapt their creations for BulletVille's high mobility. \n Breiner, Aaron and Siavesh do the rigs and animations\n Joshua, Scott, Russ, Dragos, Alexandr bring the very diverse locations of New Montana into life with environment design and stylized textures\n Siavash is an amazing animator who brings our heroes to life! \n AkiraX3, Jesus, Mauro, Arty work on 2D design, interfaces, banners and logos\n Kyle, Joe, Kevin, Romain and Christian turn the concepts into 3D models, characters and props\n Peter, Crackers, Alexis take care of the lighting and shaders\n Stiven is a talented kid who works on UI and game modes\n Nick uses his long experience with SFX design to make our sound palette unique and distinctive\n Jask takes care of our community, especially the huge BulletVille Discord\nEmmy-winner Oscar Fogelstr\u00f6m creates our lush and rich soundtrack, with collaboration from Murray Atkinson \nMega-talented writer / voice actor Reece Bridger brings life to Trax, is writing every line of dialogue & lore and, last but not least, handles casting and management of other voice actors - our illustrious list includes Aimee Smith, Alexis Monteith, Cassie Ewulu, Daniel Dorse, Griffin Puatu, Jenna Kathleen, Lizzie Hofe, Malcolm Ray, P.M. Seymour, Terrance Drye, Thaddeus Walster, Tom Schalk and Yong Yea! \nAnd Tim watches in the back taking care of admin and finance \n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big goals and bigger dreams.\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far bootstrapping the project as a REAL indie game, untarnished by pesky big corporations and dirty publisher tactics, and we\u2019d like to keep it that way!\nWe\u2019ve got private backing that allowed us to get this far, and enough to finish the core game.\n\nHow does this Kickstarter campaign and a backing of 100,000 USD help us? \nWell, the funding will allow us to grow our team and do QA, pay for artists and external developers to speed things up, do more skins, maps, game modes, and heroes.\nEvery dollar above our target will speed up development of the game and extend its scope even more - your pleasure!\nHere\u2019s what you can do to help!\n Like, share and retweet this video (link) recapping our kickstarter to new players!\n   Back our campaign! \nhttps://discord.gg/xP32KCRj", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting highly complex software such as video game code with numerous components has the implicit risk of bugs that cannot be easily identified or fixed. But our indie studio team consists of people all around the world who really know what they're doing. The accumulated experience of certainly more than 100 years in game development and the transparency we always provided on our progress with BulletVille is the insurance that you get your reward in time.\n\nWe are self-funded out of personal income and proceeds from casual games we made so BulletVille will be launched in any case, it's just a question of time and scope - your backing will allow to deliver the beta/full version earlier and with more maps, heroes, modes and skins.\n\nCovid is a risk and could slow down development but will not prevent us from delivering BulletVille and the most impacted part is the time and place of the BulletVille release party due to travel and social gathering restrictions. We will communicate according to the further developments.\n\nBy far the biggest risk, which we are also unable to mitigate completely, is\u2014Tarvos Wayward himself. \nGiven his fortunes, he may snap up all available rewards, just to show he can.

It is the world's first one-piece miniature electric hand drill for creative DIY, and it features super lightweight, ultra-quietness and great portability.\nFinish your DIY projects with the right tool kit is important. WOWSTICK hand drill helps drill small holes of various things: resin, plastic, wood cardboard, paper cardboard, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil, etc. Aiming at its practicality and simplicity, WOWSTICK is the cordless lithium-ion battery powered drill which is crated just like a pen, an ideal tool for DIY-ers as well as general people.\nNo more clunky gadgets, wires, and plug-points. WOWSTICK one-piece miniature hand drill with its dispatchable head lets you accomplish your creation by gripping up, aiming at the point, and pressing one single button.  \nThe WOWSTICK drill is small and light, just 1.6oz (46g) which fits right in your hand and literally easy to carry anywhere, so you can take it to distant workplaces. Sized at 6.8\u201d*0.6\u201d (172*13.8mm), you can grip it like a pen for ultimate control and precision as well as for comfort.\nIt is not only a great tool for DIY projects, but also a hassle-free decoration to put in your pocket or on any desktop.\nEvery bit of WOWSTICK from outside to inside (Except the button and the charging port) is all metal CNC machined to ensure the seamless curves and consistent product quality. Greatly standing out from the conventional drills in the market, this manner is more precisely made to achieve more stable product performance. Our drilling spindle run-out is far exceeding the industry standard to be less than 0.1mm, resulting in high-precision drilling at the right position every time.\nThe WOWSTICK kit has 8 drill bits made of harden steel: 0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and it allows drilling at 420r/min \u00b1 10%, so you can use it in many projects and get accurate results.\nThe handheld device is practically designed to cater for different needs, letting you plug in and off bits based on your projects, and the fact that the bits are fully compatible with 2.35 mm diameter bits accessible in the market, you may drill, decorate and attach your crafts freely.\nThe bits can be used on a variety of materials: resin, plastic, wood, clay, bead, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil and more, very practical items in daily life.\nThe WOWSTICK hand drill is ideal DIY workers like in the drilling industry and general people. It will be a good addition to your artisan inventory. It particularly suits those who perform intricate decorations. You can use the mini drill for making holes, for crafts and more applications.\nUse Tips:\nIt is suggested to take in and out alternatively when drilling, so that the residue can be brought out without getting stuck.\nYou may test it on the spare material before use. When there is no issue, you may start drilling holes in your crafts.\nOn harder metal materials,  it is suggested to start with a smaller bit and then shift to a bigger one when it is aiming at a large hole.\nThe smaller the drill bit is, the more attention should be paid. Due to its small size, it is easy to break off when used improperly. \nNote: Be careful of the operation when you are using a finer drill bit since it is easier to break off. You may perform intricate drilling of valuable materials with its unique low speed optimization.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is more than easy to operate. With just one button built at the position of your thumb when you are holding it, you may just start working with a press on the button. When a pause is needed, you may release the button. \nTo replace the bit is also a breeze based on our particularly designed screwless locking mechanism. It is fairly intuitive and no extra tool is needed. Just gently rotate the chuck out, take out the drill bit, put in a new bit, and then secure it. The process can be accomplished within 10 seconds.\nAfter finishing the works, you may put on the drill cap to avoid accidents caused by unintentional pressing of the button. So it is a hassle-free device.\nThe drill has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the distance between the wall plug and workbench or troubles caused when you forget to unplug the power cord. It provides a safe, effective, clean energy, less stressful operation option. It is cordless, tailored pen-shaped designed and operates at 3.7 volts, 1.036Wh. That said, it can be used for at least one month in regular use at its full charge.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is rechargeable via USB type C charging cable. Full charging time is about 40 minutes and can be used about 2 hours.\nWOWSTICK is the sturdy, high quality handheld tool for DIY projects. The whole body is aluminum alloy one-piece molding, giving the most simplified look, comfortable grip and sturdy and durable in use.\nThe motor of the mini drill has also been heat-treated for endurance, so it can continue to work without getting heated for a long time. You will never complain about its quality build.\nWOWSTICK designers have been digging out the maximum abilities of the pen shape. From installations to actual working, creators always like to use the device instantly from idea to prototype and thus may get inspirations at the fingertips.\nIt comes with an improved ergonomic design to ensure comfortable grip in any situation. Using the aluminum alloy shell, it is ultra-compact and light, slim and very easy to handle for detailed projects. Holding it like a pen, its slim grip makes great sense in detailed works. As a result, no matter walnut or resin, you may just focus on the fun of making things.\nGo experiment with the WOWSTICK\u2019s easy drilling. Go ahead and grab your creativity now!\nThe Imezing team consists of a group of designers, engineers and seekers of quality life. Back to simplicity and convenience are our core concept. Together, we are dedicated to upgrading tools to the next level and creating truly practical and stylish tools and instruments.\nWe launched Imezing screwdriver and Imezing Hot Glue Pen earlier on Kickstarter and both of the two projects are welcomed and liked by a lot of Kickstarter backers.

So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

Pick one of the pledge levels at right, and you\u2019ll put me on track to start recording again. For more information, read on.\nUpdate: We're nearing 60%, but I still need your help! On rewards, I\u2019ve added a private members discussion forum for Insider ($25) and above backers. And listen to this special bonus episode recorded June 8, 2018, with Lucy Bellwood.\nWhat is The New Disruptors podcast?\nMaking a go on your own is a hard business, but learning from the successes and travails of others can help. For 93 episodes of The New Disruptors podcast, I interviewed artists, writers, musicians, cartoonists, industrial designers, game makers, indie facilitators (like Kickstarter, VHX, and Crowd Supply), app developers, and unique independent operators who had either found an audience for their creative work or helped people make those connections. About 10,000 people listened to each episode over nearly two years.\nThis ranged from Jonathan Coulton explaining how he turned a self-driven song project into an Internet-backed musical career to Marisa McClellan\u2019s amazing trajectory to becoming a national expert on canning foods to Katie Lane's independent legal practice as a lawyer for freelancers to Kevin Kelly creating Cool Tools, a new crack at what the Whole Earth Catalog once was. Sir Mix-a-Lot (Anthony Ray) spoke to me about being an independent producer; Chris Hawker explained how Onion Goggles and Power Squid came to be; and Yancey Strickler, one of Kickstarter's founders, detailed how crowdfunding was changing creative people's working lives. (Click those links and you can listen to or download the episodes.)\nInterviewing the editors of Boing Boing at XOXO in Portland, Oregon (Photo by Duncan Rawlinson)\nIn October 2014, I put the show on hiatus as I wound down The Magazine, and had to focus on building up my freelance writing career. While I loved The New Disruptors, it was a significant weekly time commitment, and I felt I\u2019d assembled a big-enough back catalog at that point.\nBut ever since I stopped airing new episodes, people have asked me when I\u2019d bring the show back. It touched a nerve, people hearing stories of how others had created independent careers or businesses without being intermediated by gatekeepers or giving away control of what they made. I missed making the show, both the interviews and the hundreds and hundreds of connections with people who listened and shared their stories with me or had questions I could help answer or direct them to people to ask.\nAs giant social networks have consumed people\u2019s attention and many are trying to break those habits and move away, the time seems right to bring creators back to the fore and reboot The New Disruptors, looking at what's changed since its first run and how people build audiences and careers today.\nLive at the Nearly Impossible conference in Brooklyn\nI\u2019ve also spent the last three years increasingly making physical things after a long run of mostly producing digital work. I re-learned letterpress skills, and then printed a book of my writing on a 70-year-old press. I acquired a 2D laser cutter, and have been making and experimenting with designs in 2D and 3D out of paper, acrylic, and wood. I traveled to London to research a book that I then had digitally printed, and for which I handled every aspect of order fulfillment. I\u2019ve also worked with six different crowdfunding and commerce systems in just the last 18 months. These experiences have given me more grounding in a broader range of what people make and how they get it to an audience.\nProducing a new year of shows\nI\u2019d like to start recording new episodes of The New Disruptors, and I\u2019m coming to you for your help. Guests will be an eclectic mix of folks with small audiences and large ones across disparate fields of creative endeavor. I have several people and projects in mind already, and have spoken to a few about appearing on future episodes.\nI funded the first run of programs from a combination of early podcast advertising, some outright sponsorship, and patron support. That mix was tricky to maintain on a consistent basis, which in turn made it increasingly hard to pay for audio editing, hosting, travel, recording hardware, live venue rental, and cover the substantial amount of time I devoted to prepping and producing the show.\nI\u2019ve created a budget that would let me produce 12 new episodes over the next year. Those episodes would be publicly released, but backers at the Insider level and higher will get bonuses: early access to episodes, bonus audio, short videos, dispatches from the field, and access to live streams and shows. I\u2019ll plan to film live events, too, and release those recordings to backers. \n(Depending on venues, live events might be free to everyone, but backers at Insider and above will get free or discounted admission if there's a general charge, and first crack at tickets.)\nUnicornicopia performs at a New Disruptors event in Portland\nThe first run had weekly episodes, and I've created a stretch goal plan that would let me scale from 12 episodes to 48 based on funding targets that include scheduling live events in Seattle or Portland, traveling to conferences, and producing some more highly \u201cpublic radio\u201d-style edited episodes, too. It would also let me expand my set of portable audio gear.\nGoals\nBase goal \u2014 $9,000: 12 episodes, a mix of remote, face-to-face, and live recordings.\nStretch #1 \u2014 $18,000: 18 episodes plus events with an audience.\nStretch #2 \u2014 $24,000: 24 episodes plus events with an audience.\nStretch #3 \u2014 $48,000: 48 episodes, multiple live events, some more deeply produced episodes, and more travel to meet and interview creators where they work\nThe stretch goals don\u2019t scale linearly with the number of episodes, as with more episodes I would also take on schedule more travel and live events and be more ambitious with production.\nI know many people would like the show to return, and I\u2019d like to bring it back. Supporting the podcast here means everyone benefits, including you!\nLevel of support and rewards\nSupporter: For $10, you can show your support for the return of the show.\nInsider: At $25, you\u2019re a New Disruptors Insider for the year, and you get access to all the early stuff and live events as described above. I\u2019ll also be creating a Discord forum for Insiders and higher-tier backers: you\u2019ll be able to have discussions with me, other listeners, and guests who I invite to the forum. This is a great way to make a one-way podcast into a two-way conversation.\nDisruptor: At $100, you receive Insider benefits, and you\u2019ll be mentioned on one of the episodes with my thanks and on the show\u2019s Web site, and receive a special New Disruptors piece of merchandise\u2014an enamel pin of the logo in all its glory! (I also have a limited number of The New Disruptors T-shirts from a print run in 2014 in various sizes, available on a first-pledged basis by size.)\nEpisode Sponsor: At $750, you help underwrite an episode and have a sponsorship message read by the host (me) of about one to two minutes as on other podcasts, along with the extra message that you're a direct supporter of the show. You\u2019d receive tickets to any events that require them. Your logo or other placement will appear on the Web site for the episode and in show notes. You can also buy a sponsorship for a good cause or waive a message being read. (The original run averaged 10,000 downloads per episode, and 4,000 people remain subscribed according to our RSS feed provider. I cannot guarantee the number of listeners to new episodes, but we\u2019re starting with that built-in advantage.)\nSeason Sponsor: At $10,000, you can sponsor a set of 12 episodes, receiving all of the Episode Sponsor benefits, plus a logo or other placement at live events and throughout the Web site and in show notes.\n(Ads have to be for products or services considered suitable for a PG-style general audience, which includes every sponsor I had in the 93-episode initial run. Ad copy needs to be delivered at least a week before an episode airs, which I\u2019ll be in touch about and provide ample advance warning and reminders. Ad copy is typically a set of talking points and general messages, which I\u2019ll improvise around for one to two minutes. I\u2019ll also provide the standard air check, allowing you to have a copy of the ad in isolation. Contact me if you have questions.)\nThe New Disruptors theme music is by Jeff Tolbert.

Even when women are in leadership, the message we receive is: fit in. Be loud, authoritative, confrontational. (But not too anything.)\nOur community is committed to designing new models for leadership inspired by the ways women naturally lead.\nWithin will be a bi-annual magazine about our experiences\u2014in all of their complexity\u2014as womxn in leadership. Like our in-person events, the content will be a mix of reflecting on our experiences, inspiring creativity in the ways we lead, learning from each other, and imagining a world run by women. The community and conversation around this content will not only open our minds to new models of leadership, but also embolden women to lead from a more authentic place.\nEach issue will explore a tension we experience as leaders, such as rational/intuitive, authority/influence, or structure/freedom. Our inaugural issue will begin with the broadest theme of feminine-masculine.\nA few early cover explorations featuring photos of Melanie Araujo taken by Greyson Macalpine for our magazine prototype\nIn no way do we think we have the answer to leadership, or that there is an \u201canswer.\u201d However, our core community is made up of designers and technologists who are by nature collaborative problem solvers. Building from this community, we aim to call our assumptions into question, look at leadership from many angles, and inspire new ways forward.\nWithin represents all women/womxn and non-binary people. We do not believe masculine leadership is bad, and feminine leadership is good. We do believe that in order to thrive, society needs the full spectrum of what humans have to offer regardless of gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, or nation.\nGood question. We decided on Kickstarter for a few reasons. We\u2019re not only producing our first magazine, we are getting ramped up as a (hopefully ongoing) project. When we launched our first retreat, we received more interest than we can support at in-person events. That\u2019s how the idea of a magazine was born, and we hope to bring everyone who is interested into this community and conversation.\nProducing a magazine is surprisingly expensive, even if you don\u2019t pay contributors. We want to pay all the amazing women (and possibly men) who share their creativity and experiences with our community! So, yes we need your financial support. We also need your participation in our community. This combination will give us evidence that you share our desire to explore new models of leadership inspired by the ways women naturally lead.\nA massive thank you to everyone who has contributed to the success of our campaign. We hope this early momentum is a sign Within has life beyond our first issue. The print magazine business is a hard one, but we believe in the power of committing words to paper. We also believe in the power of design and storytelling, and would love to go the extra mile with all of you. \nWe created some stretch goals to breathe even more life into Within:\nMia Blume, Founder + Creative Director\nMia is a renaissance woman who moves fluidly between designing and coaching. She brings these worlds together to craft experiences that inspire and support women in leading from an authentic, empathetic and intuitive place. A former design leader at Pinterest, Square, and IDEO, Mia has seen it all.\nAshlea Sommer, Executive Editor\nAshlea plays at the intersection of language and movement. A design director, leadership coach, and yoga instructor, she sees stories as keys for unlocking who we are and who we can become, as individuals and a collective of women. Ashlea grew up at IDEO, and has worked with clients on all points of the creative leadership spectrum.\nSaphierrina Sutherland, Lead Designer\nSaphierrina (saph-ah-ri-na) is passionate about designing purpose-driven brands across industries and mediums. She is a wizard at making the simple beautiful, and turning everyday objects into covetable experiences. She once brought her magic to Square, and now brings it to Eero.\nNatasha Lo, Chief Wrangler\nNatasha makes things happen before anyone else realizes what needs to happen. She\u2019s a magician of sorts, working happily behind the scenes so that all of Within\u2019s dreams go off without a hitch. In her previous life, she made many things at Airbnb happen.\nWithin Community (You!)\nWe won\u2019t name you all here but our community is strong (and growing!) and we can\u2019t imagine doing this without you.

The challenge was to figure out how to make great coffee work at just $1 a cup, and we found that by being clever and controlling for waste, we could bring exceptionally crafted hot and cold coffee drinks to people at scale, without skimping on the quality of beans in our blend.\nKind words and a bit of controversy in the NYTimes\nThat $1 cup was a big hit and caused a bigger stir than we could\u2019ve anticipated. It challenged assumptions about what contexts great coffee could thrive in. It sparked a debate about the limitations of our third wave coffee movement's strategies (which I\u2019ve long advocated) to move coffee drinkers toward paying higher prices to support higher quality, more sustainable coffee\u2014against the need to reach a broader audience beyond the exclusionary, validation-seeking culinary burlesque that characterizes a lot of today\u2019s high-end coffee bars.\nOne of our conceits with \u201cThe Mix\u201d is the simultaneously heretical-sounding yet obvious-seeming idea that there\u2019s almost no single origin coffee that couldn\u2019t be made even better with a judicious bit of blending. We recently shared a small prototype batch with a handful of friends and beta testers which included a mini manifesto: \nWe hand stamped this manifesto on one of our prototype batches. Sort of like those Dr. Bronner's soap bottles you read in the shower.\nGreat coffee, great price, your pace\nWe\u2019ll roast a new iteration of \u201cThe Mix\u201d each week, so you\u2019ll be able to choose to get a box shipped weekly, fortnightly, every third week, monthly, or just whenever you need it. Each shipment will be 12 ounces (340g), simply packaged with our awesome newsletter and delivered fresh to your door.\nOur target price is going to be just $15 a box, shipped within the US. Additional charges will apply to international shipping.\nWho We Are\nTony \"Tonx\" Konecny. Tony fell into coffee first as a barista and then head roaster at Seattle\u2019s seminal Victrola Coffee. In 2006 he went on to bend the coffeebar genre as part of Intelligentsia\u2019s Los Angeles project. One of the early weirdos in what has come to be known as coffee\u2019s Third Wave movement, he holds the dubious distinction of being among the first coffee bloggers, for which he sincerely apologizes. In 2011, frustrated with how the top roasting companies focused more on their baristas and selling beverages than in giving honest footholds for would-be coffee connoisseurs, he started Tonx Coffee. It pioneered a direct to consumer subscription service, sourcing great coffees from around the world and empowering coffee lovers to brew stuff at home that could rival the best cafes. In 2014 Tonx Coffee was acquired by Blue Bottle Coffee becoming the Blue Bottle at Home service. Tony\u2019s itch for finding new on ramps for getting people into coffee remained, leading him deeper into a still-unfinished book project and the $1 coffee project for LocoL.\nSumi Ali. After a few years working as a barista, Sumi opened his first coffee bar, Condesa, while still a teenager in Atlanta\u2019s nascent coffee scene. He moved to Los Angeles to work for Intelligentsia where his exceptional barista skills and strong sensibilities about hospitality led to him being poached as the first barista at the landmark SQIRL/G&B Coffee pop-up that spawned several local culinary empires. His excellent palate for coffee and his skills as an auto and motorcycle mechanic led to him get poached again, this time to join the roasting team at Tonx Coffee as it scaled up. He went on to learn the business of green coffee importing with Thrive Farmers (the company behind Chick-fil-A\u2019s brews) and consulted for a number of roasteries. Sumi was the brains and the boots on the ground behind LocoL\u2019s successful coffee program and he\u2019s one of the most talented roasters we\u2019ve ever met (but don\u2019t tell him that or it\u2019ll go to his head).\nAdditional Teammates\nRyan Brown. Tonx Coffee alumni Ryan will be joining us as our green coffee advisor. Ryan was instrumental in the success of Tonx Coffee and Blue Bottle at Home, bringing his experience working with coffee producers around the globe and as a coffee buyer for Ritual Roasters and Stumptown Coffee. He is the author of the recent book Dear Coffee Buyer.\nAmy Marie Slocum. Amy will be the Editor of our we-can\u2019t-wait-to-show-it-to-you awesome newsletter. She previously worked at Flaunt Magazine as Managing Editor and served as the Content and Social Media Editor for Need Supply Co. She spent over a decade in the food service industry before that, training as a barista under Western Barista Champ Jared Truby and managing the farm-to-glass cocktail bar Orbit Room in San Francisco.\nSean U\u2019Ren. Sean makes movies, writes movies, and occasionally animal poetry. He helped us slap together this Kickstarter video and was the creative force for the \"Just Add Water\" video series for Tonx Coffee. Expect to see some fun things from Sean!\nThom Meredith and Brad Klemmer\u2014Kley.co. Thom and Brad are bringing their digital design genius to bear on the YES PLZ web project.\nWhy we need your help\nWe want to build a company that\u2019s for our customers and our culinary interests, not just some investment fund\u2019s bottom line. Through this campaign we can gauge and engage interest, and right-size our inventories from the jump. No overcommitting on green coffees and having them lying around in our warehouse before we can roast them, compromising \u201cThe Mix\u201d; and no under-committing and then scrambling for 2nd tier ingredients to fill an unexpected demand.\nWe want your help to make \"The Mix\" the best possible blend it can be!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe truth is we have a lot of unfair advantages. We\u2019ve been in the business for a long time, have built up a lot of good will with suppliers and allies, and have stepped on most of the rakes and sussed out the cheat codes.\n\nWe\u2019re taking some risks by offering \u201cThe Mix\u201d at a low price while not compromising on the quality of green coffees we source.

I am beyond grateful, and would be thrilled for YOU to be a part of it!\nI am coming to Kickstarter for this campaign because I believe in the power of people rallying for a project and person they care about.

This Kickstarter campaign is a celebration of that accomplishment. \nIn 1967, two years before the first man set foot on the moon, NASA had charted the entire route that the command module \"Columbia\" and the landing module \"Eagle\" would make on its journey from earth to the moon and back home again and released it as a poster. This chart has now been fully restored, recolored, and - with your support - will be launched as a special reissue. \nThe Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  On July 20, 1969, two American astronauts ( Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin ) became the first men to step foot on the moon. It was a dream and a challenge set forth by one man, President John F. Kennedy, when he declared in May of 1961 : \n\"I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.\"\nIt took years of planning and the work of thousands of people to accomplish this task but on July 16th the massive Saturn V rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on their mission to the moon.\n\"All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people.... All you see [are] the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others.\"\n                                             - Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins \nThousands of people across America and the world watched in anticipation, and all those years of planning culminated in celebration on that exciting day.\nSpiro Agnew and Lyndon Johnson Watching the Launch\n  The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart proves how well planned out the project was even two years prior to when the Saturn V launched the capsule into space. Stages of the launch, orbit, descent, and return were precisely calculated...and those who owned this chart at the time could have followed along with the astronauts on every leg of the journey. \nThis chart is a wonderful paper souvenir of one of the most glorious events in humankind and yet very few people own it. So I hope to change that with this project. \nI have fully restored this original lunar landing chart, bringing out the deep blacks of outer space, and the details of the capsule drawings. Then I changed the hues of the earth and moon ( to give it that added sci-fi punch ) and colored the text and lines, adding plenty of \"stars\" too. \nA fifty-year-old chart given new life.....it deserves it. \nThis reissue of The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart will measure 1' x 3' ( 12\" x 36\"/30cm x 92cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4\" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. The title block will also feature foil stamping to really commemorate the occasion. This is a standard panorama frame size as well, so pre-made frames can easily be purchased. \nDetail from The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  Detail from The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  Simple rewards for a humble, but worthy, project......\nTHE STICKER SET - $5\nOne 4\" circular sticker featuring the original artwork from the Apollo 11 mission patch. The astronauts had wanted the image on the patch to be symbolic so they chose a bald eagle with its \"landing gear\" extended. The eagle is a proud symbol of the United States but it was also the name of the lunar module.

I enjoy the restoration work, all design aspects of the project, and handling \"customer service\" while Diana takes care of packaging duties. Currently, she is running her own Kickstarter campaign called The Past in Focus which also deals with history - restoring historic photographs.

I'm Lillian. You might know me from tracking lots of useless stats about myself or from the massive Bowie Vs Prince bike ride I started 10 years ago. I'm a chronic side hustler with a tendency for low-paid nonprofit work (I recently added it up: I had 40 jobs in my 20's). \nMy job titles tend to sound rather incredulous on paper:  \"Database Wizard\", \"Zine Librarian\", \"Bike Valet Attendant\".  I was once a emo band groupie, and now I sit on the board of an organization called the Harry Potter Alliance. I've flown across the country disguised as the Goblin King (twice) and attended city meetings dressed as the Portland airport carpet. Basically, I'm a millennial stereotype with an economics degree.\nTraditional personal finance hasn\u2019t worked for me, so I created money lessons that put your values at the forefront. It covers all the things you need to know to make your money plan, with a dash of glitter - from investing decisions explained by cats to a walk-through of student loan repayment that doesn't make you want to cough up a hairball.\nGet Your Money Together is friendly, fun personal finance workbook  designed with your passions, values, and personal goals in mind. It was created to help you uncover the things that are most important to you and craft a money plan that is meaningful for YOU. And there are CATS!\nI know so many folks who are ready to take control of their finances, but the material out there doesn't serve them. They want serious financial literacy but they don't want to fall asleep or break out in stress hives from trying to conquer their money.\nMost personal finance is boring, stressful, and quite frankly, has far too few cats. There's a lot of resources out there for learning about personal finance - but most of them don't take into account the way many of us work these days: variable income, side hustles, and no access to things like a 401K. \nGet Your Money Together's secret weapon is approachability - I understand that most of this money stuff has more to do with anxiety, stress, shame, or just confusion about what to do. Instead of overwhelm, I have made clear tools for you to make a plan for your future - with plenty of cats!\nWhy should I listen to you?\nYou can actually listen to me! - I'm on the air every week on Oh My Dollar!, a personal finance podcast and radio show with a dash of glitter. If this is the first time you have heard of me, I recommend you check out the podcast and see if my style resonates with you.\n   Some things people have said about Oh My Dollar!:\n\"Dave Ramsey for atheist millennials with student loan debt\" - iTunes reviewer WidgetSaurus\n\"This is the kick in the butt I needed. Stop procrastinating and manage your money! Very informative and not-over-the-top.\" - iTunes reviewer Eric\n\"If that manic pixie dream girl you knew in high school went and got an economics degree, and then started a radio show about Roth IRAs and David Bowie, that would be Oh My Dollar!\" - oddly correct unsolicited emailed review (still worried it was my high school girlfriend who sent that.)\nI only started teaching personal finance only because I was frustrated with the lack of queer-friendly, feminist, and, most of all, fun personal finance education out there - especially stuff that deals with actual real-life money issues and doesn't assume you have one full-time job with benefits, 2.5 kids, and a white picket fence.\nIntro: What We\u2019re Doing isn\u2019t Working - getting out of the financial litterbox\nChapter I:  You Do You  - digging up your values\nChapter II: Purr-fecting the Budget- how to start budgeting; handling variable income, with worksheets & forms\nChapter III:  Bury that Treasure  - building up your savings, emergency funds, FU money, sinking funds, and understanding your net worth\nChapter IV: Debt, The Financial Litterbox - understanding debt, debt snowball and debt avalanche, student loan repayment structures\nChapter V: Credit, The American Laser Pointer Chase - the history of the credit system, how to improve your credit, and why you might not care about catching that darn dot anyway\nChapter VI: Investing, Making More Fish - understanding investing buckets vs vehicles, choosing your investments without crying, why you should plan for your retirement, how to get started \"late\" saving for retirement\nInterlude: Stop Buying Things You Don't Need!\nChapter VII: Building Your Cat Tower (Mortgages) -  rent vs buy, how to prepare to buy your first house, how much house can you afford, things to consider when buying a condo\nChapter VIII: Getting Under the Blanket (Insurance) - How Insurance works, what to avoid & what to get, and conducting a break-even analysis\nAppendix: Hit-by-a-bus folder, cash flow worksheets, extra budgets, digital safety\nWhat if I need more than what's in the workbook?\nThe workbook is designed to stand alone as a program to work through your money, but I know that there's more learning styles out there than just written!\nYou can also back the kickstarter at the $59 level and receive access to the 8+ hours of in-depth video lessons from Get Your Money Together Bootcamp, plus calculators for things like debt payoff. \nThis is just some of the information covered in GYMT\nThese lessons go perfectly with the workbook, offering extra support when you need a term defined or just want to see a friendly face explain co-insurance costs.\nUsually the Get Your Money Together Bootcamp online is $89 for the course alone, so this is very economical way to get both together and to get 360 support on your journey to improve your relationship with money.\nIn addition to the workbook itself and the Get Your Money Together online course, we also have some truly excellent add-on packages. Check them out:\nLawcat's Guide To Life: Purr-fect for new grads! \nAdd on \"LawCat's Guide to Life\", a zine by licensed paw-ttorney and feline advocat @asklawcat that covers the basics you need to know about the law. This zine is made just for this kickstarter!\nCat Lover's Package\nYou can add-on a special edition (just for Oh My Dollar!) money print feline-sized bowtie (also fits small dogs) from Business Catual. If you have two stylish cats, never fear, you can add an extra bowtie to your pledge after the campaign ends.\n   For kittens of all religious purr-suasions\nDo you have a person in your life that could use some purr-sonal finance education right meow? \nAt check out at the end of the campaign, you can choose \"gift shipping\" and we'll send a certificate to the person of your choice by December 15th (3rd day of Hanukkah) letting them know their money workbook is on the way. They'll also get an access code to the online course to start using right away!\nObviously, we're all about budgeting! Be confident that not only will we be transparent but also we'll try to economize as much as possible.\n\nIt turns out moving stacks of paper around the world is expensive! \nFor a reasonable per-book price, the minimum order for books is 500 - it costs $3,787.50  - from that point on, most of our costs are shipping ($7 for US folks; more for overseas). Of course, in true Oh My Dollar! fashion, we've accounted for taxes and a \"stuff happens\" buffer.\nOh My Dollar! is on a mission to empower everyone to feel confident about their money, regardless of their income or life circumstances.  Oh My Dollar! delivers free, in-person financial literacy education to low-income young adults through local nonprofits - and 10% of all books printed will be donated to these programs.\nIf you'd like to round up your purchase with the Pay It Fur-ward program, we'll do a one-for-one match and get even more books to those who need them. For each book you purchase, one will be donated to someone in need, and you'll get a note from the person who received your generous donation!\nThese books cost less to get in folks' hands because we can deliver in person, which cuts down shipping + transaction costs by $9 per book!\n\nOur goal is to have over 200 Get Your Money Together Workbooks + Bootcamps donated to folks who could use a little purr-sonal finance education in 2018.  \n$10,000: Audio Edition - UNLOCKED\nSince we hit the $10,000 level, all backers will get a free audio edition of the workbook! The audio edition will be like a guided meditation for your money - listen while you commute, do the dishes, work out, or use alongside the workbook for extra motivation.\n$12,000: Purr-sonal Finance Merit Badge Stickers\nWE DID IT! Since we hit this stretch goal, I will include a free sheet of kitten-themed purr-sonal finance merit badges for every single physical book backer (ebook-only backers will be able to add on stickers for $2 after the campaign).  \n\nI believe that dealing with your money deserve some Girl Scout style accolades, and cute cats make everything a little better.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVacuums, allergies, fleas.\n\nNo, but seriously. This is my first Kickstarter campaign for my own work, but I've been lucky to be part of campaigns for multiple nonprofits over the past 7 years (Community Cycling Center, Portland Afoot, and the Independent Publishing Resource Center). I'm looking forward to taking what I learned from those experiences and improving even more.\n\nAll of the written content for the book is created, and about 25% of the illustrations are complete. With funding from this Kickstarter, I'll be able to pay the illustrators to finish up the artwork so we can deliver the most beautiful workbook possible (to keep you inspired about your budget, of course!)\n\nI've already identified and locked in quotes for book production overseas, with a printer that came highly recommended from other indie creators. Backers will get updates on the books and where things are in the process and we hope to avoid any delays. We've made the April fulfillment date generous in order to ensure that folks receive their books on time. We'd rather be early than late! \n\nI'm doing all fulfillment in-house with the help of Backerkit's excellent software, hoping to include the delightful little things that we have done on past fundraising campaigns: handwritten notes, stamped packages, and extras like stickers.\n\nApart from concerns about possible shipping delays, though, I'm looking forward to bringing more glitter-filled financial education into the world.

Update: We reached our goal in just 9 days! So, it\u2019s time to move the goalposts: Let\u2019s raise $350,000 and we'll build a screening room !!!\nMovie Madness is a Portland institution. Known for its vast collection, knowledgeable staff, and display cases full of legendary film props, the iconic Belmont storefront has a deserved reputation as one of the best video stores in the country.\nBut now Movie Madness is in danger of closing forever. The Hollywood Theatre has the chance to purchase Movie Madness and fold it into our nonprofit, ensuring that this invaluable collection remains available to Oregonians for years to come. We must raise $250,000 by November 10 or Movie Madness will close and the collection will be sold.\nWith your help, we can save this important piece of Portland\u2019s culture and ensure its collection of 80,000+ titles remains accessible to movie lovers everywhere.\nMovie Madness was founded in 1991 by Mike Clark. Mike is now ready to retire - and he\u2019s offered the Hollywood Theatre the chance to acquire his beloved business for $250,000. (The collection alone was recently appraised at $585,000.)\nIf we succeed in raising our goal, the Hollywood Theatre will buy Movie Madness - the business and the 80,000+ title collection - and transition it into our nonprofit. We will continue to rent the Belmont storefront for the foreseeable future, and Mike will continue to display his remarkable collection of film props in the store\u2019s film museum. We will also retain the store\u2019s current employees.\nThe Hollywood is the right organization to buy Movie Madness and ensure its long-term survival. We\u2019ve lovingly restored our 1926 movie palace, and opened our new microcinema at Portland International Airport. We brought 70mm film presentation back to Portland. And we\u2019re a thriving nonprofit with 3,200+ members who believe in our mission of preserving and promoting the art of film.\nBy acquiring Movie Madness, we\u2019re not trying to save a dying business model - we\u2019re going to help it evolve by rethinking the role it plays in the community.\nWe\u2019ll expand our popular membership program to include benefits at Movie Madness. \nWe\u2019ll explore community engagement opportunities through construction of a new screening room and the development of new partnerships. \nWe\u2019ll partner with Free Geek to provide affordable access to VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray players. \nWe\u2019ll continue to preserve and grow the collection, adding new releases and found treasures to ensure that Movie Madness remains a \u201cliving collection\u201d that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of the community it serves.\nWe\u2019ve already secured a $90,000 grant from the James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation to provide two years of operating support for the project, contingent on this campaign succeeding. We are prepared to invest time, energy, and money into this project to ensure the long-term viability of Movie Madness.\nThe single most important reason for acquiring Movie Madness is to keep its extensive collection accessible to the public. A collection of this size is an irreplaceable cultural resource.\nThere are 80,000+ titles in the Movie Madness collection. In 2016, according to Variety, Amazon had 18,405 movies and 1,981 TV shows; Netflix had 4,563 movies and 2,445 TV shows; and Hulu had 6,656 films and 3,588 television shows. (Read more about Netflix\u2019s \u201cabominable selection of classic cinema\u201d in this recent Newsweek article.) Movie Madness has twice as many titles available as all three platforms combined.\nStreaming services offer only the illusion of choice. In reality, their constantly shifting lineup is dictated by studio licenses and distributor contracts, with titles subject to vanishing without notice.\nAdditionally, plenty of movies never make it to these services in the first place. Whenever there is an industry transition to a new format, movies are left behind - obscure and cult titles rarely make the cut.\nThese movies are not just entertainment - they represent diverse perspectives in a time when diverse voices are sorely needed in public discourse, and provide snapshots into our cultural history that can enlighten our present. By acquiring the Movie Madness collection, we\u2019ll keep these titles available to the public, and we\u2019ll make sure that the rare and one-of-a-kind titles in the collection are preserved.\nPledge today, and help us keep this irreplaceable community resource alive.\nWe're excited to offer some unique rewards in return for your support!\nFor $25, you can get your hands on a wool felt pennant in either the Movie Madness or Hollywood Theatre design. For $35, we've got some beautiful enamel pins, designed exclusively for this Kickstarter project. For $40, you can wear your support with pride with our Movie Madness \u201cVHS\u201d tee, and for $50, our glow-in-the-dark \"Frankie\" tee.\nNew! For $75, we\u2019re offering a limited-edition 18\u201dx24\u201d screenprinted poster, featuring prominent films from the Movie Madness collection and plenty of easter eggs for Movie Madness fans. Illustrated by Jolby & Friends and printed by Seizure Palace.\nFor $80, you\u2019ll get two tickets to A Night With Todd Haynes, an exclusive double feature of BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and a newly restored, doll-themed rarity (the title of which we\u2019re not at liberty to mention). Both films will be presented in 35mm and the evening will be hosted by director Todd Haynes! We\u2019ll even throw in popcorn and two beverages per person.\nWe're also excited to offer new ways for our community to get involved with Movie Madness. For $100, you can select a film from their 80,000+ collection to be sponsored indefinitely under a name of your choosing (availability permitting). For $150, choose five movies to be featured in Movie Madness\u2019 Community Picks section - with recommendations provided by you. Your picks will be featured for one month.\nNew! For $400, we'll screen your favorite film from the Movie Madness collection in our *new* screening room! Once we finish construction, you\u2019ll be among the first to enjoy Southeast Portland\u2019s newest community space. Invite 15-20 of your closest friends for a private pizza party with complimentary pizza provided by Sizzle Pie.\nFor 25 lucky backers who pledge $500, we're handing over our marquee for you to display a personalized message. Why not use our marquee to surprise a friend and grab a photo! We'll choose a date together, and display your message from 11pm through 2pm the following day.\nFor $1,000 we're offering two tickets to a backers-only movie-themed dinner with award-winning local chef Naomi Pomeroy at her restaurant, Beast.\nFor $2,500, we'll walk you and 16 friends through airport security and screen a movie of your choosing at our PDX microcinema (schedule permitting). For $5,000, we'll screen your favorite movie for you and your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nAnd if that's not enough, for $10,000, we'll screen 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, or WEST SIDE STORY in 70mm for you and 383 of your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nWe'd like to thank Mike Clark for bringing this unique opportunity to us, for his all his generosity and hard work, and for his trust in the team at the Hollywood Theatre. We'd also like to thank the staff at Movie Madness (our future co-workers, we hope!) for their collaboration and enthusiasm for this project.\nThanks also to Todd Haynes for agreeing to host our very special double feature, Naomi Pomeroy and the staff at Beast for offering to host our backer dinner, Blue Chalk for our incredible project video (featuring Joaquin Lopez and Anahelena Goodman-Flood\u2014thank you!), Scarecrow Video for their advice and insights, Nate Ashley for his tireless work designing our campaign reward materials, and Andy McMillan for assisting with this Kickstarter project and managing our reward fulfillment.\nThank you also to Alison Hallett and Kristy Conrad for their extra effort on this Kickstarter campaign, and the rest of our office and theatre staff for their hard work day in and day out, our board for their steadfast guidance, and all 3,200+ Hollywood Theatre members for their support.\n\u201cMovie Madness is a place where a love of movies is completely and totally evident. An entire consummate encyclopedic collection of rare and obscure titles goes away if Movie Madness goes away. It would be not just the loss of an extraordinary collection, but a loss of a place that is a real, breathing tribute to the love of movies. It keeps you excited about the world to discover places like this.\u201d\n\u2014 Todd Haynes, Film Director & Hollywood Theatre Board Member \n\u201cThe Movie Madness library that the Hollywood Theatre would like to absorb is one of the most amazing collections of cinema archaeology that I have ever seen and it is very important that it be saved. This is a very worthy endeavor - give money to this project!\u201d\n\u2014 Gus Van Sant, Film Director\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine better bastions of film and TV history combining forces to create a whole new entertainment future for Portland than the Hollywood Theatre and Movie Madness. It\u2019s going to be tough to decide which one to spend more time in!\u201d \n\u2014 Tim Williams, Executive Director, Oregon Film\n\u201cUnparalleled in its breadth, depth, and genuine quirkiness, Movie Madness is the keeper of an important legacy. So much of the classic cinema behind its doors just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. Like a library, Movie Madness looks to enhance the future by preserving the past. I offer my full support to Hollywood Theatre and its effort to serve Portlanders, now and into the future, by preserving Movie Madness as a treasure for everyone to enjoy.\u201d \n\u2014 Vailey Oehlke, Director of Libraries, Multnomah County Library\n\u201cTruly great independent video stores with a collection of this size are an incredible asset for cinephile research and study. We can\u2019t tell you how many films have slipped into a copyright and/or distribution morass - there are many instances where a collection of early commercial releases like this is your only chance to see something exceptionally rare and unique. To lose such an incredible community resource would be heartbreaking.\u201d \n\u2014 Todd Wiener, Motion Picture Archivist, UCLA Film & Television Archive", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a community-supported nonprofit, we have a wealth of experience delivering on large-scale fundraising and crowdfunding efforts, having previously raised significant funds to bring 70mm film presentation back to Portland and managed multiple projects to restore our 1926 movie palace, including a prior Kickstarter to revive our marquee.\n\nWe've worked closely with Mike Clark to develop a transition plan for Movie Madness. He\u2019s ready to hand over the reins and we're ready to take them. At first, there will be no significant change to day-to-day operations at Movie Madness. Gradually, we'll begin to expand membership, begin work on the new screening room, etc.\n\nIf we don't raise the money, we don't buy the business.

You know your friends through the photos, videos, and messages they post, liking and favoriting them every day. But how well do you know them, really?  \nYou Think You Know Me is a conversational card game for 2-10 players that playfully tests how well you know your friends, family, partners, or coworkers \u2014 helping you learn more about what they love and who they are.\nEach box holds 500 cards, each with a unique prompt about the likes, dislikes, beliefs, and experiences of each player.\nYou Think You Know Me is my first card game! I started playtesting the idea with a handwritten paper prototype, and refined it into a professionally-printed production-ready prototype over the past few months, playing it in all kinds of settings with all kinds of people.\nThe prototype's been played on first dates and at big parties, in packed bars and quiet rooms, one-on-one and in big groups, and it always seems to lead to fun and surprising stories about everyone's lives.\nHow Do I Play?\nEach player is dealt a hand of seven cards, and play starts with the person whose birthday is closest.\nPlayers take turns choosing a card from their hand, and picking any other player to read it to, guessing how they would answer. If they guessed correctly, they discard the card. If they were wrong, they discard and draw a new card.\nThe first player to lose all their cards \u2014 and know everyone they're playing with best \u2014 wins the game!\nVariant - Reverse Play: All players start empty-handed, drawing cards from the box with each turn, and reading the card to the group \u2014 changing each card to a \"You know...\" statement. Every other player answers how they think the cardholder would finish the statement. The first person to answer correctly, or the player with the best answer, keeps the card. First player to get seven cards wins!\nVariant - No Rules: Don't like gameplay rules? You Think You Know Me is a great icebreaker and conversation starter. Bring a handful of cards to brunch, the bar, or on a date to start a conversation, or use them alone for writing prompts. Play anywhere, any time \u2014 play can be quiet intimacy or noisy fun, depending on your current company and location.\nWho Can Play?\nMy prototype's gotten a lot of wear, played by people of all types and ages.\nOfficially, You Think You Know Me is for ages 13 and up, but none of the cards are inappropriate for kids. My 13-year-old son is one of the most active playtesters, and my youngest nephew, age 10, is one of the game's biggest fans. Some of the cards just might need some more life experience to answer.\nWhile I'm lucky that my son is a communicative teenager, I know that can change and this game keeps us talking to each other in silly, interesting, and heartfelt ways. As he grows into his unique self, this is invaluable to me.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Ami Baio! My favorite dessert is cake. If I could be any animal for a day, I'd be a dolphin. I prefer sushi over ramen, window over aisle seats, vampires over werewolves. I haven't seen the Grand Canyon. I love tattoos, spending time alone, and I don't know how to fold a paper airplane. I don't believe time heals all wounds, I like giving people books, and I think diamonds are stupid. (This bio was written by drawing random You Think You Know Me cards.)\nYou might know my husband, Andy, who cofounded XOXO and helped get Kickstarter off the ground. He helped with the design of the cards and packaging, and maybe even wrote some of this project description because he's so smart and handsome.\nI've written over 1,000 cards for this project so far, and each one was inspired by the friends, family, and other awesome people I follow online. Thank you.\nSpecial thanks to Herbivore Clothing Company for the product photography, Chris Higgins for the project video, and my brother, Todd McHatton, for the soundtrack.

It always has, and if you\u2019ve ever bought a women\u2019s t-shirt from us and it was way too small, we apologize (chances are, this is not the first time we\u2019ve apologized to you for this). It\u2019s time we did something about it. So all we need to do is switch t-shirt suppliers, right? Wrong.\nYou see, finding a wholesale t-shirt manufacturer that fits all our criteria has been\u2026challenging (to say the least). We need a brand with modern fits, a wide range of colors and fabrics, ethical manufacturing, reliable quality and consistency, always-available stock, and it\u2019d be reeeeal nice if it was made in America. Finding a brand that checks all those boxes and oh yeah also fits women is damn near impossible. If you can find a women\u2019s brand that comes in our preferred colors and fabrics, it\u2019s only available in mega-tiny junior sizing. If it\u2019s sized to fit most women, the cut is awkward, the fabric isn\u2019t anywhere near our standards, and it comes in whatever color you want\u2026as long as that color is pink. It\u2019s frustrating for us as a company, and every bit as frustrating for you as our customer.\nSo we\u2019re gonna make our own. Introducing Blank, our new brand of size-inclusive, made-in-the-USA, better-fitting, premium t-shirts for women and men. Let us show you around.\n  Sorry premium t-shirt brands, but junior's sizing just isn't realistic for most women. That's why we designed Blank with standard women's sizing in mind. If you're normally a medium, you'll be a medium in Blank. (For a full size chart of women's and men's sizes, scroll almost all the way down.)\nDanina is 5\u2019 9\" and wearing an XL. Annie is 6\u2019 2\" and wearing a 2X. Sam is 5\u2019 5\" and wearing a Medium.\n  This is our Blank women's large next to a women's 2X from a typical wholesale t-shirt manufacturer (their largest women's size). We don't mean to pick on everybody else, but if that's as big as your biggest women's shirt gets, something's wrong.\nMost premium t-shirt brands ignore sizes beyond 2X, especially for women's tees. Not us. We're producing Blank tees from XS all the way to 5X, for both women and men.\nWith Blank, we focused heavily on revolutionizing our women's sizing, but fellas, we didn't forget about you. If you like the way Cotton Bureau shirts currently fit, don't worry, we didn't change much. A few little nips and tucks, but the biggest change is that they're available from XS all the way to 5X. Oh yeah, and they're made in the USA, which brings us to...\n  Most premium t-shirt manufacturers produce their t-shirts somewhere else, like China or Central America. We wanted to keep our manufacturing right here in the United States, so our tees are milled, dyed, cut, and sewn in Los Angeles.\n  Blank is made from 30 singles, 4\u20134.5oz, 100% combed ringspun cotton and tri-blend (50% polyester, 25% cotton, 25% rayon) fabrics. If that sounds like a bunch of garment industry gobbledygook to you, just know this: it's super-soft and super-comfy. To start, we're offering our 100% cotton tees in black and white, and our tri-blend tees in heather grey and heather black.\n  Core Colors: Tri-Blend Heather Grey, Tri-Blend Heather Black, 100% Cotton White, 100% Cotton Black\n  Our women's tees have a thinner collar and a slightly wider neck opening than a typical crewneck (though not quite a scoopneck). The body has a little shape to it, but isn't exaggerated like other women's fits. And it has real sleeves, not tiny cap sleeves. The overall fit is similar to a tee from The Gap or Torrid. Our men's shirt is a standard modern crewneck fit (a little on the slimmer side, but not too skinny), similar to other brands like American Apparel, Next Level, or Bella+Canvas.\n  At the end of our campaign, you'll have your choice of tees in 100% cotton (black and white) and tri-blend (heather grey and heather black) fabrics. If our campaign goes bananas, maaaaaybe we'll consider some other colors. You'll just have to wait and see ;) In the meantime, here are our reward levels.\nDo you run a t-shirt brand or print shop? We put together some sample packs in case you wanna test Blank as a wholesale option.\n    Our supporters called in the whole fleet and unlocked tri-blend navy tees. Thanks! But you know us, we\u2019re not going to rest on our laurels. We don\u2019t even know where our laurels are. So it is time to push for new stretch goals.\nNeutral colors are a solid basis for a wardrobe, but there\u2019s a whole world of color to explore. For every $12,000 we reach beyond our initial goal of $48,000, we\u2019ll be releasing another color.\nWe believe in democracy, and we believe in you, so you\u2019re going to decide what color goes in to production next. Keep checking our Kickstarter Updates to cast your vote and see how your favorite is doing.\nWe know it\u2019s not a v-neck (We promise those are on our future products list!) but we\u2019re working hard to bring you the best shirts in the best colors, because we like you, kind of a lot.\n            Michelle Sharp, Blank project lead. A one-woman-wrecking-crew, Michelle has almost single-handedly carried Blank for the past 12 months. She\u2019s been all over the country working to get us to this point and will continue to lead Blank through this campaign and beyond.\nMelanie Yi, our pattern maker. A 25-year veteran of the apparel industry, Melanie\u2019s been patiently holding our hand every step of the way\u2014producing (and tweaking, and tweaking, and tweaking) patterns, consulting on fabrics, fit, and model selection, and racking up frequent flyer miles between NYC and Pittsburgh.\nApparel Branders and Azitex, our cut-and-sew and fabric partner. Thanks to Moe, Moses, Jon, Pepe, Victor, and the rest of the crew in Downtown and South Central LA for not only making the highest quality fabric and apparel, but being patient with us and answering all our questions (we have a lot of questions).\nThe entire Cotton Bureau crew. This was, is, and will continue to be an all-hands-on-deck effort. Buckle up.\nFirst off, thanks to every Cotton Bureau customer and seller ever. Without you supporting us from Summer 2013 to today, this wouldn't be possible. Thanks to all 300+ of our Blank testers (and the 3,000+ who applied) for giving us amazing feedback.

Please help preserve this National Historic Landmark.\nThe Apollo Mission Control Center (MCC) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) is the site where NASA\u2019s flight control team planned, trained and executed a series of human spaceflight missions whose goal was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 mission achieved that historic goal \u2013 one of the most significant achievements in human history. In 1985, Historic Mission Control, a \u201ccathedral of engineering,\u201d was named to the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical significance.\nFast-forward more than 30 years later: Unlimited visitor access and declining budgets have taken a toll on this much-revered site. The result is that the condition of the Historic Mission Control has deteriorated to the point that the National Park Service listed it as \u201cthreatened\u201d in 2015.\nWith the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 approaching in 2019, restoration of Historic Mission Control is now urgent, and a crowd of supporters is gathering. Retired Historic Mission Control operations team members are working with Space Center Houston to secure the funds needed to restore the site and create a world-class visitor experience that will inspire future generations through this amazing story of technological and human achievement. In 2016, Space Center Houston launched a $5 million campaign to fund this important effort.\nThe nearby City of Webster, Texas, was home to many of the flight controllers, engineers, scientists and other Apollo-program personnel during the heyday of Apollo. In early 2017, the City of Webster stepped forward with a lead gift of $3.1 million for the campaign. On top of this major contribution, they added a challenge grant to encourage broad public participation in the campaign. \u201cThe Webster Challenge\u201d will match your gifts, dollar for dollar up to a maximum of $400,000, to help us meet our $5 million goal to restore Historic Mission Control. This Kickstarter campaign and the \u201cWebster Challenge\u201d is your chance to take part in this important mission.\nLocated on the third floor of Building 30 on the JSC campus, five distinct, interrelated areas make up Historic Mission Control. The Historic Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR2) includes the consoles used by flight controllers and large group display screens. Behind the screens is the summary display projection room, known as the \u201cbat cave.\u201d Adjacent to MOCR2 are two support rooms: the Simulation Control Room (Sim Room) and the Recovery Control Room, which served to coordinate support following splashdown. A wall with large windows separates MOCR2 from the Visitors Viewing Area, a dedicated space where family members and VIP guests were able to observe mission controllers without disrupting them. \nThe restoration project will focus on all five areas of Historic Mission Control, with the goal of accurately portraying how the area looked the moment the moon landing took place on July 20, 1969. Even more specifically, that look will portray the exact moment that the team of controllers, after achieving the impossible, put out their celebratory cigars and headed home for a much-needed night\u2019s sleep.\nCONSOLES AND OTHER DETAILS\nRestoration will return Historic Mission Control to its authentic appearance in July 1969. To do so, a number of changes to the configuration of the consoles will take place. When the room served as mission control for the Space Shuttle Program during the 1980s, consoles were reconfigured and technology was upgraded. The project will restore each of the consoles to the Apollo era, specifically to mimic their Apollo 15 operational configuration. \nConsole arrays (such as panels, switches, indicators and monitors) also will be configured to their Apollo 15 locations, which represents the apex of technological achievement of the Apollo missions. Consoles will be shipped to the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas, where experts in the SpaceWorks division will restore and reanimate each console. SpaceWorks has restored numerous flown space artifacts around the globe, including artifacts currently in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum. They will install appropriate buttons and sequences and light the monochromatic displays on the CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors.\nThe reanimation of the consoles is a key component of bringing MOCR2 \u201cback to life\u201d for future visitors. In addition, the large group displays on the west wall of the MOCR2 will be reactivated using appropriate projection technology to recreate Apollo-era use of the screens. Lighting will be replaced in the room with dimmable LED lights, recreating the lighting settings that maximized control operations during Apollo missions. This will avoid future damage to historic furnishings from long-term exposure to unfiltered UV radiation. Even the historic \u201cblue\u201d overtone from the world map screen will be recreated. \nOther important details include restoring and replacing the historic furnishings specific to the Apollo era. Extensive research, including interviews with Apollo flight controllers in the MOCR2, will confirm the activities that took place at each console and discover what types of personal items would be found on each console. We will replicate everything such as ash trays, binders, pencils, headsets and coffee cups.\nWe have a unique opportunity through the Webster Challenge to double every dollar you contribute up to a maximum of $400,000. This will give us a major boost in getting to our final goal of $5 million to fully realize the restoration project. \nHistoric Mission Control is more than just a site where history was made. It is a symbol of the dedicated team that achieved many extraordinary milestones through a process that continues to inspire generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts to tackle the technological and scientific challenges of today and tomorrow. A fully restored Historic Mission Control will pay tribute to this achievement and will have inestimable value to future educational programs that encourage young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).\nHistoric Mission Control and the men and women who supported it are responsible for extraordinary innovation and technological advancements that we use every day. Knowledge gained from the Apollo era has probably helped you more than you realize. Check out some of the ways Apollo-era NASA discoveries have improved daily life in the infographic below.\nIsn\u2019t Space Center Houston funded by the U.S. Government? The answer is no. Space Center Houston, a project of the Manned Space Flight Education Foundation, is the nonprofit 501(c)(3) science center that serves as the Official Visitor Center of JSC. Space Center Houston relies on private contributions and ticket revenue to fund its operations. Projects like the restoration of Historic Mission Control depend entirely on private contributions.\nWe believe the Kickstarter community wants to make significant things happen. This project will restore and bring back to life one of the most important human achievements of the 20th century. We want to provide many people around the world the opportunity to be a part of this effort; Kickstarter is the best way to encourage your participation.\nYour involvement does not end when you back our campaign. We will share updates on the progress of the restoration on a regular basis.\nThis is your chance to be a part of history!\nIn 2015, NASA officials worked with the National Park Service to develop the \u201cHistoric Furnishings Report and Visitor Experience Plan\u201d that serves as the key planning document for the restoration. In late spring 2017, a consultation process took place with retired Apollo flight controllers, the National Park Service, JSC and Space Center Houston to develop specific recommendations for the restoration, all in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.\nThe project will start in August 2017 with the restoration and reanimation of the consoles, as this part of the project has the longest lead time. While this is taking place, crews will begin basic cleaning, repair and refurbishment of the site, replacing carpet and acquiring all the historic furnishings required for a fully authentic Historic Mission Control. The anticipated completion date for the entire project is January 2019, in advance of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.\nThe budget for the project includes the cost of the restoration of Historic Mission Control, future maintenance of the historic landmark and the development of a first-class visitor experience that will interpret the historic Apollo program for the public. Kickstarter funds also will be used to produce and deliver unique Apollo-inspired rewards for backers like you!\nWe have a unique selection of rewards for space enthusiasts, history buffs and everyone in between. Renowned Star Trek designer Michael Okuda created a special mission patch for this project; a cardboard punch-out model of the Apollo 11 command module commemorates the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing; and the new documentary, \u201cMission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo,\u201d is available for download. For backers interested in unique experiences, we have several once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to meet the real legends of Historic Mission Control!\nWhere goods and services are provided by Space Center Houston in exchange for your contribution, the amount that is deductible for federal income tax purposes is limited to the excess of your total contribution over the fair market value of the goods and services provided.

Please allow an additional four to six weeks for your reward to ship internationally. Note: we are not responsible for international customs fees. \nSome of the experiential rewards (such as tours, events and panel presentations) are offered at a specific time and place. Space Center Houston is not responsible for travel or other costs incurred by the backer to participate in these experiences. If a cause beyond the control of Space Center Houston requires cancelling or rescheduling an experience, Space Center Houston is not responsible for any additional travel or costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time. Space Center Houston cannot guarantee that the experiences are occurring on dates yet to be announced, or that if they must be rescheduled, will occur on a date that is convenient for all backers.\nSpace Center Houston is owned and operated by the Manned Space Flight Education Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Space Center Houston, a leading science and space learning center with extensive educational programs, draws more than 1 million visitors annually. Space Center Houston is Houston\u2019s first Smithsonian Affiliate and the Official Visitor Center of JSC. More than 200,000 youth from around the world visit the center annually to experience our educational space museum with more than 400 things to see and participate in targeted STEM programs. \nVisitors come to Space Center Houston to tour the JSC campus and get a close up view of NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program. Historic Mission Control is the most popular and revered site on the NASA Tram Tour. Once Historic Mission Control is fully restored, visitors will be able to see and experience the actual room where NASA flight controllers made history.\nSince the City of Webster was incorporated in 1958, NASA has served as a catalyst to grow the city and the region. Webster is home to more than 2,200 business \u2013 many of which are aerospace companies working on NASA\u2019s current deep space missions and the daily operations for the International Space Station. The city\u2019s global importance to space exploration will continue through this generous gift. \nThe City of Webster for its leadership and generosity in helping to bring this project to life; Retired Apollo Flight Directors Gene Kranz and Milt Windler, controllers Ed Fendell, Spencer Gardner, Denny Holt, Jack Knight and William Moon; Adam Holt; Michael and Denise Okuda; Sandra Tetley, Space City Films; Haviland Digital, Keith Haviland and Gareth Dodds. \nSpace Center Houston is using Kickstarter, a third-party online funding platform.

I'm Lucy Bellwood, a professional Adventure Cartoonist living in Portland, Oregon. I'm running this campaign to fund a printed collection of my 100 Demon Dialogues Project and a companion plush toy to keep you all company as you bicker with (and perhaps get to love) your own inner jerks.\nWhat's all this about? Here's the scoop:\nBack in 2015 I started exploring a series of illustrated dialogues between myself and a small, obnoxious character who had a lot of big ideas about everything I was supposedly doing wrong in my life and my career. \nSharing these illustrations induced a particular kind of catharsis: it turned out most everyone I knew was struggling with feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety. Externalizing these conversations and giving them a humorous twist often enabled me to overcome my self-doubt and get on with the exciting business of Making Good Art\u2014and it seemed to help other people do the same.\nThis year, for The 100 Day Project, I decided to delve deep into these Demon Dialogues. For the past three months, I've been drawing a demon every day, exploring all the ins and outs of the creative process, growing up, and trying to live a balanced life as an adult in the 21st century. (You can read all the entries online for free right here.)\nThe project has garnered a massive and humbling response. I've heard from so many people who saw themselves in these illustrations and were able to laugh at the absurdity of the demon's demands or nod in recognition when something hit too close to home. Lots of people were asking for books or prints, so I decided to launch this campaign to bring a physical edition of the project to life.\nThe primary goal of this campaign is to produce a print edition of the complete 100 Demon Dialogues series. I'll be making softcover and hardcover editions available, both with all the fancy bells and whistles I can think of. \nSoftcover editions will measure 6\"x 6\" and feature French Flaps, color covers, spot foil, and patterned inner covers.\nHardcover editions will measure 6\" x 6\" and feature ribbon bookmarks, colored spine stitching, spot foil, and patterned endpapers.\nBoth editions contain all 100 entries from this year's 100 Demon Dialogues project, printed in black and white, plus a brief essay on what I learned while completing the project. If things go really well, I'll be including a gallery of additional demon entries from previous iterations of this project, but let's get the basics down first.\nOf course, the logical companion for the print edition is a cuddly demon of your very own! \nI've partnered with Soft Stuff Creations to produce a plush toy demon for all your bickering needs. Here's a look at the prototype:\nThis little fella measures about 15\" from tip to tail and has beans in his backside so he can easily sit up on any surface you care to place him on. The body and eyes are both ultra-soft, short fur, and the eyes and mouth have embroidered edges. His floppy limbs windmill in a very pleasing manner when you throw him down a flight of stairs, too. \n\"Ugh, I can't believe you like this band.\"\nSoft Stuff Creations has a stellar record of producing plush toys for folks like KC Green and Kate Beaton, and I'm really excited to be working with them for this reward.\nWhile I'm deliberately keeping this campaign simple so I can better focus on producing high-quality books and toys, I am offering a limited-edition run of signed and numbered, reversible letterpress prints, produced in partnership with my pal Emily Riley of Rx Letterpress, a local Portland printer.\nThese prints will be 6\"x9\", featuring black and blue ink with a custom watercolor wash\u2014which means no two will be alike! You can hang them whichever way appeals to you the most, or switch \u2019em up depending on the day.\n(Concept art only, final design forthcoming.)\nIf you're looking for prints of specific Demon Dialogues, never fear: the fine folks at Buyolympia have got you covered. You can buy prints of every single demon from the series right here.\n  Of course, producing all these exciting things takes money, which is where Kickstarter comes in! The operating budget for this campaign looks like so:\nFor all you number nerds, here's the breakdown. [Note: these numbers are current quote estimates and may change, but we've been careful to overestimate where possible so there won't be any nasty surprises.]\n~$9,540 to Soft Stuff Creations for plushie design and production.\n~$3,050 to the print team for book production and shipping.\n~$1,000 for print brokerage and negotiation.\n~$8,000 to Blackbox, who will be bringing their stellar customer service and logistical experience to the table to get your packages shipped intact and on schedule.\n~$600 to Allyson Haller, my fabulous book designer.\n~$320 to Rx Letterpress for limited-edition demon prints.\n5% for Kickstarter fees (about $1,214, with current figures).\n2-5% for credit card processing fees (variable, but again: about $1,200).\nThis takes us just about up to $25,000, which you'll notice is the goal for this campaign. I try to be transparent about my finances as often as possible, so here's the deal: this campaign is to fund the production of these items, which is why I\u2019m setting the base funding goal at 25k. \nHowever, reaching the magic number of $32,500 will ensure that I\u2019ll be able to afford the taxes on this income (The More You Know: Kickstarter money counts as income for creators!). The final rate may be less than 30% because many of these expenses are deductible, but it's always best to play it safe where this stuff is concerned. \nThere are no official stretch goals for this campaign because I wanted to jump straight into making the best possible thing right off the bat, so consider this our one above-the-mark mission. Deal? Deal.\nSupport Team\nI'm thrilled to be working with the following companies to ensure the backend of this campaign runs as smoothly as possible:\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third Kickstarter campaign, and I'm really looking forward to implementing everything I learned during my first two successful experiences.\n\nAll the illustrations in the 100 Demon Dialogues series are complete! I've been working hard to get as much of the book design done ahead of time as possible, so all that remains is gather that artwork and getting the final files put together with my fabulous book designer, Ally.\n\nFor both books and plushies: production and transit time are hefty where overseas projects are concerned. I'll be keeping backers abreast of the production process so they can see what goes into designing and producing these objects, but we can't get around how long it takes them to arrive from abroad. \n\nOur March 2018 arrival estimate is VERY generous to allow maximum time for potential delays. I'd rather your rewards be a pleasant, early surprise than an overdue burden! I will, of course, keep everyone fully apprised in the updates of when to expect their goods. Blackbox and BackerKit, our survey and fulfillment companies, both have fantastic customer service and backend interfaces to help guarantee that your books and plushies arrive in a timely and undamaged fashion. I have the utmost faith in them. \n\nAside from shipping delays, though, we're looking at a solid, stress-free experience bringing some exciting things into the world.

Vostok 1 was launched on April 12, 1961 from Baikonur Cosmodrome with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, making him the first human to cross into outer space. It was also an orbital spaceflight consisting of a single orbit and took 108 minutes from launch to landing.\nTHE CAMPAIGN\nIn 2014 and again in 2015 we asked the Kickstarter community to support our Historic Robotic Spacecraft Print Series. With the sucessful completion of both campaigns the series grew to a total of nine designs including Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, Mars Exploration Rovers, Sputnik, New Horizons, Rosetta, Galileo and a special LightSail design donated to The Planetary Society for their own record breaking Kickstarter campaign. \n  Now we propose a whole new series of prints with a new space exploration theme; The most important missions of human spaceflight in history. Like before, each of the posters will be screen-printed at with a minimum of three colors by Vahalla Studios who beautifully executed the series shown above. However, this time the dimensions will be landscape at 32\"x16\".\nHOW DID WE CHOOSE THE MISSIONS?\nWe didn\u2019t choose them, the public did by participating in our poll on SurveyGizmo. We asked everyone to chose their three favorite missions of human spaceflight and the results are now in.\nThe missions and spacecraft chosen are:\n32\"x16\" Screen Print of Apollo 11\nPOSTER #1: APOLLO 11 [design completed]\nThe first mission of human exploration on the surface of the Moon. Neil Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Buzz Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They both spent just under a day before rendezvousing with Michael Collins piloting the command module in lunar orbit and returning to Earth.\n32\"x16\" Screen Print of ISS (as of Feb 28)\nPOSTER #2: ISS [minor revisions still to be made] \nInternational Space Station is a microgravity and space environment research laboratory which supports experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other scientific research. It is also the current record holder for the longest continuously crewed spaceflight mission now since November 2000.\n32\"x16\" Screen Print of Vostok 1 (as of March 5)\nPOSTER #3: VOSTOK 1 [minor revisions still to be made]\nThe first human spaceflight in history. Vostok 1 was launched on April 12, 1961 from Baikonur Cosmodrome with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, making him the first human to cross into outer space. It was also an orbital spaceflight consisting of a single orbit and took 108 minutes from launch to landing.\nAlthough the poll results are public and the missions to be featured for posters 1-3 have been selected, please do continue to participate in the poll. If this campaign performs well we are likely to do a series two and will want to know what missions to include in posters #4, #5 and #6.\nPROJECT PHASES\nThis campaign will have three phases:\nPHASE 1:  For two weeks we will poll for the most popular human spaceflight missions according to our SurveyGizmo poll.\nPHASE 2: On Feb 13 we announced the two additional missions to complete the trio.\nPHASE 3: On Feb 25 we will release the design for ISS and a week later we will post the design for Vostok 1. \nREWARDS\nTHE APOLLO 11 T-SHIRT\nThe newest Chop Shop t-shirt based on our Apollo 11 poster design. This is the default t-shirt reward for this campaign and will be included in all reward levels that include a tee (unless otherwise requested in your final survey).\nThe Apollo T-Shirt (still in progress)\n  THE ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT SERIES SCREEN PRINTS\nMany of the original screen prints from the Spacecraft series are still for sale and available as rewards for this campaign or as add-ons. They include Cassini, Curiosity, Mars Exploration Rovers, New Horizons, Rosetta and Galileo.\nSome screen prints from the Spacecraft Series are still available\n  THE ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT SERIES AS ARCHIVAL DIGITAL PRINTS\nAll of the designs from the original Spacecraft Series will always be available as archival digital prints (including Voyager and Sputnik) and can be selected as rewards for this campaign or as add-ons.\nVarious archival digital prints from all three series\n  VOYAGER OR CURIOSITY T-SHIRTSThe Voyager and Curiosity t-shirt designs from our Spacecraft Series will also be available to any backers at a t-shirt level or as add-ons. \nVoyager and Curiosity Robotic Spacecraft T-shirts\n  ABOVE EARTH OR BEYOND EARTH T-SHIRTS\nBoth Beyond Earth and Above Earth feature 23 historic missions of space exploration. These will be made available in styles for both Men & Women and screen-printed on American Apparel or Gildan brand t-shirts. See more at chopshopstore.com.\nBeyond and Above Earth Tees\n  MIKE MONGO\u2019S ASTRONAUT INSTRUCTION MANUALThe Astronaut Instruction Manual is an actual working astronaut instruction manual. It is created to let today\u2019s space-loving young students who want to live, work, and play in space know that they genuinely do have that opportunity. Just by their being 9-to-12 years old at this moment in human history, today\u2019s young students can be one of the Humannaires*, the next-generation of astronauts, by the time they are out of college. The book was also recently optioned by Legendary Entertainment and is in early pre-production for a television series adaptation.\nThe Astronaut Instruction Manual\n  LOTS OF STICKERS\nThere will be new stickers for the three new designs (images to come), but stickers from the Spacecraft Series will also be made available for sticker level rewards and as add-ons.\nThe sticker for both series\u2026 so far\n  WHAT ABOUT ADD-ONS?\nIf you wish to combine any other items with your chosen reward just follow these rates when adding:\nScreen prints +$50 \nSmall archival digital prints +$25 \nMedium archival digital prints +$35 \nT-shirts +$25 \nOversize t-shirts +$28 \nAstronaut Instruction Manual +$12 \nStickers +$3 \njust do the math and add to your total pledge amount shown but keep your reward on the higher priced item. Any additional US postage should be covered by your selected reward level, but International shipments can be subject to additional shipping fees depending on the complete package.\nApollo 11: 32\"x16\" Screen Print\n  International Space Station: 36\" x 18\" Screen Print\n  Vostok 1: 36\" x 18\" Screen Print\nTHANKS\nI am very much wanting to thank the Kickstarter community for the success of our Spacecraft Series One and Two. That was the beginning of a whole new arm of Chop Shop Store which now claims several space exploration partners including The Planetary Society, SEDS, Icarus Interstellar and Yuri\u2019s Night.\nNothing but praise and thanks again to The Planetary Society without whom the original Spacecraft campaign (and I\u2019m sure this one too) would have been but a shodow of what they ultimately became.\nThanks also to Kleptonaut for always providing the background music featured in the video.\nThanks also to your for reading this far and considering your support of the Giant Leap Series.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks I see for this campaign are that I lose the ability to control my right hand which will produce all the drawings.

We are aware that that was a huge mistake.  We will make things right and focus on making sure your games get to each one of you ASAP.  I have taken the reigns again and will not rest until fulfillment is completed.  \n\n\n You can reach me at my personal email:\n\n\n\n Or you can send me a whatsapp at my personal number  \n\n +52 55 20477135\n\n\n There is no excuse for our lack of communication over the last year and a few months, but I just want to tell you that, for a moment, I was afraid of some treats directed to me personally.  I totally understand the context and frustration that can cause such behavior and thus I am now open to hear and read everything that every one of you want to tell or ask me.\n\n The shipment we promised back on May 2019 has been done for a while (as can be seen on attached video), but we have ran into complications with the logistics aspect of it because the company we had a fulfillment agreement with (shipnaked) does no longer offer the fulfillment service.  We have struggled to find any other company that can come even slightly close to their prices.  Closest we have gotten is about 70% over and that is a big setback.  Now, this makes a huge difference because it was the only quote that matched our cost planning for the project.   \n\n We found ourselves at a crossroads and did not push through but rather stepped aside for a while.  As head of the Project, I reiterate my apologies.  I should have been more involved in this last process and I regret I wasn\u2019t.  I was waiting too passively for something to happen that could fix this and that brought us here. Now I am writing this because I am committing myself and the team to be entirely accountable for this situation until the fulfillment of the games is done.\n\n All I can say is that I and the team are determined to deliver this game to all of you.  It is my goal still to bring some joy to all your homes and keep the promise that we made long time ago.  There are about $65,000 USD for the fulfillment of this Project and we will make our best to stretch them as far as possible.  \n\n Here is the plan:\n 1. First thing we are doing is requesting several fulfillment quotes from as many fulfillment centers as we can contact.  (Began this week until the mid of October)\n 2. Select the one with the best price / reputation and one that offers tracking for all of your packages.  (End of October)\n 3.  Once the fulfillment center and its location is known we can begin quoting shipment from Mexico to that facility.  (First two Weeks in November)\n 4. Ship the games (Around November 15th)\n 5. Fulfillment facility should be getting the games around the end of November.  \n 6. Fulfillment individual orders to begin first week of December for delivery on or before the beginning of January.  \n "}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 2803, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/880827004/the-grid-game-the-reinvention-of-the-dominoes", "project_name": "The Grid Game / The reinvention of the Dominoes!"}}, {"backer": "Matt Grommes", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Stretch goal update: if we reach $80,000, I'll hire a community manager for Micro.blog to help build a safe community from the start. See this update on Kickstarter for details on the stretch goal and a new feature called Safe Replies.\nHi, my name is Manton Reece, and I\u2019m writing a book called Indie Microblogging. I'm also launching a brand new platform for microblogs.\nDo you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?\nIn the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren\u2019t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.\nToday, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can\u2019t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.\nI want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.\nI first set out to build a new service just for microblogs. It has a timeline experience like a social network, with replies and favorites, but it\u2019s based on RSS, with the main posts pulled from independent sites.\nIf you don\u2019t have a microblog yet, there\u2019s a full publishing interface with Markdown support and a native iPhone app. I call it Micro.blog.\nThe second thing I\u2019m doing is writing a book and I\u2019d love your support for it on Kickstarter. This short book will make the case for microblogging and show you how to participate in the growing community of writers who own even their short-form writing.\nSome of the topics:\nHow to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with microblogs.\nThe important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out there.\nTips for integrating your microblog into an existing full weblog.\nThe architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how I built Micro.blog.\nOverview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.\nPlus my own personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve our content on the internet.\nYou\u2019ll get the book itself and early access to Micro.blog so you can reserve your username. Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.\nI love real books, too, so I\u2019m even doing a limited run of print copies of the book in addition to the standard e-book. There are also rewards with Micro.blog stickers and more.\nOver the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles to my blog about independent microblogging and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing \u2014 as well as brand new essays and technical topics \u2014 to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into it.\nThere's a growing community and movement around independent microblogging. With your support, we can take back the future of the web from closed platforms and silos, and leave our own mark on the web. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting a book \u2014 even a short one like Indie Microblogging \u2014 is a lot of work.

Today we are in a very different moment, one that requires new images that reject the hate, fear, and open racism that were normalized during the 2016 presidential campaign. So on Inauguration Day, We the People will flood Washington, DC with NEW symbols of hope.\nThis art has been already been commissioned by the Amplifier Foundation. Some of the greatest activist artists working today, including Shepard, Ernesto Yerena, and Jessica Sabogal, have collaborated with photographers to create a series of images that capture the shared humanity of our diverse America.\nNow the tricky part: printing and distributing these images on a massive scale in time for Inauguration. \nMuch of Washington will be locked down on Inauguration Day, and in some areas there will be severe restrictions on signs and banners.  But we've figured out a hack.  It's called the newspaper!  On January 20th, if this campaign succeeds, we're going to take out full-page ads in the Washington Post with these images, so that people across the capitol and across the country will be able to carry them into the streets, hang them in windows, or paste them on walls.\nEvery dollar you put into this campaign will buy six ads printed and distributed for us.\nAmplifier will also distribute these images as large placards throughout DC at Metro stops, out the back of moving vans, at drop spots to be announced in the coming week via our social media feeds, and, on January 19, as free downloads for you to print and share as you like.\nAnd for every donation over $5 we will even send a postcard of the art of your choosing to the incoming President after he takes office! (Stay tuned for the text we will use!)  \nThis art is meant to spark a conversation, and after January 20, our work will continue. What does WE THE PEOPLE\u2014these three famous words in the preamble to the Constitution\u2014mean in the 21st century? Over the next several months, Amplifier will partner with organizations, schools, and everyday families to create spaces across the county, in both red states and blue, where we can speak, listen, and share our answers. Watch for updates on this as the campaign funds and moves into the world!\nWHO ARE WE?\nSHEPARD FAIREY is one of the most accomplished street artists in the world, and creator and founder of Obey Clothing and Obey Giant, first becoming known for his \"Andre The Giant has a Posse\" sticker campaign while at the Rhode Island School of Design. He became widely known during the 2008 presidential election for his Barak Obama \"Hope\" poster. \nJESSICA SABOGAL is a first generation Colombian American muralist. Her art serves as a haven, a tribute, a creative outlet of adoration and exaltation for women with stories often untold. Her pieces possess a vision of female identity that is revolutionary and powerful, brave and beautiful. Most recently she has created a visual campaign entitled, \u201cWomen Are Perfect\u201d which attempts to spread this simple but necessary notion worldwide.\nERNESTO YERENA is an artist living in Los Angeles.  His art brings political concerns to light with subject matter that depicts cultural icons, rebels and everyday people voicing their stance against oppression. While Yerena identifies as Chicano he also strongly identifies as Native/Indigenous to this continent which is often seen in his work. Highly recognized for his activism, Yerena is the founder and curator of the Alto Arizona Art campaign (2010) as well as a founding member of the We Are Human campaign (2009).\nTHE AMPLIFIER FOUNDATION:  Our non-profit is dedicated to amplifying the voices of grassroots movements through art and community engagement. We do this by funding collaborations between those movements and contemporary artists so that their messages can reach a wider audience. Our goal is to flip artists into activists and observers into participants.  \nOur work has supported Criminal Justice Reform projects with Cut50.org, Environmental campaigns working with Indigenous groups against the KXL pipeline and in defense of Treaty Rights in the Black Hills, and we have, just this week, commissioned, and started printing and distributing the majority of the art for the Women's March on Washington as an official partner.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are here to find partners as much as funding.  When this message is heard we want them to know it comes direct from the people.  Our goal is 10,000 backers in this Kickstarter and ten times that many participants after Inauguration day. \nTHE REWARDS:\n STAY TUNED FOR PHASE 2!\n___________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo matter what, we have the ability to get tens of thousands of pieces of this art printed to distribute for free in public. We also have guarantees from the silkscreen and offset printers that our product can be made in a timely manner. There is a very, very small chance the Washington Post could reject our ad at the last minute, though we have been talking to their ad department for some time and they know what we are running. If that were to happen, we would buy ad space in other DC papers that day, and we would continue to spread the art beyond Inauguration Day via billboards, bus-shelter ads, etc.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nCREDITS \n\n/ PHOTOGRAPHERS /\nDelphine Diallo: www.delphinediallo.com\nRidwan Adhami: www.ridwanadhami.com\nArlene Mejorado: www.amejorado.com\nAyse Gursoz: www.aysegursoz.com\n\n/ ARTISTS /\nShepard Fairey: www.obeygiant.com\nErnesto Yerena: www.hechoconganas.com \nJessica Sabogal: www.jessicasabogal.com\n\nFILM\n\n/ SOUNDTRACK /\n\u201cRock The Nation\u201d by LA Symphony \n\u201cThe War\u201d by The Procussions\nSoundmix by Split Rock Studios: jasonsarubbi.com \n\n/ CINEMATOGRAPHY /\nEric Becker: www.weareshouting.com\nMax Basch: www.maxwellbasch.com\nMike Lawrence\nMelinda James: www.aboutherfilms.com\nAdrien Oneiga: www.oneiga.com\nLenny Mesina: www.therapystudios.com/editors/lenny-mesina\n\n\n/ Produced / Edited / Directed by May Day / www.maydaycreative.org /\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard to the President", "descp": "We will send a postcard hand signed with your name to the president with the art of your choosing.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["498 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "We The People Sticker Pack", "descp": "Five stickers from the \"We the People\" series, one from each of the 5 art pieces.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card to the President", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,756 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Amplifier Sticker Super Pack", "descp": "Super pack of stickers which include 20 mixed Amplifier Stickers from a selection of renowned international artists including Shepard Fairey, Ernesto Yerena, Chip Thomas, Josh MacPhee, Roger Peet, Gregg Deal, Jessica Sabogal and more!

In each episode, we'll use VR to interview creators from inside the digital worlds that they've created, giving you a unique new perspective on their work.\nFor the first season of the show, we're producing five episodes. We'll release the first episode on Oculus Home and Steam in December, a few weeks after this Kickstarter closes. And if you haven't bought a VR headset yet, Kickstarter backers will be able to watch the first season using our experimental non-VR client. After that, you'll get two episodes of The FOO Show every month, until we complete this first season. \nSTRETCH GOALS: We've posted stretch goals in the updates section, but we wanted to let you know about them here. We're already adding hats that you can put on the avatars in the first season of the show. Our next goal is to add a virtual version of the delightful Danny Baranowsky as our bandleader to the first season. Check out the post for full details, and enjoy a sneak peek at the theme he's written for us below. \n We have more stretch goals, planned, so let's make this awesome graphic even longer in the next 48 hours or so! \n     Even if you don't have a VR headset, you can watch (and interact with) The FOO Show. In addition to standing and room-scale VR with hand controllers (like the Oculus Touch or HTC Vive), seated or standing VR with a gamepad, Kickstarter backers will get exclusive early access to our 2D client. Using the 2D client, you'll be able to watch the show, explore the environment, and even pick up, rotate, and take a closer look at the objects you find in the world. \nAt FOO, we believe that VR shows should highlight the strengths of virtual reality. They should be engaging and interactive, but most of all, they should be fun. That's why we've built immersive, 3D-rendered worlds for our guests and viewers to explore. Our show can only exist in virtual reality. If you've tried our Firewatch episode, you know that exploring the inside of a video game--walking around and picking up props is exciting, fun, and a completely unique experience. (If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Head over to Steam or Oculus Home and try it out now, the preview is free!) \nUltimately, we believe making this kind of virtual reality show should be accessible to everyone. You shouldn't need a Hollywood production studio and a multi-million dollar budget to build the type of shows we envision. We want the virtual reality equivalent to the television show to take full advantage of the strengths of the medium--VR demands interactivity. Producing The FOO Show on a regular schedule is the first step on the path to making that dream a reality.\nWe've been working on FOO for more than a year. It turns out, it takes time to turn an idea into something people can use every day. Our deliberate approach has let us continue to iterate and learn from our experiments and minimize time lost due to mistakes.  \nWe started with the animation. Andre built a simple prototype last summer to experiment with inverse kinematics using the Rift DK2 and a Razer Hydra. He sent a version of that to me so I could see how it worked in person.  \nHow do elbows work again?\nAs you can see, the movement was OK, but the arm joints weren't modeled in a believable way. Instead of the complex movement of the human shoulder, we relied on a simple ball and socket joint.  \nOur next step was to build a demo we could show to potential production partners and investors. We brought Sindre on, who built the first version of my custom avatar, and jammed out a demo that I showed to a few hundred people in the fall of 2015.  \nOh snap!\nWe iterated the demo a few times, and went to some fun/weird places building variants with increasingly weird features. Those culminated in this proto-FOO Show, where I interviewed myself about why I quit my job to start a VR company. It demonstrated the VR talk show concept to people who didn't get it, but was also kind of terrifying.  \nThis may be hard to believe, but interviewing yourself about yourself is challenging.\nOur next major milestone was our first public release of the Firewatch episode. In addition to figuring out how to record our avatars, we also had to track objects, and it was our first time recording multiple people at the same time, in the same space.  \nI regret not asking Jake and Sean about this mug. It remains hilarious to me.\nSince then, we've done a lot more work, added the ability to animate and track the state of objects in the world, further improved the character animation, added a rudimentary editor, built the experimental 2D client, built a VR-native user interface for the client, and lots more. We can't wait to show you what else we've been working on.\nLook, sometimes I miss the old Franken-arms.\n  We're raising $50,000 to pay for production of the first five episodes of The FOO Show. Our costs vary based on the location we're shooting, the amount of hardware we need on-site, the personnel we need on-site, the number of guests we have, and the complexity of the game assets we have to import or create. While travel and on-site personnel can be expensive, our largest cost lies in building virtual sets, creating avatars for our guests, and adapting art from other projects to work in virtual reality. Our cost for the episodes we're planning ranges from $5,000 to $20,000, with an average price of $10,000. \nWe already have one full episode of The FOO Show done and ready to publish, with more ready to shoot during the Kickstarter campaign. We'll start posting episodes of The FOO Show as soon as we can send codes to backers, to ensure that backers will be the first to get access to the new episodes. After that, we'll publish two episodes a month until the first season is completed.\nNo one has tried to do a 3D-rendered VR show on a schedule this aggressive before, so by supporting FOO, you're helping make VR history. \nTo make The FOO Show, we've built tools and infrastructure for VR that mimics a live television studio. Our tools let creators front-load the hard work of making 3D-rendered VR so that they can record and release shows quickly, without the need for much post-production, just like a TV studio. \nWe wanted to be able to record shows using off-the-shelf hardware, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Touch. Using this hardware helps keep our costs down, but it also affords interesting opportunities for multiplayer experiences in the future.\nMy elbows, they're powered by MATH!\nWe use the Vive and some complex math to animate our 3D characters. This lets us capture the nuances of human motion, so that even though our characters use a low-fidelity art style, your brain immediately starts treating them like humans. After just a few moments in an episode of The FOO Show, you'll forget that you're in a recording of human-like avatars and will feel like a fly on the wall of a fascinating conversation.  \nIn the real world, productions ranging from the local news to The Price is Right to The Tonight Show happen in live studios. By building these tools for VR, we hope to enable a massive explosion in the variety and quality of non-gaming VR experiences. We're using The FOO Show to refine our tools and pipeline. When they're ready, we'll bring in more creators, with the eventual goal of making FOO technology available to anyone who'd like to make 3D-rendered, interactive VR shows. \nWe've put together some awesome rewards for backers! There are more details below, or feel free to send us a question if you're curious about anything. \nIf you back at the $20 level or higher, you'll get your choice of an Oculus Home or Steam code that's good for the entire first season of The FOO Show. Steam users will also get access to the non-VR client. Before you ask, we have versions of FOO for Sony's Playstation VR (PSVR), GearVR, and Google's Project Daydream in the works, but they won't be ready until 2017.\nSo far, we've announced that Season 1 will feature Brendon Chung discussing his game, Quadrilateral Cowboy. We'll have more episodes to announce in coming weeks. \nWe've also put together some exclusive rewards for people who back us. These designs will only be available through this Kickstarter, so once it's done, they'll be gone. \nOur T-shirts are screenprinted in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be as close to the one Will wears in the first season of the show as we can make them. (If you want the low-poly look from the show, expect to spend lots of time with an iron and starch.) We're doing these as a print-to-order run, so it will be a while before we can ship them out, but that means you'll be able to order any size you'd like in men's or women's fits. Oh, and you can also  get any color you'd like, as long as it's black.\nWe've also commissioned an awesome collectible pin. It features Will's avatar and is made of die-cast metal with a highly-polished surface. The pin is of comparable quality to Pinny Arcade or Disney trading pins, and comes with a metal butterfly clasp. \nWe've already made prototypes of the pins to test colors and different metal finishes.\nFinally, for folks who love cutting and gluing small pieces of paper, we've harnessed the power of Pepakura to make a papercraft bust of Will's avatar that any backer at any level can print and assemble. Once finished, the digital Will will be yours forever, to keep a watchful eye over the other stuff on your swag shelf or use as an effigy. It's up to you! \nWe also have a very limited number of unique experiences. If you'd like a one-on-one tour of our virtual studio, Will would love to show you around (you'll need to provide your own Vive, PC, and Internet connection). If you'd rather have a custom rigged avatar in the unique FOO style, we'd love to make one for you. Once we're done, you'll get the 3D assets and will be free to use them however you'd like, including commercial projects (with approval from us). If you'd like, we'll also include your avatar in our regular studio audience. \nWill Smith is the CEO of FOO VR and the host of The FOO Show. You likely know him as one of the co-hosts of Tested.com, its YouTube channel, and podcasts, but Will has been covering technology for more than 15 years. He got his start writing about alternative operating systems and graphics cards at Ars Technica, before moving to Maximum PC, where he ended up as the editor-in-chief. After Will tried an early prototype Oculus Rift, he was hooked, and is convinced that VR/AR represents the next major platform for computing.\nAndre Infante is FOO's lead developer. He's been waiting for virtual reality since he read Snow Crash at age twelve. Originally recruited on the basis of a grainy Youtube video shared in a Reddit post, Andre is fascinated by the problem of reproducing authentic human interactions inside of virtual worlds. \nSindre Skaare is the lead artist at FOO. Originally from Norway, he moved to San Francisco to attend college and spent 3 years in the Bay Area games industry. He's worked for studios like Warner Brothers, nWay, and Massive Black. He also had a short gig with Campo Santo, which is how he met Will. Now he's moved back to Norway and is shacked up in a weird little hackerspace in Oslo where he tinkers with polygons and shaders.\n\"It\u2019s like hanging out inside a videogame with the people who created it.\" - Wired  \n\u201c...it creates a real sense of actually being there.\u201d - Famitsu  \n\"It\u2019s a bit crude and clumsy at times, but the potential of Smith\u2019s show is tremendous.\" - Kotaku  \n\"This is what modern talk shows should be.\" - deprecatedcoder\n\"Because of VR it feels like you are participating in the talkshow instead of just watching one.\" - Tabledevil  \n\"this is actually REALLY enagaging...

We currently have one recorded and another that's ready to shoot, but adapting each new game to work with FOO presents a unique set of challenges. That said, our schedule should include enough extra time to accommodate the unexpected and allow us to get the remaining four episodes shot, edited, and published.\n\nWe haven't booked every slot for the first season yet. Some publishers and developers are understandably anxious about giving us access to their intellectual property so we can integrate it in FOO. It's possible, but unlikely, that we'll run out of people who have made interesting games and are willing to give us access to their IP before we complete the first season. \n\nWe know that making merchandise is difficult, but we have well-established relationships with both the T-shirt and pin manufacturer. We haven't manufactured these types of items at FOO, we have previous experience designing, manufacturing, and distributing merchandise, and feel that the March 2017 deadline for delivery provides us plenty of time to work out any production kinks. \n\nWe are a small team of three people, so illness or injury of one of the core team members could delay production. While we're each extremely careful, we do spend lots of time in VR. If one of us is killed while in virtual reality, that team member's subsequent death in the real world would significantly impact our schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Virtual Supporter", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Instead of recreating something from a video game, we recreated places that actually exist in the real world. Last year, I met Shawn Douglas, who is a professor at UCSF in San Francisco who specializes in molecular pharmacology.

While style guides like the Associated Press Stylebook are used in newsrooms and public relations offices alike, they don\u2019t cover identity well \u2014 if they mention topics like gender or race at all, they just touch on the surface. Identity is a crucial topic for anyone writing today to get right, especially in fields like technology, where we need to talk about our users and audience in a way they find inclusive and understanding.\nWe\u2019re running this Kickstarter to fund the resource we need in our own work. The Responsible Communication Style Guide will cover how to write about five key topics:\nRace\nGender\nSexuality\nReligion\nHealth and Well-Being\nWe'll also cover how this approach fits into the work The Recompiler does, and how we can write about technology in the most welcoming and accessible way.\nWho are we and why are we qualified to create this style guide?\nAudrey Eschright is the founder and publisher of The Recompiler, a feminist hacker magazine launched last year. She\u2019s been looking at the underlying structures that inform our technology and improve our communities for far longer than that, with a decade-long career as a software developer and community organizer.\nThursday Bram has been writing online professionally for over a decade. She writes about business and technology primarily, but has written about everything, including reviews of kitchen sinks. Her first step with many of her clients is creating a style guide from scratch.\nWe\u2019re equipped to edit and publish this style guide, but we aren\u2019t the right subject matter experts to write many of the sections this guide will contain. It needs to be written by people with the lived experience to provide context. We\u2019re finalizing the section editors we\u2019ll be working with and will announce their names during the Kickstarter, so stay tuned for those updates!\nWho is this style guide for?\nWe\u2019d love to create a style guide that covers every relevant topic for every industry, but we\u2019re going to do something a bit more specialized for the first iteration. The Responsible Communication Style Guide will focus on covering our five topics within the context of technology. We both work in technology and know the gaps in resources firsthand. We\u2019re also starting with technology because we both see the discussions taking place in tech communities as having an outsized impact on other communications. After all, can we build inclusive and accessible tools if we don\u2019t even have the words to discuss inclusion or accessibility?\nThe Responsible Communication Style Guide isn\u2019t just for writers. Podcasters, vloggers, speakers, and media creators of all kinds have to think carefully about word choice to make sure an audience gets exactly the intended message. We see a clear business case for the many journalists and marketers working around tech in different media: if only because there\u2019s a clear business case for not alienating or offending sections of your customers.\nWhat do we need?\nWe\u2019re asking for $20,000. With that money, we\u2019ll cover the cost of paying contributors, printing copies of the style guide, and sending rewards out. Even if everyone were to choose the e-book option for the style guide, paying contributors, editors, and designers, plus other necessary expenses to create a project of this scale, will require about 60% of our budget. The rest goes toward the physical costs of delivering the project rewards you\u2019ll select.\nStretch goal!\nWe know it's a long shot, but we have 9 more hours left. If we get to $25,000 before the end of the campaign, we'll add on creating videos of our on-site training. Right now the training is only available to backers at the $1,800 level, but if we hit the stretch goal we can make videos available to anyone backing at the $35 level. Let's see how far we can push this!\nWe need you to back this project to make it successful. Even a small pledge will make a world of difference for us, though we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll consider backing at least the $15 level so that you\u2019ll be able to start using the style guide in your work as soon as possible.\nWe also want you to share this Kickstarter project with anyone you know who has to write or create other media.

However, we have a list of alternative section editors and writers who we can work with in the event of a problem.\n\nBecause the Recompiler publishes a quarterly print edition, we already have an existing relationship with printers and a fulfillment system.

Indianapolis. The writer cherished his place of birth and acknowledged it as a major influence on his writing, his art, and his perspective. \u201cAll my jokes are Indianapolis. All my attitudes are Indianapolis. My adenoids are Indianapolis. If I ever severed myself from Indianapolis, I would be out of business. What people like about me is Indianapolis.\u201d Seven years ago, a group of Indianapolis citizens embarked on a journey to celebrate Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s legacy and his deeply embedded connection to their city. We started a museum and unique cultural resource center dedicated to championing the life of Hoosier author Kurt Vonnegut and the principles of free expression, common decency, and peaceful coexistence he advocated. Their little storefront space became a bona fide global destination. Since its founding, over 200,000 people have visited the Kurt Vonnegut Museum * Library or attended its arts and humanities programming.\nAt KVML, visitors can learn about Kurt Vonnegut's life and work and see his personal items, including his Purple Heart (awarded for what he called a \u201cludicrously negligible wound\u201d and later, \u201cfrostbite\u201d), his pack of infamous Pall Malls as found near his bookcase by his children, military patches from his service in World War II, rejection letters, and an unopened letter the author\u2019s father wrote to his son while Kurt was a WWII POW, imprisoned in the underground meat locker that would later inspire his masterpiece, Slaughterhouse-Five. \nA replica of Kurt Vonnegut's study at the Kurt Vonnegut Museum * Library\n  Unfortunately, a quarter of our collection is in storage due to lack of space. We have outgrown our museum. And our building is for sale. The Kurt Vonnegut Museum * Library (KVML) needs $750,000 to move to its ideal new, permanent home\u2014646 Massachusetts (Mass) Avenue. You can help us reach this goal by backing our project, which will raise a portion of the funds needed to purchase 646 Mass Ave and renovate the space to be exhibition-ready and accessible to all. With your help, KVML will be ready to open the doors of its brand new space in the spring of 2017, ten years after Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s death.\n646 Massachusetts Avenue--Our New, Permanent Home\nEach year, KVML gives free tours about Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s life to approximately 15,000 visitors. We also offer programming that addresses the issues Kurt cared the most about: raising awareness about free expression, caring for and community-building with veterans, and offering a space where today\u2019s writers, artists, musicians, and thinkers can share their work with the public. In 2015, KVML hosted over 70 artists or speakers.\n A move to 646 Mass Ave would mean:  \nIncreased museum space with new exhibitions focused on Vonnegut\u2019s beloved novel Slaughterhouse-Five and censorship, an issue very important to Vonnegut\nMore gathering and learning space for students of all ages who come to learn about Kurt Vonnegut and reflect on the importance of free expression, common decency, and the peaceful coexistence he advocated\nExpanded programs, including programs for K-12 students and a new partnership with local professional soccer team Indy Eleven to launch a suicide prevention and anti-bullying writing program for middle school students, programs on the power of personal narrative. \nYou can read more about KVML\u2019s vision for its new space in our Case for Support.\nWood & Wire performs as part of our Vonnegut Sessions.\n Why Kurt Vonnegut?\nFew writers are as beloved as Kurt Vonnegut and few speak to the mess of being human with such candor, wit, truth, and encouragement. World War II veteran, pacifist, satirist, humanist, environmentalist, visual artist, internationally acclaimed writer and Hoosier, Kurt Vonnegut is one of the most influential American writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Vonnegut\u2019s work shakes traditional values, while offering offbeat and time-warping, alternative views of life. His bold commentaries on religion, war, the so-called establishment and mortality are woven into stories that challenge readers to examine their own values, inspiring philosophical discussions with family, friends, and Vonnegut fans everywhere. We believe it is important to have a space dedicated to upholding his legacy and spurring these discussions.\nAbout the Kurt Vonnegut Museum * Library:\nKVML is a 501c(3) nonprofit in Indianapolis, Indiana, dedicated to championing the legacy of Hoosier author Kurt Vonnegut and the principles of free expression, common decency, and peaceful coexistence he advocated. Since its founding in 2009, over 200,000 people have visited the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library or attended its arts programming. In 2015, Lonely Planet listed the Vonnegut Library first in a list of reasons to visit Indianapolis.\nIn addition to our museum, we  also maintain a rigorous calendar of arts and humanities programming designed to raise awareness about issues dear to Vonnegut: censorship, veterans\u2019 affairs, and conflict resolution. These programs include:\n\u2022 Hosting arts and humanities events for the veterans\u2019 community, including a bimonthly writing workshop for female veterans and a yearly, free arts resource fair.\n\u2022 Hosting arts and humanities events for the general public, including readings by authors, lectures by historians, gallery shows by visual artists, and music performances. \n. \u2022 Conducting programming designed to raise awareness about censorship, including celebrating Banned Books Week every year with a series of programs that highlight the importance of free expression.\nYour tax-deductible contribution helps us accomplish our mission and supports us as we work to secure our new, permanent location.\nSo it goes. So we grow.\nKurt Vonnegut at home in Barnstable, Mass.

KVML has enlisted some of the best and brightest minds to help us secure our new space and shape it into the best possible museum in which to honor Kurt.

Portland is a city that is known both as a skateboard destination, and for its months of unrelenting rain, yet we only have one small indoor space to skate. \nPortland needs more than this. \nWe are ready for a large, indoor riding facility. Portland is ready for Stronger Skatepark.\nArtist's drawing of Stronger Skatepark. Design subject to change until completion.\n   The idea to build a skatepark has been something I\u2019ve been thinking of for many years, and in May 2015 after my visit to Seattle\u2019s \u201cAll Together Skatepark\u201d I started looking seriously at the idea. During my visit to Seattle I was reminded of the fantastic opportunities an indoor park provides for the community and I've been working hard to bring a similar facility to Portland.\nStronger Skatepark will provide:\nA consistent place to ride year round, no matter what the weather \nA safe space for local youth to ride and socialize\nA comfortable place for families to try out skateboarding\nPrograms for kids including camps, classes, and after-school care\nAffordable, healthy food options\nA skate shop with knowledgeable staff and great products\nA venue for parties, contests, all ages concerts, and other events\n  The park design will include:\nStreet inspired ledges, rails, and hips\nTransitioned quarter pipes\nA mini ramp or a bowl\nBanked ramps of all sizes\nMoveable small street elements\nSmall to medium sized ramps that are fun for all abilities\nFeatured In:\n      Early Park Design:\nEarly Design of Stronger Skatepark. Subject to change until the park is complete.\n  The business itself is already partially funded by private loans, this campaign is to fund the ramps themselves. A basic street course and mini ramp will cost $25,000. If we are able to reach our stretch goal of $50,000 it will allow us to build a small bowl instead of a mini ramp! \n\nKickstarter is an \"All or Nothing\" platform, meaning that if we don't reach our goal of $25,000 no one will be charged and the park will not be built. Thats why it's critical that we get as many backers as early as possible in the campaign, and that if you believe in the project you share it with others! \nTo learn more about the work we've done so far, visit our website, www.StrongerSkatepark.com. There you can find links to our social media pages, sign up for our newsletter, and read more about the mission of the park. \n  The name Stronger Skatepark was inspired by the Gungor Song \u201cWe are Stronger.\u201d The song describes the strength that is inherent when different people band together. My goal with Stronger Skatepark is to create a place where anyone can get involved in skateboarding and the community. Kids, parents, teens, adults, people who have skated for 30 years, and people who are stepping on a board for the very first time will all be welcome. We will also other types of riders including, scooters, bikes, roller blades, and roller skates.\nAllison Skating at All Together Skatepark in Seattle\n  I've been working on this project for over a year, starting with dreaming up ideas, then researching feasibility. Last year I created a very detailed business plan and shared it with a few trusted individuals who gave helpful feedback.\n\nThen I started searching for funding. Funding is a very real challenge for a business with no history, and I was very fortunate to find an investor who believes in the vision I had. I am also investing thousands of my own dollars, but its still not enough to cover the entire cost. Thats why I've come to Kickstarter to seek out funding for the ramps. I've received positive feedback from both within and outside of the skate community, and believe I can minimize the risks associated with starting a new skatepark by planning well, and creating a high quality experience with attention to details.\n  Standard Membership\nMembers are the backbone of the private skatepark, they are the people who are riding the park regularly. We will sell annual memberships for $100.($80 for our Early Bird Reward in this campaign).\nAnnual membership benefits include \nReduced fees at all Sessions\n10% Discount on all food and goods in the shop\nDiscounts on camps, classes, and parties\nFirst access to event tickets\n\nUnlimited Membership.\nUnlimited membership means you pay once per year or month to skate any open sessions or special sessions you qualify for, it also includes all the benefits of the Standard Membership. Unlimited Membership will be available both as a yearly membership as a monthly plan if you are riding seasonly. During our Kickstarter Campaign Unlimited Memberships will cost $600 for one year. There will never be a lower price for an unlimited yearly membership than this Kickstarter Campaign.\n\nRewards are what you get in return for backing our campaign.\n\nEach reward has a minimum amount you must support us at to receive that reward. You can always give more than the minimum if you desire! \nOur first reward is a sticker pack sent to your home. The other rewards include sessions at the park, and memberships. Back us today, and then come ride when we're open! Come experience the ramps you helped build! \nOur 4 inch vinyl stickers!\n\nIf you aren't a rider there will be an option in your post-campaign survey to gift you session(s) to someone else (we will track it all digitally) or to donate your sessions to our \"Pay it Forward\" program.\n\nThe \"Pay it Forward\" program will be a wall in the skate shop with certificates for pre-paid sessions. Its our way of making the park assessable to all income levels. Anyone who can't afford a session may take a certificate and use it to ride! If you want to help kick off our \"Pay it Forward\" program then you can choose the option to donate sessions or \"Pay it Forward\" so someone else can have a chance to ride! \n\nWe have an early bird reward for One Month of our Unlimited Membership for only $60! Only 25 of our very early backers will receive this killer deal! \n\nWe also have a $30 reward that is designed for non-riders, if you donate at this level or higher, your name will be added to our tree of supporters. We will be painting a beautiful mural on the wall of the park of a tree with supporters names on the inside of the tree. In addition to the mural, a percentage of this reward tier will be used to plant real trees here in the Portland area through local not-for-profit, Friends of Trees. As skaters we all need to be Friends of Trees! We wouldn't have our boards or our ramps without them! Thats why we've chosen to give back in this way.\nMural Design honoring everyone who backs the project for $30 or more dollars.\n For $100 you can skate the park before we are open to the general public! Get a full-day of access for yourself and one friend during our invite-only soft opening! This will be limited and the park will be very quiet during this first week! Its a great chance to film! You'll also be gifted some snacks and beverages during your visit to keep you fueled while you shred!\nFor $500 you receive pair tickets to our pre-grand opening party! It will be a fantastic evening celebrating Stronger Skatepark! A catered event, with live music and a chance to mingle with all the people key to making this project happen!\nBacking at $1000 will get you an entire day of the park to yourself. These sessions will take place once the ramps are completed and we are working on finishing the details around the park. Bring up to 10 friends to skate the park before anyone else!\nStronger T-Shirt\nIf you back the campaign at $40 you can choose a black t-shirt featuring our logo on the left chest as your reward.\n Stronger Zip-Up Hoodie\nIf you back campaign at $125 you can choose this black zip-up hoodie featuring the Stronger Skatepark Logo on the left chest.\n \n\nAllison Waters - Owner and Founder\n\nStronger Skatepark is the Vision of Allison Waters, a 30 year old Mother, living in Southeast Portland alongside her husband Ace, their 5 year old son, and their four rescue dogs. She's been skateboarding for 18 years. Allison worked in a large indoor skatepark as a teen. After high school she earned a bachelors degree while also running a local non-for-profit children's program. Since moving to Portland four years ago, she's worked as a nanny, and as a coach with Skate Like a Girl Portland. Allison is passionate about making skateboarding accessible for all people. \n\nScott Everly - Lead Ramp Designer and Builder\nScott resides in Portland, Or with his wife and 2 boys. A transplant from the east coast he has been a skateboarder for 32 years and a ramp builder 28. As one of the premiere wood builders in the country his skills have been used by discriminating clientele such as Vans, Dew Tour, Hot Wheels, Adidas, Red Bull, and USSA. In addition to building he has experience in all phases of production from consulting to designing to logistics. Scott prides himself in meeting the needs of all his clients as well as providing riders with progressive terrain no matter what skill level or discipline. \n\nGraphic Design by Aubree Hollman\n\nVideo Editing and Music by Ace Waters\nLogo Design by Satchell Drakes\n\nArtists Rendering of Skatepark by Rachel E.S.\n\nThanks\n\nThanks to everyone has supported me so far in this endeavor! Those who have given me free feedback and advice, those supporting financially, and my friends and family for having patience while I work all the time! -Allison Waters", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe largest challenge after funding will be finding a suitable space. There are several spaces we are interested in and don't expect this to be a major challenge, but working out lease details on a large space as a new business can be tricky. \n\nThe other challenge is actually completing the building of the ramps. We have an excellent ramp designer and builder, Scott Everly, as the lead on the build and expect it to go smoothly once we are in our space. We hope to be open by September, but estimated October just in case we run into any hiccups along the way. We don't want to open our doors until we have our amazing space completed and ready to share!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Allison Waters\nFirst created \u00b7 11 backed\nI am a 30 year old, life long skateboarder.

Problem Glyphs will be a premium edition, display-worthy art book, measuring 10x12\" and featuring a Smyth sewn, genuine clothbound hard cover with gold foil-stamped cover illustrations. The estimated 220 interior pages will be printed on beautiful matte coated art paper. Tremendous care has gone into every aspect of the book, from its binding to its typography, the beautiful and storied Doves Type. \n\nCreated in collaboration with Strix Publishing, this book will showcase Gauger\u2019s work on Problem Glyphs in an edition worthy of space on your coffee table or book shelf. \nFor illustrative purposes only.

A game that merges scientific knowledge and entertainment in a way that appeals to both dinosaur enthusiasts and the general public. The only way a game such as this could happen was if we came together and made it ourselves. We named our project Saurian, and now we need your help to make it reality.\nSaurian is an open world survival video game being developed for PC and Mac. Our goal is providing the most captivating and scientifically accurate prehistoric experience yet developed: living the life of a dinosaur. Players will take control of several extinct species in their natural environment and attempt to survive from hatchling to adult. Staying alive means managing physical needs while avoiding predators and natural hazards in an open world landscape reflecting up-to-date scientific knowledge of the Hell Creek ecosystem of 66 million years ago.\n  Saurian\u2019s ultimate goal is to educate the public about the significant and expanding knowledge science is uncovering about dinosaurs, the lives they led and the world they existed in. We want the player to absorb this knowledge while they play the game; learning by doing without ever feeling like they are being educated. The public perception of dinosaurs is heavily influenced by pop culture that increasingly references itself rather than the accumulating knowledge that scientists and researchers continue to gather about these fascinating animals. Our intent with Saurian is to let fossil evidence, peer reviewed science and consultation with leading experts inform our game design. This decision has already proven highly influential; new scientific studies have revealed key aspects of each animal's behaviors and lifestyle that offer the potential to enhance gameplay. As an example, Raptor Prey Restraint (RPR) hypothesis increasingly appears to be a key component to understanding the anatomy and hunting behavior of raptor-like theropods. Indirectly, our approach also challenges the common perception that \u201creal\u201d dinosaurs and games based on unembellished scientific data are not interesting or fun to play.\nWe pride ourselves on our scientific rigor. We have engaged in extensive research utilizing both the scientific literature and consultation with leading experts, including Robert DePalma, Dr.Victoria Arbour, Dr. Denver Fowler, Dr. John R. Hutchinson, Dr. Matt Wedel, and Dr. Gregory Wilson. As a result, the mass, locomotion speed, jumping capabilities, and turning ratios of all the dinosaurs in Saurian are based on data and research. Skin texture and pattern in some cases are based on direct observation of fossilized skin. Even the animal\u2019s color are based on their inferred ability to metabolize and generate certain pigments. Whenever possible, all aspects of Saurian have been vetted to ensure our animals and their world is up to date with the cutting edge of scientific knowledge.\n  Play as Dakotaraptor, Pachycephalosaurus, Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops and advance through multiple distinct life stages. Survive from hatchling to adult, each stage presenting its own unique challenges based on your growth and development.\n  Saurian invites you to experience diverse survival challenges, expansive open world adventures and the amazing experience of living the lives of dinosaurs. The core of Saurian's gameplay is managing your stamina, thirst and hunger without falling victim to the unrelenting environment or becoming another animal's lunch. Players will need to draw upon a variety of skills and abilities to survive; mastering Dakotaraptor's grapple and pounce to subdue combative prey, avoiding the sharp eyes and bone crushing jaws of Tyrannosaurus rex, and tracking potential predators and prey with keen senses. With our dedication to scientific accuracy, we have created an immersive and engaging experience like no other game you have ever played before.\n  From the shores of the Western Interior Seaway to the tangled waterways, cypress swamps, open woodlands and towering conifer forests, we\u2019ve recreated a portion of the South Dakota\u2019s Hell Creek Formation of 66 million years ago entirely from the available fossil record. Explore this historically astounding open world while encountering the many species of dinosaur and other Mesozoic creatures that prowl the thickets to learn your place in the food chain.\n  The player is not the center of the brutal Saurian universe. As in reality, every creature dwelling in the forest is trying to survive a thriving simulated ecosystem. The animals\u2019 AI tethers them to the same challenges and survival needs as the player, adding a dynamic balance of priorities between the varying species. Other dinosaurs will fight or flee from you depending on what will best aid their survival. We suggest you do the same.\n  Saurian is a passion project. All of us are here first and foremost because we believe in the potential of Saurian as both an educational tool and an entertaining game. There are far less challenging and cheaper prospects to pursue if making large sums of money were our primary goal. It has taken us the better part of 3 years to push development to this point, working unpaid in our free time. All of us have invested substantial sums of our own money as well, to cover development costs up to this point. Our primary obstacle to completing Saurian has now become work time, and to overcome that, we need funding to allow team members to free more of their time for Saurian without putting themselves at financial risk. You can find a detailed breakdown of how Kickstarter funds will be spent below:\nA successful Kickstarter will enable us to push Saurian\u2019s development to the point that we will be ready for a Steam Early Access release. We recognize that some games in Early Access have a reputation for being unpolished, buggy and lacking in content. On Early Access release, our intent is to provide the public with: \nA fully realized game world featuring polished, final game assets\nOne feature complete dinosaur (Dakotaraptor), fully playable from hatchling to adult\nA vibrant, functioning AI ecosystem\nPre-release and ongoing optimization efforts to ensure maximum access\nWe will not consider entering Early Access until we can guarantee this list. We feel that an early access release allows us to mount a realistic, achievable Kickstarter campaign that will fully cover the core of Saurian\u2019s gameplay and features. We will then be able to utilize income from sales to continue pushing Saurian to completion.\n             This is Gerry, our resident emu and Dinosaur Motion Consultant. He works with our animator (Bryan) to verify that our dinosaurs move as they should. How many dinosaur games can say they have an actual dinosaur on the development team?\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a crowd-funded indie project, there will undeniably be unseen challenges during the course of development. Not all problems that will arise will result in delays or setbacks, but there is always the chance of something more dire that will rear its ugly head. While these delays are undoubtedly frustrating, both for funders and developers, a benefit of being a crowd-funded indie project is that we have no producer to answer to. We can focus on bringing the core features that we promise at the cost of a minor delay, rather than sacrificing those features and systems to meet an arbitrary deadline.

It's faster, easier, and more fun than reading this whole page!\nFrank Zappa lived an insane life. Rock star. Artist. Composer. Activist. Talking head. Family man. Jokester. Absurdist. One of the greatest musicians who ever lived. Even if you don\u2019t know anything about him, you\u2019ve probably heard his name and seen his face.\nAnd now, for the first time, we have something no one has ever had: \nUnrestricted access to his never-before-explored, private archives. \nWe're at the brink of unlocking thousands of hours of unreleased footage, and hundreds of boxes of tape, and unnameable other stuff that has been literally locked away under the Zappa family home like a time capsule since Frank\u2019s death in 1993.\nIt\u2019s time to tell Frank's DEFINITIVE STORY, like it's never been told, and to bring some of this unseen material into the world. \nWaiting inside the Vault, there's more material than we could ever fit in a single film.. but there's a challenge. \nIf we don't work fast, this won't just be our first chance to see what's in the Vault... it might also be our last chance.\nSee, most of the contents of the Vault exist in OLD, OBSOLETE and AGING MEDIA FORMATS: tape, film, video, paper, and other outdated forms of media that are deteriorating even as we speak. \nIn order to use and share this stuff, we first have to access it, catalog it, find the best stuff, digitize and preserve it, and then edit it. And all of that takes time, money and patience.\nThat's why we're asking all of Frank's fans to get involved, and to help us get this done now. \nThe more we raise, the more we can do... and now that we've passed our MINIMUM GOAL of $500,000, our challenge is to keep going as far as we can, so that we can save more at-risk materials and get more of the movie done. \nFor those of you who decide to join me, save the Vault, and help tell Frank's story, I've got good news: you'll get a lot more than the satisfaction of helping preserve Frank's legacy. \nWhether you just want to follow along, or want a once-in-a-lifetime Zappa experience, we've got you covered with a ton of great, exclusive rewards, including...\nTRACKS 10 & UP: A FRONT ROW SEAT to follow along as I start exploring the Vault. I have no idea what we'll find, but I know it'll be crazy... and that I want to share the experience with you guys! \nTRACKS 25 & UP: A DIGITAL VAULT PASS, granting you exclusive access to a backers-only archive of downloadable material selected from what I find in the Vault.\n\nAnd remember: the more we raise, the more we can save, and the more you'll get to see, hear and keep!\nTRACKS 35 & UP: THE DOCUMENTARY that you're helping make, available as a digital download (Tracks 35+) and in a Collector's Edition DVD or BLU-RAY (Tracks 150+), packed with bonus material and limited edition packaging.\nTRACKS 50 & UP: EXCLUSIVE WTFIFZ MERCH, featuring new artwork created just for this Kickstarter campaign, and never available again! It's like a killer concert merch table, without ever leaving home! Rewards include T-SHIRTS (Track 50+), POSTERS (Track 125+) and more.\nAnd with the help of Frank's family and friends, we\u2019ve got some incredible, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities and rewards for true Zappa fans:\nTRACK 2500: OWN FRANK'S STUFF. The Zappas have generously allowed us to offer a very limited number of items from Frank's private collection, including original filmstrips from the Vault and a few of his personal possessions.\nTRACK 6000: EXPLORE FRANK'S VAULT. You'll get a private tour of the legendary Joe's Garage and the relocated Vault from me and Ahmet Zappa. Be the first person to see some of the unreleased material, then discuss it over a private lunch with me and my producing partner, Glen Zipper.\nTRACK 7500: RECORD WITH FRANK'S GUITAR. Come play Frank\u2019s guitar for a private recording session with Joe \"Vaultmeister\" Travers at the legendary Joe\u2019s Garage!\nSo, who the fuck is Frank Zappa? Even now, 23 years after his death, the man is still a fascinating pile of contradictions. If you haven't watched the video, just consider these ten facts about Zappa:\n1. He was one of the biggest rock stars of the '70s...\n2. But he didn't do drugs. Ever.\n3. He conducted and composed for orchestras ...\n4. But he also went on national TV and played a bicycle.\n5. He got banned from SNL...\n6. But he was a regular on CNN.\n7. He took on the government over censorship.\n8. He basically invented Rock the Vote.\n9. He was the face of an actual revolution in Czechoslovakia.\n10. He almost ran for President in 1992.\nAnd that doesn't begin to cover Frank's life, career, or prolific output as a performer, composer or visual artist. His work crossed genres. He made people uncomfortable. His ideas and attitudes made him revered by some, despised by others, and a source of perpetual fascination and inspiration... until, in 1993, his life was cut short by prostate cancer.\nWhen he died at the age of 52, Zappa had already released 60 albums, and created enough music to fill 42 more posthumous albums... and counting! He'd also had four kids, influenced a generation of artists, scientists and thought leaders, and left his unique stamp on the world. \nAnd all of that? That's just the tip of the iceberg.\nThat's why this project is so important. Frank Zappa was a million different things, and for the first time, we have access to everything he kept in his private archives \u2013 thousands of hours of audio and video recordings, plus countless shelves filled with boxes of documents, photos, art and more. Using all of that material, I want to finally tell his definitive story, and help answer the question: \n\nWho the Fuck is Frank Zappa?\nAnd, even better... we want you to join us. \nFrank Zappa was one of the most prolific artists of our time, and rows upon rows of floor-to-ceiling stacks of tape, video clips, film footage, and more, have been locked away under the historic Zappa house in the Hollywood Hills since Frank's death in 1993. \nNo one has ever heard or seen the vast majority of this material, much less cataloged it, and it is literally crumbling against time in the Zappa's private archive: a massive underground storage chamber known as \"The Vault.\"\nBy backing this campaign, you'll help us digitize and preserve (!) these archives for use in this documentary \u2014 not to mention for limited, gradual release and distribution, and the enjoyment of Zappa fans for generations to come. The more we raise, the more of Frank's unexplored archives we can save.\nHey, I'm Alex. I\u2019m an actor / director, and in the last few years I\u2019ve made two other documentaries about cultural influencers; Downloaded (about Napster) and Deep Web (about the hidden Internet). I\u2019ve been a big fan of Frank Zappa\u2019s music my whole life, but it took some time to realize that in addition to being a singular artist, he\u2019s flat-out one of the most brilliant, hilarious, wild and fascinating renaissance men of the century. \nShortly before she died, his widow Gail gave me unprecedented access to Frank\u2019s life (and Vault), and her blessing to make the first all-access doc about Frank \u2014 a one-of-a-kind honor. For this project, I\u2019ll be interviewing everyone I can who had any kind of connection to Frank, and painstakingly going through the Vault to preserve and archive the stuff I think tells Frank\u2019s untold story best.\nI've also written more about why I launched this project.\nAs a documentary producer who\u2019s had the privilege of working on a diverse slate of films including Undefeated, All Things Must Pass, Deep Web, The Last Play at Shea, The Nightmare, and Foo Fighters: Back and Forth, one of the questions I am asked most is, \u201cIf you could make any documentary you wanted to do, what would it be?\u201d My answer has always been the same, \u201cThe definitive, no-holds barred Frank Zappa doc.\u201d Last year someone finally asked me a follow-up question that I should\u2019ve already asked myself: \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d And that, my friends, is where our journey began. \nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind for Alex and I ever since, working every day to lay the foundation of everything we need to make this dream possible. Now, together with you, I want to make a film that is not only a worthy historical document of Frank\u2019s remarkable legacy, but also a kick-ass cinematic experience that no one will ever be able to put in a traditional documentary box.\nJoe is not only a musician who's been playing with the Zappas (and other incredible bands) since the early '90s; he's also the \u201cVaultmeister\u201d \u2014 keeper of Frank's archives, and expert on all things FZ. He has been the lone guardian of the Vault's material for years, chipping away at cataloguing and preserving what he can as well as co-producing the FZ delicacies released by the Zappa Family Trust.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks and challenges we face aren't from this Kickstarter, but from the potential danger to the material in Frank's Vault if this campaign DOESN'T succeed. \n\nIf it does, we'll have everything we need to help #SaveTheVault, preserve some or all of Frank's most at-risk material, and to #TellTheStory.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #97", "update_userinfo": "THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT!", "update_content": "It's hard to believe this journey we started in 2015 is finally coming to an end!

The gorge begins 17 miles east of Portland and runs another 80 miles to the east. \nIn itinerary format, the book lays out great places to wine-tour, shop, sample the brew pubs, visit historic sites and museums, soak in hot mineral waters, explore scenic back roads, whitewater raft, learn to windsurf (or watch experts), bike, swim, hike behind a waterfall or in an ancient forest, or take a train ride, aerial tour or boat cruise. It's all in the gorge, and all in the book. \nCape Horn in April, near the end of the rainy season. Drive to this overlook in Tour 1, or even better, hike Cape Horn, also in Tour 1.\nThe glove-boxed size resource offers 12 itineraries of 36 to 72 hours, each centered on one of the gorge\u2019s historic riverfront towns. Trips are designed for family vacations, solo explorations or romantic adventures. The cost of outings ranges from free to up there.\nChoose one of the rewards--a copy of the book or an interpretive walk or bike ride--and you'll help fund the print run in March 2016. Whether you choose a reward or not, thank you for looking at my page.\nEvolution of this book\nIn fall 2013, Friends of the Columbia Gorge asked me to write a book that\u2019d promote connections between the gorge\u2019s hiking trails and its towns. Friends is a 5,000-member advocacy/educational nonprofit and land conservancy. Towns to Trails is a long-range program to build a gorge-wide trail network that also incorporates public transit. Some Towns to Trails segments are complete--they're in the book--and more are coming.\nDuring months of field research and drafts, the book's scope expanded beyond this, and I wrestled with how to best present all the ways a person can have a blast in the gorge. For a while, I was working on a geographic model: showing recreation options as you traveled from Portland to points east, along with a listing of activities by topic. \nBike to this viewpoint on the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail, in Tour 9. The view: Coyote Wall, a huge fault in the earth's crust on the Washington side. (Explore it in Tour 5.)\nBut that still meant you, the reader, had to do a lot of planning and page-flipping. I wanted to make a gorge vacation pure pleasure--from the moment you have the idea to go, to the minute you return to your front door. \nI decided to do the planning for you, and settled on an itinerary format so you don't have to spend hours crafting a gorge vacation: just grab the book, dream a bit, maybe make a reservation or two, and then go.\nThe 13 gorge towns have 13 very diverse personalities. Hood River, a more athletic version of Portland, is world-famous for its windsurfing, orchards and beer. Washougal has the iconic Pendleton Woolen Mills, an awesome river beach and a tavern called Bigfoot. The Dalles occupies land inhabited for 10,000 years, and has one of the gorge's best museums and historic downtowns. You can walk to the point where Oregon Trail pioneers launched their lives into the Columbia, and climb Pulpit Rock, where missionaries preached to Native Americans in the 1830s. \nEach town has much to love. Each one becomes your base for a vacation. \nWind Mountain, one of the gorge's most prominent landmarks. From Tour 4, Carson and Gifford Pinchot National Forest.\nMany gorge visitor are like me: I\u2019d been hiking there since I moved to Oregon 27 years ago, but my forays hadn't expanded much beyond wildflower and waterfall hikes. \nFor this book, I spent 18 months biking, swimming, hiking, eating, drinking, exploring and researching. I read armloads of books on the gorge\u2019s cultural and natural history\u2014nuggets of which are interspersed throughout my book, wherever it's most relevant to you as a visitor. \nIn the style of my Portland guidebooks, I created urban biking and walking routes within the gorge towns, so you could explore, shop, eat and get a real sense of the place.\nThe result is a book that gives you what you look for in a vacation: a variety of experiences, indoors and out, from free to value-added, from strenuous to mellow, from obvious highlights to the quietest pathways, beaches and back roads. \nI believe travelers to the gorge shouldn't just hike and hightail it back to Portland for dinner. Columbia Gorge Getaways gives you a no-stress path to a multi-day escape while supporting the great gorge towns whose backyards have become a national playground.\nAbout the book\nThe book's tours cover the entire gorge, on both sides of the Columbia, from temperate rainforest to desert, and from river beach to cliff top, from hostel and brewpub to luxury resort and wine tour.\nBike to beer, beach and this view atop a bluff in Tour 10, Hood River.\nThe book is 224 pages: 12 chapters, 21 maps, 60 historic and contemporary photos, and three appendices that cover gear rentals, lessons, outfitters, excursions, festivals, and alt transportation. It will retail for $19.95 and be available wherever books are sold, as well as direct from Friends of the Columbia Gorge. See the \"About the book\" heading for the table of contents and sample text.\nThe book has been written and edited. Maps are finished. At Feb. 3, 2016, design and layout are underway. The Kickstarter campaign, if successful, will pay for the print run in March 2016.\nPack a picnic and get close to expert windsurfers at Washington's Spring Creek National Fish Hatchery. Tour 5: White Salmon and Bingen\nFollow each tour's itinerary as closely or as loosely as you want. In the book you\u2019ll find where in the gorge to:  \neat Northwest-grown food, and drink local wine, beer, spirits and cider, in brewpubs, tasting rooms and vineyards\nAfter you shop in Cascade Locks or hike or bike the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail, eat near the Bridge of the Gods at Thunder Island Brewing in Tour 11.\ncruise scenic back roads to wineries, viewpoints and orchards\nShare the road with cows on scenic routes laid down by footsteps of Oregon Trail pioneers in Tour 8, The Dalles.\nrent bikes and ride one of the nation\u2019s most scenic car-free routes, the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail\nNo cars, big views: bike the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail in Tour 9, Mosier.\ndiscover local history, geology and culture at historic sites, landmarks and an eclectic bunch of museums and visitor centers\nVisit Herman the 6-foot sturgeon, feed hatchery fish and trout, watch ships pass through locks, and tour classic WPA architecture at Bonneville Dam, a National Historic Landmark. Drive or bike there in Tour 11.\nWalk the same beaches as Lewis, Clark and Sacagawea. Here replica canoes mark their campsite, seen on a flat bike ride in Tour 1, Washougal and Cape Horn.\nshop in quaint downtowns full of galleries and stores selling casual wear, gifts, crafts, jewelry, books and sports gear \nGoldendale's Art Deco courthouse is one of many architectural gems in gorge towns. In Tour 6: Lyle, Maryhill and Goldendale Observatory State Park.\nplay on a river beach, raft a whitewater river, and take a kayak, SUP or windsurfing lesson \nWade, swim and beach walk at Sand Island in the Columbia River on Tour 12.\nfind an ancient forest to walk and sleep in\nAt Government Mineral Springs, in Tour 4. This tree came down but many ancient ones still stand.\nride a horse, fly above the gorge on an aerial tour, tour ancient petroglyphs, book a river cruise or hire a guide to fish for sturgeon\nTake a guided tour of petroglyphs, including famous She Who Watches, at Columbia Hills State Park then stop at nearby wineries in Tour 7.\nhike the gorge\u2019s iconic waterfall trails and less-heralded pathways\nHike to or stop at one of a hundred+ waterfalls along the Historic Columbia River Highway in Tours 10, 11 and 12.\nWalk to the top of Beacon Rock, like generations of Northwesterners have done, or walk out to Ives Island at low water, a less traveled option. Both are in Tour 2, North Bonneville and Beacon Rock State Park.\nbuy fish from a Native American fisher, just as people in the gorge have been doing for 10,000 years\nLong before Lewis and Clark passed through the gorge, Native Americans lived and worked here, and many still do. These traditional fishing platforms are at the mouth of the Little White Salmon River, in Tour 5.\npick cherries, pears or apples in orchards on volcanic slopes\nPick cherries in June along a scenic driving route from Mosier to The Dalles, Tour 9.\nhang out near the water at one of the gorge towns' many festivals\nStay in luxury at Skamania Lodge and walk to the Gorge Blues and Brews Festival in Stevenson, Tour 3.\nstay overnight in a hostel, urban inn or wine country bed and breakfast\nStay at what seems like an oxymoron: a luxurious poor farm, McMenamins Edgefield Manor in Troutdale, seen on Tour 12\nAbout the gorge\nThe Columbia River Gorge in the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest is like a national park, with waterfall hiking and biking on curvy, clifftop roads. But in many ways it\u2019s even better: it\u2019s got an 80-mile lineup of riverfront towns that offer urban exploring, Northwest-grown food and drink, and outdoor adventures.   \nThe gorge divides Washington and Oregon. It\u2019s famous for its waterfalls, windsurfing, wine and the century-old Historic Columbia River Highway, one of the nation\u2019s first scenic highways. \nOne of the book's two overview maps: the west end of the gorge. Numbers correspond to the book's chapters.\nTowns on the west end sit in rainforest country, with Douglas fir forests and countless waterfalls up to 600 feet high.\nOne of the book's two overview maps: the east end of the gorge. Numbers correspond to the book's chapters.\nThe east end of the gorge is the Old West, with empty blue skies, Ponderosa pine, scrub oak, cows and cliffs. \nScenic road-touring on the Historic Columbia River Highway, between Mosier to The Dalles. Here in the eastern gorge, the rainforest gives way to oaks and rocky canyons. From Tour 9: Mosier and Rowena Crest\nThe gorge was named the nation\u2019s second National Scenic Area in 1986. It\u2019s also part of the Oregon National Historic Trail, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, and the emerging Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail. \nCarved by ancient floods, the 80-mile long gorge is one of the Seven Wonders of Oregon\u2014a place where your camera gets a workout and your spirit escapes its to-do lists. From Portland, every location in the book is within 100 miles. \nInside the book...\nThese pages from the book still have a few alignment errors--they're from the early rough layout. \nPrevious books\nI've been writing Pacific Northwest guidebooks since 2001.They've been published by Timber Press, Metro (Portland's regional government) and Microcosm Publishing. \n\"...one of the best guidebooks in many years,\" Salem Statesman Journal\n\"Foster skillfully combines neighborhood history and architectural descriptions with keen observations guaranteed to capture a walker's imagination.\" The Oregonian\n\"A feast of Portland stair facts...with Foster's keen eye for quirky detail\" The Oregonian\n35,000 copies were printed and distributed free in the Portland region by Metro, funded by a grant from Kaiser Permanente\nThe book will be published by Microcosm Publishing in 2016, as part of the celebration of Beverly Cleary's 100th birthday.\nMy books take readers on explorations of a city's or region's geology, architecture, neighborhoods, parklands, and human and natural history. I appeared on Oregon Field Guide in 2006, exploring Portland's street-level past, and again in 2009, rambling around its public stairs. \nHere's what people are saying about my books.\nFor this book, I started my own publishing company because I wanted to write a guidebook that would include listings of businesses--something none of my earlier books have done. \nThe team of experts \nTo produce this book I founded Towns to Trails Media and hired a crew of local experts: \nJenefer Angell of Passionfruit Projects edited the manuscript in fall 2015. Jen and I worked as editors in 2001 at Beyond Words Publishing, and this was my first opportunity to work with her again.\nMatthew Hampton designed the book\u2019s maps. A former alpine and white water guide, Matthew\u2019s cartography has won numerous international awards. We worked on Walk There! together. More of his work can be found at Cascade Cartography or at Oregonmetro.gov, where he is the chief cartographer. \nBrad Smith and Etah Chen of Hot Pepper Studios are designing the book\u2019s cover and interior. Brad and I first worked together on Walk There! in 2008.  \nBob Smith of Book Printers Network is handling the book\u2019s printing specs and production at United Graphics in Mattoon, Illinois.\nJoe Biel of Microcosm Publishing edited the trailer and Jeff Hayes of Microcosm mastered the audio.  \nTimeline\nFall 2013 The seed for this book is planted by Friends of the Columbia Gorge, as one way to promote its Towns to Trails program.\nJan 2014  Awarded grant by Skamania County, on the Washington side of the gorge, to fund research. That was followed by a few months of research, and a lull while I wrapped up other writing projects.\nFall 2014 through Fall 2015  Scouting, research, writing and revising\nFall 2015  Editing and map-making are completed.\nWinter 2015 to present  The book's cover and interior are designed. \nFebruary 2016  Kickstarter campaign is launched.\nMarch 2016  The book file is sent to the printer in Illinois. \nBudget\nAs a writer/publisher, counting my own hours for this project is an exercise I don't attempt. Here are major outside costs to make a beautiful, accurate and detailed book:\nEditing: $3,023\nCartography: $5,400\nDesign of cover and interior: $5,600\nPrinting: For 3,000 copies: $6,269. For 4,000 copies, $7,511\nEbook conversion: $500\nFees: ISBN, barcode, copyright, incorporation: $480\nTotal costs, excluding shipping and Kickstarter fees: $21,272 or $22,514, depending on the size of the print run. \nA Stonehenge replica, at Maryhill in the eastern gorge is in Tour 6, a tour of wineries, an improbable art museum associated with Queen Marie of Romania, and one of the nation's best public dark sky observatories.\nRewards\nRewards you can touch are the book as either an ebook or paperback:\nand this metal ornament hand-crafted in Cascade Locks, Oregon. \nIt's of Tsagaglalal, or She Who Watches, a petroglyph you can see on Tour 7 at Columbia Hills State Park.\nRewards you can remember are interpretive walking or biking tours you can sign up for, to explore Portland and some gorge locales. I've led walking tours for the City of Portland, Metro, Multnomah County Library, Audubon Society of Portland and the Multnomah Athletic Club. They're a great way to laugh, talk to new people, get exercise, see new places and learn a few nuggets of local history. \nLeading one of my favorite Portland Hill Walks: from the King's Hill National Historic District into Washington Park.\nEvery walking tour must include good food and drink. In this case it's Portland's Gluten Free Gem Bakery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is in final stages of production: design, where interior pages are laid out. Next stop: printing. The biggest risk, once books are in, and I've fulfilled Kickstarter rewards, is that I'm unable to sell the rest of the books. With this campaign, and early sales calls using advance reading copies, I'll gauge whether a 3,000 or 4,000 (or more) print run is more viable.\n\nIt's a risk I believe is acceptable: my other books have great distribution and sales, thanks to their publishers and sales reps.

When you read LIGHTSPEED, it is our hope that you\u2019ll see where science fiction and fantasy comes from, where it is now, and where it\u2019s going.\nLIGHTSPEED is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award, and stories from LIGHTSPEED have been nominated for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, and the World Fantasy Award. Previously, we crowdfunded our two other \"Destroy\" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim.\nWhen not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy.\nAll of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED.\nYou'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android). Below are some explanations and clarifications of our various reward options.\nAll backers who pledge at least $5 (the DESTROY SF! reward level) will receive an ebook copy of the LIGHTSPEED POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue. The special issue will be available in June 2016.\nAll ebook rewards, including ebook subscriptions, will be made available DRM-free in epub, mobi, and PDF format via our ebookstore. Mobi is primarily for Kindle/Kindle app users; Epub works on lots of things, such as Nook, Kobo, and iBooks.\nIf you select one of the subscription rewards, your subscription will begin with the June 2016 issue.\nSince all of the subscription rewards include the DESTROY SF! reward, the POCDSF special issue won't count against your subscription; so if you buy a one-year subscription, you'll really be getting 13 issues, rather than 12, etc.\nIf you are an EXISTING SUBSCRIBER: If you choose one of the subscription rewards, we'll just extend your current subscription by the specified term (i.e., by 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Note: We can only do this for subscribers who subscribe directly via the LIGHTSPEED store or via Weightless Books; unfortunately we can't offer to extend subscriptions for Kindle Periodicals subscribers. When we send out the Kickstarter survey after the campaign concludes, we'll ask you which store your subscription is currently with and renew it accordingly.\nIf you want the DESTROY PRINT reward, but also want to back at a higher tier, we also have options for that. Just look for the rewards that have PRINT in the titles.\nTo our international backers who want the DESTROY PRINT! reward\u2014we apologize for the stiff fee ($20) for international shipping, but that's what it costs, unfortunately! The print edition will likely be between 1-2 lbs., which means the shipping will be $18+, so we rounded that up to $20 for the \"handling\" part of \"shipping and handling.\"\nPREMIUM REWARD - Video Chats: Chats can be about whatever you want (within reason!) in connection with the theme of the project. So that includes the business of writing and publishing, science fiction/fantasy in general, POC SF/F specifically, etc. But if you just want to squee about your mutual interests, that's okay too!\nIn the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals:\n(#1) $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED!\nThe Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight.\n(#2) $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster - UNLOCKED!\nIf you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-73 (including the POC Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #74 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-73, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nIf you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-45, and your subscription will begin with #46 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-45, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nAll other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus 3 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY.\n(#3) $20,000 - JJA POC Sampler - UNLOCKED!\nLIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of POC-authored stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology). All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#4) $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED!\nWe normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month.

Over 70,000 books were reduced to ashes. To this day, students still have few books from which to study.\n168:01 is an installation at the Art Gallery of Windsor featuring a library of blank white books. The white library stands as an austere monument of loss that simultaneously activates a potential for rebirth. Each book in the white library is embedded with the possibility of rebuilding anew from the ashes of cultural decimation.\nThis is where you come in \u2013 168:01 is a system of exchange, connecting viewers like yourselves directly with the College of Fine Arts to generate a transnational grassroots effort. Your participation in this Kickstarter will fund educational texts from a wish list compiled by faculty at the College of Fine Arts. Each new text will replace a blank white book from the exhibition. \nOur goal is to replace all 1,000 blank books in the exhibition with educational texts. At the end of the exhibition, all of the texts will be shipped to the College of Fine Arts in Baghdad, beginning the process of rebuilding their library.\n---\nHistorical Context\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was home to the largest library in the world\u2014the Bayt al-Hikma, or House of Wisdom. A Mongol siege in the 13th century laid waste to all the libraries of Baghdad, along with the House of Wisdom. According to legend, the library was thrown into the Tigris River to create a bridge of books for the Mongolian army to cross. The pages bled ink into the river for seven days, after which the books were drained of knowledge.\n168:01 takes its title from this story of loss, representing the first second after 168 hours (or seven days), which signals the beginning of rebirth and process of moving forward to rebuild.\n---\nAbout the Artist\nWafaa Bilal is renowned for provoking dialogue about international politics and internal dynamics through high profile, technologically-driven art projects that employ the use of robotics, the Internet, and photographic mobile mapping. His work is informed by the experience of fleeing his homeland of Iraq and existing simultaneously in two worlds\u2014his home in the \u201ccomfort zone\u201d of the United States and his consciousness of the \u201cconflict zone\u201d in Iraq.\nBilal\u2019s work is represented in major public collections, including Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Qatar; Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; Milwaukee Art Museum; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California. He has exhibited extensively in galleries and institutions throughout the world, including the US, Thailand, Iraq, the UK, Dubai, Lebanon, France, and Germany, and he has served on the panels of over twenty major global universities and institutions, including the Tate Modern, UK; Harvard University; Stanford University; Museum of Art and Design; the Global Art Forum, Qatar; and the Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts, Turkey. His work has been reviewed in major publications, including ARTnews\u00b8 Art in America, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Newsweek, and he is the co-author of the critically-acclaimed 2008 publication \"Shoot an Iraqi: Arts, Life and Resistance Under the Gun\"\nAbout the Art Gallery of Windsor\nThe Art Gallery of Windsor collects, conserves, interprets and presents Canadian art. It is a place to view significant works of art by local, regional, national and international artists; a place to see what Canadians have been making and thinking about for longer than Canada has been a country. The AGW is a valuable cultural resource for the Windsor area, providing the special service of showcasing Canadian art in a city that has one of the busiest border crossings between Canada and the United States.\nLocated in the southern tip of Canada and across the river from Detroit, is an important site for the arrival and departure for Indigenous, settler and migrant communities. In recent years many Middle Eastern families fled their countries in search of safety in the US and Canada. Both Windsor and Detroit are home to burgeoning Middle Eastern communities that now form an essential part of their cultural fabric. Wafaa Bilal\u2019s installation 168.01 will resonate deeply with the Gallery\u2019s audiences and open up important conversations on freedom, security and cultural heritage that are at once deeply interwoven and splintered along colonial, racial and economic lines. This project is commissioned by the Art Gallery of Windsor and curated by Srimoyee Mitra, Curator of Contemporary Art.\nThe Art Gallery of Windsor is a chartered, non-profit, educational organization operating for the benefit of the public. It is supported by its members, donors and sponsors, the City of Windsor, The Canada Council for the Arts, the Department of Canadian Heritage, the Ontario Arts Council, and the Ministry of Citizenship, Culture and Recreation.\nFor more information on the exhibition visit: 168:01\n---\nRewards\nIn exchange, you can select the following as rewards for your participation:\n$5 or more\nPledge $5 or more and I will post a special \"thank you\" message on my personal Facebook page in your honor.\n$10 or more\nPledge $10 or more and I will mail you a handwritten \"thank you\" postcard, featuring a photograph from my acclaimed photography series The Ashes Series, Al-Mutanabbi Street.\n$15 or more\nPledge $15 or more and your name will be listed on a wall next to the installation of 168:01 at the Art Gallery of Windsor!\nThe future home of 168:01: The Art Gallery of Windsor\n$25 or more\nPledge $25 or more and you will receive one limited edition artist book from the installation of 168:01.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe success of 168:01 relies heavily on community support, so the biggest obstacle to full realization of this project would be underfunding. To replace every white book on the shelf with a book from The University of Baghdad\u2019s wish list, I will need to raise over $20,000. Ideally, I will raise more than the goal.\n\nBy keeping the funding goal modest on Kickstarter, I am giving myself 1) a good jumping off point to start purchasing the books for the exhibition and 2) time to secure the rest of books as direct donations. I am hoping to build off the momentum of a successful campaign, grab the attention of the right people and continue circulating the registry of books to individuals and organizations throughout the exhibition period. \n\nThe shipping of the white book rewards from 168:01 may be delayed, as the exhibition will travel to at least one other venue after the Art Gallery of Windsor.

Within hours of his death, government agents seized everything in that room. But multiple accounts suggest a certain notebook, rumored to be there, was missing.    \nThe occupant of that room... was Nikola Tesla.\nNearly seventy-five years later, in the hard-luck city of Buffalo, NY, a low-rent detective witnesses his partner killed in the crossfire of a blackmail scheme gone bad. Driven to know why, he's led into a twisted conspiracy to possess a world-changing design torn from Tesla's fabled missing notebook... \nThat design is the object everyone is after - Hitchcock's 'MacGuffin' - in THE AMERICAN SIDE.\nSet against the classic and industrial architectural backdrop of Buffalo and the mesmerizing power of Niagara Falls, THE AMERICAN SIDE is populated with complexly motivated characters played by an eclectic ensemble of actors from Matthew Broderick to Camilla Belle, Janeane Garofalo to Robert Forster, and even the original Man from U.N.C.L.E., Robert Vaughn!\nYes!\nGrab your popcorn!                                                                                     \nThis film has already been made!  \nOur campaign isn\u2019t about raising funds to make a film. It\u2019s about making sure we get this film into a theater near you!\nWhen it premiered at the Woodstock Film Festival, THE AMERICAN SIDE was hailed by The Hollywood Reporter as an 'adrenaline-charged, pop-noir mystery' and a festival \u2018highlight\u2019, loaded with loving homages to film noir, Hitchcock, and conspiracy films of the '70s. \nIt also sent audiences scrambling down the rabbit hole into the wildly intriguing world of Tesla.\nWho was Nikola Tesla?\nResponsible in whole or in part for almost every significant technological advancement of the 20th century, Tesla was developing wireless devices when people were still getting around on horseback. But eventually the eccentric and paranoid genius was marginalized by his peers and abandoned by the industrialists who made millions from his work.\nStill, Tesla continued to invent, obscuring his designs by leaving them unlabeled, unfinished, and even separated into pieces. The later works of his that were recovered, are studied by the U.S. Government to this day.\nPLAY\n\nWe all know countless terrific films are made every year that don\u2019t have a promotional machine behind them, and therefore never make it to the big screen. But there is a growing movement in the indie film world to change the typical model and take charge of the theatrical life of these films. \nFor our spring theatrical release, we\u2019re partnering with one of the sharpest, most experienced minds in independent film. Because before you see it someplace like HBO or Netflix, THE AMERICAN SIDE should first live where it was meant to be seen: in movie theaters. \nBy raising our own financing for publicists, posters, trailers, ads, and fancy things like digital packages so theaters can project the movie properly, we can reach audiences beyond the initial markets. Every dollar we raise expands our presence. More backing means more theaters and a larger life for the film. \nIt also means REWARDS for you! \nTHE AMERICAN SIDE is a truly independent endeavor from a filmmaking team without insider connections or piles of dough, just a dogged commitment to the material and the belief that there is an audience for intricate indie films that entertain.\nPlease take a look at our rewards and back this project with whatever you can, so we may reach that audience - in movie theaters - where films like THE AMERICAN SIDE should be experienced for the first time.\nAnd keep in mind, you can pledge above the price point of the reward you choose, or wave your reward altogether.\nSo many extraordinary actors, designers, and technicians shared our belief and signed on. We hope you will too.\nJoin the conspiracy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThey say it's a miracle ANY film EVER gets made. So many things have to go right, and you can still lose it all because of three days of rain. \n\nSome people thought making a film this ambitious on a tight budget and an even tighter schedule was crazy. But as Robert Forster's character puts it, 'One man's nuts, is another man's balls.'\n\nWe were told on more than one occasion-\n'You\u2019ll never be able to shoot that scene on your budget\u2019.\n\u2018You\u2019ll never get that actor\u2019.\n\u2018Greg Stuhr is so handsome he\u2019ll distract from the story\u2019.\n\nAnd yet, thanks to a lot of grit, determination, an incredible group of artists and technicians (including a makeup team that made Greg look like 'just a guy'), and a heck of a cast, crew, and post-production team, we overcame every one of those challenges to complete THE AMERICAN SIDE.\n\nStill, even after facing down the long odds of getting the film made the way we wanted it made, one huge challenge remained: ensuring THE AMERICAN SIDE had a life in theaters.\n\n*********************************************\n\nEver stumble across a great film on cable or Netflix and wonder why you\u2019d never heard of it? Too often the answer is simply \u2018money\u2019. Major studios control what we see at the movies, even putting out so-called \u2018indie\u2019 films that are simply produced by a studio subsidiary. Studios have the resources to promote these films, making them more attractive to theater owners and further limiting the number of screens available for truly independent work. \n\nTo compete, indie filmmakers who have already stretched every penny to make their film, are now tasked with raising more to promote their films beyond a limited release in a couple of select markets.\n\nBut again, by the nature of producing in the independent realm, we get pretty good at tackling obstacles. And if we've learned anything, it's that for every problem there is a solution. \n\nPart of our goal is to empower you, our audience, to decide if THE AMERICAN SIDE looks like a film you\u2019d like to see in theaters. Your pledge is a 'yes' to that, and to seeing independent films AT THE MOVIES! \n\n********************************************************\n\n*This fundraising campaign is subject to all Kickstarter rules and regulations, movie guild rules, and applicable laws.

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign. Tee Hee!\nAs #1 Golden Shiny Boy Champion, I need a place to shine bright and inspire. I want to be a part of your life again, serving in both a wind-beneath-your-wings and an ASRM capacity. You know you still want me, baby, but allow me to tell you why.\nFirst, I like POP! Figures. I intend to roll most of the money into Funko stock. Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

You can still subscribe through our store, and stay on top of all Kill Screen news by signing up for our mailing list. \nA NOTE TO OUR US BACKERS: Please check out our FAQs to learn more about our FREE US SHIPPING. \nFive years ago, we published the first issue of Kill Screen thanks to a successful Kickstarter. Independent games had begun to break into the mainstream, with Braid and then Limbo proving that small teams could make financially successful games that at once simplified and expanded the possibilities of gaming. We wanted to expose the innovation we saw making its way into the mainstream and treat games like any other art, colliding them with film and music and design. That is why you\u2019ll see that our new magazine is changing visually, with a sleeker design, cleaner image, and a more personable, grown up feel.\nSo on just six thousand dollars that we raised on Kickstarter, we produced 9 issues of our magazine, helped launch the careers of many fantastic game writers, published a daily website that has consistently pushed the boundaries of game criticism, and put on three conferences that have thrown the relationship between games and culture into stark relief.\nWe are now back on Kickstarter to reinvent our current magazine: to be much bigger, bolder, and better looking than ever before.\nKill Screen is back on Kickstarter because we owe so much to the success of our first project. Without our initial successful Kickstarter and this amazing community, we would not have been able to publish our magazine or build our company into what it is today. We remain an independent publication, and we want to stay that way. So it\u2019s up to this Kickstarter and our lovely supporters to make this revamp a reality\u2013\u2013 if the project isn\u2019t funded, we won\u2019t be able to make this happen.\nThere are a lot of exciting new changes to our magazine. Firstly, it's going to be physically larger and will contain full-color portraits of the creators we're featuring. We are working once again with Shapco for our printing needs. They are a family-owned company in Minnesota that has been in business for almost forty years.\nWe\u2019re going to showcase the independent creators that are important to us through reported features, visual essays, and rigorously researched, long-form criticism. We\u2019ll dig deep into the most important new games by sending writers and photographers to find out how they came to be: not through Skype interviews but through a week of embedded reporting.\nWe'll continue to seek out the most thoughtful, curious writers in videogames and give them space to thoroughly grapple with games past and present. \nOur magazine will feature writers from top publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker, GQ, the LA Times, and many, many more.\nAn issue of Kill Screen will be an essential collection of videogame writing, with a laser focus on what\u2019s important and new alongside Saturday-afternoon longreads. People familiar with the site will see their favorite writers off the leash, exploring the things they love with unprecedented resources.\nThose who don\u2019t have time for videogame writing in their day-to-day will have a sumptuously designed, one-stop-shop to know what matters. We believe games are for everyone. We want to show you why.\nFor an idea of who we'll be covering, here's who has already committed to be featured in this project, among others:\n-Ben Esposito, Donut County\n-Teddy Diefenbach, Hyper Light Drifter\n-Nina Freeman, Cibele\n-David OReilly, Mountain\n-Jenny Jiao Hsia, Beglitched\n-Winnie Song, Badblood\n-Jane Ng, Firewatch\n-Marc Ten Bosch, Miegakure\n-Fullbright, Tacoma\n-Erica Gorochow, Specimen\n-Brendon Chung, Quadrilateral Cowboy\nThe change we saw coming in 2010 has taken root. Videogames have grown up! The promise of \u201cindie games\u201d now thrives in little online spaces and onstage at E3; game jams pop up, and blast out dozens of games worth playing and talking about. Perhaps most importantly, this is the first time in history when gaming\u2019s old monoculture has started breaking down. Now you can have taste in games, the same way you might in film or music. You don\u2019t have to like Call of Duty on one end of the spectrum or Gone Home, on the other; there are a million shades of gray\u2014and blue, and purple, and taupe, and so on\u2014to choose from. All of which creates a new challenge for Kill Screen: to inspire a life well-played. Our magazine launched as \u201csmart\u201d videogame writing, but in 2015 it needs to be more than smart: it needs to be deeper, better reported, and curatorial to cover an exploding culture.\nTop, left to right:\nRachel Catlett - Project Associate\nJamin Warren - Founder and CEO\nJudy Romano - Business Development Associate\nMiddle, left to right:\nDavid McDowell - Photographer\nJustin Kielbasa - Designer\nBottom, left to right:\nJane Mai - Business Assistant\nZach Budgor - Editor \nClayton Purdom - Editorial Director\nPledge $5 or More: You will receive a digital issue of our new magazine and your name forever on a weird digital monument to our backers, designed by Camp Cult's Cale Bradbury.  \nPledge $25 or More: You will receive a physical copy of our new magazine, plus a digital copy of Boss Fight Books' Super Mario Bros. 2 by Kill Screen's own Jon Irwin, a digital issue of our new magazine, and your name forever on a weird digital monument to our backers. \n Pledge $30: DIGITAL LOVE TIER.

We're boosting our schedule to a rigidly-kept quarterly event, we're including beautiful color photography rather than solely illustrations, and we're going to be sending out writers for international embedded reporting. And of course, we want to be able to pay the writers and artists that work with us what they deserve rather than trying to make do on a shoestring budget.\nOur funding goal is much higher this time around than it was during our first campaign. Kickstarter was a very different place in 2009, and you couldn't ask for large funding goals to support the quality of publication you wanted as easily as you can now. We wanted to make a quarterly publication, but it proved impossible to do so on just $6,000. So this time we're asking for upgraded funding to support an upgraded publication.\nWe have an extremely thorough model to calculate costs to make this magazine, and we've spent a great amount of time carefully determining how much money we need to do the magazine right for a full year. We don't want to undersell it and risk not being able to fulfill.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy upgrading our magazine to a quarterly publication we recognize that we're giving ourselves a lot more work. Luckily we have an awesome full-time staff, as well as a group of dedicated writers that are ready to handle the larger work load. Our full-time team is twice as big as it was during our run of the magazine to this point. Of course we initially wanted our publication to be quarterly, but we were overconfident when we believed $6,000 was enough to make that dream a reality. We have learned a lot over the last eight issues of our magazine and have come out with a wealth of knowledge about making it a reality, including a higher funding goal to enable our team. \n\nBy including photography and embedded reporting, we are certainly opening ourselves up to a challenge. However for the first time in Kill Screen's history, we are lucky enough to have a staff photographer rather than relying on many different freelancers. This will create creative consistency in the visuals in the magazine as well as meaning that we have a staff member dedicated to this portion of the magazine. We also have an international team of writers that enables embedded reporting beyond our previous issues. The longer release calendar of our quarterly schedule will also enable us to plan content well in advance. \n\nFinally, making a magazine is not easy. Luckily, we've already done this eight times (nine including issue zero). We are using the same printer we've used many times over and have a great working relationship with them. For the first time in our history we have a new, dedicated full-time staff ready to make this magazine happen and deliver it on schedule. We have budgeted our time and money to ensure that we have the resources necessary to stick to a rigid quarterly schedule and make sure our magazine gets to you on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Thank you and an update", "update_content": "Thank you all for your support this past month.

A project 8 years in the making.\nShade: The Dying World is a graphic novel from creator Nathan Heigert that's been over a decade in development and 8 years of production. The first six chapters were published as Shade: Part One at San Francisco's Alternative Press Expo in 2010. Now, with your funding, all twelve chapters will be printed in one handsome paperback book for the first time. \nAll 360 pages of illustrations are already complete, with 200+ finalized with color. The successful funding will jumpstart the coloring of the remaining pages.\nA dystopian, sci-fi epic set on a planet orbiting a decaying star, the story is set on the planet Da\u00f1ub, whose orientation as it orbits its red-giant star scorches the north and leaves its south in relative calm. \nThe culture in the north, the Da\u00f1ubi, struggle to endure infighting between tribes and the brutal elements, but they are capable of greatness. \nIn Part One of the book, the northerners embark on wooden airships, and begin their journey of thousands of miles across the desolate land between the hemispheres. After months of enduring hardships, they reach their distant objective, believing their quest to be over.\nOnly then do they discover their paradise has already been claimed by a great unknown civilization called Ethenon. Blessed by good climate and resources, its citizens have built an empire of wealth that amazes the voyagers. \nThe Etheneans are fascinated by the new arrivals and invite diplomacy between their two worlds. With the northerners' knowledge of ship-building and the southerners' unlimited resources and manpower, it seems they can combine their skills to begin a new era in their planet's history. But they soon learn that this clash of cultures will test them all. The story of their conflict makes up the second part of the book.\nMathos is the old scholar whose life's work is to discover the oasis to the south and rebuild society in its shelter. Mocked for his beliefs, he is unrelenting in his effort with the help of his apprentice, Djantu. \nYoung, idealistic, and possessing an almost clairvoyant insight, Djantu loyally follows his mentor towards their goal of reaching the legendary land of shade and water. But when he is confronted with the task of leading his people, he must rise to the occasion.\nTogether, they go forth on their quest, enlisting the guidance of a courageous warrior, Jocabo. \nHaunted by a loss from his past, Jocabo seeks redemption by shielding his companions from harm, though he fears their mission is doomed.\nIn the south, the Etheneans are led by the Emperor Nerod and General Darus, who see great potential in interacting with the Da\u00f1ubi. But are their motives pure?\nSpecial Promotions: Bernies! Non-Alcoholic Home Brews! Bookmarks! \nTo keep up momentum for pledges, each week I will introduce a new campaign promotion. This week the promotions are: \nSince the first week's \"514 Trumps\" illustration was such a hit, we are announcing a companion piece to that illustration: for every $10 backed between today and the end of the campaign, I will draw one (1) Bernie Sanders talking to himself about math! I'll be on the hook for literally hundreds of these unkempt little fellas! And just like the Trumps, the top backer for this week will win the full illustration when the campaign hits its goal!\nLike this, but x 100's\nAlso, anyone who gets someone they know to pledge for even the $10 tier will receive an elevated \"Chieftain Level\" thanks in the back of the book and a \"Chieftain\" bookmark with their book as token of thanks! If the friend you refer pledges for a hard copy, they will get a \"Mercenary\" bookmark! And if they refer someone, they will also get a Chieftain bookmark! Refer as many people as you can and get a bookmark for each one! To participate, confirm that the person you referred has pledged, then message me their name through Kickstarter. Also, if you simply increase your existing book order by one book, you will receive both bookmarks.\nNot final design.\nPast Promotions:\nWeek 3:\nThe five highest pledges between Sunday Oct 18 and Saturday Oct 24 won their choice of needle felt figurine: Trump, Da\u00f1ubi, or \"Barrel Roll\" Izzy Starfox designed by Kelly McLachlan, to be received within 2 weeks of the successful funding of the campaign!\nWeek 2:\n53 people pledged at the $35 level or higher to get a barrel roll in their name by my dog, Izzy Starfox. In addition, the highest pledge of the week won the 514 Trumps illustration and will receive it upon the successful end of the campaign!\nWeek 1:\nBackers pledged enough money for me to draw 514 Trumps!

I've been drawing for most of my life, and have always aspired to be an illustrator, so my current work as a commercial storyboard artist and animator (and the creator of this book) has been a dream come true. This has included award-winning national ad campaigns, webisodes, apps, and YouTube videos. \"Shade\" has been my side project for years: first from when I came up with the original concept in high school, and then from 2007 onward as I worked on the story and script and illustrated the artwork. I count on my incredible fiancee Kelly and our mini-Cattle Dog Izzy for moral and emotional support.\nMock-up of Design\n\u2022 360 illustrated pages\n\u2022 Full color\n\u2022 7\"x9\"\n\u2022 3 lbs in weight\nThere is also a limited quantity of large-format hardcover books for those who prefer hardcover to paperback.\nMock-up of Design\n\u2022 360 illustrated pages\n\u2022 Full color\n\u2022 8\"x10.5\"\n\u2022 3.5 lbs in weight\n  Cost Breakdown for Minimum Funding\nWhy set $20,000 as the goal? There's a simple reason for this: bulk printing.\nWith a book of this size, in full color, the costs for printing are huge compared to a 22-page black and white, light page weight comic issue. But the vision I have for this book mandates that the quality of the art comes through on heavy-weight paper in full color.\nThat means that to make the printing affordable, there have to be enough copies made to make the per-unit price reasonable. In fact, any order less than 250 copies would have a per-unit printing cost higher than the selling price! But as orders go up the costs come down dramatically. The cost to print 500 copies is 43% less per unit; at 750 copies it's 58% less per unit! It's at these quantities the cost of production becomes practical, but it means that enough backers have to join forces to make this happen. It's also why Kickstarter is a more ideal platform for the campaign than Indiegogo, where funding less than the goal met is still collected, which wouldn't guarantee a bulk-cost for printing.\nWho is the audience for this book? Is there an appropriate age range for a reader?\nAs a fan of the science-fiction, fantasy, sword & sandals, and historical fiction genres, I would imagine anyone who shares one or more of these interests would enjoy this book, as well as anyone who enjoys comic books and graphic novels broadly.\nThe book does include sections of war and fantasy-related violence, which as a point of reference I would compare to the levels you see in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, which is rated PG-13. To see for yourself, you can read the first chapter of the book online at www.shadegraphicnovel.com, which contains a war sequence which is probably the most graphic part of the entire book. If you think a reader you have in mind can handle this, then they can handle the book as a whole.\nA rising tide lifts all boats, and with funding beyond the goal of $20,000 fun new features will be added that will be accessible to all eligible funders.\n$22,000 \u2013 BONUS supplemental map art to book design!\nI'll illustrate new art to be included as inside cover or bonus page art showing the areas of Da\u00f1ub in the North, the Ethenean Empire to the South, and the path of the voyagers for easy reference. \n$28,000 \u2013 BONUS digital \"Making of\" booklet! \nI'll design a booklet featuring early art, historical and visual inspiration, storyboards, sketches and more, along with a short history of the conception and making of the graphic novel, as a digital download available to all $10 and up backers.\n$35,000 \u2013 BONUS fold-out airship comparison diagram 11x17 poster to print books! \nI'll illustrate new art showing the various airships of Da\u00f1ub seen throughout the graphic novel as a size-comparison diagram that will be included with every print copy of the book.\n$50,000 \u2013 UPGRADE: Project expedited by hiring colorist to split workload!\nImagine getting the graphic novel a couple months earlier than expected! If we reach this goal I'll be able to afford to hire a colorist to help finalize color on the remaining pages of the book.\n$75,000 \u2013 BONUS digital advance copy of preface chapter to follow-up book!\nIf we reach this goal, not only would I be floored by the level of interest in the book, but I will be eager to share some more stories of the planet Da\u00f1ub that I have in mind. Within a year of funding (Nov. 2016) I'll commit to releasing a first look at the follow-up story as a digital download to all $10 and up backers.\nLinks:\nFB: www.facebook.com/shadegraphicnovel\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/3o0nur/shade_the_dying_world_kickstarter_graphic_novel/cvsxexs", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith all 360 pages already illustrated, the project is nearly complete. Around 140 pages remain to be colored, which will be assisted by the funds raised by a successful funding.

Our goal was to combine all things we use in our everyday life to be stored in a Duffel Bag. The KAVA bag starts and ends with everyday essentials we drag with us from day to day bases. This bag was designed around the workflows of travelers and commuters, even some essential for photographers. The KAVA comes with a headphone jack opening on the top, the bag itself can be held in several different ways for your comfortably, we also included a small tripod holder and as well as a bottle holder along with a side pocket for extra essentials, last but not least the inside of the bag includes a laptop holder for most laptops. And it doesn't just stop there... \nPhones have became an essential part of our lives and they play a big role on our daily interactions. With introduction of bigger phone sizes, we decided to offer two elastic pockets on the straps that can be used to store phones, wallets or even passports. We tested each elastic pockets with different phone sizes and we have yet to find a problem! The elastic pockets on the straps allows you to quickly grab your phone and wallets without ever worrying about losing them.\nWhen we first started on working on KAVA, we paid a close attention of how people interact with music. We've placed the headphone port in a connivence location for making listening to music more enjoyable in the backpack orientation. Your music player will rest in the inside pocket of the bag. \nThe front flat pocket allows for a quick and grab and go access to things such as cellphones, wallets and small objects. With our broad lifestyles, the front pocket will prove to be handy and personal to each and one of us.\nSide pocket complements the smaller front pocket with more space that allows not only one but few objects to be put in and be zipper for secure carry.\nThis is unique feature that allows for multi-purpose use. The side elastic pocket with two straps will allow you to secure in small tripod or monopod. It can also a secure water bottle. Since the bag can be held and worn differently, the strap holds it in place securely regardless of the orientation of the bag.\nIncludes:\n1 x Front Zipper Pocket\n1 x Side Zipper Pocket\n2 x Handles ( Horizontal and Vertical) \n2 x Strap Elastic Holder (Phone/Wallets)\n1 x Side Multi-Purpose Elastic Holder\n1 x Laptop Inner Pocket\n1 x Small Zipper Pocket \n1 x Backpack Straps\n1 x Shoulder strap\nWe believe with KAVA you can truly discover yourself as it acts as a perfect companion in carrying your everyday essential gear.

Wordnik can and should include every English word that's ever been used.\nWhy?\nEvery word deserves a recorded place in our language's history. We want to collect, preserve, and share every word of English, and provide a place where people can find, learn, annotate, comment on, and argue about every word.\nIf you want to know more about a word\u2014any word!\u2014we want to help you find the information you need. If you're curious about a word, why should you have to wait until someone else decides that a word is worth knowing?\nHow?\nThe reason so few words are added to traditional dictionaries is because writing definitions takes a long time. A very talented editor may write seven entries in a day, or she may need weeks to describe just one word. Dictionary definitions are very difficult to write. \nWordnik takes a different approach. Instead of writing traditional definitions, we search for casual definitions that have already been created. You see these casual definitions all the time in good writing!  Here's an excellent casual definition for the word bibliobesity from Terry Teachout, in the New York Times:\n\"The problem of bloated books\u2014bibliobesity, as it were\u2014has always been with us.\"\nAnd another, for cookprint, from Consumer Reports:\n\"And cut down on your cookprint\u2014the energy you use to prepare the food you eat.\"\nAnd for misophonia, by The Huffington Post:\n\"The condition is called misophonia\u2014literally 'hatred of sound'\u2014and occurs when a common noise, whether it's something like a person chewing loudly, water dripping or someone 'ahem'-ing, causes you to become anxious or angry, more so than a typical response, TODAY reported.\"\nSometimes we call these self-defining, explanatory sentences \"free-range definitions\", or \"FRDs\" (pronounced \"freds\").\nBy finding these sentences (and we've already found a lot of them) we can help people understand new and rare words the way people normally learn new words: in context.\nWhy Wordnik?\nWordnik has been collecting and sharing words since 2009.\nOur mission is to collect all the words of English and share them with everyone. We share words through our website at Wordnik.com, and through our API at developer.wordnik.com. Last year, we reincorporated as a non-profit, because we believe the English language belongs to everyone.\nEvery word at Wordnik gets its own full page, with as much data shown as possible: a standard definition (if one already exists), example sentences; synonyms, antonyms, and other related words; space for community-added tags, lists, and comments; images from Flickr and tweets from Twitter; and statistics on usage, including how many times a word has been favorited, listed, tagged, commented-upon, and, of course, whether or not it's valid in Scrabble (and how many points it scores).\nWordnik also has an open API! For web and native app developers, instead of licensing a less-complete dictionary or finding public-domain resources and adapting them, you can use our API to incorporate information from our site in search results or as full definitions.\nAt Wordnik, we don't want to be a gatekeeper between you and the word you're interested in; we just want to show you the data that exists and let you make up your own mind! And we want to do this for every word.\nHow exactly will Wordnik do this?\nWe'll start by taking the thousands of free-range-definition examples (FRDs, or \"Freds\") we've already found, and use those as a training set for a new machine-learning-based tool. \nWe have lots of example sentences like this one!\nThen we'll start looking for more great sentences, beginning with the hundreds of thousands of words that have already been looked up on Wordnik but for which we don't have good data. (If a real human looked something up, it is more likely to be interesting.)\nWe'll also update Wordnik so that any time a word is looked up that we've never seen before, we'll kick off a search to find more data about it.\nWe won't limit ourselves to words that are more frequent than one-in-a-billion, either. If a word exists at all, we'll show you what we can! \nA million words missing from dictionaries? How can there be that many?\nIn 2010, Harvard researchers published findings in the journal Science that began to quantify the number of definition-less words in English. Using the Google Books Corpus (5 million books, 361 billion words) and comparing samples to major dictionaries (including the Oxford English Dictionary [OED] and the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD]), the researchers estimated that \"52% of the English lexicon\u2014the majority of the words used in English books\u2014consists of lexical 'dark matter' undocumented in standard references.\"\nJean-Baptiste Michel, Erez Lieberman Aiden, and the other authors of the Science paper defined a word as a meaningful string of letters that occurs more often than once every billion words. (1 in a billion is the frequency of the least common words in the dictionaries they analyzed.) Using this definition, they used their data to estimate that the English language contains 1,022,000 words\u2014each of which appeared at least 362 times in their 361 billion word dataset.\nThe second edition of the OED has 615,100 \"word forms defined and/or illustrated\"; MWD has around 470,000 main entries (not including word forms).\nOnce you take into account words that appear less frequently than once every billion words, there may be a million or more missing words!\nDo we really need all these words?\nWe already have all these words in English! They exist right now in articles, books, blog posts, and even tweets. But they've never all been recorded in one place where they can be discovered and loved.\nHave you ever felt that the right word was out there, but you just couldn't find it? \nHave you ever learned a weird word that made your whole day? Perhaps a word like thoil, which means 'to be able to justify the expense of a purchase'? Or pandiculation, which means 'yawning and stretching (as when first waking up)'?\nMany of these missing words aren't words we use every day, but their existence enriches the whole language. We believe every word should have the right to be included in the dictionary.\nAt Wordnik, we want to gather data about every word\u2014and then you can use that data to decide whether a word is worth adding to your vocabulary. We'll just find the words: what happens next is up to you!\nWhat Will Backers Get?\nIn addition to adding all these new words to Wordnik for everyone to enjoy, we will be releasing a report to backers in March of 2016 detailing our progress and giving an overview of the words we've found and added. Every backer will receive this (digital) report.\nWe have some other splendiferous rewards, too!\nRANDOM BACKER: for one measly greenback, you can be a random word adopter. We'll add your name to a \"random sponsor\" list that will display one random sponsor's name every time someone clicks the \"Random Word\" link at Wordnik.com.

(The letter S has already been sponsored.) [Limited reward: only 25]\nYour donation is tax-deductible!\nWordnik is a non-profit effort. For US backers, your donation is tax-deductible and may also qualify for matching funds from your employer if they support such a program for charitable contributions. While we file for our own non-profit status we have teamed up with a well-known 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Planetwork (they were also the fiscal sponsor for Hypothes.is). For any contributions you make you will receive a letter from Planetwork/Wordnik verifying that your contribution qualifies as tax-deductible.\nHow Will We Spend This Money?\nA rough breakdown\nOur biggest expenses for this project are adding the extra servers and storage to find, process, and serve data for a million (or more!) new words. Although we believe we can be more efficient than our current setup, we're basing our costs on what we spend now to run Wordnik's servers now.  \nWe also are hiring some amazing machine learning consultants to ensure that we're doing this The Right Way. (We expect to make their names public very shortly after launch of the campaign.)\nWe also will be spending a little money to make cool stuff to reward our backers, and and, of course, there are Kickstarter fees.\nWait, What Do You Mean By \"Word\"?\nThis is a very good question! Linguists, lexicographers, and grammarians often struggle with what makes something \"a word\". Here are some types of words that are A-OK with us and that we will include when we find them:\nNonce-words (words used just once)\nAffixes (prefixes and suffixes), and words created by adding affixes to existing words\nFixed phrases and idioms\nWords borrowed from other languages and not yet considered naturalized in English by other dictionaries, but used by English speakers and writers.\nHere are some things we DON'T consider \"words\" for the purposes of this project:\nobvious typos or OCR errors. Of course, then you have to figure out what's \"obvious\" ... we'll be looking at words that are very similar to existing words and show up in identical contexts, e.g.:\nkeysmash, e.g. asjdlkfjasdf. We'll be doing some filtering to see if new strings we find are \"shaped\" like English words.\nEmoji(s). Sorry! Go look them up at Emojipedia.\nEven More Things To Look At! \nIf you want even more information about why MORE WORDS ARE BETTER, you probably will like these two TED videos: \n Thanks so much for making it all the way to the end! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'll be updating Wordnik's sentence-finding-and-ranking process to be more lightweight and on-demand, which involves some technology that is new to us. Luckily, we have access to some kick-ass developers who have promised to help us if we get stuck.\n\nWe may find that some sources that are rich in missing words (scanned old books, weird web forums) are harder to crawl and parse than we think. In that case, we'll create maps and lists of sources we'd like to pursue further, and seek additional funding from foundations supporting work in the digital humanities to move forward with those sources.\n\nSome people may declare that some of the missing words we find and/or update \"aren't really words\" and start to have terrible flamewars in Wordnik's comment section. We have a dedicated cadre of Wordniks skilled in defusing these arguments, and who regularly watch our Community page (where all new comments appear). If some new words turn out to be really contentious, we'll add a rating system for users to express their opinions of our finds.\n\nWe may find every possible word of English and have to resort to coining weird-looking words like \"kjiggfrzt\" and \"mmmmmwump\" in order to describe new things and concepts. If this happens we plan to produce a list of more-pronounceable words that are underused or have very few senses, as likely candidates for taking on new meanings.\n\nIf we find every possible missing word in English and are still short of a million, we may have to 'borrow' more words from other languages, as is the way of English. If that happens, there is a slight risk of counterattack from the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise or the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, although it's more likely that those two bodies will eject (rather than adopt) English words in retaliation.\n\n(But seriously ... although we expect to be able to find a million missing words, we'll also be looking for new meanings and senses of words that already exist, especially when those new meanings aren't represented in traditional dictionaries.)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "What's Going On With Wordnik?

This is a living machine that eats food scraps and makes energy and plant food using microbes with zero waste. It\u2019s called the HORSE. It\u2019s portable. It\u2019s affordable. It creates jobs and independence from fossil fuel energy and landfilling.\nWe just blew through the $20,000 barrier but we are running out of time!  So we added a new $30 reward to invite small backers to make a fresh pledge.  This magnetic sign is for carrying the message on your tailgate!\nThis changes everything, as featured on:\n  61% of what we throw away is biodegradable (food, landscape waste, paper, wood) and the solution is within our reach locally. Worse yet, 40% of all the food we produce never gets eaten. Food waste is nearly all going to landfills in North America. Join us in revolutionizing the way we create and distribute renewable energy by backing the HORSE project.\nBenefits of HORSE\n\u2022 The HORSE will eradicate curbside garbage pickup and the carbon emissions associated with long distance trucking.\n\u2022 Creating a whole new shared carbon-negative transportation model for local use: less trucking + no landfilling + renewable energy!\n\u2022 Combined benefit is disruptive and huge \u2013 it\u2019s decentralized \u2013 it\u2019s portable \u2013 it\u2019s affordable\nImagine a technology that can divert waste and create energy off-grid. Imagine eliminating the organic waste from your trashcan. Imagine making it into two valuable new resources that you can personally or commercially use. Our crowd sourcing goal is to both connect like-minded people and to raise enough money to build a containerized version of the HORSE. The one you see in this campaign is going to Surrey, British Columbia! Our Canadian friends will enjoy the first one!\nThis is how Henry Ford conceived the Model T. This is how Doc Brown conceived the Flux Capacitor. They inspired us. Ford's vision was a horseless carriage constructed of the \u201cbest materials, by the best people available, using the simplest designs that technology can devise\u201d. Our vision is a HORSE with the same characteristics. Now a century later we are taking it up a notch with biomimicry \u2013 a machine designed to behave like nature intended. The future is now! In the year 2015!\nVision\nThe vision is to become more self-sufficient and to make renewable energy on your property and fertilize your own or a nearby garden or farm to grow food and flowers. The HORSE is both a sustainability and society game changer. It\u2019s all about the quadruple bottom line: people, planet, profit and progress. There are 700,000 restaurants and 4,000 college campuses in North America. Each one should have their own HORSE. Just imagine the sustainable energy revolution for islands, resorts, zoos, museums, schools, parks, convention centers, farmer's markets, music venues, apartments, and corporate and municipal campuses as they turn food scraps into energy. This is just the beginning.\nHere's how it Works\nWhat goes in and what comes out\nIt will consume 25 tons per year of food scraps, beverages, fat, and paper products. It can create 5,400 gallons per year of liquid fertilizer + up to 37 MW-hrs of raw energy. As renewable gas that\u2019s 125 Million BTU per year (4.3 MW-hrs of this energy is electrical output). The system also has accessory valves for BBQ grills, fire pits, lights, and ovens. How cool is that? Here is what that means in everyday terms.\nWe want to show the world how this works\nIf you pledge you will be part of the Community Supported Biocycling (CSB) learning community. Biocycling means sustainably recycling biodegradable materials like food scraps into something of value. This will be a sustaining forum to develop projects, share experiences, successes, challenges, ideas, and more innovation. CSB is the operating system for the HORSE. CSB is designed to help others run Kickstarter campaigns or other initiatives to get funding for a HORSE of their own, including copy, video, other media, and best practices we have identified in running a Kickstarter to get funding for an Impact unit and onsite bioenergy generation.\nYou can make an impact and be part of this\nWe have a specific CSB project in Seattle and are hoping to build more as a demonstration to allow early adopters and innovators a chance to operate this system. We can build as many projects as the campaign supports so jump on this HORSE with us! This is the logo we created for our CSB community. It puts a face on our operating system that people can recognize and use at restaurants, community gardens, and other public places.\nEnabling Food Waste to Food Resource\nWhy pledge on this one without receiving a cool gadget? Because it\u2019s about future generations and paying it forward. We have come up with some cool rewards in the pledge levels \u2013 even though this campaign has a social and environmental purpose. Check them out. With your help this innovative machine can make a really big difference.\nLiquid \"Rocket Fuel for Plants\"\nLogo T Shirt with message on back\nManufacturing\nOur systems are designed and built in the US, near Seattle in the small town of Auburn, Washington.  Here are some pictures of fabrication of the prototype unit:\nGas storage fabrication\nFinished gas storage\nWater testing the tank\nFinished tank\nDoc says: \"Roads? Where we're going we don't need any roads!\"\nFAQ  \nWhat kind of things can I put in the HORSE?\nThe HORSE can take a wide range of organic wastes, including kitchen trim, post-consumer dining room food scraps, meat, grease, oil, all edible liquids, seafood, dairy products, starch, sugar, fruit, vegetable, small bones, soiled paper products, napkins, tissue, paper towels, waxed paper, grass clippings, leaves, fats, fryer oil, grease trap waste, beverages, alcohol, soup, condiments, eggshells, glycerin, etc.\nWhat kind of things should I NOT put in the HORSE?\nIf a real horse can't eat it you should not put it in this one.  For example: no plastics, glass, or metal.  No soap or cleaning products.  Too much salt is a bad idea.   Alcoholic beverages, brewery yeast, distillery 'stillage', and dairy whey are OK.  Wood is not bad but also not helpful.  Avoid things that will kill bacteria.\nHow much does a HORSE cost?\nThe cost of a HORSE is $43,300.  We have set the crowdfunding goal low but we have high hopes to give birth to two HORSEs from this campaign.  While the Kickstarter platform has a limit of $10,000 we are prepared to credit 50% of any pledge toward a subsequent purchase of a HORSE on or before April 2017.\nWhat does \u201cReinventing Horsepower\u201d mean anyway?\nThis will really surprise you! Our HORSE works around the clock to perpetually recover the power embedded in food waste. When generating electricity this energy converts into about 5,000 kWh per year. If a Tesla gets around 2 miles per kWh, our HORSE could power that Tesla to go about 10,000 miles per year. Not bad. Keep in mind, that car weighs 2.5 tons though. To improve transportation productivity, we decided to lose the unnecessary weight and create a carbon neutral urban cargo tricycle powered by human and electric motorhub. Let\u2019s go Back-to-the-future and call this the HORSEPOWERED CARRIAGE. Fully loaded, this carriage weighs around 0.3 tons. Now we can squeeze the work out of every kWh and transport stuff more than 10 miles per kWh. That's a 5x improvement in electric vehicle productivity or about 52,000 miles per year! This mind-blowing combination could be the next-gen HORSE and CARRIAGE, from waste to wheels...1 lb of food scraps can fuel 1 mile of electric transport!   In today's budgeting dollars this work is valued at $52,500 in transportation and disposal and 27 MTCO2e of emissions!\nWho are Impact Bioenergy & Community Supported Biocycling? What are each of their roles in this project?\nImpact Bioenergy is the core technology provider, designer, builder, and supplier of the HORSE digester. CSB is the service end of a strategic partnering program that helps remove barriers to market and deploy this transformational technology in different locations. It is a partnering program between organizations such as food banks, schools, restaurants, breweries, distilleries, markets, urban farmers, gardeners, and other for-profit or non-profit ventures.\nWhat is Biocycling?  \nBiocycling is the recycling of organic materials. In the context of our project, this term describes the process of taking organic wastes such as food scraps and converting it into liquid fertilizer and energy that can once more be used directly on the farm at which these food resources were originally produced. We like to say...\nFarm to fork to fertilizer and fuel, and back to the farm again.\nWhy the HORSE? Why not just compost?\nComposting is awesome but many food wastes are just too wet and dense to compost easily. It is far better to digest the food wastes which conserves all the nitrogen and water, harvest the energy, and make liquid fertilizer. The liquid can also be used to irrigate compost and make the compost even better. The digester biogas production & capture reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can be used as gas or used to make light, heat, electricity, or CNG vehicle fuel. \nHow much maintenance does the HORSE require? Who will do the work? \nThe HORSE requires about 3 hours of work per week that involves loading feed, mixing the digester contents, checking readings, and drawing off the liquid as needed. Future designs will have increased automation capabilities to reduce the daily maintenance requirement. A HORSE deployment creates local jobs, and operating personnel will be hired at each project location.\nHow does the HORSE work?\nThe horse mimics processes that occur in digestion system of a ruminant, like a cow.\nIf it is like a cow, why is it called a HORSE?\nHORSE stands for High-solids Organic-waste Recycling System with Electric output.\nImpact and CSB Team, Srirup Kumar, Michael Smith, Jan Allen, and Pete Agtuca", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe need a host and partner who will make space for the HORSE and pay for the recycling service and energy we produce. That makes the economics work.\n\nWe need a local farmer and gardening community who will pay for the liquid fertilizer.\n\nWe need boots on the ground to make the CSB business model work.\n\nWe have a plan to address these objectives and meet the challenge.\n\nWith your pledge you can help us succeed and make a real impact. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a big venture capital partner to industrialize this technology. We\u2019re coming to you because this is the BEST way to localize the energy and food cycles in our lives. We want bioenergy to proliferate at the grassroots level. This means we need a community of inspired people who can share experiences and support one another. We can show how the energy and fertilizer can produce the absolute most benefit at the local level.

The museums were nice, the Bosphorus was scenic, and the food was great, but we really fell in love with that cats. The cats of Istanbul are amazing. We met them everywhere we went. Ada carried food for them, and we'd hang out with them, scritch and cuddle them, and watch them patrol their territories of the city. We got to know them.\nAda named the cats of the Dervish House on Istiklal the Great Eye Clan, because their black rimmed eyes on white fur and slim, tall bodies make them look like Egyptian statues of cats. We learned the story of the clan that lives at the Archeological Museum from the cafe staff, who care for the moms and kittens, while the young toms patrol their way though the thousands of years of art and history outside the gates. We found tribes of cats on the Adalar archipelago in the Sea of Marmara. We found the mad cats, friendly cats, shy cats, and old fat cats that guarded the fronts of cafes. \nThe people of Istanbul love the cats every bit as much as we did. Strangers encouraged us, and introduced us to their cats, and we'd swap stories about the different clans around the city. \nAugust came and we said good bye to Istanbul. But we weren't done telling stories about Istanbul, and its cats. I would tell Ada about the messenger cats that brought news from different parts of the city by ferry, Ada would tell me about the cats that secretly catch fish in the Basilica Cistern at night. \nThe cats and their city inspire amazing stories, and I want to share ours with you. It'll be a story of adventure and change, following a cat from far away, abandoned in Istanbul by a family who loved her, but couldn't take her with them. \nI'll be taking time off my regular work, and then Creative Commons licensing the results.\nYour support helps me take the time to write and edit the book, and then publish it with a CC license, and let the whole world have it. I'll be creating a  website for the novel, and creating a PDF/A for people who support this Kickstarter (as well as other rewards!). For those of you who don't know what that means, I'm normally a information security reporter, and PDFs, while useful, are terribly insecure. To cope with this, I will publish a hash that lets you verify your PDF is exactly the one I made for you before you open it, and instructions on how to do this.  (PDF/A will convert to any ebook format as well as regular PDFs)\nYou contributions also go to limited printing, postage, etc.\nDesign for the block print cover selected!\nI will still be doing a few changes and then of course carving it out of linoleum, but this is where we arrived, a cat peeking out of Ottoman tile.\nLooking for My John Tenniel Stretch Goal\nAt $7000 I'm going to look for an illustrator who can bring the cats to life! I know what I can afford at that point won't go too far, so as the money goes up, I'll pay the illustrator more as a sneaky way of getting more pictures. \nUpdate: We sure blew past the stretch goal in a hurry. I'm now looking for an Istanbul-based illustrator who wants to work on the book with me. I'm talking to one now, and we're going to see if we can work together.

The good news is that I've been a professional writer for nine years, and I know what I can and can't do.

While this will be my first novel, it won't be my first novel-length piece of fiction. \n\nThe biggest danger is that I don't finish the novel in time. And the truth is, I'm often late, though reliably late -- just ask my editors over the last nine years.

And yes, you are graded cumulatively. When one of you fails, you all flunk out.\nDifficulty and length of games can be managed by choosing from among 20 different graduation cards, which helps ensure that each game is a new experience.\nYour goal may be to graduate, but you can\u2019t let the monsters overrun the school. As they pile up, you\u2019re forced to use your magic just to stay alive, and you may have nothing left to pass the Graduation Milestones. If you reach an F (on the Graduation Card), it\u2019s Game Over.\n Wizard School was created by Hank Green and Eric Johns, and illustrated by Karen Hallion. We wanted to build something that brings together the stuff we love most into a cooperative game that we love playing. Wizard School is our first game release, and we need your help.\nDo you believe the Scorpelican has no place in modern education? Do you want friends like Ghost Janitors that love to clean up and Baristas who always know your order? Us too. And we'd like you to help DFTBA Games and Wizard School pop into existence.\nThis is your letter, it's now up to you to decide whether you'll be attending Wizard School.\nClick here for a more in-depth look\nWhen you open a box containing wizard school, you will find (this image is updated to include all stretch goals achieved by our wonderful backers!):\nAnd inside our Kickstarter-special, not really all that safe for kids  expansion \"Hank's Dirty Little Secrets\" you will find quite a few things that you will not find on a store shelf. These are all the cards that Hank wrote, and then made Karen draw, but really could not be put into the core game. A fair number of references to Hank's actual high school experience, which we wouldn't call racy, but we wouldn't call tame either. At the moment this expansion consists of 30 cards (11 magical cards, 11 school cards, and 8 graduation cards), but we're hoping/planning to increase that number as our campaign grows!\nThe monster box is hand made by our friend from Abbots Hollow Studios (here is his awesome etsy store). They're all unique, so don't expect yours to look exactly like this, and every one will be signed by Hank.\nThe hardwood wand is also custom made and hand-crafted.\nAnd for our $500 backers, in thanks for the huge role you're playing in getting this thing going, you get to work with Hank, Eric, and Karen to design something to add to the game. That could be a new student, or monster, an item, or graduation card. When we all agree on what this something is, Karen will draw it up, and you will be the first to see it before it gets put on a card and sent to every one of our backers.\nBack in 2010, Eric kinda...borrowed Hank's intellectual property to create the Evil Baby Orphanage card game, which has gone on to sell tens of thousands of copies. Hank, as a life-long lover of tabletop games wanted more, so together they have decided to jump (wand first) into Wizard School as the very first game developed by DFTBA Games. \nThey asked some of their favorite artists if they wanted to be involved, but did not initially ask Karen Hallion because of how she's far too talented and busy to work on something like this. But, oh, they were wrong. Karen dove right in and their weekly meetings have found her playing an advisory role as well as an artist role, which has been extremely welcome. \nOver the last six months, development has taken over our lives, but when what's taking over your life is a game about Wizard School, it's not so bad.\nHelp Us Help You\nWizard School won\u2019t become a reality if strong, independent-minded, fun-loving, lovers of the inane, like you, don\u2019t step forward to say, \u201cI need a wand, and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it.\u201d (By the way, if enough of you post your videos saying that on youtube, we\u2019ll add a cool extra for every backer. More info on that when we reveal stretch goals!)\nKickstarter is the best way to get that wand into your hands. The best way to ensure that Harvey the Ghost Janitor has students to assist for the next hundred years. It allows us to build the wizarding community, a great game, and DFTBA Games all at the same time.\nOh yeah. So glad you asked that. You didn\u2019t really think that we were just a one-and-done kinda company? We\u2019re planning on creating a bunch of of fun games, not just this one. \nOur second game, Created by Robert Burke, is called ROLF! It's a party game for only you and your quick-witted, intelligent friends. This fast-paced improvisational card game has everyone come up with new endings to classical phrases. The quickest and best wins. That\u2019s it. Super simple, but ridiculously fun.\nWe've got a third game in development as well, a more classical board-game style adventure that takes place in ancient Rome. But that's a ways in the future.\nI mean, we don't want to brag but between us we've created seven business, two online stores, and a dozen successful games (OK...all of the games were Eric's.) We've manufactured nearly everything you could think to print (including, of course, games). Basically, we bring a lot of experience to this project and are very confident we know how to design, print, and distribute this game for you. \nAs proof, I will now distribute a bunny to you:\n(\\(\\ \n( - -)\n((') (')", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done everything in our power to minimize the risks to our wonderful Kickstarter backers.

Not all of them will be in this first documentary: here's a list of who will surely be in.\nIn strict alphabetical order\u2026\nAllan \u201cAl\u201d Alcorn. Is a pioneering engineer and computer scientist. Alcorn was the designer of the video arcade game Pong, creating it under the direction of Bushnell and Dabney. Pong was a hit in the 1970s.

After first acting as the principal engineer on the Commodore Plus/4, C16/116, C264, and C364 machines, Herd designed the significantly more successful Commodore 128, a dual-CPU, triple-OS, compatible successor to the Commodore 64. Prior to the C128, Herd had done the initial architecture of the Commodore LCD computer, which was not released.\nBil Herd\nRaymond E. Kassar. Was president, and later CEO, of Atari Inc. from 1978 to 1983. He had previously been vice-president of Burlington Industries, a textile company. During the Kassar years, Atari Inc.\u2019s sales grew from $75 million in 1977 to over $2.2 billion just three years later. In December 1982, Kassar had sold 5,000 shares of stock in Warner Communications only 23 minutes before a much lower than expected fourth quarter earnings report would cause Warner stock to drop nearly 40% in value in the following days. In July 1983, Kassar was forced to resign from Atari Inc. over mounting allegations of illegal insider trading activity of which he was later completely acquitted.\nAl Lowe. Is a musician and game designer/programmer who developed several adventure games, mostly for Sierra On-Line. He decided to teach himself programming and in 1982 he created three games for the Apple II. Sierra bought these games in 1983 and Al worked for them as a game designer for 16 years.

He is the founder of software house Llamasoft. There are a number of distinctive elements common to his games. They are often arcade style shoot \u2018em ups. They often contain titular and/or in-game references demonstrating his fondness of ruminants (llamas, sheep, camels, etc.). Many of his programs also feature something of a psychedelic element.\nJeff \"Yak\" Minter\nCharles Ingerham \u201cChuck\u201d Peddle. Is an electrical engineer best known as the main designer of the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor; the KIM-1 SBC; and its successor the Commodore PET personal computer. The 6502, developed in 1976, was used in many commercial products, including the Apple I and II, Commodore VIC-20 and 64, Nintendo NES, Atari 8-bit computers, BBC Micro from Acorn Computers and several coin-op video games of the Golden Age.\nChuck Peddle\nJohn Roach. Former executive at Tandy Corporation responsible for the lunch and success of the TRS 80 microcomputer series\nDavid Rolfe. Is a computer programmer who was instrumental in the development of many \u201cgolden age\u201d arcade and home video games.

Was the managing director of Sinclair Research Ltd, and one of the company\u2019s longest-serving employees. In 1977, with Sinclair in financial trouble, Searle left the company. He rejoined in 1979 when Sir Clive Sinclair formed Sinclair Research, successfully promoting the ZX80 and ZX81 personal computers in the US. In spring 1982, he moved to the United Kingdom as Sinclair\u2019s managing director\nMichael S. Tomczyk. Is best known for his role in the development and marketing of the Commodore VIC-20, the first microcomputer to sell one million units. In early 1980, Tomczyk joined Commodore as Marketing Strategist and Assistant to the President (Commodore founder Jack Tramiel). When Tramiel announced that he wanted to develop a low cost affordable home computer \u201cfor the masses, not the classes,\u201d Tomczyk embraced the concept and aggressively championed the new computer, insisting that it be \u201cuser friendly.\u201d\nJack Tramiel. Was a Polish-born American businessman, best known for founding Commodore International, the manufacturer of the Commodore PET, VIC-20, 64, 128, Amiga, and other. The Commodore VIC-20 was the first microcomputer to sell one million units. The Commodore 64 sold several million units. It was during this time period that Tramiel coined the famous phrase, \u201cWe need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.\u201d\nJack Tramiel\nLeonard Tramiel. Jack Tramiel son and long time business partner and executive at Commodore and Atari.\nLeonard Tramiel\nStephan Gary \u201cWoz\u201d Wozniak. Is the computer engineer and programmer who founded Apple Computer with Steve Jobs. Wozniak created the Apple I computer and the Apple II computer, which contributed significantly to the microcomputer revolution of that era. In February 1981, Wozniak was injured in a private plane crash. In 1983 he returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.\nSteve \"Woz\" Wozniak", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is no risk: all interviews and additional footage are already shot. \nWe just need to pack everything in an awesome documentary!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Close to the end of our third campaign!", "update_content": "In less than two weeks the campaign for our latest documentary will end.

In other words, we won\u2019t be able to do this project without the participation of Kickstarter backers.\nKickstarter gives a wide audience the chance to be a part of this project. We're inviting you to go behind the scenes and be a part of the process \u2013 from fundraising through conservation to display. All backers will receive regular updates on the process and can follow along each step of the way.\nNeil Armstrong's spacesuit \u2013 like most of the spacesuits in the Museum\u2019s collection \u2013 is currently being stored in a climate-controlled collections storage area that is not accessible to the public.\nYou may be surprised to learn that spacesuits are among the most fragile artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection. The Apollo suits were made to take astronauts to the Moon and back safely -- not to last hundreds of years in a museum.\nTo provide public display and access, Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit requires conservation to stop current deterioration and a state-of-the-art display case that will mimic the climate-controlled environment where it is currently being safeguarded.\nMoving the draped spacesuits into climate-controlled collections storage.\nLisa Young works on Neil Armstrong's spacesuit in the Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory.\nWill the suit look dramatically different when the project is complete? Not to the naked eye. Conservation is the process of documenting, stabilizing and protecting an artifact, not modifying it to make it \u201clike new.\u201d\nSo why does it take so long? We\u2019re allowing plenty of time to get this right.The research and documentation we do now will literally write the book on the proper techniques for spacesuit conservation for every suit in our collection. Along the way, we\u2019ll be consulting with those who contributed to making the suit and its materials, those who cared for it during the Apollo program, and materials experts throughout the world. Research, meetings, and mastering new techniques take time.\nAs we complete this research, we\u2019ll be using state-of-the-art techniques in 3D scanning, photogrammetry, chemical analysis, CT scanning, and other means available to create a detailed map of the suit that will document its condition in the most complete way possible. This work will inform a condition assessment that will help us create the appropriate environment for public display while preserving the suit in its current condition.\nDigitization team working with Abraham Lincoln's life mask\n3D scanning the Armstrong spacesuit gives us the chance to put the suit directly into your hands. With a 3D scan of the suit, you can take a self-guided tour and explore the functions of each of the suit\u2019s 21 layers (check out 3D models of other iconic Smithsonian collection objects). You can make a 3D print of Armstrong\u2019s glove and slip it over your hand. Teachers will have a dynamic new tool for talking about the technology required for living and working in space. 3D scanning also ensures that our conservators and curators have an accurate picture of the suit in its current condition, helping to monitor and preserve the suit and protect it from further deterioration.\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s Digitization team is doing work that will revolutionize the way we interact with and learn from the artifacts in our collection. The team has already scanned a number of the Smithsonian\u2019s iconic artifacts, from the Wright Flyer to the Bell X-1, and is currently in the planning stages to scan the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia. Check out this clip from \u201cCBS Saturday Morning\u201d to see how the team digitizes everything from the Spirit of St. Louis to a sitting American president.\nTake a look at our list of rewards to learn how you can get priority access to 3D scans and 3D prints of the suit!\nThe suit will be put on display at the Museum in Washington, DC, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in 2019. The suit will eventually be permanently displayed as a centerpiece in the future Destination Moon exhibition, a completely redesigned and updated gallery that will bring the exciting story of lunar exploration to a new generation.\nIn addition to the Armstrong spacesuit, Destination Moon will feature several other significant artifacts, including a huge Moon mural painted by the famous space artist Chesley Bonestell in 1957, the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule in which Alan Shepard became the first American in space, the Gemini 7 spacecraft, the giant F-1 rocket engine, the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, parts of the Apollo Mission Simulator, and many small artifacts. The exhibition will also display the Ranger, Surveyor, and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft currently hanging elsewhere in the Museum, and at least one other robotic spacecraft from a more recent mission.\nEarly rendering of Armstrong suit display in \"Destination Moon\" gallery\nThe Apollo 11 Moon landing was one of the single greatest achievements in the history of humankind. Bringing Armstrong's spacesuit back not only helps honor the accomplishments of a generation who brought us from Earth to the Moon in less than nine years, it also inspires the next generation of bold space explorers.\nThe suit is a part of our cultural heritage, and safeguarding it recognizes its importance in telling the story of a remarkable accomplishment. And because it is the real thing, seeing the suit provides a tangible way of touching history.\nAstronaut Neil A.

It operates two landmark facilities that, together, welcome more than eight million visitors a year, making it the most visited museum in the country. It also is home to the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies.\nThe Museum's two buildings house thousands of artifacts showcased in exhibitions on aviation, space exploration, and planetary science. At both of its locations, the Museum presents programs, educational activities, lectures, and performances that reflect the American spirit, and the innovation, courage, and optimism that have led to triumphs in the history, science, and technology of flight. At the Museum in the nation's capital, which opened in 1976 and is located in the heart of the Smithsonian complex in Washington, DC, some of the most awe-inspiring icons of flight are on display. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, located near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, is a massive structure with open, hangar-like settings that accommodate large aircraft and spacecraft, as well as entire collections of aviation and space artifacts.\nSome of the Smithsonian project team with Armstrong's suit.\nFINE PRINT:\nThe Smithsonian is using Kickstarter, a third-party online funding platform.

But we want to do more than keep the spacesuit safe \u2014 we want to display it for all to see. The only risk we have is not meeting our deadline to have it conserved, digitized, and on display in time for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing.

It was made in real time, in an apartment kitchen and backyard garden, between the winter of 2014 and the summer of 2015.\nThis book is a collaboration between cook/writer Andrew Barton, photographer Peter Schweitzer, and stylist Kate Schweitzer\u2013  all from SECRET RESTAURANT PORTLAND.\nThe name MYRTLEWOOD comes from this beautiful tree, a lauraceae, a member of the laurel family and an evergreen, a native only to Oregon and northern California. The town nearest where it first appears is a place Andrew spent many childhood summer weekends. Many of the bowls and plates used in this book are fashioned from myrtlewood, which is fitting with our vision to focus on locally sourced ingredients and products.\nCOOKBOOK CONTENT:\nThe recipes inside these pages are influenced by both the local and worldwide food landscape. Andrew is a self-taught cook, garnering influence from his cultural/family heritage, from the practice of running an underground supper club, from traveling with a fork in hand, and from extensively reading classic food writers (Elizabeth David, MFK Fischer) and current visionaries (Nigel Slater, Chad Robertson). \nWe have sourced from Andrew's home garden throughout the project, also using ingredients gifted by friends who work on farms, buying from farmer's markets, and by foraging in nearby forests.\nAt the same time we have really tried to \"keep it real,\" not only by shooting in a lived-in, shared dwelling, but also by using a vast array of ingredients available in everyone's local grocery store. The ingredients for Myrtlewood were purchased on a small budget (Andrew works at a nonprofit preschool) and each recipe was created with accessibility in mind. We want these meals to be affordable for everyone and attainable with any skill set. We hope to have been quite instructional in the writing, so that anyone can pick up new techniques or really discover cooking through it.\nAll this work was done in and around Andrew's home kitchen. The writing was done in notebooks and a trusty laptop, usually in moments before or after school, or late at night by lamplight. The recipes were sent to friends around the country for testing.\nThe highlight of each shoot, for all of us, was enjoying the meal after it'd been cooked and documented. Usually it was three of us, sometimes just the two, but often a few other friends too. The creation of the book felt collaborative in every sense.\nYou can get a taste of our recipes on our instagram @myrtlewoodpnw\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nOur independence has driven this project from the beginning. We began with the idea \"hey! we should shoot a cookbook.\" and here we are, fifty photo shoots and hundreds of recipes later, ready to share our project with you. We deeply value our current community, and Kickstarter allows us to continue to expand our community. We want the completion of this book to be a personal process, as it is our passion. Rather than handing it off to a publisher and hoping for the best, we will be seeing it through all stages. We will even be the ones packaging it up and sending it to you this winter. \nClick to view sample spreads\nView our Press Kit here\nTHE BOOK ITSELF: \nWe are working with a local Portland print shop located quite literally down the street from Andrew's house. They have printed several of our projects in the past (and projects of good friends). It feels great to be placing our book into trusted hands. Being so close to the printer allows us the opportunity to be actively engaged with production of our book, eliminating all the middlemen normally present in the author / designer / publisher / printer relationship. \nWe look forward to walking down through the tree lined neighborhood to see the first test print, just because we can. \nThe book will be 8.5\" x 11\", approximately 200 pages in length, on Cougar Opaque Natural finish paper, perfect bound, with a heavyweight matte finish cover.\nOur goal is to produce a first-edition of 1000 copies. All funds raised will go toward production costs for Myrtlewood. \nClick to view larger image\nDONATIONS & REWARDS:\nIf you are interested in showing your support, you can donate any amount, at any time!\nFor each $35, you are rewarded a copy of the book.

No tools except a huge chef\u2019s knife and a wooden spatula.\n\u2022 A seafood market on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, with all my best friends from college, where we had appetizers on a bench outside (cups of lobster bisque, stuffed clams, clam chowder, smoked bluefish pate and crackers), then took home (to a beautiful converted barn) a couple pounds of local fish and 18 oysters. The boys shucked oysters while I cooked up a feast from the fish, while good records spun and good beers were sipped.\n\u2022 A beautiful meal I cooked on the last night in Maine: squid ink pasta with Maine clams, Maine halibut, and garlic butter. With a little gem lettuce finger salad on the table. \u2022 Testing my love of sardines while on a 4 day train trip across the country.

Now we need your help to create a fun and accessible HTML/CSS course!\nA lot of us got started in tech by making our first website on Geocities. Sadly, Geocities was shut down six years ago and it left a big void. The remaining web hosts tend to be tailored for business use. What about people who want to learn, be creative, and have their own personal space on the web?\nThat\u2019s why we built Neocities. We\u2019ve been hard at work for two years to provide free web space for everyone, with no ads, a modern HTML editing platform, and a welcoming design, plus social features that make Neocities a community and not just a web host. We\u2019re already hosting over 47,000 sites. In our commitment to transparency in our work, our entire website is open source, and anyone is welcome to inspect our public workflow, fix bugs, or send feature enhancements.\nNow we want to take it to the next level. We\u2019ve been hearing from educators all over the world who are using Neocities to teach students HTML, and we're really excited about what they're doing because tech literacy is an increasingly important and empowering skill. We want to expand on that idea by building a free educational platform for HTML and CSS, giving everyone in the world the opportunity to learn to code for the first time.\nThat's our main goal. But if this campaign goes well, we have some other ambitious projects that we want to take on too. We want to make our sites load faster, and have more free space. And we want to create a video documentary on the history of Geocities and the free website movement. With your support, we can make this all happen.\nWe want to build an interactive, illustrated HTML and CSS course that will interact seamlessly with Neocities, our free web hosting service and community.\nOur course will have a comic book narrative, interactive lessons, and a preview of one's work that will be automatically accessible as a website on Neocities. Social features and badges will help keep new learners motivated. Unlike the professional-level courses currently available, our focus will be on fun, creativity, and personalization \u2014 you won't just be building some example site, you'll be crafting your own personal spot on the web!\nLike the rest of Neocities, our educational platform will be free and open source, with no ads.\nTutorial mockup\nIn addition to making Neocities an excellent learning platform, we're looking to improve the Neocities serving infrastructure. What we have now has proven to be reliable and cost-sustainable. But we want to make it better by integrating the latest tech to provide a world-class geographic CDN (Content Delivery Network) for all sites so that they can load faster, provide advanced security features like SSL support, and provide even more hosting space than we do today.\nThere have been some major recent advances in data storage tech (IPFS and SeaweedFS), and we want to use this tech to build Neocities into a state-of-the-art web host. But in order to do so, we need your help to put down an initial investment in server hardware so that we can run them. Doing so will not only make sites load faster, but will increase the amount of space we can provide.\nSince we launched, we've met a lot of people who worked on Geocities before it shut down. They're an amazing, incredibly talented bunch with really interesting backgrounds. We've been wanting to make a documentary that tells their stories, but we've lacked the budget necessary to give it the attention and polish it would deserve.\nIn order to do this, we'll need funds to travel to where the key people in website creation live and interview them. We already have most of the equipment needed (including the camera we used to film the Kickstarter video)\u2014the main missing piece is a professional-level microphone.\nWho's behind Neocities?\nThere are only two people working on Neocities right now: Victoria Wang and Kyle Drake. By structuring Neocities carefully, we've made it so that we can run it on a tight budget, which has allowed us to operate without having to worry about investment. This is a good thing, because it has given us the power to say no to things like mandatory advertising on sites, and ensure our users' privacy. But at the same time, it means that it's harder for us to get funding to work on Neocities. Neocities receives a small amount of money from supporters, but it's not enough for us to work on the site full-time.\nWe're hoping that not only will this campaign give us enough income this year to build the new education platform and increase our backend capabilities, but that it will also allow us to work on the site full-time, so we can give it the attention it deserves.\nStretch Goals\n$10,000 - More chapters of course: CSS\nOur beginner course will be for learning HTML with some basic CSS, but if we hit this stretch goal, we'll be able to extend the course to cover much more CSS and all the creative things that can be done with it. CSS allows users to change every aspect of a page's layout and design and allows them to create a website that is truly their own.\n$20,000 - More chapters of course: Beginner JavaScript\nCombined with tools like Node.js, JavaScript has become a very powerful programming language for web developers. Not only can you make amazing things in a browser, you can use the same language to build the backend. We'll be using the latest standards from the tech community to build a friendly introduction to JavaScript for our online course.\n$30,000 - Neocities Infrastructure Upgrade\nWe want to make a faster and much more reliable version of Neocities that will stay online even if some of our servers go down. The biggest expense is the extra servers needed to add redundancy. If we hit this goal, we'll be able to purchase these servers and work to improve Neocities' infrastructure, improving the uptime and loading speed of both the main Neocities site (including the HTML course) and all member sites.\n$40,000 - Documentary on the History of Geocities and Free Web Sites\nWe want to make a documentary on the history of the creative web \u2014 one that covers all the key people that helped to make it happen, and tells their stories. If we hit this goal, it will give us a budget necessary to film this documentary.\n$50,000 - Neocities Goes Gigabyte\nOne gigabyte is a big milestone for a lot of technologies. We remember when Google Mail launched offering this, and it was a major improvement to most of the mail hosting available at the time.\nNow, we want to do the same for Neocities, and set that same milestone.\nIf we hit this goal, we have the investment needed to upgrade our backend infrastructure to support a lot more free web space. If we hit this milestone, we will be able to give 1 gigabyte of free hosting, a 10x increase from what we can provide now!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll software projects come with unforeseen setbacks, but we're committed to overcoming them. We've already been working on Neocities for two years, bootstrapping the project and completing many difficult tasks. Also, we've each been doing web development or design on various projects for over a decade.\n\nBuilding an effective educational site will be a challenge. However, we've been in contact with educators who are using Neocities to teach website building to students, and we'll be working with them closely as we develop the course. We'll be testing the course with people of all ages to ensure we're on the right track.\n\nAs for Neocities itself, we've built the site to be robust and cost-effective to run, but it's a major undertaking and problems do arise from time to time. We might have to temporarily halt progress on building the course if a problem arises that we need to prioritize in order to keep the site running smoothly.\n\nThe biggest risk to Neocities is lack of funding. We've been working on a tiny budget, and it restricts the amount of time we can spend full-time on Neocities. We want to work on Neocities full-time and keep it running for many years \u2014 your support will allow us to make this happen!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Chapter One complete", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Chapter One beta", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

And your neck? Probably not too great. Or you\u2019re already in so much pain that someone sent you here (hugs). BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain.\nHighlights\nBetterBack makes every chair ergonomic \u2013 Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one chair, you can make every chair ergonomic. Lightweight and portable, you can throw BetterBack in your purse or backpack.\nNext gen back support \u2013  The keystone to good posture is the pelvis. Traditional back supports only focus on your lumbar spine. BetterBack stabilizes your pelvis, restoring your spine's natural curvature, and provides lumbar support. \n15 minutes a day \u2013 Like dumbbells at a gym, BetterBack helps you build up your posture muscles. Wear it for as little as 15 minutes a day to achieve great posture when you stand or sit on your own.\n                                      BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain. Even if you don\u2019t have back pain, wearing it for just 15 minutes a day can retrain your default posture, so when you stand or sit without BetterBack, your posture is greatly improved. Good posture boosts your mood, confidence, motivation and overall health. \nTake a few seconds to re-posture yourself right now. If you\u2019re sitting, chances are your back isn\u2019t touching your chair at all. That\u2019s because most chairs aren\u2019t ergonomic, and many actually encourage bad posture. BetterBack makes every chair ergonomic. Sit effortlessly in perfect posture at your desk. Or on a plane. Or at a game. You get the idea.\nYou get fast results and long term comfort. Put BetterBack on in 5 seconds flat!\n                                    Sit in perfect posture for minutes or hours. We took sizing into account from the 1 percentile woman all the way up to the 99 percentile man, so BetterBack can be adjusted to fit just about every body.\nImagine going to 50 of the best doctors, therapists and trainers around the world and asking them for their #1 posture tip. Well we did, and we put them together into an eBook for you.\nOr get the Better Posture eBook FOR FREE!\nIf you\u2019re not in a place to financially contribute to our campaign, we still care about your posture and your health!

Please note that if you live outside of those regions, you may be responsible for local duties, fees and taxes.\nA few years ago, in the lovely year of 2012, I was the co-founder of a startup, Everest, that was building technology to help people live their dreams and achieve personal goals. I was mostly in front of a computer 12+ hours a day, but we also put on the Dream Series, which were meaningful events to help kickstart people's dreams. A few hours after an amazing obstacle course run through Golden Gate Park, my sciatica pain began. The pain and discomfort made it hard to concentrate, do great work and enjoy life.\nPost-race wearing the trophy (the Golden Shoes) a few hours before sciatica pain would forever change my life. #NotWorthIt\nI tried dozens of products, therapies and techniques to help with my back pain. Many of them had great features, but weren't full solutions for me. The Neo G Posture Brace: helped with alignment, but it was difficult to breathe and really bulky under my clothes; Easy Posture Lumbar Support: I still managed to wiggle and slump in my chair, and it only helped when I sat at my desk; the Nada Chair: brilliant knee form and pelvic stabilization, but gave me knee pain after just a few minutes of wear; LF Ultrasound: provided short-term pain relief, but it was fleeting; Memory Foam Knee Pillow: provided better alignment when I started sleep, but would end up in the bottom of my bed; and on and on.\nA friend and I spent weeks tinkering with anything we could find to help get back support. There are still taped together take-out soup containers for lumbar support floating around my apartment. The first version of the BetterBack knees? A cut out from the top of a mega-sized protein bottle. \nMaking the latest knee prototypes. So many iterations in between!\nI had no idea how many people were suffering from back pain when this all began. I felt way too young to have back pain, personally. Friends or colleagues would see me wearing the early versions of BetterBack and ask to try it. As soon as they did, I would get messages all the time: \"Oh hey, I'm flying to New York on Tuesday, any chance I can borrow that thing you wear?\" Or \"My back is acting up, any chance I can just borrow it until Friday?\" I had no idea so many people were suffering. I began to do more research and was blown away by what I found.  I decided to make more -- and invest time and money into making it better. \nSix prototypes later, I began working with manufacturers to build a high quality, well crafted and incredibly comfortable posture strap I would be proud to see my mom wear. And your mom too, if she doesn't have an awesome back.\nI'm on Kickstarter for two reasons. One, I'm hoping 500 people will pledge so I can hit the minimum order quantity and produce the very first run of BetterBacks. Even more importantly, I'm hoping to find people who will go on the journey with me to get a better back. I want to hear your story, what has worked and hasn't worked for you in the past, understand how BetterBack helps you and how it can help you better.  Please join me.\nGood posture affects your health, your mood and your motivation. Most people only begin to understand the importance of posture after their body is so damaged from slumping that sitting aches become chronic pain. I know because I am one of them.\nMy mission is to help people be their best selves and unlock their full potential. Without health, that is impossible; it is the foundation for everything else.\nI have spent the last few years learning about back pain, trying a huge range of products and therapies, and developing BetterBack with dozens on dozens of bad backs and amazing souls.\nThe relief and support people feel while wearing BetterBack\u2014and even after\u2014is truly amazing. No matter how many times or tools you\u2019ve tried to sit pain free, BetterBack is like posture training wheels so you can experience and integrate good posture into your life for good.\nI have self funded the design, development and sampling for BetterBack. Our final prototype has been well tested and our manufacturers are ready to go. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, packaging and shipping. \nBetterBack was my first Kickstarter campaign. It has been some of the most amazing and challenging few weeks of my life. If you are thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign, I encourage you to take the leap and go for it. You will connect with the most incredible global community of supporters and get to bring a part of yourself to life. I wanted to share some of the amazingly talented people who contributed to my campaign; maybe one day they will help you with your campaign too.\nIndustrial Design // I had the chance to work with three amazing industrial designers on the development of BetterBack.\nAndy Storms is a softgoods and SolidWorks pro. Smart, thoughtful and a joy to work with. Reach him at andy@neverago.com\nJosh Guyot is the go-to guy for innovative product design and custom parts.

He is also a super talented designer. Check him out at instagram.com/julianbialowas\nMarketing // I had an extensive marketing plan developed before I launched my Kickstarter campaign and will be writing about what worked and what didn't on my website katherinekrug.com. The soma creators have a great post and Stonemaier Games has a series of helpful posts on KS marketing.\nI wasn't expecting so many marketing companies to reach out after I launched my campaign (be ready for it!) and I decided to try out a handful of them. By far these were the best:\nFunded Today - These guys brought a wealth of experience and expertise to my campaign. I just wish I had known about them earlier.  I'm certain I would not have reached $1M without their help. Find them at http://bit.ly/1EMP9eC\nBackerClub - These guys have a strong community of engaged Kickstarter backers and a fun rewards club. BackerClub.co \nSpecial thanks to Dr. Ryan Lawlor for his tremendous help (www.drlawlor.com), Ramon and Renato for helping me test new marketing channels (GrowthHack.com.br), Josh Krigman as a hugely talented writer (joshkrigman.com), Collin Hughes for photography in my video (http://collin-hughes.com/), and Jonathan Swanson, Pam Krug and Peter Dering for their endless support. \nBear hug to every single one of the backers who supported bringing BetterBack to life! \nVisit us at www.getbetterback.com\nHow much should I wear it?\nSit in perfect posture for minutes or hours. It is comfortable to wear all day long, but even 15 minutes a day can greatly improve the quality of your life.\nWill I look stupid wearing it?\nIt's hard to believe, but most people don't even notice when you're wearing it. I sit through meals, meetings and flights with BetterBack on and it's only when I'm taking it off that people tend to notice it, with a \"you've been wearing that this whole time?!!\" The thing that tends to happen next is someone shares their story of back pain and asks to try it on. \nHow comfortable are the knee straps?\nI have absolutely terrible knees (at one point I was put in two leg casts because of feet and knee injuries, later having surgery on my right knee). We spent a lot of time designing the knee cushions so that the force was widely distributed and comfortable for people who have knee problems *and* back problems.\nCan I wear BetterBack while I drive?\nUnfortunately, no. BetterBack is not safe to wear driving, or when you need quick leg mobility. It is great for sitting at your desk, eating, meeting, going to a movie, sitting on an airplane, meditating, etc. Note: you can wear BetterBack cross-legged! \nHow is this different than the Nada Chair?\nLet me start by pouring heaps of praise and adoration on Dr. Toso who came up the knee form to help people with their posture. I have tried the Nada Chair and while I loved the stabilization it offered, it unfortunately hurt my knees very badly to wear after just a few minutes. It wasn\u2019t a solution for me as a result.\nBetterBack uses the same knee form as the Nada Chair, but the design and construction of the knee pads, back support and straps are new, incorporating six rounds of prototyping with two amazing Industrial Designers and the feedback of 62 wonderful backs who beta tested it last year and this year. Here are some of the ways BetterBack is different:\nKnees, knees, knees!\nWe use PE (polyethylene) to disperse force and foam to provide cushiony comfort on the knees, so even people with bad knees can wear BetterBack. Because of backer support, everyone\u2019s knee pads will now include thicker compression molded foam for even more durability and comfort. :)\nBack pad\nBetterBack is worn outside of clothing, but it can still get hot on an airplane, at a game or when things heat up at work. BetterBack combines a perforated foam and spacer mesh for maximum back breathability, without sacrificing lumbar support.\nStraps & Adjustability\nStrap adjusters are placed where your hands naturally rest, for easy tightening and loosening. Quick slip keepers keep the straps flush against BetterBack for a clean and minimalist look.\nUsability\nWe\u2019ve developed two ways to make sure people can put BetterBack on quickly and correctly. The first is using a poly cotton fabric for the outside materials and a spacer mesh for the inside materials that touch your body. On inside surfaces, we\u2019ve also included easy to read icons so you know exactly which way is up without any guessing.\nMaterials\nWe want people to feel good and confident wearing BetterBack, so we\u2019ve sourced high quality, durable materials similar to what you\u2019d find in fashion, rather than in the medical section.\nThis all started in my kitchen, trying to make something to help me with my excruciating sciatica pain. My friends and people I\u2019d meet all around San Francisco turned out to need it too. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be such a success on Kickstarter! I believe Dr. Toso was a visionary and I hope to see much more attention and innovation on the knee form/pelvis stabilization in the years to come, just as innovation on lumbar support products mean people looking can find something just right for them.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have extensive manufacturing and operational experience (I used to manufacture interiors to large condominium buildings and hotels), plus two manufacturers capable of delivering BetterBack. One thing I know for sure: something unexpected always comes up. I\u2019ve buffered my timeline to account for unexpected curveballs that may impact the schedule, so I can deliver BetterBack to you on time. These things could also impact the delivery schedule:\n\nVolume - sometimes Kickstarter campaigns wildly exceed a project creator\u2019s expectation. If we hit huge volume, it may push the timeline back, likely to the tune of 14 days. \n\nReally awesome ideas - I know I will receive some amazing ideas and insights from the Kickstarter community. I don't want to lose out on the ability to deliver you a superior product, if it can be reasonably done.\n\nFreight - Port closures and customs delays happen. It\u2019s impossible to know when and for how long. The buffer calculated into the timeline should cover this, but it is an unknown.\n\nMy goal is to deliver the highest quality, most effective posture strap on the market. I will work my back off for you and deliver transparency all the way through. Feel free to reach out to me personally anytime you have a thought, idea or a question at kk@getbetterback.com.\n\nLast but not least: any pledge amount brings us closer to our goal -- both of hitting our first production run and of building awareness around good posture.

For iOS users, voice replies are currently limited to Gmail notifications.

For those who are backing Pebble on Kickstarter for the second time - thank you! Your Pebble Time watch will be engraved with something extra special.\nWe've been making smartwatches for almost 7 years now. Our ultimate goal is to make Pebble an indispensable tool in your daily life by helping you accomplish more each and every day. \nWhile developing software for the original Pebble, we uncovered an important problem: apps are an inefficient way to interact with a smartwatch. As we increased functionality by adding more apps, our Pebbles clogged up. It became harder to quickly find the app we wanted. No one wants to manage another homescreen!\nTo make Pebble infinitely more useful, we needed an expandable system for organizing information and interactions. Luckily, the answer was right up our sleeves.\nIt turns out the best interface for any watch...is time!\nPLAY\n\nYou already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle. Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps.\nWith one click, see what\u2019s coming up next. Your timeline connects to calendars, alarms, and apps, organizing all kinds of relevant information along with quick actions. Similarly, recall the past. Scroll back in time to see that email you missed, your step count for the day or the score from the game last night. \nYour timeline takes an incredible amount of information and makes it super easy to access. \nThis is the new app menu, featuring new app faces with glanceable content. With timeline we've also created a system that dynamically loads and caches apps as needed, letting you access as many apps as you need.\nAs with all Pebble software, we\u2019ve built an open platform. You can allow apps and developers to add \u2018pins\u2019 to your timeline, so you can keep track of things like upcoming events, sports, weather, traffic, travel plans, pizza specials and more.\nThe Pebble operating system has been re-imagined with a new visual style. While all existing Pebble apps will still work great, we\u2019re inviting developers to upgrade their apps to support color. More details coming soon!\nSimplicity and focus, without compromise\nWe\u2019ve added all these new features - color screen, microphone, slimmer design and timeline - without compromising what you love most about Pebble:\nAlways-on, daylight readable screen with a great backlight\nUp to 7 day battery life (Time Steel battery life is up to 10 days)\nUse any standard 22mm watch band\nWater resistant and durable \nTactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking \nSilent vibrating alarms\nStep tracking with Misfit and Jawbone\nLanguage and international character support (Chinese coming soon!)\nTimeline will work on Pebble and Pebble Steel (exact date TBD)\nWorks with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above\nWorks with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more\nIf you\u2019re already part of our community of backers, developers and, early adopters, that\u2019s fantastic! If not, we invite you to join those who have supported and guided our journey so far. It's pretty straightforward, just back this project!\nWe pledge to do the absolute best we can at creating amazing products and supporting them for as long as possible. We\u2019ve gone out of our way to develop new features, release software updates and provide technical support for all Pebble owners. Check out our Amazon reviews or our Twitter's @Pebble and @PebbleHelp to get a taste.\nDeveloper community\nSince the first Kickstarter campaign, developers have been an integral part of the Pebble community. We are very proud of the 26,000+ developers who have created over 6,500 apps and watchfaces for Pebble.\nPebble Time greatly expands possibilities for wearable apps, building on top of the existing Pebble SDK and tools:\nRich C SDK for apps and watchfaces running natively on the watch, even when the phone is disconnected\nBest in class online development environment: www.cloudpebble.net\nNew emulator that can be used on CloudPebble or locally\nRich set of APIs: accelerometer, compass, bluetooth messaging, background tasks, GPS and HTTP request, etc\n(NEW) Color APIs to support the 64 colors of the new Pebble Time screen\n(NEW) Support for PNG and APNG\n(NEW) Timeline APIs to push information from the web into the user\u2019s timeline (no watch or phone apps required)\n(NEW) UI framework to create beautiful applications that take advantage of color and animations\n(Later in 2015) Voice to text APIs: add voice recognition to your apps\n(Later in 2015) Smart accessory port for hardware hackers.\n(Later in 2015) Bluetooth Low Energy API. Use Pebble to control BLE-enabled objects. \nAll existing Pebble apps are compatible with Pebble Time and apps built with the new SDK are compatible with both platforms. We will reveal more information about the new APIs during the campaign. Stay tuned!\nTime for one last plug: we're hiring!\nOver the years, we've hired a bunch of folks from our community and are looking to hire more!

CLICK HERE for the answer.\nAlmost eight years after his death, KURT VONNEGUT  remains one of the most popular literary figures of the 20th and 21st Centuries. Readers from one generation to the next, the world over, continue to find their lives transformed by his comic and cosmic insights, on display in such bestselling books as Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast of Champions, Mother Night, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, and on and on. Amazingly, all of Vonnegut's works remain in print, and his popularity shows no sign of waning. Yet to-date, there has been no definitive film documentary covering his extraordinary life and work. ROBERT WEIDE has been trying to correct that oversight for 33 years. In 2015, with your help, it will finally happen.\nHOW IT STARTED\nIn 1982, a young filmmaker wrote a letter to his literary idol, proposing a documentary on the author's life and work. Kurt Vonnegut (then 60) soon met with Robert Weide (22) and authorized the production. Weide thought it would take a few months to raise the needed financing, and figured a film could be completed within the year. That was 33 years ago.\nWeide (r) interviews Vonnegut in front of the author's boyhood home in Indianapolis, Indiana. 1994. \u00a9Whyaduck Productions/ C. Minnick\nFilming on the documentary finally commenced in 1988 and continued, on-and-off, through the years, taking the pair to several locations, including Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis (where the author reminisced through his boyhood homes, his grade school, his high school, and many landmarks of his youth), Iowa City, where Vonnegut taught at the famous Writer's Workshop in the mid-60's, and Buffalo, New York, where Vonnegut would attend the world premiere performance of a humanist Requiem he had authored.  Weide's camera would follow the author to his 60th high school reunion, to several public speaking engagements, and on a promotional tour for his final novel, \"Timequake.\"\nWeide and Vonnegut on the shores of Lake Maxincuckee in Culver, IN. 1994. (Inscription by Vonnegut.) \u00a9Whyaduck Productions/ C. Minnick\nAN UNEXPECTED FRIENDSHIP\nAs the years rolled by, something unexpected happened -- filmmaker and subject would become close friends. The upside to this was that Vonnegut would open up to Weide about his life and work in a personal way never before captured on camera. The downside was Weide's concern that he might be jeopardizing the \"journalistic integrity\" of the film. Despite his uncertainty, Weide kept filming Vonnegut (and principal people in his life) until shortly before the author's death in 2007.\nAfter Vonnegut's passing, Weide faced big questions about how to continue with the project. What started out as a conventional documentary about an author, had now become a highly personal experience that suddenly felt exploitative to release publicly. And the years kept ticking by. (Incredibly, in 2015, Weide is just five years short of Vonnegut's age when he first approached the author.) Finally, it was a Vonnegut intimate, close to the project, who suggested full disclosure, citing that the evolving friendship between author and fan should be folded into the film -- in the same way that Vonnegut often interacts with characters in his own fictional narratives. This suggestion provided the incentive for Weide to dig out the old footage (dozens of hours of it), and carry on. Meanwhile, documentary filmmaker DON ARGOTT was recruited to document this new \"meta\" angle, while Weide carried on with Vonnegut's life story, as originally planned. Since Weide had already taken the film as far as he could on his own dime, it was now just a matter of financing.\nThat's where Kickstarter comes in.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nThis is the perfect way to express your appreciation for all the enriching hours you've spent reading Kurt Vonnegut's books. This is a project authorized by Vonnegut, and one he very much hoped to see come to fruition. A successful Kickstarter campaign will resuscitate these efforts and finally make the completed film a reality after 33 years. We'll hit the ground running with more filming -- primarily interviews (with Vonnegut's friends, colleagues, family members) and pertinent locations, then back to the editing room to edit dozens of hours of footage, hundreds of photographs, never-seen home movies, etc., into a polished production that will be a worthy homage to one of America's most beloved writers. How proud will you be to know you helped make it happen? Please consider how much you can contribute, look over our rewards, and become part of Vonnegut's karass!\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nRobert Weide wins his third Emmy Award.\nROBERT WEIDE is the recipient of an Academy Award nomination, as well as a Golden Globe award, and the prestigious Director's Guild of America (DGA) Award. He has been nominated for fourteen Emmy awards -- winning three times, for producing, directing, and editing, respectively. His documentary films include THE MARX BROS. IN A NUTSHELL, THE GREAT STANDUPS, W.C. FIELDS STRAIGHT UP, MORT SAHL: THE LOYAL OPPOSITION, the Oscar-nominated LENNY BRUCE: SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, and WOODY ALLEN: A DOCUMENTARY, an official selection of the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. His feature films include MOTHER NIGHT (writer/producer), based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel; HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS & ALIENATE PEOPLE (director), starring Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst, Jeff Bridges and Megan Fox; and last year's screen adaptation of THE GIVER (co-writer) starring Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep.\nRobert Weide & Larry David on the set of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\nIn 1999, Weide produced and directed the HBO comedy special, LARRY DAVID: CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, which served as the springboard for the long-running series staring Larry David, which Weide directed and executive produced.  Last year, Weide created, wrote and directed the British comedy/drama series MR. SLOANE for Sky Atlantic TV (UK) starring Nick Frost and Olivia Colman.\nDon Argott at work.\nDON ARGOTT\u2019s first feature documentary, ROCK SCHOOL, was an official selection at Sundance and SXSW in 2004. It would receive rave reviews and become a favorite on the festival circuit, prior to its theatrical release in 2005. TWO DAYS IN APRIL, which follows four college football players as they enter the NFL Draft, had its broadcast premiere on the Documentary Channel. THE ART OF THE STEAL, chronicling the long struggle for control over the $30 billion Barnes art collection, was named by Roger Ebert as one of the Best Documentaries of 2010. LAST DAYS HERE, acquired by IFC Films, tells the story of Bobby Liebling, lead singer of the cult heavy metal band Pentagram. Sequestered for decades in his parents\u2019 basement, Bobby\u2019s music is finally discovered by the heavy metal underground. This cult favorite portrays the unbelievable journey of a man at the crossroads of life and death.\nTHE ATOMIC STATES OF AMERICA, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. The film looks at the United States\u2019 long and troubling relationship with nuclear power. Argott\u2019s latest feature, AS THE PALACES BURN, set out to tell the story of the heavy metal band, Lamb of God. But during the filming process in 2012, the story took a dramatic turn, when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested on charges of manslaughter, blamed for the death of one of their young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching, Kafkaesque courtroom drama that had observers on the edge of their seats.\nArgott (L) and Weide flank their subject.\nLINKS\nVonnegutdoc.com\nKurt Vonnegut Docu Facebook Page\nSponsors & Contributors\nTwitter: @VonnegutDoc\nWhyaduck Productions Website (Weide)\n9.14 Pictures Website (Argott)\nREWARDS\nBecause of Robert Weide's long association with Kurt Vonnegut, we are able to offer some unique Vonnegut-centric rewards at all different pledge levels. Many of these items (some of them autographed by Vonnegut) are pulled directly from Weide's personal collection. Additional items have been donated by others in Vonnegut's \"karass\" (including his daughter) who are extremely supportive of this project. In many cases, these are rare items and opportunities that you will find nowhere else.\nWeide is also culling from his other productions. If you are a fan of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" or Weide's documentaries on Woody Allen or Lenny Bruce, there are collectibles here for you as well. Many of these items are offered in extremely limited quantities, so pledge early before you miss out!\nIf you\u2019re interested in a reward that\u2019s not designated as deliverable to your country, email us at info@vonnegutdoc.com, and tell us where you live. We\u2019ll investigate whether we can ship it to you, and send you an email response.\nIf you wish to receive two or more rewards that are not bundled together, simply pledge enough to cover the total number of rewards (including shipping), then include a message as to the specific rewards you desire.

Collectively, they have produced and/or directed a dozen documentary films, none of which have failed to find distribution or air as high-profile specials on PBS or HBO, resulting in Emmy awards, an Oscar nomination, and screenings at Cannes, Sundance, etc.There are distributors and broadcasters already eager to see the completed Vonnegut doc, so there is virtually no chance that the film would not find its way to the public.\n\nThe filmmakers are aiming for a completion date in late 2015. The only conceivable risk would be a delay in this date. It's possible that during the remaining production period, Weide or Argott could get called away for a short period of time to fulfill another work obligation. The most this would do is delay release for a short period of time. Since some of the rewards (film downloads, DVDs) can't be fulfilled until after completion, certain rewards might be delayed somewhat, but all reward obligations will be fulfilled as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe $250,000 raised by the Kickstarter campaign will not alone be enough to deliver a finished project, all-in. But it is enough to complete a final cut of the film, at which point we have other financing sources that will kick in and pay remaining costs of rights and clearances, and take us across the finish line. If we raise more than our Kickstarter goal, all the better, as it's that much less money we'll have to obtain from outside sources. The more free and clear we can be of outside financing, the better.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "KURT VONNEGUT: RELEASE UPDATE & EXCLUSIVE CLIP: THE INDIANAPOLIS OF MY CHILDHOOD.", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KURT.

Wonder no more!\nTwenty-five years ago, Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick created the game that introduced the world to 2D point & click adventure games. Maniac Mansion took the computer game world by storm with its compelling story, complex puzzles, cutting edge humor, engaging game play, and provided an entire generation with a new idea of what an adventure game could be. Blah blah blah...\nAnd now they are back together with an all new 2D point & click adventure game!  Ron is skinny again and Gary had that rash looked at \u2014 and they're here (finally!) to create the true spiritual successor to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.\nThimbleweed Park is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic point & click adventure games so special, and done by the actual people who spawned the genre.\nIt's deep, it's challenging, it's funny, it's everything you loved about adventure games.\nHoly crap is this going to be fun! And you can be part of it - right here and right now for $20 bucks which is like $1.52 in 1987 dollars.\nWhy do we want to make Thimbleweed Park? Because we miss classic adventures and all their innocence and charm. \nThey were fun and would put a smile on your face. We want to make one of those again and we want to do it right. We don\u2019t want to make a game \u201cinspired by,\u201d or \u201cpaying homage to\u201d classic point & click adventures, we want to make a real classic point & click adventure. \nThimbleweed Park is a game for true lovers of adventure games. This is a Kickstarter for fans who loved Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, and everything else that made that era great.  It strips away all the cruft built up over the years and is distilled down to what we loved about the genre.\n                                By popular demand and with thanks to the fine folks at Humble Bundle, we are now offering the ability to pay using PayPal. If you can back through Kickstarter directly, we kindly ask you to do that. It will make our lives a bit easier. But if you can't, then we're here for you. We got your back. \nAnyone who backs at $50 or higher will not only get their name in the Thimbleweed Park phone book (used for actual puzzle solving), but you\u2019ll also be able to record your own custom voicemail message when the number is called (subject to approval).\n               Please back our stretch goals and help us make Thimbleweed Park the best damn point & click adventure game you've played since that last point & click adventure game you played and liked.\nThimbleweed Park is the curious story of two washed up detectives called in to investigate a dead body found in the river just outside of town. It\u2019s a game where you switch between five playable characters while uncovering the dark, satirical and bizarre world of Thimbleweed Park.\nLost along a dusty stretch of highway, the town of Thimbleweed Park once boasted an opulent hotel, a vibrant business district and the state\u2019s largest pillow factory, but now teeters on the edge of oblivion and continues to exist for no real reason. It\u2019s a town that makes you itch and your skin crawl. It\u2019s a place no one ever looks for, but everyone seems to find. \nNot far from town, Delores and her siblings are gathered at the reading of her rich uncle\u2019s will where the backstabbing, intrigue and puzzle solving knows no end. How is this all connected to the dead body under the bridge? Good question.\nAt the long abandoned circus grounds, Ransome the Clown had been cursed and can never remove his make-up. How did he get into this situation? How can he get out? Does he really want to? What\u2019s up with that dead body slowly bloating in the water? Who knows!\nMeanwhile, on the 13th floor of the Edmund hotel, Franklin wakes up with no idea how he got there. But that\u2019s not the weird part. The weird part is that he\u2019s dead. Spoiler: He\u2019s not the body found just outside of Thimbleweed Park. Wow! That's confusing. Don\u2019t panic, we\u2019re just as confused as you are.\nWe like big pixels. Huge ones. Pixels that have their own Zip Codes. Pixels a family of six could live inside of and still have room for Uncle Pete when he drops in unexpectedly on his way to the coast.\nWe had a lot of fun building Maniac Mansion, there was a charm and simplicity to the art that let the game design shine and your imagination run wild.\nWe want Thimbleweed Park to be like an undiscovered classic LucasArts' adventure game you'd never played before. A game discovered in a dusty old desk that puts a smile on your face and sends a wave of nostalgia through you in the same way it does for us.\nRon Gilbert and Gary Winnick created and designed Maniac Mansion and have extensive experience making games over the past 25 years. Maniac Mansion was LucasArts\u2019 first adventure game and the point & click adventure game that spawned the genre we know and love today.\nRON GILBERT is a game designer, writer and programmer best known for creating and designing the cult classic adventure games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. Ron was the ninth employee at Lucasfilm Games, instrumental in their leap into adventure games, and creator of the SCUMM engine. He was the co-founder of Humongous Entertainment and made numerous adventure games for kids, such as Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam. His most recent work includes the adventure/RPG DeathSpank, The Cave and indie mobile games The Big Big Castle and Scurvy Scallywags.\nGARY WINNICK is an artist, writer, designer and art director. During his ten year stint at Lucasfilm Games he co-designed and created all the art for their first graphic adventure Maniac Mansion. Additionally, he created art for and art directed many other LucasArts games including Zak McKracken, Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monkey Island and Habitat. Gary created the original property Defenders of Dynatron City, co-plotted a six issue mini-series for Marvel and served as a producer for the animated TV special. He was a co-founder of Lightsource Studios and Suddenly Social. His most recent graphic novel Bad Dreams is currently being published by comic company Red 5.\nJust like they were on Maniac Mansion, Ron and Gary will be the core of the team building this new point & click adventure, co-designing and writing with Ron doing the bulk of the programming and Gary doing the art.  Good times.\nAn additional programmer and artist will be added 6 months into production, along with a part-time musician. Dedicated testers will join as the game nears completion.\nWe're fully devoting ourselves to Thimbleweed Park in the same way we did Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island and everything else we do. This is a serious full-time project for us. We want to make the best classic point & click adventure we can.\nFollow and participate in the game's development on our website, where Ron, Gary and other members of the team will discuss behind-the-scenes art, designs, information, cooking, gossip, answer questions, get feedback and generally have a lot of fun*. \n* Fun not guaranteed and void where prohibited by law.\nTons of other fascinating rewards can be found by looking to your right\u2026 over there\u2026 no, a little higher\u2026 scroll up\u2026 there!\n** Rewards icons are for reference, entertainment and gambling purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the final rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding games is always risky.

A project\u2019s biggest risk is controlling that scope and staying focused. Our experience brings realistic game design and production goals to the project. \n\nDoes that mean we won't be late? No, we probably will be late, but not by a lot and the game will be better for it. That's just the reality of making a game and we're going to be honest about that. We'll keep everyone up-to-date and hopefully there will be no surprises.\n\nThere is also the risk we'll spend way too much time trying to decide where to have lunch each day.

"Matt Grommes", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "When asked what was the most frightening thing he ever encountered, Ernest Hemingway answered: \"A blank sheet of paper.\"  Most artists, designers, writers, and students could agree.  I've talked to a lot of artists, and we all seem to have a recurring pattern.  I buy a new fresh sketchbook and agonize over starting it.  I get a couple of pages in, and run out of ideas.  I draw a few more pages and get bored.  Then I abandon the book for a couple of weeks while I ponder ideas.  Eventually, I do a couple of bad drawings and give up altogether.  Now I'm cursed with a half-full sketchbook that I'm slightly embarrassed to show to anyone.\nThis sketchbook is designed to alleviate all of that anxiety.  I've filled the book with just the beginnings of drawings, leaving lots of room for interpretation and creativity.  Each page has something new on it, but it's up to you to fill in the blanks.  Artist's block has no place in this book.\nAs an art teacher, I see the intimidation of the great white abyss every day.  Kids come to my class straight from math and science, with their left brain on full blast.  They spend their day analyzing, memorizing, and calculating.  Before I can get the kids to create, I have to turn on their right brain.  So the first thing they do is complete one of these drawings.  It's a good way to get the creative juices flowing, without forcing things.  If I give students a blank page, they spend four minutes staring at it and saying \"I don't know what to draw.\"  But with these drawings, the ideas start pouring out immediately.  Not only that, but in a class 30 different students, I get 30 completely different drawings.  So I know the possibilities are virtually limitless.\nThis book will be printed on 80# white paper (or heavier if possible), so you can draw aggressively with a variety of media, and not worry about bleeding.  The rounded corners will keep the pages from getting beat up and dog-eared, especially while traveling.  It's great for carrying around for a quick drawing on the go, or stash it between the couch cushions and pull it out when the mood strikes.  If you would like more than one, so you can keep one at work and one at home, or have drawing contests with your loved ones, or spread the joy through gift-giving, the process is simple.  Just multiply your pledge by the number of books you want, and send me a message to make sure I know what it is you need.  Or, if you're feeling extra special, you can opt for the \"buy 4 get one free\" reward level.  It's a great deal!\nFor 12-year-olds who get stuck in a rut, drawing the same thing over and over, this book is a tool to dig them out.  For grown-ups who draw all the time, this could be a fun and energizing activity, and could boost your creativity, or refresh your enthusiasm.  For adults who haven't drawn in a while, this is a perfect way to get back into it.  Personally, as an art teacher who draws every day, I still get excited about filling in these pages.\nWhether you spend four minutes per page, or forty, you can be proud of what you do in this book.  You can draw only in lines, or you can shade, color, or collage.  Use pen and ink, colored pencil, crayon, markers, or lipstick.  It's up to you!\nJust look at a couple of before and after shots!\nAre you nervous about the fact that you haven't taken an art class in a decade or more?  Don't worry!  I've thrown in several mini art lessons to refresh you!  Proper proportions of the human face will help you draw realistic people.  A lesson in one-point perspective will bring back what you already know about vanishing points.  Follow that up with a lesson on two-point perspective to further hone your skills as a draftsman.  I firmly believe in drawing from observation, so I've included a couple of grid drawings, which will help you slow down and draw exactly what you see. Also included are lessons on shading, including crosshatching, stippling, and scribbling.  They will help you free up your hand and mind, and try new things.\nEvery single drawing in this book has been tested on 150+ people, and I know they work.  Kids as young as 11 have turned out drawings that they are proud of and can't wait to show off.  Draw with confidence, and know that people will beg you to flip through this book!\nWhere does the money go?  If this project reaches its goal, most of the money will go to printing the finest, highest-quality product possible.  The cover of the paperback version will be embossed linen.  The hardcover version will have a silver foil logo on the cover, and a ribbon bookmark built-in to the binding.  Let's face it: the point of most business is to maximize profit, and quality will suffer.  But this project (and from what I see, most Kickstarter projects) isn't about profit for me.  It's about getting these books out to the people, so more folks can enjoy the art and get inspired.  I've already got a full-time job AND a successful side business.  So I'm not doing this book to get rich.  Most of the money for this project just goes right back into the project.  I hope to make enough money to cover all of the expenses of printing and shipping, keep my Diet Coke stocked up while I'm packing things, and I may have to buy a better scanner.  I've already invested quite a bit into this project, because I believe in it and I want to see it succeed.  Hopefully by now, you would like to see it succeed as well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've already talked at length with a local printer, and am very satisfied with what I've seen from them. I don't expect to see any problems from them. My two biggest worries are either not enough sales or too many sales. If I don't sell enough books, then the project doesn't happen. This wouldn't present any major difficulties besides heartache. If I sell too many, then it just becomes a volume-of-packing-and-shipping issue. I still don't think that would be too bad. I've got lots of people who can help me ship things out on time.\n\nAs for production of the book, I don't see any issues arising. I've already drawn out all of the pages. I just need to scan them and convert them to a PDF, and get them to the printer.\n\nI've been fairly successful running a website and delivering things on time for several years, so this is nothing out-of-the-ordinary for me. But I normally ship larger sculptures that require a lot of packing and padding. These books will be far more numerous but less padding, so I think it will even out to business as usual.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Are you ready for more?", "update_content": "Hello all.\nPlease excuse the intrusion.

After owning three arcades in the late 1970's to early 80's, it has been his LIFE-LONG DREAM to create a facility where young and old alike could enjoy these nostalgic games. When he came across the property in southern California, he leveraged all his financial resources to purchase the facility.\nIn other words, HE'S ALL IN!\nAs a non-profit organization, we have the 18 acre campus, 40,000 square foot facility, and over 500 vintage and modern games, but we don't have the $150,000 that's needed to renovate the space.  \nThat's why WE NEED YOUR HELP! \nIf you have questions, keep reading. BUT, if you're ready to contribute, go ahead and click BACK THIS PROJECT (upper right) and CHOOSE A REWARD to the right. \nWhat's Unique About the Museum of Pinball?\nWe are a non-profit. We're in this for the love of the game first and foremost.\nWe own the property. Therefore, we don't have a lease that will  threaten our financial stability.\nWe have room to expand. We envision all 127,000 square feet full of nostalgic games and the 5 acre park full of vintage RVs.\nWe will be open every week. While some other pinball facilities or local events limit their availability to just a few times a year, we will be open every week - Friday-Sunday with regular hours and Monday-Thursday for special events. \nWe are near a destination location. With the Morongo Casino & Restort and the Cabazon Outlets within a few miles of our campus. \nWe are close to six major airports including the Palm Springs International Airport (only 28 miles away).\nOur pinball collection is remarkable. Not only do we have over 500 machines, but many are rare and highly collectible. \nOur founder is a seasoned businessman. John Weeks knows how to build something from the ground up having been successful in launching both Internet and bricks & mortar businesses.\nWhat are you waiting for? There are some great rewards waiting for you if you contribute now! Click BACK THIS PROJECT (upper right) and BE GENEROUS! \nWhen Will the Museum of Pinball Open?\nIf we reach our goal of $150,000 through this Kickstarter campaign, we can be open by late January 2014. If we don't reach our goal within the 30 day window, your credit card won't be charged, and we don't get any of the money you pledge...and we're not sure when we'll be able to open. (Frankly, let's not think about that.)\nWhat's In It For You? REWARDS!!!!\nWe know you believe in this project, but we also know that it's fun to receive a \"thank you\" gift for contributing.

Click here to learn how your company can support the Museum of Pinball - a non-profit organization. \nIf you own the facility, don't you already have $150,000 of your own money?\nIf we had it, we'd use it! When John Weeks came across the property in southern California, he leveraged all his financial resources to purchase the facility. In other words, HE'S ALL IN! As a non-profit organization, we have the 18 acre campus, 40,000 square foot facility, and over 500 vintage and modern games, but we don't have $150,000 to renovate the space. That's why we need your help!  \nWhy did you choose this location in Banning, California?\nFor the past 5 years, we've been searching for an appropriate location in southern California. Anything in LA or Orange County was extremely costly (either to lease or purchase), but we wanted it to be near a destination location. When we found 18 acres with 127,000 square feet of buildings within a few miles of the Morongo Casino & Resort and Cabazon Outlets (and 20 minutes from the resort town of Palm Springs with an international airport), we were amazed by the potential. By purchasing the facility (rather than leasing), we are able to ensure that someone else (i.e., a landlord) can't increase the price of our monthly facility expenditures. \nIf I want to fly to the Museum of Pinball, what is the best airport?\nThere are seven major airports near the Museum of Pinball including:\nPalm Springs International Airport - 28 miles\nOntario International Airport - 50 miles\nJohn Wayne / Orange County Airport - 75 miles\nLong Beach Airport - 87 miles\nBurbank Bob Hope Airport - 96 miles\nLos Angeles International Airport - 100 miles\nSan Diego International Airport - 120 miles\nAren't there other pinball museums or facilities in the US?\nYes, we LOVE other pinball facilities, because all of us are focused on the same goal - spreading the love of pinball. Here are a few facilities around the US...\nPinball Hall of Fame (Las Vegas, NV) - 150 machines.\nPacific Pinball Museum (Alameda, CA) - 90 machines.\nPAPA (Scott Township, Pennsylvania) - open twice a year for tournaments with approximately 450 machines.\nSilverball Museum Arcade (Asbury Park, NJ) - 180 machines.\nSeattle Pinball Museum (Seattle, WA) - 50 machines.\nNational Pinball Museum (Baltimore, MD) - closed due to landlord canceling lease.\n\nWhen will the Museum of Pinball be open?\n  If we are successful in raising $150,000 with our Kickstarter campaign, we anticipate a Grand Opening in late January or early February 2014. The Museum will be open Friday-Sunday (regular hours) and Monday-Thursday (special events).\nWhen the Museum of Pinball opens, will I have to pay to play?\n  With a $15 entry fee (after the Grand Opening Weekend), you'll receive a card that will allow you to play approximately half of the machines at no additional charge for as long as you would like on the date of purchase. Other games will require additional credit to be added to your card, and you'll redeem those credits by swiping your card at individual machines of your choice.\nI'm a pinball aficionado, and I've never heard of John Weeks and his collection. Who is this guy?\nIf you're a follower of PAPA tournaments and the pinball culture in the US, you're probably familiar with high-profile players and collectors - but maybe you've never heard of John Weeks. After owning a chain of three arcades in the late 1970s and early 80's, John became enamored by pinball. In 1996, he started seriously collecting machines with a vision of opening a massive pinball facility. While John does participate in some pinball gatherings in southern California, he has also flown to see the other major pinball facilities in the US to learn and be stretched in his vision. With the majority of his time focused on running his Internet-based businesses, he loves spending time playing pinball with friends...and avoiding the attention of the spotlight.\nWhat pinball machines do you have in your collection?\nClick here to see the list. As we acquire more machines, we'll update the page on our website.\nHow do you plan to maintain over 500 pinball machines?\nBecause John Weeks has owned arcades in the past and is an avid pinballer himself, we know that one of the keys to ensuring that everyone enjoys the Museum of Pinball is to keep the machines in great condition for pinheads and the general public. Not only have we had numerous people already volunteer to be part of our ongoing tech team, we also plan to hire pinball techs to be on the museum staff. Although the Museum of Pinball is a non-profit, it must be run like a for-profit business in order to go the distance.\nWho manufactures the pinball accessories that you're offering as rewards?\nWhile the t-shirts are printed in California and the custom tokens are sourced in the US, all of the pinball accessories (including the covers, skates/dolly, and rotisseries) are manufactured by John Weeks. He has sourced and manufactured these items for the last few years, and he's happy to offer them as rewards to backers of the Kickstarter project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWITH THE $150,000, we are confident that the renovation and Grand Opening of the Museum of Pinball is possible for early 2014 (ideally late January - early February). \n\n- We own the facility and over 500 pinball machines.\n- We have a lease signed for a business to move into the 87,000 square feet in the middle of the property.\n- We have the business acumen to oversee the renovation, installation of the machines, and the opening of the Museum.\n- John Weeks has owned and operated successful arcades (1970s and 80s), retail tool stores (late 1980s), and Internet-based businesses (currently). \n\nWITHOUT THE $150,000, we know that the opening of the Museum of Pinball will be delayed.

We successfully Kickstarted the first volume in 2012, and the response has been so positive--and the requests from readers so unending--that we\u2019re back to do it again.\nYou know the feeling: There are so many fantastic authors and great books out there that sometimes it\u2019s hard to know where to begin.\nSay you\u2019ve always wanted to read something by William Faulkner. You probably know a bunch of his books: The Sound and the Fury; As I Lay Dying; Light in August; Absalom, Absalom! Maybe you\u2019ve even come close to buying one. But every time you think about it, there\u2019s that big question:\nWhich should you read first?\nStart Here solves that problem. It tells you how to read your way into 25 amazing authors from a wide range of genres--children\u2019s books to classics, contemporary fiction to graphic novels. Each chapter presents an author, explains why you might want to try them, and lays out a 3-4 book reading sequence designed to help you experience fully what they have to offer. It\u2019s a fun, accessible, informative way to enrich your reading life.\nStart Here, Vol. 2 will be available both as an ebook (compatible with Kindles, iPads, Nooks, and a variety of other devices) and as a printed edition.\nWho is writing \u201cStart Here\u201d?\nStart Here will be written by a wide array of writers, critics, and bloggers who bring not only their expertise but also their passion for these authors. This combination of passion and expertise is at the heart of Start Here. Passion without expertise is unhelpful, and expertise without passion is uninspiring.\nWhat Authors Will Be Covered?\nSome of them we\u2019ve already planned, some we\u2019re still planning, and some of them we\u2019ll ask for your help in selecting.\nHere are some we know we are going to include: Jennifer Egan, William Faulkner, Anne Carson, Ursula K. LeGuin, David Mitchell, Toni Morrison, Alan Moore, John Green, and Philip Roth.\nHere are a few we\u2019re thinking about: Salman Rushdie, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Nadine Gordimer, John Updike, Edith Wharton, and others.\nWho\u2019s on your wish list?\nWhere's the money going?\nThe proceeds will cover:\neditorial costs (compensation for contributors and behind-the-scenes work, software for book creation, legal fees, licensing)\npromotional costs (cover design, PR and marketing, special giveaway items)\nrewards & shipping (including print edition)\nadmin fees to Kickstarter and Amazon.\nWhat if you exceed your initial funding goal?\nOnce we meet our target, we\u2019ll add a second goal and five more chapters. If we meet that, we\u2019ll add another five chapters and another goal. Basically, your support will determine if the book exists and how many authors will be covered.\nWho Are You Guys?\nBook Riot is a community dedicated to the idea that writing about books and reading should be just as diverse as books and readers are. So, sometimes we are serious, and sometimes we\u2019re silly. Some of our writers are pros. Many of them aren\u2019t. We like a good list just as much as we like a good review. We think you can like both J.K. Rowling and J.M. Coetzee and that there are smart, funny, and informative things to say about both, and that you shouldn\u2019t have to choose.\n----------------------------------\nCandidates List\nAlice Walker\nAnn Patchett\nAnne Carson\nBarbara Kingsolver\nThe Brontes\nCharles Portis\nChina Mieville\nD.

It's designed to be family-friendly, but with enough strategy for adults to enjoy repeated plays. Each player is trying to recruit 100 power worth of animals to their side to take control of the Guzunganator, a machine that can control the weather. Each turn, players play an animal card to recruit one wacky animal to their side. Stronger animals are better, but finding the right combination is key to capturing the Guzunganator. But watch out! If a player plays a Season Change, all your careful planning could be undone in an instant!\nWhat's in the Box\nOne deck of 88 cards\nOne \"Season Card\" to indicate current season\nOne \"Play Summary\" card\nOne Rulebook\nGame Play Video\nGetting to the prototype pictured above has been a crazy story for us.  Weather Wars was born in a burst of creative energy one evening in Beijing, when we were half way through a year-long trip around the world.  (For more on our story, see the \"full bio\" link in the blue box at the top right of this page.)  Since that night, the game has evolved from a regular deck of cards mocked-up with Sharpie marker, to a demo deck printed - poorly - on a home printer, to the professionally printed prototype above. \nAlong the way, we've also expanded the game's reach.  We started a facebook page, designed a website, and started playing with a whole lot of people.  You can download a free Print-and-Play version of the game, as well as the newly updated stand alone Rules Booklet here.  With every new person we introduced to the game, we became more convinced we had a game with commercial potential.  People of all ages and walks of life loved to play it, and we had to take the next step to getting this game to the public.\nThat's where you come in....why your support matters.  With the money we raise through Kickstarter, we will be able to order a large quantity, high quality print run.  As larger print runs offer substantial per unit savings, this will allow us to offer the game at more affordable prices and reach more people.  If we are able to raise enough money to exceed our initial goal, the project will progress through our stretch goals (see below) and the game can reach its full potential!\nTo start with, anyone who contributes to our campaign, in any amount, will be included in our Victory Song!  The song will be written and performed by Doug Murphy, one of the creators of the game, and it will include the names of every one of our supporters and be uploaded to Youtube!  In addition to your own piece of internet fame, we're offering some snazzy reward packages at various pledge levels.  They all include domestic shipping, and pledges at the Ms. Polar Bear level and higher include international shipping as well.\nAt the Ninja Pig level and higher, you get two copies of the game.  You can give one as a gift, or combine the decks to play with more than four people!\n*OK, so this is clearly not a picture of a stuffed penguin...it's the Ambassador Penguin cartoon holding a present for you.  We don't have any prototypes right now, but we do have a process in place.  We'll be working with Happy Softies, who make hand-made custom plush toys out of Sydney, Australia.  You can check out some samples of thier work here to get an idea of the quality of this reward.  We're excited to see the final product too!\nWe were so excited to realize, when we returned to California after our travels, that we still had this original brainstorm session on paper.  Peer into the minds of game designers and see how seeds of ideas grow into games.  The place mat will be delivered in a handsome frame, as soon as we find the perfect one!\nOur goal of $6000 will be enough to help fund a Weather Wars commercial print run of a large enough size to maintain affordability.  But if we exceed that goal, we have lots of upgrades planned:\nWe have all the ideas for this expansion sketched out. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll offer you, our Kickstarter backers, access to the expansion at a backers-only price!  (Target delivery by the end of the year.)  We're hoping there is enough interest to add these new characters to the Weather Wars story!\nAnd if you keep pledging, we'll keep stretching...\nVIDEOS:\nQUOTES:\n\"The beauty of [Weather Wars] is that you can keep it as simple or complex as you want depending on the group you are playing with.\" - Lynn, mother of 3\n\"I love this game! I cannot wait to play with my friends!\" - Kyla, age 12\n\"Hah!  This art work is fantastic!\" - Nate K at BoardGameGeek.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning.\" - Winston Churchill \n\nComplete risk avoidance is impossible in a new venture, but we've done a lot of research, talked to experienced game designers and plenty of experts. The game is fully designed with completed artwork, layout, in depth rules and FAQs, and packaging. So, when this campaign ends, we are ready to send the order to the printer immediately.\n\nWhen the control transitions to the printer, our risk increases. If we are able to keep manufacturing in the US, we'll be able to mitigate that risk. But even if we print overseas, we've selected a company with a great reputation and a long history of shipping to the US. \n\nWe can never be 100% sure everything will go smoothly, but we've done all that has been recommended to us, all that is within our power, to make sure you get a high quality product on schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Checking In", "update_content": "Hello Weather Wars Backers!\nHappy weekend to all of you.

A Vagrant) and more. STRIPPED sits down with these creators to talk about how cartooning works, why it's so loved, and how they're navigating this dicey period between print and digital options...when neither path works perfectly.\nEven more than comics, this movie\u2019s about pursuing art in an age when the business of art is changing constantly.\nBut enough words! Let us show you two sneak-peeks of the film: One talking about how webcomics work (by Doctor Octoroc!)... and another talking about how traditional syndication works.\nThe Music\nThe film is set to an original score by Stefan Lessard of \"Dave Matthews Band.\u201d The score has elements of Django Reinhardt, of classical, of rock, and of jazz.  There's even a stop-motion music video with our buddy Kate Micucci, singing about comics throughout history:\nWho Was Interviewed For The Film?\nBill Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes) WHAAAT\nBill Griffith (Zippy the Pinhead)\nBrendan Burford (King Features Syndicate)\nChris Hastings (Dr. McNinja)\nAnthony Clark (Nedroid)\nDan Piraro (Bizarro)\nDanielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\nDarrin Bell (Candorville, Rudy Park)\nDavid Duncan (Savannah College of Art & Design: SeqArt Department)\nBrian Ralph (Savannah College of Art & Design: SeqArt Department)\nDavid Malki (Wondermark)\nDavid Reddick (Legend of Bill)\nDylan Meconis (Family Man)\nEmily Horne (A Softer World)\nKate Beaton (Hark, A Vagrant!)\nGary Tyrrell (Fleen)\nJon Rosenberg (Scenes from a Multiverse)\nGene Ambaum and Bill Barnes (Unshelved)\nGreg Evans (Luann)\nRodd Perry and Guy Endore-Kaiser (Brevity)\nHilary Price (Rhymes with Orange)\nHolly Post (Topatoco)\nHoward Tayler (Schlock Mercenary)\nJames Strum (Center for Cartoon Studies)\nJeff Keane (The Family Circus)\nJeff Smith (Bone, RASL)\nJenny Robb (Ohio State Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum)\nJohn Lowe (Savannah College of Art & Design: SeqArt Department)\nJim Davis (Garfield)\nKarl Kerschl (The Abominable Charles Christopher)\nKazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Flight)\nScott Kurtz (PvP, Table Titans)\nKris Straub (Chainsawsuit, Broodhollow)\nBrad Guigar (Evil, Inc.)\nMeredith Gran (Octopus Pie)\nMichael Jantze (The Norm)\nPhil & Kaja Foglio (Girl Genius)\nR.C.

The movie has already been shot, edited, and scored -- and the color correction and sound mix have already been budgeted for. More than that, you have two artists who are absolutely committed to completing this film: We've been working on it for 3 years for free...and putting tens of thousands of our own savings into the film. So there is no way we're not completing this film.\n\nPlus! It looks like we've reached our first two Kickstarter goals, so the historical footage is going in the film! \n\nBut: There is always a risk that unforeseen production delays could occur. Keep in mind: This is a full-length film being produced by just two artists, not a full studio.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter is live!

To bridge the gap between storytelling to story making, we will use a new tool that was, itself, the product of a successful Kickstarter campaign...The Tabletop Moviemaking Studio. Inspired by Wells, Dali, Bergman, Yeats and Piccaso, Tabletop Moviemaking draws on the history of Juvenile Drama and puppet theatre popularized in the Victorian period.\nOnly 2 Exclusive Safecast Air-1 Monitors Left! Citizen Science Working Group\nThere are a number of research projects the LA Makerspace community is involved with, such as working to detect radiation from deep space (DECO), mapping insect biodiversity in the Los Angeles basin (BioSCAN), and searching for next-generation solar materials (SHArK). One of our newer ones is Safecast Air, whose goal is to develop and distribute open-source air quality monitors which will allow anyone in the world to access real time data on what\u2019s in their air. \nAt the $100 level, ten lucky backers will be awarded an exclusive Safecast Air - 1 monitor. With these you\u2019ll be able to track a number of air quality metrics in your community, and help report it to the public Safecast database. This level also includes field trips and opportunities to work with scientists and engineers at CalTech, Natural History Museum, Tokyo Hackerspace (plus more), and participate in projects that include insect biodiversity, radiation, air and water quality. The $40 level includes all of these opportunities but does not include the air quality sensor.\nWe Are Makers\nThe Los Angeles Makerspace is a non-profit community space for makers and tinkerers of all ages to create and collaborate. Our mission is to provide a place where kids can learn alongside adults, maker parents can bring their children, and where people of all ages can join in making and learning through creating projects, participating in workshops and taking classes. Makers of all ages can take classes and receive mentorship in software, hardware, electronics, robotics, art, filmmaking, citizen science, bio-tech, eco-tech, wearable-tech, and more!\nWe've Done Some Cool Stuff\nOur classes and events are always full and have included a Hackathon for kids ages 4-18 and their parents who learned to program (Scratch, Kodu, HTML, Javascript, Arduino, Ruby, Java, iOS), Fashion Tech, Food Hacking, Make-up Effects, Soldering, LED Lanterns, Squishy Circuits, Origami, Scratch Programming, Take Apart, Digital Dominoes, Arts & Crafts, and glue gunning everything in sight.\nWe Want To Do Even More Cool Stuff\nWe have 2100 square feet of space at the LA Mart that needs to be filled with equipment, tools, and supplies to bring our makers' ideas to life. We need 3D printers, a laser cutter, computer workstations, arts & crafts materials, filmmaking equipment, metal and woodworking tools, electronics and robotics, and so much more!\nSquishy Circuits and more!\nMaker Movement\nWe are part of the global Maker/DIY Movement, recognized as being responsible for invigorating innovation and spurring new ideas. The concept behind a makerspace is to provide shared physical resources that are otherwise unaffordable or unattainable by an individual or family, and to support the community. Makerspaces provide a fluid workspace, as well as the collaboration, inspiration, and encouragement of like-minded others.\nAt the LA Makerspace, our volunteer mentors and instructors hail from different backgrounds and skill sets, including: Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Artists, Scientists, Teachers, Filmmakers, Roboticists, Rocket Scientists, Librarians, Executives, Entrepreneurs, Moms, and Dads dedicated to the proposition that making things is essential to creating an awesome society.

The authors, Hillel Cooperman and Jenny Lam (us), have been designing user experiences collectively for over 25 years. Six years ago we founded Jackson Fish Market, a small software design consultancy in Seattle, Washington. We've worked with clients like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, as well as several small to mid-size startups and tech companies. Clients come to us when they want to create an experience that's not just intuitive, not just usable, but something that their audience can fall in love with.\nSoftware is the canvas with which countless experiences are being created every day. And the number is only increasing. As more surfaces become interactive, more software will be created to run on those surfaces. And making something that not only gets the job done, but connects with an audience on an emotional level is a challenge. The book is called Making Things Special. It's a collection of essays and illustrations that give lessons and inspiration on the art of creating standout user experiences. The book is divided into three sections. The first covers the history and context of creating user experiences today. The second covers the role of the user experience designer. The third gets down to brass tacks in terms of techniques and specifics on creating the user experiences themselves.\nWhile the book will certainly be a useful tool for designers, we believe that the ideas and examples are important for anyone fighting to make a great experience including technologists, marketers, and business folks. We think there are even broad lessons for those creating user experiences in other mediums. We're thrilled to be on Kickstarter which is a special experience in itself. The funds we're trying to raise will help us ensure the book has high quality illustrations throughout, as well as getting top editing talent to make sure that the book is coherent, cohesive, and flows.

Any computer game you play, any role-playing game you play, any online profile you fill out, have their elements and DNA rooted in Dungeons & Dragons. It's a game that has had far-lasting, powerful and yet subtle influence in our culture. \nFrom its humble beginnings in a basement in Lake Geneva, WI, D&D was created by a group of game enthusiasts and game designers. The story of D&D and its creation spans four decades and is a complicated, heart-breaking story. Imagine \"The Social Network\", the creation of Facebook, but no one ends up rich. This is a cautionary tale of an empire built by friends and lost through betrayal, enmity, poor management, hubris and litigation.\nDungeons & Dragons is a game beloved by its fans. A game that brings family and friends together, creates communities, societies and sub-cultures. D&D teaches. We have heard countless stories of gamers who have delved deeper, studying history, language, science and math purely for the desire to be better players. Gamers have created lifelong friendships because of this game and come in all walks of life; firefighters, educators, computer programmers, entrepreneurs, and yes, even a few documentary film-makers.\nFILMING THE DOCUMENTARY\nWhat it feels like to be interviewed.\nWe love this game and the people that we've met while shooting it. They deserve our best efforts to create something really special. And you, our audience, also deserve something special, to know the story of D&D. A story that needs to be told so that people know how important Dungeons & Dragons has been in our culture. That's why we've set out to create a definitive look at Dungeons & Dragons. And we need a lot of help.\nWe've already shot hours of footage and spent the better part of a year putting this project together. It's been an amazing experience. But we've done all that we can and spent as much as we can afford. We still have a long, challenging road ahead of us.\nWe need to interview people all over the country, find folks who were there at its creation, talk to experts to explain to us why this is such an important game. We also have archival footage to find and pay for. Once we get it \"into the can\", we then have to cut all of that footage together. We need to edit, add music and include some fun graphics, etc. We then have to sound mix it, master it and put all the finishing touches to make it look great.\nAnd we'd like to get all of it finished by 2014, the 40th anniversary of the first publication of Dungeons & Dragons, when the first boxed set was released.\nThe good news is, we travel light. With almost 40 years of film making experience between the three of us, we know where to cut corners and shave time without ruining the integrity of the film. We're filling in where we need to and putting on different hats. With just the three of us, we have to. But now, we need your support to elevate this project to a new level. That means hiring a small crew and paying them slightly more than indentured servant wages.\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nAnthony and James conferring.\nWell, because we love the idea of Kickstarter. We think that Dungeons & Dragons (the game and the documentary) is a perfect fit for this grand experiment. It's a game that's affected millions of lives and there's a built-in community behind it. It was a game made for groups of people and we felt it was a natural conclusion that it should be a film made by groups of people.\nThat's where you come in. We need your support. It's an expensive project and yes, we are asking for a lot of money. But rest assured, transparency will be our focus and our mission. We will be updating our blog, sharing on our social media sites, sending out reports and making sure that every dollar we spend is accounted for. You will be with us the entire way, at every interview, during the edit and at the mastering. We will need your support making decisions, helping us spread the word and see us through the moments of despair.\nThis is what makes the Kickstarter idea so exciting for us. That you, our investors, will be with us, that together we can make a great film. Something we can all look back on and say, \"yeah, you know that cool little doc about D&D, I was a part of that.\"\nWHY WE NEED WHAT WE NEED\nAt the original, long-abandoned TSR offices in Lake Geneva.\nMaking a movie isn't cheap, but we've managed to cobble together some figures that might help explain what we need and why need it.\nIf we get our goal of $150,000, we get to shoot the film. This is the minimum we need for actual production, crew, equipment, flights and lodging.\nIf we get $250,000, we get to edit, add music, mix the sound, add some graphics and do the Mastering. We get to pay for the archive footage, which, we are learning, is expensive. This pays for all the finishing costs. The $250K level brings everyone to the first of our FIRST STRETCH GOAL, a beta version of our smartphone app: GAMER FINDER. Find gamers around you using your smartphone's geo-tagging features. Now, if you want to play a game and your friends are too busy, just use your app to find gamers near you.\nAt the $500,000 level, we get to market the film. Yes, marketing is expensive. Even the extra $250K is never enough. This helps us send it out to film festivals (Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca, to name a few) and eventually, cross our fingers, sell the film to a distributor so they can get it to theaters. The $500K level brings everyone to our SECOND STRETCH GOAL (and this one, we are very excited about). Everyone who donated $100 or more will automatically receive the Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary Companion Book. This beautifully bound, illustrated book, published by Green Ronin and edited by James Lowder, will chronicle the creation of the documentary and will include essays from interviewees and other special guest contributors. Those who payed less than the $100, will be given the opportunity to increase their pledge to the $100 (or more) level and we will send the book along with your other rewards.\nFINALLY\nIf you can't help us monetarily, help us by spreading the word. Share your stories on our social media sites, follow up on what we're doing with our blog and website. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about how influential this game truly is. Everyone should know the legacy of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson and how they changed the world. We hope that with this documentary, they finally get their due.\nThanks, everyone.\n\nA FEW CLIPS\nADDED REWARDS\n- At the $3,000 Level, you can have this one-of-a-kind item. Once someone snatches this reward up, it's gone. What you are pledging for is a Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary Banner that we've had specially made. We will have everyone who either worked on the film or was interviewed sign their autograph.

It\u2019s time San Diego, with its year-round growing season and vibrant food scene, got a public market of its own and you can Kickstart it into being right now! \nBorough Market\nWHO: You might think that the city or county would have established a public market years ago, or that they\u2019d be donating a cool old building or a bunch of money. Sorry, no go. We're going to have to do it ourselves. Dale Steele has been chasing public properties and pitching politicians about a public market here for more than ten years. Civic budgets aren\u2019t looking any brighter and we can\u2019t wait for them any longer.\nCatt White lives in San Diego\u2019s food world and she starts and manages neighborhood farmers\u2019 markets. You know her and her team from the Little Italy Mercato and markets in North Park and Pacific Beach.\nMarket Maestra Catt White\nTogether, Dale and Catt (that's us) are clever, connected, creative and have the cojones, er, chutzpah to bring San Diego the Public Market it deserves. We could use a little help with the cash. That\u2019s where you come in.\nWHAT: We\u2019ve leased a 92,000 square foot property near the harbor and Petco Park and are transforming more than 2 acres of funky warehouses,\nFuture Food Hall\ncosmetically challenged office buildings and weed-filled open spaces into food halls and plazas. We\u2019re filling a high-ceilinged former boiler factory with cheese making, salame curing, bread baking, chocolate tempering, coffee roasting artisans; vegetable growing, fruit picking, chicken raising farmers; street food from around the world and some of San Diego's coolest chefs turning out the hottest plates a sophisticated diner could desire.\nWHAT: We\u2019ll line the plazas two days a week with farmers\u2019 day stalls overflowing with farm fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, chicken and grass fed beef, spiny local sea urchins and line caught fish, and a riot of colorful fresh flowers along with local honey, pastries, sea salts and pastas. Stick around after the market for Farm Family Dinners. \nOther days we\u2019ll fill those booths with aspiring local dressmakers and jewelry creators, candle makers and furniture crafters, surfboard shapers and pet portraitists. We\u2019ll host craft beer tastings, clothes swaps, jewelry and koi and succulent shows.\nWe\u2019ll move tents out of the way to fill those same plazas with music festivals, movie nights and quincea\u00f1eras,chef\u2019s tasting events and art exhibits, and the occasional Chaldean Festival, Chinese New Year\u2019s parade, Filipino fiesta or charity fundraiser. You can get married here, or celebrate your grandma\u2019s 100th birthday. \nGranville Island Market\nWe\u2019re converting the old office spaces into a commercial kitchen, micro business incubator, and classrooms where kids and parents will learn to cook healthy dishes, chefs can expand their skills, and your special recipe can become your own small business with the help of experts and mentors and commercial cooking equipment. We\u2019ll offer urban agriculture workshops and a farm lab where you\u2019ll learn to plant, compost and harvest, and maybe even to appreciate worms. \nWHEN: Development is already underway. We\u2019re paying rent, weeding, patching walls, painting floors and marking parking spaces. Farmers are planting crops to bring to market. Local chefs and food artisans are touring the property, sketching out menus, and planning the shops they\u2019ll build this winter and open next spring. \nSan Diego Public Market\nWe need your help to fund contractors, sign fabricators, equipment purchases and planning department fees (that\u2019s a big one) to keep the project moving at its brisk pace and let the weekly farmers\u2019 markets open in late August. Yes. This month. We don\u2019t mess around here.\nWHY: In return for your support, we\u2019ve assembled a slate of rewards you\u2019ll find hard to resist, from t-shirts and heirloom seeds to personalized plaques, shopping sprees and parties on the plaza. And that\u2019s on top of the reward of knowing that you helped create the San Diego Public Market, where all kinds of people will come together to shop, eat, learn and celebrate. And to dance. \nThat\u2019s what happens at public markets, decade after decade.\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Kickstarter, you know that we don\u2019t get a cent of what\u2019s pledged unless we reach or exceed our goal. That would slow us down and make us sad. So in addition to donating what you can, it\u2019s a huge help if you spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, and by emailing your closest friends, co-workers and even that guy you met at Coachella. Heck, put a sign on the lawn. Tell everyone you know to pledge early and pledge often.\nYour vote counts!\nWe can do this. We can build the San Diego Public Market.

This is due to restrictions placed by the city of Mountain View on the Hacker Dojo. We are looking to lift these restrictions by updating the building, and to create some amazing new resources for our community such as a dedicated event space and makerspace/design studio.\nWhy Does the Dojo Matter?\nWe help many of the projects you love before they get famous, including OpenPhoto, iPhly, Pebble Watches, Biocurious, and many many more. One of our founding directors is also an executive producer on the much-loved Indie Game the Movie.\nInexpensive space to work has powered some of the most innovative and successful startups in the valley recently, including Pinterest and Word Lens.\nProvides a home for conferences and meetup groups who want to focus on being awesome, not on fundraising.\nStartups founded here create hundreds of local jobs\nProvides a community and access to resources for technical people\nCreates a community where curiosity and a passion for making things is valued\nBut Don't Take Our Word For It\n\"...having places like that [Hacker Dojo] are so important to the fabric of the Valley, they need to be supported.\u201d - Margit Wennmachers, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz\n\"My company is currently profitable and our app has been downloaded almost 3 million times.

It is about 3000 square feet.\nMany conferences and classes that are extremely content-oriented do not have the bandwidth to court sponsorships and locations. We believe that by empowering these events to bootstrap and run with almost no money that we will enrich the intellectual environment for everybody!\nThis space will eventually be the design lab! Currently it is home to our nearly finished TARDIS and some of the communal tools we don't yet have room for.\nWith housing prices so high in the Bay Area, we believe that a dedicated space to stretch out and create physical objects will be a valuable commodity and empower many individuals and startups to create things they would otherwise be unable to create.\nSo what are the prizes?\nThe Shirts\nThe incredibly talented Melody Lu has made this beautiful shirt which is exclusive to kickstarter backers. Here's a rough mockup of the design.\nA mockup of the shirt! If you want more information about it, we dedicated a whole backer update to this!\nThe shirts are American Apparel and printed in both unisex and women's sizing. They are available at the $32 pledge level, and also in the boxes of win at $265 and $1337.\nThe Mural Reward\nThe first few rewards you can be involved in is a mural that is also being donated by Melody Lu. Here is a mockup of it.\nMelody Lu's Mural Mockup\nThis mural will be customized according to the wishes of a few of our generous donors. You can decide what books will be on the table with the dinosaurs, and what technology they use.\nThe Plaque\nThe plaque of contributors will be modeled after the plaque of the founding members, and hang alongside it.\nWhen the Dojo was being founded, 60 exceptional members stepped forward to pay dues before the Dojo even existed. Now we are looking to recognize donors who are willing to step forward in our time of need by creating a second plaque for exceptional donors in our renovation fund.\nPower Strips\nWhile mere mortals might think these are normal power strips from a hardware store, the fire marshall has assured us they are not acceptable, giving you a chance to own some of Dojo history!\nWe can't use these power strips anymore, so they are going to be part of the grab bag at $256 (see sidebar to see the other awesome stuff you get in the box!)

This outlines all the steps we must take in order to make the city happy, and guarantees that if we follow all the steps that we will be permitted to use the Dojo for classes and coworking for a long as we would like so long as we don't change our legal usage again.\nWhat Will the Money Be Used For?\nThe list is actually quite long, but the majority of the renovation money will be spent on:\nBuilding permits\nADA-compliant bathrooms\nA fire suppression system\nEmergency exits/egress \nEverything which legally can be done without a licensed contractor is being done by Dojo volunteers. If you'd like to volunteer to help with that aspect, please email IWantToHelp@hackerdojo.com\nAfter we are legally allowed to go into the buildings we will be making\nA dedicated event space to host classes and small conferences\nA design studio with resources for makers who want to make physical objects\nHow do we know you are qualified to do this?\nHacker Dojo already has the infrastructure in place to run over 8000 square feet of space for all variety of people who like to make things.

You can now order Seed Money by visiting www.leafcutterdesigns.com/shop/seed-money.html\nNew goal (achieved!): $45K = Buffalo nickels for all backers\nRead the full update here...\nWhat is Seed Money?\nSeed Money looks like the real thing - pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters - but is far more valuable. Use it to solicit surprise and smiles from friends and strangers alike, and then tuck these paper coins in soil to grow colorful flowers and delicious vegetables. It's tender for tending!\nSeed Money will be lovingly designed and made by Lea Redmond and her pals at Slide Sideways and Porridge Papers. This initial run of currency will include hand-illustrated pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and will be letterpress printed in Nebraska on thick custom papers embedded with seeds. Available in rolls for sharing and spreading the wealth, these lightweight, whimsical - and practical! - coins will slide easily into a purse or pocket.\nWhat can you do with Seed Money coins?\nAll sorts of delightful things! And they're certainly not just for gardeners!\nSecretly tuck them into medians, public parks, or your friend's front yard.\nLeave a few with your tip at a restaurant.\nPlace them in coin return slots to surprise strangers.\nPlayfully try to use them at your local coffee shop or bakery.\nLeave them on sidewalks for people to stumble upon.\nGive them as a unique gift or party favor.\nGrow an entire backyard flower/food garden with the full set of coins.\nPass them out at your farmer's market just for fun.\nSend a roll to a politician with a letter expressing your opinion on agribusiness subsidies.\nIf you run a retail shop, hand over a few along with the real change.\nLock up a few rolls in a safety deposit box at your bank just in case Malthus was right. Or perhaps your porcelain piggy bank is more secure?\nHow is Seed Money designed and minted?\nLea will design both sides of each coin denomination. The artwork will be reminiscent of actual US coins but with a playful, hand-drawn aesthetic and a flight of fancy or two. Each coin will include the phrase, \"In Soil We Trust.\"\nPorridge Papers in Lincoln, Nebraska will then make four custom batches of hand-made paper embedded with organic seeds, one for each type of coin:\nPennies: flower mix (Don't worry, nothing invasive!)\nNickels: hearty greens mix (such as kale, chard & spinach)\nDimes: herb mix (such as thyme, dill, oregano, parsley & basil)\nQuarters: salad mix (lettuce, carrot & tomato)\nSeed Money will then be \"struck,\" i.e. printed and die-cut, into tens of thousands of mint-condition paper coins on Porridge's letterpress machines. In the meantime, our pals Jacqui and Scott at Slide Sideways in Tacoma, Washington will design hand-lettered imagery for four unique coin wrappers. Finally, the loose paper change will be wrapped into rolls by hand in Oakland, California.\nLucky recipients might find the occasional rarity in their rolls of Seed Money: perhaps a 1935 buffalo nickel or a Canadian penny. Lea will also slip in a few \"misprints\" inspired by actual historical \"strike errors.\" Did you know there are a few 2005 Kansas quarters out there that say \"In God We Rust?\"\nIn Soil We Trust\nWhile our Seed Money is mostly lighthearted, it also carries subtle statements and questions about our relationships with nature and money. Can you imagine a culture that deemed food so important that its currency system was based on seeds? Call it the seed standard, instead of the gold standard. What if having a pocketful of seeds was a sign of wealth and prosperity?\nA coin was once worth the actual amount of gold or silver it contained. Today, its value is purely representational. A melted down quarter is almost worthless and pennies are mostly just annoying. Our paper coins aim to re-infuse actual value into physical money. Seed Money promises to produce a bounty of beautiful, delightful, and edible experiences.\nExchanging real money for Seed Money\nOur $10,000 funding goal is a function of the minimum quantity requirements for the custom-made seed papers and high-quality letterpress printing. We'd love to exceed our goal and \"mint\" an even bigger batch. The suggested Kickstarter pledge levels at right represent a roughly 30% discount to expected future retail pricing. Seed Money will be delivered to you sometime in October or November of this year - well before the holidays.\nThank you for your enthusiasm and support!\nWe absolutely love to create thoughtful, playful, high-quality objects and activities.

Our next move: Pushing others to jump out of their comfort zones, too, and writing and designing the hell out of the results. For the next month, we will crash on one issue of a magazine. No salaries, no health care, no ergonomic office chairs. No foundation grants, no advisory boards, no independently wealthy vanity investors\u2014for now, at least. That means no filler, no product placement, no luxury gift guides. It means we won\u2019t be afraid to publish things that are complicated or sexy or weird... the kinds of things that might just get you fired. (We\u2019ve been there.) Tomorrow will feature original articles and essays about what\u2019s on the cusp, plus fresh design, illustrations, and photography in a quality print publication.\n\nWho are we?\nTomorrow\u2019s eight co-founders and editors are Tim Fernholz, Ann Friedman, Megan Greenwell, Amanda Hess, Cord Jefferson, Dylan C. Lathrop, Zak Stone, and Nona Willis Aronowitz. We spent most of our waking hours together at GOOD magazine until six of us were fired and two more quit in June 2012. There, we put out a daily web magazine and a quarterly print magazine with written and visual journalism about the economy, sex, culture, politics, sports, and food.\n\nWe\u2019re in the process of recruiting a diverse team of kickass contributors. (If that\u2019s you, please get in touch: tomorrowthemag@gmail.com.) And keep up with our progress at tomorrowmag.tumblr.com and twitter.com/tomorrowthemag.\n\nWhat will Tomorrow be?\nWe\u2019re starting from the beginning: What areas of society need to hit the reset button?\n\nTomorrow is about (and for) the people who are working out what\u2019s next. Today\u2019s dilemmas deserve fresh eyes liberated from the tired status quo of superficial journalism, boring narratives, and old ideas about what works. We\u2019ll take a look around the corner to bring you stories about the people, the movements, and the trends that are tearing the world down and building it anew.\n\nTomorrow will be available on the web, but first it\u2019ll be published as a treasure-it-forever print issue. We\u2019ll give you 100 oversize pages of reporting and essays, plus full-color photos, illustrations, and infographics. This is print, after all\u2014we might as well go big or go home.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s first edition will be printed and shipped to your door in fall 2012. A launch party in Los Angeles will follow. Arrange your hangover burrito plans now.\n\nWhere will the money go?\nThe $15,000 will fund production, web design and hosting, tech needs, postage, and one amazing launch party. We'll print enough magazines so everyone who orders an issue gets one. But if you exceed our expectations, we\u2019ll exceed yours. If we raise more than $15,000, we'll be able to compensate contributors and ourselves\u2014at least a little. If we raise even more than that, the publication will get even better.\n\nWhat is Tomorrow\u2019s future?\nWe\u2019re committed to making at least one issue\u2014but we\u2019re open to more. If you\u2019re an advertiser or independently wealthy human who would like to help us sell out, hit us up. (Hey, we need to find work sometime).

We are raising money for the SECOND book in a series of graphic novels \u2013 when the first book is unknown, and in fact has just been released today. The first book is a very long (210 pages) full-color graphic novel that tells the epic story of the clash between angels and robots and humans, and a special half-breed girl who has to decide whose side she is on. It\u2019s called The Silver Cord, and some might classify it as spiritual fiction. I think of it as techno-epic. The story is completely finished, brand new, and as of today you can read it in its entirety either on our website for free, or as a printed book.\nBut that is not what we are pitching here. We hope that you will read the first 210 pages of our graphic novel, and then want more. To get more, you\u2019ll have to fund this second and concluding book. If we are able to raise the modest, but adequate, goal amount then we\u2019ll proceed to finish the story. It\u2019s all mapped out; the characters are itching to see what happens next, and we are eager to return to the storyboards.\nWhen I speak of \u201cwe\u201d I mean the team of artists and authors who worked on this first book. I normally write and edit technical non-fiction, like the magazine that I helped start, Wired. But others on our team have written for Pixar movies, or worked on the visuals, graphics, and concept art at ILM, Lucas, or Electronic Arts. We also include young artists coming from forums like Deviant Art. See the wonderful roster below.\nTo show you a bit of what we have built so far, below are some examples of the character development sketches we made for the first book. \nThis story tackles an environment most artists shun as visually impossible \u2013 the angelic realms. Normally, no author or artist wants to try to paint a ghostly, disembodied after-world of intangible beings. So they revert to wings. The main thing about the world we present in these books is that it contains millions of different species of angels. \nMillions of species of angels\nAnd then there are the robots who desperately need the angels. For more surprises you\u2019ll have to read the first book. It\u2019s free on the web, or you can order a hefty, full-color print copy from Amazon\u2019s Createspace.\nThe book is printed 8.5 x 11, and the free web version also presents large renderings of the artwork. Here is are some examples of its pages.\nThere is plenty of room for comments about each page on the web and we hope you chime in. As we (authors) have time we\u2019ll also add commentary to each page, particularly if you ask specific questions.\nFor contributing to our fundraising campaign we offer a selection of rewards tied to the second, soon-to-be-made book. But it is possible you may want to contribute to the second book simply because you enjoyed our first one at no cost. It is odd, if not crazy, that we are offering the first book for free since we spent more than 8 years working on it (part time). But the economics of print don\u2019t favor new un-established comics, and after 8 years of waiting, our story needs an audience.\nWe hope you enjoy this story of an alternative afterlife, of an unusual convergence of the spiritual and technical, of the coming-of-age of a confused teenager, and the dawn of robots as \u201cchildren of God.\u201d If you do enjoy it, please tell your friends and followers, and if you would like more, you should fund the concluding book of The Silver Cord.\nThe Rewards\nThe reward levels cascade up. For each higher level of contribution, you also receive the rewards from all the previous levels. We'll have a page in the back of the new book with the names of all people who fund the book. (Of course, you can opt to not have your name listed.)\nTo clarify, here is what we are proposing:\nThe Silver Cord (Book One), now\nWeb version, free, at www.silver-cord.net\nPaper version, 210 pages, all color, $30, from Createspace\nThe Silver Cord (Book Two), later\nPDF version, $20 contribution to the fund\nPaper version, 200+ pages, all color, $35 contribution\nThe Silver Cord (Book One and Two), later\nPaper versions, two volumes, signed, $100 contribution\nThe Cost\nOne thing the first book taught us was how much work goes into a graphic novel -- at least one as colorful, long and deep as ours. The $40K we are seeking for the second book is at the cheap end. On the first book some of the creators donated their work. On the second book we will pay (modestly) everyone who works on it (except me, Kevin Kelly, since I am doing this for the joy of it.) Our budget includes paying the script writer, the story-boarder, the artist who draws, the artist who colors, the letterer, and the production person bringing it all together. (Remember too, that almost ten percent of the raised amount goes to Kickstarter and Amazon.) Finally, for those who earn the reward of a printed book ($35 and above) there is the substainial cost of printing and mailing each copy. The $40K will cover it all, but without any fluff.\nThe Story Synopsis\nThis is a story about the young half-breed girl who gets caught in a war between newly conscious robots and ancient jealous angels. She has to save the human world.\nSince the beginning of time, the world of humans and the world of angels have run parallel but apart, connected only by a single tunnel of light.\nHumans know the tunnel as the passageway that lifts their souls after death. Angels know it as the Birthing Ring: the tunnel that delivers souls into the tiny bodies of newborn babies.\nBut the recent discovery of quantum computing has disrupted this age-old balance. As scientists perfect this technology in tiny \"Q-chips,\" they are inadvertently opening a second passage between the world of humans and the world of angelic species. But unlike the first passageway, this new portal is forming deep in territory controlled by dark sinister angels.\nAny day now, scientists will install this new quantum-powered chip into a robot so smart, so life-like, so close to human consciousness, that just like a human baby, it too will require a soul.\nUnbeknownst to the scientists, the exact moment the quantum robot is switched on, the new portal will open and allow the darkest of all angels to rush down and become the robot's missing soul. This ensouled robot will be the first of many. An unstable force of possessed robots, until\u2026\nA confused teenager discovers that she's the only one who can stop dark souls from penetrating the human realm.\nBut who will believe her?\nBackstory\nNow great wars in heaven are being fought over what to do, while in the far reaches of the realm skirmishes break out as angelic tribes prepare their responses to this disturbance by human technology. Chief among their worries is the coming moment when robots on earth will be smart enough to contain a soul. Only a few spirits will gain the eternal prize desired by all angels: full-sensory embodiment.\nFor 10,000 years the physical realm of humans and the spiritual realm of angels ran parallel but apart, intersected only in rare cases by a few exceptional beings, such as mystics and shamans. For the last two millennium the angelic realms have been warring among themselves in a battle over the growing power of humans. Some races of angels encourage the growing progress of human culture, while other orders of angels grow increasingly agitated as humans acquire technology that can encroach into their dimensions. In the last 50 years technology has advanced to the point where quantum computing, artificial intelligence and genetic engineering are disrupting this age-old gulf between realms, allowing humans to influence the intangible world once ruled exclusively by angelic species.\nThe question the angels fight over is; who will get to go?\nThe question for you is: would you like to hear how this all ends? The story's answer may surprise you. Please enjoy the first book with our compliments and consider funding the conclusion. We won't disappoint you.\nThe Team\nKevin Kelly\nCo-founder of Wired magazine, futurist, author of the influential book Out of Control, which was an inspiration for The Matrix trilogy, helped invent the future world featured in The Minority Report.

I'll need $6,000 to make a nice hardcover full color book, so I'm coming to Kickstarter to get the funds to pay for this. Thanks for your time and please consider pledging to help fund this project. If you'd like to keep up with this project and my work I'll be posting updates here:\nTwitter: @mrjakeparker\nBlog: www.mrjakeparker.com\nWant to know more? Keep reading...\nFor the last 13 years I\u2019ve been working as an artist on everything from toy commercials to feature films. For 5 years I worked in feature animation on the films Horton Hears a Who, Ice Age III, and Rio. I've also written and drawn my own graphic novel series, Missile Mouse, published by Scholastic imprint, Graphix. In between all that I've drawn several short stories which I want to collect in a book.\nMy book is called The Antler Boy and Other Stories and all of the stories were previously published in other comic anthologies like Flight or Out of Picture. Some are out of print and it'd be hard to track them all down so I thought it\u2019d be great to collect them all in one book.\nHere are the 9 stories in the book:\nHugo Earhart - One of the first comic stories I did. It's about a boy taking on responsibilities that are a bit over his head and his rising to the task and proving himself worthy. It\u2019s got a flying whale and cool airships; what more could you want?\nThe Robot and the Sparrow - A tale about the unlikely friendship of a sparrow and a robot. At its core though, it\u2019s about losing someone you love and dealing with that.\nLucy Nova Space Explorer - Lucy gets herself in and out of trouble in two (two!) stories on strange alien worlds. These stories are also peppered with some impressive cutaway drawings of the creatures she encounters and technology she uses.\nMissile Mouse: The Guardian Prophecy - Missile Mouse crash lands on a planet to find he's just the guy to help save a small village from a monster...or is he?\nThe Star Thrower - My irreverent take on the inspirational story of the same name.\nThe Antler Boy - The title story about a boy who finds out his curse might actually be more of a blessing.\nCheckers - A story about a girl who just wants to play a game of checkers.\nSecret of the Space Cave - Lastly I\u2019m doing a brand new 18 page comic just for this book about a curious space explorer and a pilot-for-hire who discover a space cave that holds nothing less than the answers to life. Oh, and those answers are nothing like what our explorers expect.\nSketchbook Section - The book will also have a healthy section of sketches and notes about the stories in the back. You'll see the ideas that didn't make the cut and ideas that evolved into the finished stories.\nAll new color - A handful of these stories have never seen color so I\u2019ll be giving them the proper coloring treatment for the book. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to breathe some new life into them this way.\nSize - All of the stories, plus the sketchbook section, plus all the miscellaneous other pages should bring this book to the 140-150 page range. It will be 10.2 inches tall by 6.6 inches wide, roughly your average graphic novel dimensions.\nLet's talk money - I need $6,000. I want this to be a nice, full color, hardcover book. I found a reasonably priced printer who does some beautifully printed books. That amount will cover all printing expenses, proofs, shipping overseas, and miscellaneous expenses like software to build the book, shipping it out to buyers, and the fees associated with Kickstarter.\nEDIT: As of Tuesday April 24, I added the Antler Boy eBook to every pledge of $25 and up. I talk about that here.\nHere's what you get:\n     __________________________________________________________\n     __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\nMore info about the SPACECAVE ONE sketchbook here.\n      __________________________________________________________\nThey look nice, here's one framed for my daughter's room.\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\nThanks for taking a moment to check out my Kickstarter project.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

She'd rather be left to her own devices \u2013 literally \u2013 inventing things and solving math problems and ignoring people altogether.\nShe's also forced to study alongside the imaginative girlie-girl Mary, who's always going on about romance and exotic travels.  Fortunately, Mary's appetite for adventure leads her to propose the two girls open a detective agency, and when an heiress shows up with a case about a missing diamond, it's the perfect puzzle to coax Ada out of her shell.\nThis is the made up story about two very real girls \u2013 Ada, the world's first computer programmer, and Mary, the world's first science fiction author \u2013 caught up in a steampunk world of hot-air balloons and steam engines, jewel thieves and mechanical contraptions.  For readers 8-12.\nThis is a pro-math, pro-science, pro-history and pro-literature adventure novel for and about girls, who use their education to solve problems and catch a jewel thief.  Ada and Mary encounter real historical characters, such as Percy Shelley, Charles Babbage, Michael Faraday, and Charles Dickens \u2013 people whom the girls actually knew.  If Jane Austen wrote about zeppelins and brass goggles, this would be the book.\n\nWhy \"Wollstonecraft\"?  Mary names the detective agency after her mother, the famous feminist writer. If this is the kind of book you'd like to see, please support this project.\nBOOK ONE: Mary & Ada found a detective agency in 1826 London, and their first case involves an heiress with a missing pendant, and her clearly-innocent maid who has confessed to the crime.\nBOOK TWO: Joined by Mary's step-sister Jane and Ada's half-sister Allegra, the girls (aided by 19th century scientist Mary Somerville)  tackle a case of mistaken identity and break into (and out of) a notorious asylum to stop a swindler.\nBOOK THREE: Ada's sudden illness force the girls to split up and tackle three baffling cases that are clearly unrelated \u2013 or are they?\nBOOK FOUR: The Wollstonecraft girls are recruited by the famous dinosaur-hunter Mary Anning to investigate the disappearance of her friend, fossil-collector Etheldred Bennet.\nUPGRADES: EVERYONE who has pledged for the first e-book or above will now ALSO get an e-book of Book Two, and all $25 pledges and up will get the first three e-books and an autographed cover postcard, which I can sign as you request.  As more people come on board, things get bigger for everyone.

If you\u2019re thinking about going back to school or about the possibility of self-taught learning, read this book first! Don\u2019t Go Back to School will help you figure out if you can do it on your own\u2014and it\u2019ll show you how. It might just save you a gazillion dollars in tuition fees, and spare you the yoke of student loans for years to come.\nIn Don\u2019t Go Back to School, I\u2019ll deconstruct the basic infrastructure that school provides\u2014things like resources, expertise, evaluation, and a learning community. And I\u2019ll profile fascinating, self-taught people, showcasing the practical ways they meet those needs. I\u2019ve already talked to people like Cory Doctorow about learning to be a working writer, Dan Sinker about learning to code, Quinn Norton about learning neurology and psychology as a science writer, and a dozen others so far, with many more interviews planned.\nThe passionate learners in this book have taught themselves subjects like programming, history, writing, design, art, engineering, business, languages, philosophy, and many other skills, trades, and disciplines. They\u2019ll tell you what they know about learning and show you how they\u2019ve done it. Their stories will paint a picture of what learning without school is like, so you can figure out if it\u2019s right for you. And they\u2019ll give you the spark you need to get started and stick with it.\nI\u2019m also planning to include information on the new wave of collaborative education facilitators like Skillshare, and a set of guidelines from HR professionals about representing your self-taught skills or knowledge when trying to get a job.\nWhy I'm the best possible person to write this book\nAs a grad school dropout and a teacher at a grad program, people ask me all the time about whether or not they should head back to school. Most of them  don\u2019t really need to. What I see is that they really want to indulge a passionate curiosity to learn. To master something new, to challenge their minds, to play with new ideas, to feel driven and inspired and absorbed. Going to school isn\u2019t the only way to do those things.\nUnless you want a job that can\u2019t be had without a specialized degree (like pharmacist or public school teacher), and, unless it\u2019s free, I usually advise people not to go. But the idea of learning independently can be daunting, so I started writing down my own strategies and interviewing friends who learn on their own, asking them how they do it. In my research, I've found that people who learn stuff independently develop strategies and infrastructure to give them some of the necessary things that they\u2019d get from a school setting. I want to be able to share that learning framework so that more people can figure out how to do it on their own.\nAs I talked with folks about what I was working on, I got so much enthusiasm and excitement for the idea; it became clear this needed to be a larger, published project.\nHere's where you come in\nThe money I raise will go to supporting my work interviewing and writing, paying for transcription, book design, proofreading, printing the books, and postage to send them to backers. I\u2019ve already started the interviews and research, and completing it should take about three more months plus time to get the book printed.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with it, Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing model; if I don\u2019t reach my goal by the end of the fundraiser, your account will not be charged for your pledge.\nAll copies of the book printed for Kickstarter backers will be numbered and signed!\nAre you self-taught or a school dropout?\nI'd love to hear your story and get your feedback and suggestions on this project. Please post your thoughts in the comments or get in touch with me directly!\nThanks for checking this out.

The film follows the community of spirited gamers as they make their way from Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown to their new home at Next Level in Brooklyn, an arcade started by Chinatown Fair\u2019s former manager Henry Cen.\nABOUT THE MOVIE\nI was initially drawn to Chinatown Fair because it seemed so out of place.  It was as if it should not have existed at all.  I had read about the arcade in the NY Times and was amazed as soon as I walked through the front door.  It was a different world inside, full of energy and warmth.  When I discovered the community that surrounded the arcade I knew I wanted to make a documentary that would capture the feeling of being there and share the incredible stories and history I was discovering.\nThe film will be a portrait of the subculture that occupied a strangely beautiful place that is no more. That's why we are making this movie-- to preserve and share a special time and place unaffected and authentic in a way that you don't see very often.  \nWe filmed at the arcade during its last week in operation and since then we have interviewed many members of the community and documented the beginning of the new scene at Next Level arcade.  We are still exploring the story and have a lot more shooting to do!  As we progress the more interesting it becomes.\nABOUT THE ARCADE\nChinatown Fair stood its place at 8 Mott Street for over fifty years.  It saw the rise and fall of Chinatown tongs, persisted through numerous wars, financial downturns, and outlasted most of its kind - arcades that have been phased out by Xbox's and Playstation's and replaced with corporatized family fun centers like Dave and Buster's.  What Chinatown Fair would be unprepared for was the gentrification of its neighborhood.     \nThe arcade was dim and lived-in like a familiar living room or basement, but also part boxing gym -- gritty, unpolished, and utilitarian.  It was a place with a singular purpose, to provide an arena for intense and passionate competitive play.  The arcade was a training ground for some of the best players of all time.  Justin Wong, Eddie Lee, Henry Cen, Arturo Sanchez, Sanford Kelly, Michael Mendoza all grew up playing at CF.  \nChinatown Fair was also the rare place tolerant of all types, resulting in a community that was as diverse as New York itself. And in many ways I don't believe CF could have existed anywhere else. It had to be in New York and had to be in Chinatown.  The arcade was the embodiment of its surrounding.  Everyone felt welcome and was accepted.  Not everyone came soley for the video games.  A group of LGBT trekked from the outer reaches of the city to the arcade on a daily basis simply because they felt safe there.  The arcade was a dysfunctional harmony of noises and flickering light, and uproarious banter. \nTHE PLAN\nWe are raising money on Kickstarter to fund our production and post-production budget which will cover equipment rentals, sound mixing, scoring, graphics, editing, and a litle bit for marketing.  We are still filming and as we go along we find new people to interview and new places to shoot.  The movie is beginning to form itself.  \nARCADE will premiere in early 2012, play at festivals throughout the year, and then tour across the country.  Then the movie will be made available for TV, online streaming and download.\nPlease help us by donating and sharing the project with friends!  \nWe have put a lot of thought into the incentives and hope you like them.  Be sure to check out the custom mix-tape and \u2018zine featuring artwork from members of the NYC gaming community (if you would like to contribute let us know!). The t-shirt that Homage is creating to commemorate the arcade is also going to be really great.   \nThank you for your support!  \n-Kurt\nP.S.

See it here. \nWe have just over a week to go and we've already doubled our initial ask! Do we still need funds? Definitely. Any additional contributions go towards finishing costs and important things like subtitling, which will only help Weiwei's story reach a wider, global audience. Forty-three days into Weiwei's detention by Chinese authorities, he was granted his first family visit. Yet this only raises more questions than it answers, as his location and the charges against him remain a mystery, and his access to legal counsel completely denied.  It's important that we continue to tell people about Weiwei. Funding this film is a way to achieve this end. \n________________________________\nOn the morning of April 3rd Ai Weiwei was detained at Beijing Capital Airport by customs police while traveling to Hong Kong. His Beijing studio was raided. His wife, Lu Qing, and eight assistants were taken into the local police station for questioning. Five of Weiwei's associates remain missing. On May 15th, 43 days after Weiwei disappeared into police custody, Lu Qing was allowed to visit him at an undisclosed location in Beijing. There still are no formal charges against Weiwei, but he continues to be held by police. \nThese above events have dramatically changed the context of my film's production and release, but here is my original Kickstarter pitch ::\nTwo years, seven countries and eleven cities later, I know Ai Weiwei. He is the ultimate prankster: simultaneously an international art star and a \u201cdissident artist\u201d in the Western press, with tens of thousands of Chinese netizens following him online and the government keeping almost constant tabs on him. \nI have over 200 hours of footage (some of it viewable here) that includes never-before-seen interviews with Weiwei\u2019s family, friends and fellow artists, and chronicles his preparation for major museum shows at the Haus der Kunst and Tate Modern, and a public sculpture work for New York\u2019s Central Park. The two years I spent filming him really mark his rise to international renown, both for his art and his online activism. He is probably the fiercest and loudest internal critic of China, yet somehow he is not in jail.\nWeiwei\u2019s story is extraordinary, but I need your help bringing it to the world.\nTo date I have invested my own money and earned critical support from Agnes Gund, the Henry Luce Foundation and Hazen-Polsky Foundation. But, making a feature-length documentary is no small task. I\u2019m working with a top-notch team including editor Jen Fineran, composer Ilan Isakov, Beijing-based graphics company 39 Degrees North, and a host of volunteers helping get the word out. I now need funding to meet post-production costs of editing, color-correcting, sound mix and music recording.\nIn a more abstract sense, you are helping to bring the issues of human rights, Internet censorship and freedom of expression to the forefront of conversations at film festivals, theaters, museums, universities, broadcast television, government and diplomatic offices\u2026everywhere we plan to show the film.\nThank you for your support!\nAlison Klayman\n_______\n\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f:

Shortly after being named ArtReview magazine's most powerful person in the art world, he was served with a $2.4 million tax evasion charge by the Chinese government. Though fans and supporters contributed over half of the bill in solidarity, the government has rejected his claims for appeal. As the ongoing drama continues, Weiwei has said, \"If a country resorts to silencing its people with sham laws, you win the battles, because you have power, but you\u2019ve lost the war.\u201d In an attempt to localize Weiwei's global cause and empower each person to keep his voice a loud part of the digital conversation, we have launched a  campaign on  and . We know his ability to freely express himself online is fragile, and never guaranteed, and so we encourage each and every one of you to get involved, be engaged, and speak out.
