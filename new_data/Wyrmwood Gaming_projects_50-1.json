The simple game play combined with clever scoring make this a brilliant casual game for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nNever-before seen Deluxe Version for just $5!\nThis project is a special 10-day project for \"pledge what you are able\".  We are offering a fixed number of rewards to get the game out there with just 1000 of the Deluxe Version with a minimum pledge of $5.  We encourage you to pledge what you are able, but if $5 is all you can pledge, that is ok for us.  This is a crazy experiment to see if \"seeding the market\" will pay off for future print runs!  Note shipping costs and add-ons will be collected post-campaign during the Crowdox Survey process.\n CRAZY Pricing! To be honest, we LOVE this game, but it failed on Kickstarter last time at $40/copy (HERE).  We had a brilliant looking project, good reviews and everything looked great, but wow did it fail!  Rather than just let this project die we have teamed up with the factory to reboot this game.  We are going to produce  1000 copies of the Deluxe game.  We are doing the Deluxe game with ALL stretch goals unlocked and asking you backers to pay what you can.  We know the world is a crazy place right now and lots of us are hurting.  We are strictly limiting this campaign to just a few copies and will NEVER produce the Deluxe edition again!  \n KS Limited Exclusive Content! Deluxe copies will NOT enter distribution. Don't miss out on these awesome extras. \n Stretch Rewards! All stretch rewards are UNLOCKED and every copy of the game will come with all the stretch rewards mentioned!\nhttps://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247576/poetry-slam\nStep One: Reveal a Letter Card and a Word Prompt, then all players simultaneously write a word behind their screen that fits the rule (sorta like Scattergories but with only one word):\n Step 2: When you have completed your word grab a Speed Tile, first come first served!\n Step 3: Using the word you created from Step 1, form a simple poem to clue in your fellow players as to your word.\nHint: The poem should be sort of like clues from Dixit, not so easy that someone can guess it before you even finish with your poem, in that case you only get two points. It also shouldn't be so hard that no one can guess it, then you get no points. You want it to be difficult but not too difficult, so at least one person guesses correctly after you finish the poem for 3 points!\nTwo final details: Snap Tokens. You must give three +1 point Snap Tokens to other players during the game, but no more than one per round. You also accumulate Slam Tokens when you break rules or use forbidden letters.\nDownload the rules on BGG here!\nLearn how to play Poetry Slam from designer Adam Wyse!\nClick the image to jump to the full review\nClick the image to jump to the full video review.\nFrom BGG Ratings, click the image to jump to all comments.\nClick the image to read the full review\n As a reminder...

Because this is an ENGLISH word game we have made the difficult decision to ONLY ship to the USA/Canada/UK and EU, and as of April 8 we have added Japan and Australia by popular demand!  If you want a copy of the game and live outside of these areas please look into a mail forwarder service in the USA where we can ship your rewards to for further forwarding.\nWe added Australia and Japan by popular demand on Day 2 of the campaign!!\nUPDATE 4/8/2021: By popular demand we have added New Zealand, shipping is $32 for one copy or $51 for 2 copies of either version of the game to NZ. The Philippines is $22 for 1 copy or $32 for 2 copies, also by request!  Note because the game is HEAVY (over 3 pounds with the shipping box) we will ONLY ship via UPS to the lower 48 US states for USA backers.  If you live in Alaska, Hawaii, PR, APO or otherwise have a PO Box rather than a physical shipping address, sorry you are out of luck and we will NOT ship to you.  For all other regions note we are NOT offering this as \"VAT/CUSTOMS\" friendly.  We will put a stated value of what you paid for your rewards, but can't guarantee or be responsible for any fees you may pay to get your package.  We will ship to all non-USA areas via DHL.  VAT TAX for the EU/UK will be collected along with shipping costs on the Crowdox Survey.\nRetailers to pay $20 shipping via UPS.\nNote Regarding Late Surveys And Shipping\nWe won't ship rewards more than three (3) months after we finish shipping Poetry Slam from our warehouses. We'll be sure to make several attempts to reach any stragglers over those three months, but after that period of time, we'll consider any remaining pledges with an incomplete survey a donation to Mayday Games and any copies set aside will be sold through game stores and conventions.\nCreative Team\nWanna know more about the design process and hear Adam talk candidly about making his designer dreams a reality?

Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

That\u2019s where the Deck of Stories comes in.\nIt\u2019s a flexible story-telling system of story hooks that will get your creative juices flowing. Each hook features next steps that help take you deeper into the moment and the unique ORC storytelling system that suggests where it would fit best in a storyline.\nThis Kickstarter includes the release of the Deck of Stories Volumes 1 and 2, as well as five-themed boosters and the Deck of Stories: Genesis Box.\nIn addition to the Deck of Stories Volume 1, the Deck of Stories: Genesis Box contains a set of NPC and Sensory Cards to help fill out your story even more. The NPC Cards are pre-generated, beautifully illustrated characters that you can insert seamlessly into your game. Each NPC Card has an NPC along with five traits that help you role-play that character. Add one when your players catch you off guard and you need an NPC on the spot, or use them to help fill in the role of a new character in your game.\nThe Sensory Cards engage the five senses with unique details that you can add to your adventure. Any time your story feels flat, choose a Sensory Card from the deck and use it to fill out your description of a room, or add interest to a situation.\nWhether you're planning a story arc in your latest campaign or need an exciting one-shot for your next session, the Deck of Stories is a must-have tool for your story-creation arsenal.\n\n        Are you ready to create a legendary adventure?\nA crooked skeleton stands before you\nDeck of Stories is Compatible with Roll20\u00ae\nWe\u2019re happy to announce that digital versions of the cards will be available on Roll20.

After reading the prompts, arrange them in the order that makes the most sense to you, taking cues from the ORC story-telling system. Now you have a beginning, middle, and end for your story that\u2019s loose enough to adapt but structured enough to move the story forward. Not what you wanted? Shuffle and re-draw.\nA solid O, R, or C at the top of each card helps you decide where to place it in your story structure. Keep in mind that the story structure you create is not rigid.

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey up until a few weeks before we ship.

As so many of us worry about the future and yearn to return to the glorious spring unfolding outside our quarantined windows, we're excited to bring you our newest, most enchanted project...\n\nCreated by illustrator Kevin Jay Stanton, this 78-card deck features traditional paintings rooted in classical tarot interpretations that delve into the lore and mythology of the plant kingdom.\nFor over five hundred years, humans have used Tarot cards as a tool for divination and meditation. Their archetypal symbols have mystical, philosophical and psychological implications that allow us to understand our past, our future, and ourselves. But even older than that is the symbolism we've always assigned to the plants that grow around us. Hermetic, alchemical and scientific traditions explore flowers as tools for making meaning, medicine and magic. \nBOTANICA marries the tradition of Tarot to a lexicon far more ancient: the natural vocabulary of life on Earth. \n\nBOTANICA takes all of the major and minor arcana of traditional Tarot and reinvents them in the language of flowers. The Queen of Swords is Red Oleander. The Hermit is a Chinese Lantern. The High Priestess is the Elderflower. The Devil is Nightshade.\n\nThe deck features  the complete set of 78 Tarot cards, illustrated with acrylic and ink paintings. The Major Arcana are defined by single plants and flowers, and the Minor Arcana are plants combined with the objects from their suit, with regalia on the court cards.\nThe cards are 3.25\" x 4.15\", printed on premium heavyweight card stock and emblazoned on the back with gold foil. Each deck will come with a booklet naming the plants and objects on each card, and explaining the symbolic meanings of each card. \nThe set comes in three editions: THE HERBALIST, THE ALCHEMIST, and THE ENCHANTER. The details of each set are listed further down.\nDivination is the process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, and similarly the act of reading tarot is finding patterns, meaning and visions in the symbols. A larger picture is created when a story is formed from how one card interacts with the next, as a bouquet is created from the harmony between many flowers.\nBOTANICA can be read in many ways, depending on what you\u2019d like to get out of it. To start, you\u2019ll want to familiarize yourself with the deck. Light a candle, play some evocative music, and think about how you respond to the cards you\u2019ve drawn. Without looking at the meanings, what\u2019s the first card that really resonates with you? What plant strikes a chord in you on first sight? \n After you know the deck a bit better, it\u2019s ready for use. Plants have always been a foundational part of how we treat our bodies, and Tarot can be a tool to help sort our thoughts. Consider drawing a card in the morning to guide you throughout the day. Ponder a question and draw three cards to meditate on the foundation of a problem, what it looks like currently, and how to handle it in the future. Or lay out a full ten-card spread and really get to the root of it all. \nHere is a small sampling of the cards included in the deck, with notes from their creator.\n\n\nTHE LOVERS represents emotional decisions and the union between independent and equal partners. I chose peonies because they have flamboyant blooms that are \"perfect flowers\" -- a botanical term for flowers with both reproductive parts --  and for the generosity they exhibit in their symbiotic relationship with ants. I think it\u2019s important for modern decks to capture the essence of The Lovers, and for me it\u2019s about people being their whole selves and sharing that with others, the way peonies share their dew with ants and are protected from predators in turn.\n Like the floating seeds of a dandelion, THE FOOL sets out on their journey full of hope and with the promise of new growth. It\u2019s a common plant, almost ubiquitous, and carries with it a naive quality I find appealing - I love the idea of making a wish by blowing on its seeds.\nTarot is sometimes described as the journey of the Fool through the deck. That\u2019s why I picked a weed that could weather all of that and still come out on the other side with a feeling of charm and whimsy to be the major symbol of Botanica.\nTHE SEVEN OF WANDS is represented by Datura, or Thorn Apple -- a highly poisonous species of flowering shrubs pollinated by bats. I picked it for this card because the Seven of Wands is about being ready for a battle and having the endurance to see it through, and the fruit of datura reputedly have the ability to heal wounds as much as they can cause harm.\nI picked Japanese vajra (a Buddhist ritual object) for the wands because they\u2019re a symbol of enlightenment that embodies the balance between the five poisons to one\u2019s purity and the five wisdoms that help one attain it.\n\nTHE FOUR OF COINS is a card is about being trapped by comfort. Honeysuckle bears flowers with a sweet aroma that wafts through the summer air, attracting all manner of creatures. It can be an extremely invasive species, and in those cases its vines can take over native plants and literally choke them. The Four of Coins is a warning to avoid excess, to take time to smell the flowers.\nThe coin symbol I picked for this card is wampum, a beaded Native American currency, as the Common Honeysuckle is a species native to the eastern coast of North America. The shells of this protocurrency were harvested off the coast and prized as much for their value as decoration. Their beautiful swirls of purple and white were often woven into belts by tribes like the Iroquois.\n Here are the  three editions in which we're publishing BOTANICA.\n\nThe standard BOTANICA deck will include all 78 cards, and a booklet explaining the symbolic meaning of each card and each plant. Each deck comes in a sturdy tuckbox, blocked with gold foil.  Everything you need to read fortunes in the flowers.\n ***SOLD OUT***\nTHE ALCHEMIST is a collectible version of BOTANICA, limited to an edition of two hundred fifty. This edition is housed in an elaborately embossed tin with antique brass finishing, wrapped in the embroidered silk altar cloth. Each copy is signed and hand-numbered by the artist Kevin Jay Stanton. You will be thanked by name in the informational booklet that accompanies the deck.\nTHE ALTAR CLOTH\nThe ALCHEMIST, DARK ALCHEMIST and ENCHANTER editions include a 24x24\" silk altar cloth to be used for readings (or as a stylish neckerchief). In addition to being a beautiful way to encase your deck, each cloth is embroidered with symbols of the Arcana and imbued with the wishfulness and tenacity of dandelions.\nTHE COMPENDIUM\nThe ALCHEMIST, DARK ALCHEMIST, ENCHANTER and HERBALIST AND COMPENDIUM tiers will come with a a compendium detailing the research, process art and theory that went into the creation of BOTANICA.

Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with many beautiful books and other rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money and how much work are required to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. To be honest, our biggest risk is that in these turbulent times people won't have the funds to spend on art projects like these.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making things with such high production values than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict. (For instance, despite our considerable epidemiological expertise, we didn't see this global pandemic coming.) But our team has the knowledge, experience and commitment to persevere through difficulties and deliver a product that meets and exceeds the exacting expectations of our audience of discerning readers and collectors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A BLESSING", "descp": "We will speak your name aloud amidst a field of wildflowers, and you will be botanically blessed.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "A GLIMPSE", "descp": "You will receive a digital PDF containing images of all 78 cards, and the booklet explaining their symbolism.\nINCLUDES:\nDIGITAL ACCESS", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["235 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "THE DANDELION", "descp": "A 1\" hard enamel dandelion pin designed by Kevin Jay Stanton.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\n\nCharity information:\n* We will be donating up to $15,000 to Direct Relief.  \nPer Kickstarter rules, no money collected for this campaign will go towards any donations.  All proceeds for charity will be donated from our own funds outside this campaign.  The charity we are donating to is Direct Relief.  Direct Relief works in the U.S. and internationally to equip doctors and nurses with life-saving medical resources to care for the world's most vulnerable people.  We chose them due to their stellar rating with Charity Navigator and for the specific work they do, especially in this current crisis affecting every corner of the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done. The gameplay for this game is 95% complete. The art and graphics are well underway.

In addition, our intention is to not release this game to standard retail until all U.S backers orders have been shipped.

We use centrifugal distribution on a flat surface with bearings that abstract the result at two levels (While the spinner spins at one speed, the bearings turn inside the channel at another, varying speed). It\u2019s a similar mechanism as what Wheel of Fortune uses to more or less \u201cguarantee\u201d balance. But truthfully, there is no perfect system. We would certainly be confident in saying this is as balanced a result as rolling a high-end balanced die.\nQ: What about the sequential numbers?\nA: We've changed it! Given the ongoing and vehement response to this particular feature - we've been able to change and interleave the numbers so that they're non-sequential and always in opposing quadrants.  All backers will receive interleaved numbers.\nIt was a really strange month: October 2019. One of my friends had been laid off the week prior, and I was to take over his old office. Sitting there, eating a fibreOne bar he'd so graciously left behind in his desk, my friend David entered the room and together we assessed the rest of the valuables (beyond the box of fibreOnes, obviously) scattered about. \nThat's when we saw it. A magic eight ball. It made us consider randomness. It made us wonder about probability. It made us ponder whether we needed to pursue other things before being fired ourselves. And when we asked if we should fully chase whatever dumb idea we had next, the eight-ball responded \"It is decidedly so.\"\nAnd so here we are on Kickstarter, with, you know, all the wisdom of a magic eight-ball, having fully convinced ourselves that this next dumb idea would be the dumb idea to help us break free. \nIt is thus with a \"spin of the dice\" (to coin a new term)..., and after much planning, prototyping and months of play-testing, that we present our not-quite-as-dumb-as-we -might-once-have-thought idea:  \nBecause when you don't want to lose dice, it's best to not use them at all. \ud83d\ude1c The red indicator bearing points to the roll result.\nFront view of the Mythroll 4:6/8:12 with the indicator pointing to the 6 on the upper row or 12 on the lower row.\nOn our 4:8/6:12 Model, half of the spinner shows a d4 and a d8, and the other half shows a d6 and a d12. The two red indicator bearings guarantees each half of the spinner always has an indicator when spun..\nWe have two objectives with this campaign.\n1. To build a community of alternative rollers; or \"Mythrollers\" as we call them. Defined as \"a group of people who share a boundless perspective on randomness and number rolling - and are unsatisfied with the polyhedral prisons they've been confined to.\" Dramatic? Yes. Exactly. \n2. To bring this unique idea to market with the help of said Mythrollers. \n We've been designing, prototyping, game-testing and prepping for manufacture for approximately 6 months now - and the final build of the first two models are currently in production. \nHere's a bit of the process we've been through...\nThe original, October 3rd/2019 3D-rendered design of, what was at the time, called \"The Scroller\". \ud83d\ude02\nNovember 2019: Let's call this time period \"the exasperation\".\nDuring the month of November 2019 (or what we like to call \"The Exasperation\"), the debacle which was \"electroplating\" the numbers onto a conical steel item, caused our team in China to have to create over 25 unique iterations to get it right. This process... sucked. We had to design and implement a new technique to electroplate the numbers and lines in a multi-step process. But, we're now the proprietors of a new electroplating technique! Yay!\nWe were excited to put a video together to discuss our process a bit.\nEach Mythroll Armory Spinner will be delivered in a delightfully logo-adorned, perfectly-shaped black box for safekeeping.\n We need the Kickstarter community for a few MAJOR reasons: \n1. Creating prototypes of this type costs approximately $250 per unit. We have a number of variations in the design phase. However, these variations cannot be created and brought to market without the funds provided by the Kickstarter community.  \n2. Pre-orders will allow us to build a multitude of finishes and colours available for purchase DURING the kickstarter. We'll also be able to unlock a custom two-wide zip case (Pictured below).\n3. To keep the costs of manufacturing low, we need to order several hundred spinners of each model at a time. That can't happen without the Kickstarter community supporting the project. \n4. We'd also love to push the manufacturing process along to build a d20 Spinner (rendering animation below). \n5. One of our goals is to become an Amazon FBA store so that, when someone wants a spinner, they can get it shipped to their home overnight. We cannot accomplish this without the support of the Kickstarter community. Once backers DO help us reach our goals - our new online Spinners Amazon FBA store will be available to all! \nCustom Mythroll Spinner Dual-Case holder unlocked! It may not be exactly as pictured.\nIndividuals backing multiple pairs will receive one custom character pad per spinner pair.\nWe were going to put a picture of the boring dice you can receive for your pledge of $10, but we figured no one wanted to see them anyways.\n Upon the successful completion of the Kickstarter we really want to make the spinners available on Amazon Prime in both Canada and the United States. Doing so will allow us to ship with prime delivery, but the price will go up to a minimum of $62.95 USD  per unit to account for the costs associated with the convenience of Amazon Prime (labelling and inventory management) and Amazon's large cut (15% in the games hardware category). Do not wait to pledge! \n Lock in your 47% (minimum!) savings by pledging during the Kickstarter now (before the retail prices kick in AFTER the Kickstarter)!

Export beautiful tokens in a wide range of styles.\nAt the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign, your support will immediately go to work helping us deliver these full-featured color tools while continuing regularly to expand the library of parts and customization options on www.heroforge.com.\nFebruary 2020: We begin updating our library of thousands of parts for color compatibility. \nMay 2020: Finalized user interface for color application, and the launch of beta access to color tools for all Kickstarter backers, and launch Token Maker Unlimited. \nJune 2020: We will open order submission to Kickstarter backer for both 3D printed color and hand-painted color custom miniatures. While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge. Backer reward redemption will be facilitated by digital voucher codes redeemable on www.heroforge.com.\nWe have been developing exciting new tools to fully utilize the most revolutionary 3D printing technology and hardware. It is a big job, but who better to do it than the makers of the original 3D printed custom miniatures?\nHigh-Quality Web-Based Rendering\nWhether you want to fully paint your design with a couple of clicks or hand-tune unique digital 'paints' to capture your character's aesthetic perfectly, we have you covered.\nWe wanted users to be able to do more than apply flat colors, so we looked to traditional, real-world painting techniques to inform our designs. Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures. Since then, we\u2019ve shipped hundreds of thousands of miniatures to dozens of countries around the world. We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options. We've added over a thousand new parts, two dozen new fantasy races, and ever-improving materials in both plastic and metal. In 2019, we began adding fresh content every single week. \nTens of thousands of users have visited every \"Treasure Tuesday\" to see what we\u2019ve added from our ever-growing \u2018user wish-list\u2019 of content requests. And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added. Your backing will help us in the process of updating our library of thousands of parts to support rich, in-depth color customization, and launch exciting feature additions sooner.\nThe Future of Hero Forge\n\n                       Hero Forge 2.0 will expand and enhance the design capabilities that Hero Forge is famous for. You can expect us to continue our tradition of innovation, setting the bar for customization and artistry for custom miniatures. \nPreview just a few of our planned additions and advancements in the hero featured in our splash image: XL epic wings, dynamic and detailed bases, magical weapon effects, and cute new companions represent just some of the exciting new features we have planned, so even more people can design their perfect miniature. With your support, we can add this new content even faster, and with the new Hero Forge 2.0 color tools in mind.\nHero Forge 2.0 is the platform for the future of 3D printed custom miniatures. Design and print the most epic of characters, not only in stunning detail, but in gorgeous full color.\nBacker rewards include early or permanent access to a range of new features and tools on www.heroforge.com.\nEarly Access to Color Tools\nBe among the first to start designing in color! Backer tiers starting at $34.99 will be given early access to our color design tools. Watch our UI and tools develop before your very eyes!\n\nThe First Opportunity to Order Custom Miniatures in Color\nWe are employing cutting edge technology to bring full-color custom miniatures to you. Backers will be first in line to have figures printed in this exciting new material as we scale up production.\nEarly and Permanent Access to New 'Token Tools'\nOur token tools and new photo booth options will add a range of easy-to-use image capture features to Hero Forge. While we intend to one day add a range of pro-tools to a Hero Forge subscription services, Kickstarter backers will get access to the Token Maker Unlimited with no recurring subscription fees, receiving either a full year of access at lower tiers, or lifetime access at higher backer tiers!\n...and Much More!\nWant to offer even more support?

Your support will help us deliver them even sooner! Read on to hear about the first batch of six stretch goals, with more to be announced once these are met soon!\n\nWe're so excited about these last remaining stretch goals. We can't wait to see how many you will help us unlock during these final days of the Hero Forge 2.0 campaign!\nSky Castle Studios, LLC is a Santa Monica-based development studio dedicated to using gaming and technology to inspire creativity and connect people. Established in 2014 after the runaway-hit Hero Forge crowdfunding campaign, we continue to grow our cutting-edge web-based design application and explore the latest in 3D printing manufacturing. \nSpecial thanks to Fantasy Grounds for letting us feature screen captures of their virtual tabletop program, Kraken Dice for providing the dice featured in our photography, Izzy Gramp for color design, and Kate Elliot at www.kvephotography.com for editing our Kickstarter video.\nWe are lucky to work with incredibly talented artists all over the world, and would like to thank them for their contributions to Hero Forge. In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

The act of a scheduled activity where I would go have fun with friends on a regular basis helped me overcome my depression. It helped me build stronger connections with friends, create a sense of community, and, as cheesy as it sounds, gave me somewhere to belong. As a way to contribute back to the fandom creatively, I started Dispel Dice. \nSince then, it\u2019s grown more than I could have possibly imagined in a short period of time. I want to share Dispel Dice with the world, and to do that, I need to accelerate production so it can be sustainable long-term.\nDispel Dice stands in solidarity with Kickstarter United.\n\nWe've unlocked all the designs now!

VAT TAXES, IMPORT FEES, CUSTOMS FEES, & DUTIES ARE NOT INCLUDED.\nHow we do it!\nEvery artisan set is hand poured, polished, and painted, so there may be slight imperfections or differences of color and material suspension in the dice. No part of this process is automated. Please understand that due to the nature of how they're crafted, it is impossible to ensure they're absolutely perfect or identical because each one is one of a kind.\nI am the sole full-time staff member of Dispel Dice at the moment, but I did not do this alone. I have an amazing support network that came together to help me bring this project to life. This absolutely would not be possible without their combined experience and contributions.\nEveryone on this list (along with some people who asked to be left off of it) has touched my life in so many ways -- from a friend who crowdfunded and organized a meal delivery service to feed me while I worked during the final stretch of this project, to the long hours my father and I spent learning every nook and cranny of the manufacturing process together to ensure a quality product. He's been in manufacturing and quality control for over 25 years, so it's been a real joy to learn from him first hand. I can't thank my father and my mother enough for their support during this adventure!\nThere are those at the resin & plastics shops -- Kyle, Ricky, Glenn, Sasha, Charlie -- who contributed their time towards educating me about resin casting in the first place. There's Chris and Jessie Do, who have inspired and mentored me. They planted the seeds that gave me the confidence I needed to start this business.\nI can't leave out my friends Katy and Trevor, who packed orders tirelessly while I worked. And don't even get me started on Susan. She encouraged me for months to start making dice, and went above and beyond by taking time out of her busy schedule to answer emails and questions while I was setting everything up for the launch. There's also my DM, who created awe-inspiring content, as well as my friend Derek, who set up my first game. He persisted in inviting me to get out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it changed my life.\nThe list could go on forever. Each of the people I\u2019ve named has helped me during this long and winding journey, but there are so many more who have left kind comments, sent supportive messages, or encouraged me along the way.\nThis section is for you.\nIt\u2019s not enough, but I just want to take a moment to thank everyone that contributed, listened, gave advice or moral support. Although I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done up to this point, I can\u2019t take all the credit for the incredible work that would have been impossible without the contributions of my family and friends; I\u2019m so proud of them and everything they\u2019ve accomplished. Thank you all for being part of this project!\n\n\nWe stand in solidarity with those at Kickstarter United, and support voluntary union recognition. Thank you for your hard work, because this platform for creators and those that support them, would not exist without you and your contributions. \nDAY 1 PLEDGES ARE NOW OVER!\nUPDATE: Day 1 Pledges Bonuses have now ended!

If you pledge 3 sets or MORE, you will receive the Merlot D20. \nDespite what you may read about the dice on the internet, they are in fact, inedible.\nThe edges on these dice are sharp -- especially the D4. These dice are not meant for children or to be ingested. Please keep them away from pets, children, feet and mouths. Failure to do so could result in injury or death. \nPlease.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI make multiple sets of dice almost every single day, so I\u2019ve personally encountered many of the issues that will crop up during the manufacturing process. You can see all of my experiments over the past several months on my Twitter or Instagram pages. I have purposefully selected these designs for their stability, so you can be sure that I\u2019ve done my research.\n\nI\u2019ve personally taught the crafters at my facilities how to pour the sets properly, step by step, so everyone involved is using the same process and materials that I\u2019ve been using in my one-person operation since Dispel Dice\u2019s inception. In addition to that, if this project funds, I will be pouring alongside them so that we can continue to make this process more efficient.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent months speaking and training our two facilities to ensure that they\u2019re able to produce a quality product. We will be sourcing a third as well. As with any production or manufacturing process, there may be unforeseen risks or complications, but we\u2019ve done our best due diligence to get ahead of all of them.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, here's where we are:\n\nWe\u2019re able to produce sharp edges stably and efficiently. The dice are beautiful (just look!). The suspension is evenly dispersed. They\u2019re able to match my sample colors almost perfectly every time, though there may be very slight variances between batches.\n\nDue to the fact that they are handmade, there may be small flaws or quirks on the dice or in the number wells. Examples include a tiny hole in some of the number wells (which is painted over), and slight bubbling of the paint in the numbers -- specifically the smaller ones. The painting isn't always perfect on everything, but I will be working closely with the facilities to improve the quality. Nevertheless, I ask for your understanding that there may be a slight difference in the metallic sheen and thickness of the paint on the final products. \n\nLast, but not least, I want to point out that I have already placed batch orders from the facilities and tested their ability to produce quality sets in moderate quantities ahead of this launch. We've been working with them to develop this process for 8 months now. Instead of launching as early as possible, I really wanted to iron out as many kinks as I could ahead of time.

I would love for you to join me live for this last hour and celebrate what we have achieved!\nYou are citizens of Squall's End on a rescue mission to The Isle of Cats and must rescue as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives. Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family, you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together.\nYou will need to manage resources as you draft cards to explore the island, rescue cats, find treasures, befriend Oshax and read ancient lessons. Each lesson you collect will give you another personal way of scoring points, in addition to filling your boat and keeping cat families together!\nTo expand the base game, we are offering a 5 & 6 player expansion adding more lesson cards, cats, treasures and 2 extra boats to the game. Not only does this expansion add support for 2 extra players, but it also adds more variety and options to the base game extending the replayability offered by the game. \n\nThe Isle of Cats is played over 5 days (rounds). On each day the cats will venture into the fields on the island and you have until nightfall to attempt to rescue them through 5 phases of play.\nEach player gains 20 fish.\nEach player is dealt 7 discovery cards, they choose and keep 2, passing the remaining cards to the player to their left. They repeat this process 4 times, but the last time they will only keep 1 card.\nYou will then look at your 7 cards to decide which to add to your hand. The cost is in the top left corner of every card, and if you wish to keep a card, it must be paid for in fish.\nYou can keep as many cards as you like!\nEvery lesson card you kept must be placed face down on the table. Lesson cards are personal objectives allowing you to score extra points at the end of the game.\nNow players take it in turns to rescue cats, each cat requires a basket and a number of fish. Keep going around the table until everyone has run out of baskets, fish, or passes.\nWhen you rescue a cat, you must immediately place it on your boat, the first cat can go anywhere, but after that every cat must touch at least 1 previously played tile.\nYou will need to find a balance between how many cards you keep in the explore stage, and how many cats you wish to rescue in the rescue phase.\nFinally, players will take it in turns to play Oshax and Treasure cards. Treasures offer smaller pieces to fill those tricky areas, and the Oshax are friendly cats that can act as any colour, they just want to have a friend!\nAfter 5 days, you will earn points for completed lesson cards, rare treasures and families of cats (groups of touching cats of the same colour) on your boat. \nHowever, you will lose points for each room on your boat which isn\u2019t filled and any rats which haven\u2019t been eaten!\n\nThe winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game!\nYou can download the rulebook here.\n\nThe Isle of Cats family mode provides a beginner friendly, gateway game which can be played by anyone new to the board game hobby, and children. It removes a lot of the complexity included within the standard game and simplifies the setup, learning curve, and decisions players have to make. \nIt also makes the perfect introductory game, as once you are comfortable with the family mode and are ready for something more challenging, you will already know some of the rules for the standard game. \n You can download the rulebook here.\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Cats solo mode has been designed to provide players with a similar experience to the multiplayer game. You won\u2019t be competing to get the best score possible, but instead you will be faced against your sister! Somehow, she managed to sneak aboard your boat and she is trying to claim credit for everything you have done, it\u2019s going to be a tough week!\nIn the solo mode you will be playing the game in the exact way you would play the multiplayer game, but through a few extra cards and minimal management, you will find yourself competing against a challenging opponent. The solo game includes multiple difficulties allowing you to progress as you get better and is a great way to learn the game before playing with other people.\nYou can download the rulebook here, the solo rules start on page 18.\nIf you would like to read a written preview of The Isle of Cats, then Zatu Games has you covered!\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nElla, Yanna, and Kuma are the inspiration behind The Isle of Cats and lead models.\nFrank West is the designer of The Isle of Cats, he is also the worldbuilder for The City of Kings, art director, and graphic designer.\nDragolisco is the lead artist for The Isle of Cats, creating nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst exploring The Isle of Cats.\nSara Jorge is the Assistant Producer of The Isle of Cats and has helped create prototypes, organise playtests, and assisted with design concepts.\nIan O'Reilly is the primary writer assisting Frank with writing the back stories for The Isle of Cats.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nAll shipping is EU, America, Canada, Australia, and Brazil friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations. We will also do everything we can to keep our UK shipping friendly whatever the outcome of Brexit.\n** Shipping to Brazil is sent as part of a bulk shipment to a warehouse, removing custom fees. However, this does add 2 months to the shipping period.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Russia. If this should change I will let you know.\n Additional copies of the game\nYou may add additional copies of the game and/or expansion to your pledge, and will receive a \u00a35 discount for every extra copy after your first. To do this, please manually increase your pledge to include the extra funds, and if you are outside of the US/UK please make sure you include shipping.

My last Kickstarter, The City of Kings included multiple expansions, custom 3D accessories and was a very big boxed game.

I have allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in printing The City of Kings, World Packs and Vadoran Gardens, I am extremely confident in their ability to manufacture this game.\n\nSHIPPING\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during our last project, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other.

This is the Kickstarter page for A Lie Agreed Upon: The Deadwood Chronicles, a book about the making of David Milch's classic HBO series Deadwood, which recently wrapped up its story with a TV movie, 13 years after its traumatic cancellation. \nWHAT WE'RE MAKING: A book about Deadwood that looks like an old Bible, written by me, with an introduction by bestselling novelist Megan Abbott (Dare Me), extensive footnotes, and drawings by Max Dalton that channel dime novels and Charles Dickens illustrations.\nPRINT RUN: 5000\nUNIT PRICE: $30 per copy\nSPECS: 434pp; black-and-white illustrations; faux-leather cover, possibly with gilded pages\nDELIVERY DATE: November, 2020\nFUNDRAISING TARGET: 150K\nThe cover of A LIE AGREED UPON: THE DEADWOOD CHRONICLES\nABOUT ME AND THE BOOK\nI've been writing about Deadwood for 15 years, starting when I was a TV columnist for The Star-Ledger of New Jersey (two set visits, in 2005 and 2006), and continuing at Slant, Salon, and most recently New York magazine (they flew me to the film set in 2018, and it resulted in an exclusive interview with Milch in which he revealed his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease). \nBut here's the thing: Although I've done numerous books about film and TV--including The Wes Anderson Collection, The Wes Anderson Collection: Grand Budapest Hotel, Mad Men Carousel, TV: The Book, and The Sopranos Sessions--this Deadwood book is something that can't be produced within the commercial system. It's too much of a peculiar, obsessive collector's item/art object. \nAs you can see from the cover mockup, A Lie Agreed Upon will look like a Bible from the early 20th century (it's specifically modeled on my  grandfather's Bible), so that if you read it in public, people will assume you're just refreshing your knowledge of the Gospels. Reverend Smith would approve. \nThe heart of the book is a thoroughly reported history of the series, broken into seven chapters,  plus illustrations, footnotes, an introduction, and an appendix of critical essays on all  the episodes. Here's a detailed breakdown:\nIntroduction. By crime fiction writer Megan Abbott, the bestselling author of Give Me Your Hand, You Will Know Me, and Dare Me, and a staff writer on HBO's The Deuce. Fans of my work will also recognize Megan from her marvelous introduction to Mad Men Carousel. \nChapter 1: Beginnings. David Milch before Deadwood. Covering some of his personal history at Yale, as Robert Penn Warren's assistant, as an acclaimed young writer on Hill Street Blues, as a writer-producer on NYPD Blue and subsequent dramas, then finally pitching a show about Rome to HBO, finding out they already had a show in the works called Rome, and changing his pitch to a Western. \nChapter 2: Pilot. The writing, casting and shooting of the pilot episode. This chapter will include origin stories of the principal cast, Milch's hiring of director Walter Hill, and the creation of the main set at Melody Ranch Studios near Los Angeles. \nChapters 3-5: The Seasons. These chapters will cover the production of seasons 1, 2 and 3, including the addition of new cast members, concerns about falling ratings, controversies over the show's language and violence, and the series' place within the pantheon of early-aughts TV dramas built around antiheroic characters. These chapters will draw on my archive of interviews with principal and secondary actors as well as the cast and crew, including so-called \"below the line\" people who worked in specific craft-oriented jobs and who aren't normally included in a book of this sort. This section ends with the show's shocking cancellation in 2006, and goes into differing accounts of what happened.\nChapter 6: The Wilderness. Wherein Milch tries to get other series going at HBO, with varying degrees of success, including John From Cincinnati (one season), Luck (one season) and Last of the Ninth and The Money (pilot only). Meanwhile, the main cast members move on to other shows, including Justified, starring Timothy Olyphant; House of Cards, costarring Molly Parker, Supernatural, costarring Jim Beaver; American Gods, starring Ian McShane, and Sons of Anarchy, which employed so many former regulars that I've joked was a part of the Deadwood Actors Full Employment Act of 2006.\nChapter 7: The Movie. Self-explanatory. \nAppendix: Recaps. Critical essays on every episode of the show, plus the film. These will certainly contain detailed footnotes on the story; the characters' psychology; the ratio of historical fact to Milch's fiction; Deadwood's kinship to Western movies and literature, the Bible, and Shakespeare; and other fun stuff. Many of these footnotes will be written by me, but there will also be contributions from colleagues who are experts on particular aspects of the show and the history it draws on.\nAs is my policy, the recaps will discuss things that have already happened, but never things that haven't happened yet. That way first-time viewers can use the recap section of A Lie Agreed Upon as a viewing guide.\nAnd now here comes something really cool:\nILLUSTRATIONS\nMax Dalton, an Argentina-based graphic artist and illustrator who did drawings for my Wes Anderson books and Mad Men Carousel, is on board to do a series of original illustrations for this book, based on key incidents in Deadwood. \nThese will be done in a modified version of his signature style, drawing partial inspiration from dime novels and the pen-and-ink caricatures that used to appear in bound editions of novels by Charles Dickens. Here's a rough, early version of a sketch of the shooting of Wild Bill Hickok by the coward Jack McCall. They will appear in the recaps section, always on the page where the event in question is written about, in order to prevent accidental spoilers.\nIllustration by Max Dalton\nWild Bill's Funeral, Illustrated by Max Dalton\n\nUPDATE: We're offering a set of 6 Max Dalton Deadwood drawings as a reward for backers at certain levels. See the Rewards section for details.\nWHAT OUR FUNDRAISER IS FOR\nIt's to pay to make this book. That's it. \nOur expenses are broken into four (4)  sections:\n1. TALENT. This category starts with me, as I'm going to be writing most of the text, and I've already been accumulating material for A Lie Agreed Upon for over a year already, on my own time. (That's not counting all the stuff I've been building up since 2004.) But to do this job right, we will  need to hire a lot of other people, and pay them market rates. On the payroll:\n* A text editor and a project manager (hopefully the same person, though it might end up being two people);\n* A copy editor and a proofreader (maybe the same person, but maybe not; these are related but different skill sets) ;\n* A second interviewer, to handle some of the below-the-line interviews, as well as follow-up conversations and fact checking;\n* A full-time interview transcriber who knows the series and American history thoroughly; we're going to have probably 200 new interviews, in addition to the 50 or so I've already done, and that's a lot of transcription;\n* A historical advisor who will analyze the show's relationship to the historical record, and recommend places to integrate that information into the book;\n* Megan Abbott, for her introduction;\n* Max Dalton, for his illustrations.\nCost: $105K\n2. TRAVEL EXPENSES\nBased on my previous experience doing this sort of book, we're going to have to take a few trips to Los Angeles and other locations (including the real Deadwood in South Dakota), to look through archives, and do in-person interviews with people who prefer not to talk on the phone. It might be me doing the traveling. Or it might be the second interviewer, or the historian. We don't know just yet. We're ballparking a total of six solo trips, though it could be more or less.\nCost: $15K\n3. CREATING AND PRINTING THE BOOK\nWe've priced this out, and the minimum print run that we can accept is 5000 copies, because that would get the cost of each book down to $30, the list price of other books of its type. This estimate includes a small cushion for things to go wrong and have to be redone, because nothing every goes perfectly. We don't want to print fewer copies, because it would make each copy of the book more expensive.  \nCost: $20K\n4. PACKING AND SHIPPING THE BOOK\nWe want to have this book delivered by early fall, 2020, so that it can be a holiday gift for people who ordered it. We've estimated the time to pack and ship 5000 copies at 10 business days, if we have five people each day, all working eight-hour shifts. \nWe also have to rent a storage facility large enough to handle 5000 shrink-wrapped books stacked up on wooden pallets, plus the packers, the tables, and the mailing supplies. Also meals. This is tedious work, and we want to treat folks right. \nThis is the best solution for packing and shipping, financially, because we did a bit of research and realized that if we contract with an independent packing and shipping service, the cost of the book will go up, to probably $45 per unit. Nobody wants that. Better to bite the bullet and get the durn thing done on our own.\nCost: $10K\nWHAT YOU GET IN EXCHANGE FOR A DONATION\n$10 and $20 (Hooplehead and Saddle Bum levels) get you 1 and 2 bars of Soap with a Prize inside, respectively. Frankly, why y'all would just want the soap and not the book and all the other good stuff on here is beyond us. But who are we to judge?\nPackage design by Paula Bonhomme and David Lambert\n$30 (Prospector level) gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, signed. Shipping costs vary depending on where you are in the world. International shipping is pretty darn expensive, but y'all probably knew that already! \n$40. (Schoolmarm level) This level gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon plus 2 bars of soap.\n$100 (High Roller level) This level gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 bars of soap, and a set of 6 Deadwood drawings by Max Dalton (different sketches than the ones that will appear in the finished book). The sketches are printed on 80 lb. off-white paper and packed flat to prevent damage.\n$150 (Madam level) 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 bars of soap, a set of Max Dalton drawings, and a copy of a separate, limited-edition Matt Zoller Seitz book, Dreams of Deadwood.  This is a photography portfolio book, full color, 24 pages, landscape style, with original text not featured in A Lie Agreed Upon.  \nCover of DREAMS OF DEADWOOD\n$200. (Saloon-keeper level.) This pledge level includes 2 copies of A Lie Agreed Upon; 1 copy of Dreams of Deadwood; the set of Max Dalton prints; and a complete set of all 4 fragrances of Soap with a Prize inside. \n$275. (Impresario level.) 2 copies of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 copies of Dreams of Deadwood, the set of Max Dalton illustrations, and 8, count 'em, 8 bars of Soap with a Prize Inside! (Two of every scent.) The 8 soaps are packed in a separate, special old-timey package\u2014an ideal gift for that incorrigibly foulmouthed loved one in your life. By which we mean, they also love Deadwood, not that you should wash their mouths out. \nWe're going to add more pledge levels in the coming days.\nThose of you who have already backed the project will notice that the items you selected are no longer available. That's because we've restructured the levels so that every level up  adds more things, and incorporates everything from all the other levels below that. IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH YOUR PLEDGE to something different, we've been reliably informed that it isn't too hard to do. However, if you want to stick with what you originally signed up for, that's OK with us! \nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nWe have now added International shipping options for some (but not all) of the levels. \nSome of you already backed the project from other countries, in a kind of informal arrangement with me, with the understanding that we'd settle up at the end when the project is fully funded. We can still do it that way, but honestly, it would be much better for the project if you switched your pledge to one of the new categories that has international shipping specified on the pulldown menu. \nThe money you contribute right now towards shipping counts towards meeting our goal. And as you know, every dollar we add to the total increases the chances of this book and all the related stuff actually existing! \nORDERING LOTS OF BOOKS FOR GIFTS OR RESALE\nThis is fine. Just use the \"Pledge Without a Reward\" option and enter multiples of $30 per book, and send me a note saying you're ordering in bulk. I've been told that some folks prefer to do this because they just want a bunch of books and aren't really too interested in the other stuff, and that's fine!  \nHuzzah!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk in this project is not knowing whether a sufficiently large audience exists to fund the book at the level we need to get it done. \n\nThere's also the possibility that an even steeper slide into dystopia could slow down production of the book, but if that happens, Kickstarter projects are going to be the least of our worries. \n\nIf we succeed in funding it, it'll be my ninth book as a solo author or part of a writing team, and the 15th commercial book that I will have been intimately involved in at the level of production, design, or conception. \n\nWhat's new is doing it entirely outside of the commercial publishing business. There are a lot of intangibles involved in that, because it's kind of like becoming an independent businessperson after working on projects for various major corporations. The economics of scale, time management, ego wrangling, and logistics are all different, and there are more moving pieces that I have to be personally aware of. \n\nFortunately, the purpose of seeking funding is so that I can pay professionals specializing in particular areas of book-making to handle their part, rather than doing everything myself, which is the road to ruin, generally. Many of the individuals I'd hire to work behind the scenes are folks I've already worked with in the past, on commercially successful books, several of them New York Times bestsellers. \n\nI think we did a smart thing in deciding to make a book for people who ordered the book, then send it to them directly. That means we don't have to spend time or money trying to get it sold on Amazon or in physical bookstores, figuring out how to publicize it so people can locate and purchase it, pouring money into Facebook ad buys, hiring publicity or marketing people to convince bloggers, GoodReads contributors and/or mainstream critics to write about it, and so on. \n\nWe're cutting out every conceivable middleman here and making an art object that will be delivered directly to the people who commissioned it.

This is one of my very favorite episodes of the series because it feels like a summation of the unsentimental but compassionate attitude that David Milch and his actors took towards matters of the flesh and spirit, as well as the different ways that individuals and communities try to make sense of it.--]"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Deadwood book will contain Luck recaps as well", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Interview with Deadwood Coordinator Mike Watson", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "History Lesson #1: Deadwood Pilot", "update_content": "The following is a sample of the voluminous notes that our historical researcher, Isaac Napell, has been doing for A Lie Agreed Upon.

It has a big speaker and runs on batteries so you can take outside in the backyard and play with friends. And you can swap the software, making it many different instruments in one portable package!\n\n\nMusic Making For Everyone - easy to play, sounds like nothing else\nImagine a gateway drug for people wanting to get into making beats or electronic music. Imagine something deep enough for studio musicians too.\nYou can play the drums or melodies manually (which is better for playing along with an acoustic instrument), or you can use the left knob to select patterns and change the speed to make dance music or hip hop beats.  \nThe pros will get a kick out of the sonic character. The output is 12 bit and it sounds punchy and crunchy like the early MPC drum machines from the 80s and 90s.\nWant LOFI? You got it.\nLet's start with the basics. This video is a nice and slow walkthrough of how the drums work.\nSpeak together\nMultiple people playing music at the same time is so unique and connecting.  Unlike talking, which has us taking turns with each other, music allows us to speak at the same time. Like running through the forest together.\nBitty had to be loud enough to play outside with friends.\nThe speaker that comes on the Bitty is typically used as a car door panel speaker. And it's made of aluminum, not paper.\nWhat do I get? All the software. Play it for years.\nEvery Bitty comes with ALL of the software and samples we've made. You plug it into your computer with USB, select from a library of sound packs, hit upload and boom, new Bitty!\nWe have sound packs like Theremin Bitty, Techno Bitty, Basement Bitty, Trap Bitty, Lofi Bitty Bitty, Beach Bitty, and more on the way.\nSome people suggested selling different Bitty flavors with the software locked, but that doesn't feel right. We'd rather make a thing with a growing library of sound packs so it's a lasting product that stays fresh for years.\nKeeping it fresh is the same reason we made it AAA battery powered. It won't die on you in 15 minutes two years from now. (And you can get rechargeable AAAs too). It can also be powered over USB if you're in your studio.\nSay less\nNite Mode\nThe Kickstarter run of this version will be Edition 1, each one hand numbered. \nIt has premium rubberized knobs. It comes preloaded with the Midnight Bitty sound pack - think synth sounds like the movie Drive soundtrack with some punchy drums. \nYou can swap the software later just like on any other Bitty.\nEarly prototypes of Nite Mode and regular Bitty (no speaker)\nBitty in the Wild\nHere are three tracks made by Trevor Waldorf, aka Hex Eater, from sounds sampled from the Bitty. He is using multiple layers of Bitty sounds with some additional effects (like the washy echos). \nAnd wow! That punch. \n\nGet nerdy on me\nEach sound pack changes the sounds and the mechanics of the knobs (although they are generally similar so it's not confusing).\nThe sounds you see in the demos are combinations of these things: \nSine / square / saw / triangle waves (it's all there, noise too.) \nSample playback - 16khz samples\nPolyphony - 4 voices is easy, depending on the complexity of the patch, 8-16 voices is possible\nFilters - Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Notch\nPatterns / Arpeggiation\n+more in the works\nIt's a platform\nBitty is based on the Arduino platform. So if you wanted to really get in there, you'll be able to edit the code, or write your own from scratch. In fact any sound software already written for regular Arduinos will work.\nBut you don't have to, it comes playable right out of the box.\nFor teachers and parents: if I were a kid and had the choice between a stock Arduino and another one with batteries, amplifier and speaker, and software...\nPeople making faces\nThank you\nThis project wouldn't have happened without many many people. And until today it ran mostly on debt and gratitude! Thank you to Owen Trueblood and Gavin Lund for Rev 1 and Rev 2 of the boards.\n\nOwen Trueblood hand assembling the Rev 1 of Bitty. Gavin Lund debugging the latest Rev 2.\nThanks to AS220 in Providence, Shawn Wallace specifically for giving Nick the technical skills to start Curious Sound Objects four years ago.\nTim Barrass for writing the Mozzi library. Matthew Seaton and Noah Vawter for their contributions to the Bitty code.\nNoah Feehan and Zach Dunham for their sage advice. Dante Fabiero, Gerard Patawaran, Marcelo Coelho, David Robert, Jeff Lieberman, David Cranor, Dan Paluska, Akito Van Troyer, Erik Sorno, and Ella Rinaldo for their friendship and support. Rex Baker for his counsel and good humor. Kate Balug for being a lovely person, an awesome partner, and a fantastic mom. All the Maker Faire people for setting up such a great opportunity to show fun things to a lot of people.\nAll the fine folks at Industry Lab and Kickstarter. \nWell this is a pleasant surprise and is worth an update to this page! Codechangers backed two Education Packs! They run STEM summer camps for students 8-18 and will incorporate Bitty into their curriculum. How fun will that be! Check them out here. And nice to meet you Jason!\nThe latest set of prototypes were made by MacroFab, a company in Houston, TX. \nAnd they turned out great - sturdy, smooth, and on time. Yes, we considered going overseas to save some money, but we would rather pay more for the peace of mind that we will get a quality product on time. \n\nPlay it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're going to work with the same company to make the final ones.\n\nThis plan puts our minds at ease, as they are honest and reliable.\n\nHowever, making thousands of something is a different beast.

With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version.

To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources.

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!  Kickstarter set comes with these exclusive items you won't find in stores later*:  \n* Exclusive content layout and visuals will vary from those pictured on this page.  Exclusive items may be sold by Calliope Games at conventions or online but will not be available through standard distribution.\nEvery copy of the game comes with:\n4 innovative game trays, which connect to form the game board\n36 double-sided Path tiles \n1 Phoenix tile \n1 translucent acrylic First Player marker\n8 Phoenix miniatures \n8 glass bead \"ash\" Life tokens \n7 \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers: 3 Red, 2 Blue, and 2 Yellow\n50 golden Star tokens\n1 Rulebook\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive Set also features these upgrades and additional materials which will not be available as add-ons later:\nAnd every copy of the game will come with these unlocked stretch goals:\nHere's a closer look at some of the premium components included in every copy of the game:\nEight beautifully sculpted Phoenix miniatures\nSeven \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers in three shapes.\nThe unique patented tray allows one tile to be flipped and rotated without disturbing the others.\n*Note that the final appearance of all components and upgrades may change. \nTsuro: Phoenix Rising is built on the foundation of the classic game Tsuro: The Game of the Path by Tom McMurchie.  Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.  There is no extra shipping for one additional copy.  To receive 3-6 copies of the game, manually add double the shipping cost. \nPledge $20 now to be a part of the Tsuro: Phoenix Rising retailer program and receive your full margin plus 4 additional points for your support.  You may choose the Standard Retail Edition or Kickstarter Exclusive Set.  You will also have an opportunity to fill out your order with other Calliope titles at the same margin; FFA $350 (destination USA - See FAQ for details).  Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page. If you choose this option and we determine you are not a brick-and-mortar retailer, you will be charged the difference in price for one standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising after the campaign. No refunds will be issued. Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

From fevered sketches in dog-eared notebooks, the idea for a pulp horror adventure board game was born.\nTo celebrate the 10th year of the conceptual birth of Ancient Terrible Things (ATT), and to coincide with the re-print of a rare expansion, Pleasant Company Games presents a 14-day Kickstarter campaign for backers new and old. \nFor those ready to complete their ATT collections, and for those new to the rusting riverboat, welcome to the journey and celebration of the cult pulp horror dice-chucker!\nSketches, photos and exploration; circa 2008\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOver the years we have developed a strong community of followers on the Kickstarter platform, and we see Kickstarter as being the natural place to celebrate this milestone. Though Ancient Terrible Things is available from selective retailers in the US and EU, the products can be hard to find in the rest of the world. \nStretch goals\nThis campaign does not feature stretch goals, as the the campaign is geared towards offering re-printed and existing content to new and existing backers. \nLimited quantities\nThe campaign will run for 14 days with limited copies available in each tier level. \nQuantities will be adjusted dynamically in each tier level to accommodate overall reprint quantities (500 for the Lost Charter) and available stock (500 ATT base game).\nAll products for this Kickstarter campaign are shipped from the USA, and may be subject to customs compliance in the destination country.\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without exclusive content. AwakeTen KS campaign includes a printable digital wallpaper of the new dice-tray artwork in The Lost Charter 2nd Impression printing, for all pledge levels and  a limited edition promo Encounter card for all backers at Colonel pledge level ($15+) or higher.\n Ancient Terrible Things (2014) is the original Dicequest tabletop game. Set on a jungle river, explorers travel by riverboat to uncover Ancient Secrets. Along the way they will face Pitfalls, Villains, Horrors and Artefacts - all which award fame and madness. The core game features 104 unique cards, 11 translucent dice, game board of the river with its Fateful Locations, 144 tokens, wooden pawns and player boards.\nAncient Terrible Things: The Lost Charter (2015) was the first expansion for ATT and has been out of print for a few a years. As part of this KS campaign, Pleasant Co. Games will be re-printing 500 copies of the expansion.  The Lost Charter introduces travel-friendly cards for all the Locations, solo rules, a 5th playable character, 2 new purple Revelation dice and new game mechanics, including Foreshadowing, Trade Offers and Character Obsessions.\nAncient Terrible Things: Madness of McGuffin (2017) is the latest mini-expansion for ATT. With the release of Konja(2017), the second game to feature the Dicequest game system as used in Ancient Terrible Things, the designer introduced a streamlined re-roll system and  resource dice to the game.\nThese changes have been introduced to ATT through the Madness of McGuffin expansion, which includes two Starting Swag cards for each of the four principle characters in ATT. Along with new white Resource dice and a full set of translucent custom Skullpip dice, the  expansion adds new ways to play with extra atmosphere and suspense.\nMcGuffins' Mask is activated with a white die and two Focus tokens to re-roll two dice.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways. Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and starts to close off the city\u2019s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan \u2014 a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.   \nYou will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don\u2019t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing.  \nWill you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lock down the city before you can escape?\nIn Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan \u2014 by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.  \nPlayers use hidden asymmetric goals to recover the maximum amount of cash during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.  \nClick to Download the Draft Escape Plan Rulebook\nClick to read a draft of the German rules.\nClick to read a draft of the French rules text.\n  LIVE PLAY-THROUGH:\nLive Playthrough with GeekSpiel\nQ&A with designer Vital Larcerda\n.  \n    PLAY\n\n        Click to read their full review on BoardGameGeek.com\nClick for the full write up on BoardGameGeek.com\nLooking to try out your skills in Escape Plan for FREE?

This Unfair expansion brings four new themes to take its replayability through the roof. Mix them with your old favourites, or with each other to discover all new strategies to master in this thrill ride of a game.\nLook out for the Late Pledge button after the campaign ends.\n More details in the Stretch Goal section later in the page.\nThis expansion adds even more replayability to the Unfair base game. With the base game alone, there are 15 combinations of themes for a 4 player game - throw in the expansion and that goes up to over 200!\nAliens have arrived, but they assure us they only want to serve humanity. Help with their research projects and they offer Alien Influence in return, a new type of currency worth 2 points each at game end.\n You can earn Alien Influence by building attractions and upgrades so the aliens can observe us in our natural environment. These are marked with an Alien Influence symbol in place of a star.\nThen use your accumulated influence with the aliens to build advanced technology to improve your park - the price is marked on the pricetag.\nBe careful! If any staff should happen to get any Alien Influence on themselves, they will disappear mysteriously at the end of the round, shuffled back into the Park deck!\nB-movie enables scoring for building panoramas, including those in the base game's 6 themes. With a little effort, some spectacular scenes are possible.\nB-movie adds some useful new features to help you build the right attractions in the right order to complete your panorama.\nMashing up themes on the same attraction can have all kinds of benefits... \n ... all to help you make movies so awful they're awesome.\nDiscover a mysterious valley filled with living dinosaurs, offering exciting new ways to draw a crowd... for a park owner willing to take the risk.\nAdd live dinosaurs to your park! With high stars and low cost, they come with enclosures that are just barely adequate, so each round you must roll to determine if they rampage.\nYou can build electrified fences to properly contain them, or use some careful risk management to keep them under control.\nIf your park is all about dinosaurs you can enhance guest security, or turn it into an island, using a new type of Showcase card - the replacement park entrance.\nThe Old West offers wide open spaces, big projects, sudden riches... and robbery. Quality upgrades represent gold nuggets in this theme pack - discovered, dug up, and spent to improve the frontier town in your park.\nWith an extra lot in your park, you finally have space to build more than 5 attractions. You can even build two super attractions at once!\nThe Western theme doesn't turn on panorama scoring by itself, but when played with a theme that does, like B-movie, the Western panorama cards can be placed in any order to make for some awesome vistas.\nThe sheriff is tough but fair, but even he can't keep the local bandits completely under control\n                                                               Don't like being hounded by the city and their Unfair City cards? Now you can make yourself immune by accepting the Djinni's Bargain.\nPrefer to limit demolitions in your park, but without stopping all interactions entirely? You need better Building Insurance!\nHow about some warning of what the city plans to do to you? A little Prescience will let you peek at the future.\nMore variety in your 2-player games? Just add One For The Pot.\nPlay these in combination with other game changers to tweak the play style to suit your group's preference.\nComponents - ABDW expansion:\n262 cards in total featuring 111 new illustrations\n4 new theme packs of 57 cards - Alien, B-movie, Dinosaur, Western\n4 new Game Changer cards \n30 Alien Influence tokens, in values of 1, 3, 9\n8 Insurance Excess tokens (for use with the Building Insurance game changer)\n1 Dinosaur Rampage reminder marker\n1 Alien Abduction reminder marker\n32 page narrow-format rulebook\nPackage: Base game + ABDW expansion\nThe cover for this expansion joins onto the base game box to create a panoramic scene, and future expansions will extend the scene even further.\nSpecifications:\nCards: 300gsm black core stock, matte lamination, round corners.\nBox: 12\" x 5.3\", 2mm greyboard, matte lamination.\nTokens: 2.5mm greyboard, matte finish.\n Read Neil's full review on BGG here\nListen to The Dicemen Cometh podcast episode here \nThe Unfair base game reached all of its stretch goals, including upgrades to card stock and token thickness, so this expansion for Unfair starts pre-stretched with those same features.\n\nIn the base game campaign, we were able to add two extra theme packs as stretch goals. That was possible because we had been working on the game for five years beforehand.\n\nThis time we have a number of stretch goals to reveal, but we need to warn you that none of them is on the scale of an extra theme pack.\nWe pre-pack Unfair in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to stay tax free for backers and keep shipping costs as low as possible globally.\nUSD$12 for shipping is included in the Expansion pledge tier, and USD$17 in the Unfair + Expansion pledge tier. Backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees in these ranges:\nUnfair is the beautiful and lovingly cynical brainchild of designer Joel Finch. The original base game was literally a 5 year labour of love, designed in no small part because his stupendously fabulous wife Kate wasn't interested in playing Magic the Gathering with him.\nThe Unfair world is a contrast of pure theme park fun, happy childhood memories, and blue skies...\n...and the gritty, impersonal, sometimes nasty world of commerce. What do people say while they knife their competitors? It's just business...\nThis first expansion sees the addition of four theme packs that complement the original set. Development of these four themes has taken place over the last four years, with worldwide blind playtesting beginning in December 2017.\nThe original 6 themes provided 15 possible combinations for a 4-player game. With the 4 new themes, that total increases to over 200 possible combinations!\nThe game looks mostly finished - so why do we need Kickstarter?\nUnfair's large number of deluxe illustrations mean it has a high art cost relative to its sale price, and success at Kickstarter is the way we can recoup that. Without Kickstarter, the budget for art would be significantly lower, and we would need to have fewer unique pieces and/or accept lower detail for many of them.\nSuccess at Kickstarter also helps us to recoup the costs more quickly than sales through retail, so funds can be applied to future development immediately, speeding up the timeline for upcoming expansions. Which is handy, because we have plans underway to fill out the alphabet with a range of new themes and mechanics.\n\nWe can get more eyes on the final result *before* it goes to print, which helps to improve the quality. The base game was improved in many details by the feedback of backers during the Kickstarter campaign, and we hope you can help us there again.\nUsing Kickstarter also allows us to improve the result over the minimum retail product by adding stretch goals, and have a little fun with a few sneak peeks of future packs that we wouldn't be able to justify otherwise.\n\nIn short, with your help through Kickstarter, we can make games more awesome.\nOver 250 playtesting groups provided feedback to help improve and polish this expansion. Thank you to you all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter project. \n\nOur artists have proven very reliable and we have confirmed they can complete the listed stretch goal card illustrations by the end of this campaign, and we won't be pushing them beyond that.\n\nRules are complete and formatted, and only need final blue-ink commentary from our resident grumpy former theme park owner.\n\nBackers' games will be pre-boxed in shipping boxes at the point of manufacture for faster and more consistent shipping. They will feature internal corner protectors to reduce risk of corner damage caused by dropped boxes.\n\nLast time we had some production issues in some of the Kickstarter copies of Unfair. We rectified the issues and replaced cards and components for all the backers that requested them. It was a huge job but we are committed to providing quality games so we did everything possible to rectify the situation. \n\nBut this time we have a longer checklist of things to TRIPLE check, and our factory has committed to improving their quality, and ramped up their Quality Control processes. We own our own card die now, and this is a simpler project. We won't be caught out again. \n\nIf you find you still somehow need any replacement cards we do have some left.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook.

So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde. A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game is currently shipping to backers.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: HATE, Zombicide: Invader, and Arcadia Quest: Riders, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Late pledges available on BackerKit soon.\nWe are Campaign Coins. We make beautiful metal coins and tokens for tabletop games.  \nWe also love meeples. So, we thought... why not make some?\nWe asked our artist and game designer friend Daniel Solis to do the art (he likes meeples too). We then used the experience with industrial casting and antique metal plating which we have brought to all of our coins since 2007, and then spruced them up with the beautiful new enamels we started using in 2015.\nAnd you know what? Even we're surprised by how hecking nice these are.\nMeeple prototypes. They heart you.\nWe think they'll make you smile. You might fancy a special set for yourself (the red ones are pretty sweet). Perhaps you'll go full meeple and get a complete set of all colours to bling out every game in your collection. Maybe you'd just like a collector pack of one of each to line up on your desk to brighten each work day.\nBecause everybody loves meeples. Right? Right. We thought so.\nThe meeples are standard size: 16 mm (3/5 inches) from side to side, and the same from head to feet. They are 10 mm thick (2/5 inches).\nThey are die cast metal, with hand polished edges. We have given each meeple a unique antique metal finish. Each meeple also has its own pattern, which we have sealed with a different translucent colour enamel.\nThis means that when you are gaming, you can tell which ones are yours from whichever angle you look at them. From above, you can see the different metal, and face on, you can see the pattern or the colour.\nMeeple prototype colour line up\nHere are the combos you can see in the lineup photo above:\nRed Hearts with Antique Copper\nYellow Daisies with Shining Gold\nGreen Bamboo with Antique Bronze\nBlue Waves with Platinum\nPurple Stars with Antique Silver\nBlack Skulls with Black Nickel\nAntique plating prototypes, from left: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Black, Purple\nThe meeples stand up straight or lie down flat. And they are heavy! A single metal meeple weighs a hefty 11 grams (\u2156 oz), ten times the weight of a regular wooden meeple.\nIf you look at them side on, you can see where we polish the joins. We finish them by hand, and we like the slight imperfection, they look more handcrafted than machined.\nWe hope the photos do them justice. They're just so pleasing.\nHow do you make a meeple?\nRead about how the meeples came to be in Update #2\nRead about how we refined the meeple designs in Update #4\nRead about our bonus Mt Fuji meeple stretch goal in Update #5\nFor more meeple fun, see our #meepleholiday photo gallery.\nThanks: AUD $1 (~ USD $1)  \nThanks for your support! You'll get the updates and follow our progress. We'd give you a meeple high five too, but meeples don't have fingers.\nLucky Meeple: AUD $10 (~ USD $8)\nWe will send you a single Red Heart Meeple. No other Add Ons are permitted for this pledge, and there are no Stretch Goals for you sorry. Postage is included worldwide.\nMeeple Pack (AUD $30 /~USD $23)\nThere are six types of Deluxe Metal Meeple.

If we reach this goal, everyone who pledges for a Collector Pack or higher will receive a single Mt Fuji meeple in Shining Bronze. We will never this again with the same combo of colour enamel and antique finish. The only way to get this limited edition version is to pledge here. For more about this meeple, see Update #5.\nBonus meeple: Mt Fuji in dark blue with Shining Bronze\nArtist Bonus (AUD $30,000)  \nYOU DID IT! After the Bonus Meeple, we have no more physical stretch goals to offer, sorry. (Really. We're being careful, as we don't want to disappoint you by promising too much).\nBut gosh, we do want to share your generosity with the artist who made it all possible. So, we will pay a 50% bonus to the art fee we have already paid to Daniel Solis. You are all meeple royalty now!\nIf you would like Add Ons, please increase your pledge by that amount. We will check what you want and charge the correct shipping in BackerKit after the campaign ends.\nMeeple Pack: AUD $30 (~USD $23): Either a Colour Pack of 8 meeples of the same colour, or a Collector Pack of 6 meeples, one of each colour.\nNote, rather than buy this as an Add On, you will get much better value by increasing to a higher pledge level.\nMore than Eight Packs?\nWow, you really like meeples. Thank you! If you have gone for our TEN OF EACH or EIGHT PACK pledge levels, and still want more packs, then you get the special Add On price of AUD $22 (~USD $17) for each additional set you add on top of your Eight Pack pledge.\nNote, you must be at the Ten of Each or the Eight Pack pledge levels to quality for this special price.\nSingle Meeples?\nWe are really sorry, but we cannot offer single meeple Add Ons, as the risk of error is too great. If this campaign is successful, we will offer single meeples on our website at a later date. We chose sets of 8 meeples as the most popular number, although we know that different games have different requirements. We hope you can understand our decision. We had to draw the meeple line somewhere.\nKing's Ransom Coin Set AUD $45 (~USD $35): This is a set of 50 of our high quality metal coins, great for use with any Euro-themed board game. The set contains 25 x Copper-1 coins, 15 x Silver-5 coins, 10 x Gold-20 coins, and a single Gold 10,000-coin to use as a first player marker, all in a red velvet bag. Note, the denominations on the coins are tiny, so you can ignore the numbers and change the values to suit different games. We are offering this Add On at a slight discount to our regular website price. For shipping purposes, the weight is the same as two meeple sets.\nOur Board Games with Coins PDF lists the coins needed for popular board games.\nThat's All: We don't intend to offer any other Add Ons, because we want to make it smooth and easy to ship these to you. But, you can buy all of our regular range of coins right now at CampaignCoins.com\nCampaign Coins are brought to you by King of the Castle Games. We are based in Melbourne, Australia. We were the first to bring metal coins to the board gamers and roleplayers way back in 2007, and then as now we manufacture them to the finest possible quality. Our coins and tokens look great, and are hard wearing. We want you to play with them for life.\nIn 2018 we will also start publishing our own line of card and board games, starting with Rochi, designed by James Ernest and Sonia Orin Lyris.\nPlease note: the pledge levels do not include postage. Like many other Kickstarter projects these days, we have decided to charge shipping in Backerkit after the campaign ends. This will allow us to give you the most fair and accurate shipping charge possible, based on the exact weight of your pledge, and the information at the time of shipping.\nOrders from USA and Canada will be fulfilled from America.\nOrders from Europe will be fulfilled from the EU. Customs duties will not apply within the EU.\nOrders from Australia, New Zealand and Asia will be fulfilled from Australia.\nWe cannot accept pledges from South America. We're really sorry, but we don't currently have a fulfilment solution that offers you reasonably priced secure shipping. The meeples will be available from our website if this project is successful, and you can order then.\nSHIPPING ESTIMATES\nHere are our current estimates on shipping costs, based on the data we have right now. While we will be charging you in Australian Dollars (AUD), for clarity we have listed your local currency for shipping estimates:\nAustralia: One set AUD $3 | Five sets AUD $15\nNew Zealand: One set ~NZD $6 | Five sets ~NZD $23\nAsia: One set AUD $6 | Five sets AUD $30\nUSA: One set ~USD $5 | Five sets ~USD $14\nCanada: One set ~CAD $9 | Five sets ~CAD $26\nUnited Kingdom: One set ~GBP \u00a35 | Five sets ~GBP \u00a310\nEU: One set ~EUR \u20ac5 | Five sets ~EUR \u20ac12\nRest of World: One set ~EUR \u20ac6 | Five sets ~EUR \u20ac14\n For a complete photo gallery, please visit our Facebook photo album.\nDeluxe Metal Meeple prototypes: Facebook photo album\nRevised Flower Meeple design", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been making coins since 2007, and this is our fifth Kickstarter.

See the FAQ if you want to get Add-Ons in packs of 10.\nThis the best price you'll get, since buying directly from us will cut out the middlemen.

Some Add-Ons may not be available again.\nWe have plans to support retail and distribution if our margins work, so please message us if you have an opportunity or offer. We aren't sure what the future holds for GROWL, but we love the game and hope you'll support us today.\nShipping is charged after the campaign (when stretch goals are determined and the product is finalized). These are estimates. The game will be about 10 ounces, 6x4x2.5 inches. These prices do not include additional shipping if you purchase add-ons.\nUnited States - $3, Canada - $5, Mexico - $8.50, China - $5\nBackers in *MOST* other countries will be charged about $11. We are EU-friendly (rewards to the EU will be shipped from within the EU).\n4/23/18: A quick update on shipping. My Stamps.com software claims that nearly all international shipments of the boxed games will be under $11. But apparently foreign countries don't always delivery packages for the rates they are supposed to, and may destroy or hold shipments hostage. I had a long conversation with a Kickstarter game creator who has shipped hundreds of thousands of games. He told me the two biggest problem countries in his experience were Russia (he suggested not even accepting backers from Russia), and Brazil (the post office is on strike). Some island countries like Australia cost a lot as well, but I am looking for distributors in these countries to reduce your costs. I will try my absolute hardest to charge the lowest shipping, including shipping from fulfillment centers within those countries or regions when possible. Due to unknown factors that can affect shipping costs, I can at best promise to warn you via update (and email) what the real costs will be prior to charging you. And of course you will be given the opportunity for a refund if you wish. I apologize, but I will also have to reserve the right to refund any pledges that I don't think my shipping partners will be able to fulfill. I will reach out to you directly if this becomes necessary. \nHere are the countries my shipping partner won't deliver to. I can still try to ship there directly, but I can't make promises you will get your packages in a timely or cost-effective manner: Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea , Guinea-Bissau, Haiti , Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine\nThank you. -Joey\nIf you want FREE SHIPPING for GROWL then go to Kickrock.it/growl, get a unique sharing link, and convince a friend to buy the game.

Wouldn\u00b4t it be cool to have a solid glass sphere with the structure of the Universe inside it? The success of our previous campaign \"The Universe in a Sphere\" showed us: Yes! But not only that, we got many requests if we continue making these spheres and if we plan to add more variants. We realized quite fast, that the Milky Way is a must have, especially if you already own the Universe in a Sphere. \nIn this sphere, every one of the 300,000 tiny dots represents an entire Galaxy. Due to the Milky Way being represented by only a single dot within the Universe Sphere, the vast amount of stars per Galaxy is hard to understand.\nNever mind, human can try do understand, so we decided to create a collection of Spheres. We want to go from huge to small, with the Universe in a Sphere as our our big bang, continuing with the Milky Way in a Sphere and only stop if you say: Please stop it, we don\u00b4t need more beautiful glass Spheres. \nHoping, that this will never happen, we already worked on many Ideas like The Sun in a Sphere, The Solar System in a Sphere, Elon Musk\u00b4s Tesla in a Sphere, The Earth in a Sphere, Bacteria/Virus/Molecules in a Sphere, DNA in a Sphere, Atom in a Sphere. So stay tuned and now:\nLet\u00b4s start with \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\"...\nHexgrid Base, LED Set, Round Base\nIf you google the Milky Way, you will find many beautiful pictures, fantastic animations and pretty decent maps. But after some research, you realize, a lot of it is artwork. \nTo make it short, it\u00b4s because a Galaxy is so stupendously huge, that it would take approximately 1,000 years with the speed of light, alone to reach a point from where you might see the other end of our Galaxy. If you stay inside it, you can\u00b4t see the forest for the trees. Especially the center is so crowded and bright, that you have no chance to see through...\nThis sun, our sun, seems to have around 200,000,000,000 brothers and sisters. Two hundred billion stars that rotate with a speed between 20 and 200 kilometers per second in the shape of a giant disk. There are 1 million times more stars in our Galaxy, than dots in one Milky Way Sphere.\nThe diameter of the disk is\n150,000 light years (1,400,000,000,000,000,000 km) and it is\n2,000 light years thin (190,000,000,000,000,000 km). Our closest neighbor is the star Proxima Centauri, which is apProximately 4 light years away (37,000,000,000,000 km). In these dimensions, movement is hard to notice and you can easily forget, that it\u00b4s only a matter of perspective and time .The sun circles the Milky Way every 220 mio years...\nPLAY\n\nVideo:(http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=spiral_galaxy_renderer, music: Unicorn Heads)\nHow do we know, what our Galaxy looks like?\nWe will answer this question, right after the break, in which we show you, what you get if you support this campaign and why we need you.\nWhat do you get?\nIf you support this campaign, you can choose between \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\", \"The Universe in a Sphere\", different bundles, 3D printed bases and an LED Base plate. You can get the LED Base plate by simply adding 10 \u20ac to your pledge. It has different changeable color sets, but does not rotate the sphere. \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\" is still in progress, but the first prototypes and the previous Spheres are already convincingly beautiful. \nThe Milky Way in a Sphere V1, The Universe in a Sphere, Gift Box and Flyer.\nWe will offer the most favored bases of our previous campaign in order to prevent having 300 different variants to pack, like last campaign. If you want a special material or color we do not offer, you can visit our shop at\nhttps://www.shapeways.com/shops/cinks-labs  \nwhere you can order our bases (you will not be able, to buy the LED base plate there). Shapeways is a 3D printing company with its seat in Europe and the US.\nRound Base, Hex Grid Base, LED Base plate, LED Fitting Base + LED Base plate\nLED Base Plate + LED Fitting Base, The Universe Sphere on the LED Base Plate, different colors and materials of 3D printed bases.\nNow we want to lay the groundwork for future campaigns and designs, as well as we want to finish our second Sphere, \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\". We asked a friend, who leads a company for movie post-production, to help us and he has done some awesome work. Together, we designed the second prototype, which looked so impressive, that we are super hyped for the next projects. \nThe two prototype stages\nHow is the Milky Way measured and how much can we see?\nWe wanted to get the data for the Milky Way in a Sphere as detailed and true as possible, so we looked up, how the Galaxy was measured and who did it.\nWe found out, that the ESA (European Space Agency) sent the satellite Hipparcos into space, to map out the stars between 1989 and 1993.\nThat\u00b4s a while back, we thought, there must be more recent data...\nThe ESA sent another satellite in 2013, the Gaia mission, which revealed first data in 2016. We downloaded the data, opened it in excel and wondered, why there are no x-y-z coordinates? After some research, we noticed we have to transpose the data. Longitude (l), Latitude (b), Parallax, geometry, we had to remember the good old school days, learn something new and voil\u00e0, after several hours we were able to calculate our x,y,z.\n\nDistance = d=1/Parallax\nX = d*cos(b)*cos(l)\nY = d*cos(b)*sin(l)\nZ = d*sin(b)\nDoes not look like the Milky Way that much\nWhat do we see here? After some research and a phone call with a professor of the University of Astrophysics in Potsdam, our guess became true, it\u00b4s only a fraction of the whole. That fraction is pretty good measured, but again, the forest for the trees. With that knowledge, we found visualizations of the Gaia data and we became sure, we need more data to design the Milky Way.\nCredits: X. Luri & the DPAC-CU2. Simulations based on an adaptation for Gaia of the Besan\u00e7on galaxy model (A. Robin et al.) https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20110810\nSo we looked up more data. We found different infrared data, stellar density data, data catalogues like tgas and hyparcos, pictures, photos and we built the first prototype. It looked good, but not awesome. Every dot had the same size and the arms were hard to mention.\nWe hired Ronald and his company \u201cBASIS KG\u201d from Vienna, Austria and together we took our images, datasets and 3D models to create the second prototype. \n\"First, we concentrated on the stars in the arms and made them more visible and highlighted. After that, we selected the data from the bright star clusters and gave them more volume by adding stars. Next was to bring the stardust and all the asteroids into the Sphere and we decided to phase them out from the center to the edge\"\nAfter several hours of work we finally got the result and were so impressed, that we instantly ordered our prototypes...This is the first footage of our new Sphere, but we might improve it and its production  during the two month of our campaign.\nStretch goals\n100.000 \u20ac - The Milky Way in a pocket cube At 100.000 \u20ac we want to add the option for tiny glass cubes containing the Milky Way, that cost only 10\u20ac. \n200.000 \u20ac - The big sphere At 200.000 \u20ac we want to add the big 15 cm sphere, which still needs more development\n306.970 \u20ac - Designed product packing \nAt 306.970 \u20ac, the finish line of our previous campaign, we want to hire a company for professional packing, so the bases and spheres fit inside one designed box.\nThe prototype of the big sphere vs. the regular sphere. We will make another campaign for the big sphere, because it needs more development.\nHow is it made?\nTo show the laser etching process, we made a video of a cube, because it is better to see.\nThe Pocket Milky Way\n   The Pocket Milky Way 3x3x1 cm\nTestimonials", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike in the past campaigns, it\u00b4s still necessary for us to produce a larger amount of spheres, to lower the production costs and make it affordable for many people. We have learned, that there will always be costs you can\u00b4t predict and we were really happy, that the initial campaign was such a huge success. \n\nWe also had some trouble with our shipping service provider, who messed up 3000 tracking codes, falsely rejected 200 packages because of the batteries. At the end, we delivered all these Spheres, but this cost us quite some time and nerves. Nonetheless, we are more than confident, that we will also overcome any future hurdles. \n\nTogether, we successfully finished two big campaigns on Kickstarter, but we are still only two brothers, who are in the progress of building their company.

You\u2019re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the \u201cfriends\u201d you\u2019re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?\nDeadwood 1876 is a social deduction game where you'll work with teammates to find and collect gold. But in the end, the team with the most gold will have to fight each other to the death to determine the winner! Will you spend your turns helping your team find gold, or preparing to defeat your own teammates in the Final Showdown?\n2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 13+.\n1 Magnetic book box\n1 Faux leather pouch\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies and Deadwood history)\n3 Wood carved platforms\n9 Wood star pawns\n10 Wood engraved dice\n79 cards (9 Characters, 20 Safes, 50 Deadwood)\nThe game comes in a magnetically-closing faux book. Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter! Second edition published as \"Salem 1692\" in 2017). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 4, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section or shoot us a message.\nYour shipping cost does not increase at all regardless of your location or the amount of add-ons you order. You will receive all add-on items at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery October 2018).\n Examples:\nYou are outside the US and want 2 copies of each game. Select the $43 reward level and pledge $129 ($43 two-copies reward level + $6 reward level int'l shipping + $40 two add-ons of Salem + $40 two add-ons of Tortuga).\nYou are in the US and want 6 copies of Deadwood, 1 copy of Salem, and 10 copies of Tortuga. Select the $110 reward level and pledge $300 ($110 six-copies reward level  + $20 Salem add-on + $170 Tortuga large group add-on). \nIf you want Deadwood and Salem, Deadwood and Tortuga, or one of each game, we have reward levels available for those options.\nOur illustrator Sarah Keele wants to turn you into a Dark Cities character! During the campaign Sarah is offering a limited number of discounted custom portraits in her shop! We will then turn this portrait into a card that you'll be able to use during game play in your copy of Deadwood 1876!\nCustom Character Cards are also available in her shop for Tortuga 1667 and Salem 1692. Discounts are also available in her shop during the campaign for other art from the game.\nFollow her instagram for other giveaways and discounts.\nWe will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on April 10th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after April 10th: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\nGame creation and graphic design is by Facade Games, owned and operated by Travis and Holly Hancock (and our little cheerleader Margo).

This game would not exist without your ideas, feedback, and criticisms. Thank you!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem. We had another great experience with the launch of our second game, Tortuga 1667. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the very 1st edition of the game, the lowest shipping costs we can offer, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We also take your feedback into account before launching production. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! We will do everything in our power to achieve on-time delivery, and we will reach out concerning any unforeseen circumstances. Our first two projects, Salem and Tortuga 1667, were delivered on time to backers as promised. \n\nSalem: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior at the same time as my first kickstarters. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kicktarter.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

This is the nature of manufacturing complex and innovative products. In our case, possible delays may be associated with shipping, customs, and manufacturing.

We have budgeted an ample time frame for this tooling.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to source reliable manufacturing options and set attainable timelines.

You've had it with your day-job and set out to open your own caf\u00e9 in the beautiful, diverse and thriving city of Berlin. Competing against other rival caf\u00e9s, you set out to be the best, no matter the cost!\nIn Seize the Bean, players compete to get the most good reviews by the end of the game. They do so by successfully serving customers in their line. Each turn will provide them limited actions which they can use to attract certain types of customers, gain resources, or even boost their actions for more effective results. By looking for opportunities in the ever-changing city, the players can take the right products and upgrades and build up their shop and clientele to victory.\nCustomers form the heart of the game, providing you with those precious points (good reviews), although potentially the most problems too (bad reviews). Each group of customers represents a Berlin archetype and has their own needs, wants, and abilities. A typical game of Seize the Bean will use 6 of the groups, giving you the potential to customize the city and play a different game every time!\nThe 10 base customer groups are: Hipsters, Tourists, Musicians, Party Animals, Start Uppers, Cyclists, Students, Funemployed Expats, Starving Artists and Performers.\nCurrently, with stretch goals, we\u2019ve unlocked all of the additional 15 customer groups (depicted below): Street Freaks, Tech Nerds, Rebels, Criminal Minds, Authority Figures, Families, Health Nuts, Upper Class, Fashionistas, Media, Friendly Locals, Coffee Connoisseurs, Boardgame Geeks, Boardgame Media and Quality Beasts.\n(Please note that the final two groups, Boardgame Media and Quality Beasts, are promotional add-ons that are not included in the retail base game.)\nThe so-called \u201cchrome\u201d bits of the game are the life-sized coffee beans, miniature milk cartons and hyper-realistic sugar cubes (really, you will want to eat them\u2026 but don\u2019t!). In our prototypes we\u2019ve modeled and 3D printed these ourselves, locally in Berlin, but for a manufactured version we\u2019ll be going with resin, thanks to our unlocked stretch goals!\nMost people think the gimmick of the game is the scoop we\u2019ve demoed at events. However, this was added in order to make the acquisition of beans go faster and be more manageable in the game. In the end, it turned out to be quite a source of enjoyment for our play-testers! (Please note: plastic cups are not included in the game.)\nPlayers earn points for good reviews and negative points for bad reviews. Each review has a fun, thematic message attached, bringing some of the real-life social networking to the game. (Many of our backers will be providing the messages on these reviews!)\nAll cards are 75x50mm in size and will be 300gsm ivorycore with professional grade aqueous coating. The tokens will be 700gsm greyboard with a top and bottom layer of 300gsm including matte varnish, while the dual-layer player boards will have a 400gsm top layer. The beans, milk and sugar cubes will be poly-resin. The barista meeples will be machine cut wood that\u2019s painted, varnished and silkscreened on both sides. The rulebook will be 128gsm gloss paper and the box will be 2mm greyboard wrapped in 157gsm gloss paper.\nWhat to read more? CLICK HERE to see his full review!\nWant to read more? CLICK HERE to see his full review!\nPlayers will take their turns over the course of a game day, serving their customers, taking actions with their barista meeples and acquiring new customers through word of mouth, based on what products and upgrades they have built into their caf\u00e9. At the end of each day, players draw customers from their deck to their line.\nWhen serving, players pay the required (and sometimes optional) resources to earn rewards, activate the customer\u2019s unique ability, and avoid earning a bad review!\nWhen taking actions, players can acquire new resources as well as select customer, product and upgrade cards from the city (the central card pool) to add to their caf\u00e9. These actions can be enhanced by product and upgrade cards.\nWhen applying word of mouth, players can only attract customers who like the products and upgrades they have built into their caf\u00e9. The trick here is that even if a matching customer is not wanted it still must be taken! \nGameplay continues until a set amount of good reviews have been earned, at which point the players take a final turn where they can only serve their customers.\nDon\u2019t like reading rulebooks?

We\u2019d of course need the rulebook to be translated and we\u2019d also love to make unique boxes for each language. We\u2019ve priced this out and we added stretch goals for the foreign language versions.\nWe are proud to say that we are offering backers the choice of an English, German, Spanish or French edition of Seize the Bean!\nOur publishing partner, The Wood Games, will be running a campaign for the Chinese version on February 20th, 2018.\nWant Seize the Bean in another language?

This is a Kickstarter project for an expansion to my hit board game The Networks. \nNot familiar with it? That's okay! Here's a website where you can learn more about the base game, and here's the Kickstarter project from 2015 where over 2,700 generous backers pledged over $100,000 to make it a reality.\nThe Networks is now in its third printing. It's been printed in Chinese, there's a German version in the works, and more languages are on their way. \nLike what you see? If your friendly local or online game store is sold out of The Networks, the base game is available from this campaign.\nYou'll need a copy of the base game to play The Networks: Executives.\nAnd now you're all caught up!\nSo you\u2019ve proven your worth in the past. We know you can run an ordinary TV network. Big deal.\nWe have a bigger challenge for you. Here are 12 unique Network Executives, each with their own weird characteristics. Every Executive has powers, but they also have significant liabilities. Can you master each Executive\u2019s idiosyncrasies, draft the best Season 0 cards, claim your true status as a Mogul, and come out on top?\n           The Networks: Executives adds three major components to The Networks: Executives, Season 0 Cards, and Mogul Cards.\nThe Executives are the biggest addition to the game. The expansion comes with 12 Executives in the box. Each one will significantly change the way you play the game by giving you a set of distinct powers and liabilities.\nYou can play as Flix, which turns your network into a streaming service that lets you consider all your Shows as being in their proper time slots... but every time you switch genres within a time slot, you lose Viewers.\nYou can play as Beeb, which turns your network into a state-run enterprise that tends to generate revenue. But because you now have a lot of bureaucracy to deal with, you must use a rondel to choose your actions.\nYou can play as Telethon, which turns your network into a public broadcasting network. You may not hold Ads in your Green Room. But you may hold a telethon once per season to ask other players for money, in exchange for powerful Sponsorship Tokens. If they don't give you money, you get to keep the Sponsorship Token to use yourself.\nAnd so on. With all the Executives in the game, the amount of challenge and replayability grows enormously. \nThe Season 0 Cards are a new way to begin the game. Instead of everyone starting with similar Shows, Stars, and Ads, you will now begin the game with a draft. Everyone starts with a hand of 4 Season 0 Shows, and chooses one as their 8 pm Show. Most Season 0 Shows get you Stars, Ads, and/or Money, but have no genre and give you no Viewers. Others have a genre and Viewers, but get you nothing else.\nOnce you've selected your 8 pm Show and received anything it gives you, you'll pass the remaining 3 Season 0 Cards to the player on your left and receive 3 cards from the player on your right. Everyone will now choose their 9 pm Show, and so on.\nThis starting draft ensures that players begin the game with completely different setups. Some players may begin with a stocked green room, but no Shows with Genres. Other players may get shows with Genres to get a head-start on their Genre Bonus, but with little in their green room.\nWhy is the race to a Genre Bonus important? Because of the third addition to the game: Mogul Cards. These are effectively supercharged Network Cards. At the start of the game, you'll deal out a number of them to the table equal to the number of players plus one. These will be the only Mogul Cards available in the game; you will not replenish these between Seasons.\nYou get a Mogul Card by either getting your first 5-Show Genre Bonus, or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. You can no longer draw Network Cards or trade in money for Viewers after a 5-Show Genre Bonus, but some Mogul Cards still let you do that. \nMogul Cards even out some lategame swinginess present in the base game and give players a long-term goal to shoot for.\nWith these three huge additions to the base game, The Networks becomes a much deeper and more replayable game!\nWant to know more? Here's a draft of the rulebook for the expansion!\nWant to try it? If you have a copy of the base game, here's a free PNP of the expansion! \n    \"If you ever thought what your damp, shoddy, and structurally unsound public access TV station experience needed was to give more attention to the equally shoddy and unsound eccentricity of its management, then you're in luck! Because that's what Executives is all about.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"The Executives adds a ton of variability and exciting new strategies to the base game! The wide array of player powers and Season Zero starting options makes every player's game feel unique with interesting and challenging decisions. The addition of Mogul cards give players powerful rewards to work towards, and the new shows inject welcome new content for regular players. More than an essential expansion, The Executives is a reward for Networks fans!\" - Danielle and Jake Bock, Draft Mechanic\n\"When we played it was obvious that this expansion gives The Networks a ton of replayability. This is totally an expansion you need if you like the original game.\" - Gameosity\n             \"...The Networks is a well crafted card-drafting game. The game remains engaging throughout the entire playing time, and the escalating strength of the three Show decks gives a nice trajectory to the strategy/scoring.\" - The Opinionated Gamers\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game... I\u2019m impressed with what Gil Hova has done in The Networks and look forward to seeing how it will do on Kickstarter. He\u2019s made a solid game with a great sense of humor. And yes, it was difficult to cancel \u201cAn Hour of Shouting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t bring in the viewers I needed. There\u2019s no room for sentimentality on the Networks.\" - Indie Cardboard\n\"The Networks is, quite literally, my favorite Euro-style game. Gil Hova has done what many have found unthinkable, combining a deep economic game of resource management with sharp humor and an incredibly engaging narrative. It's a perfect blend of mechanism and theme. It is, in short, UHF: The Euro Game. And you need it in your collection.\" - Your Moderator Chris, Flip the Table podcast\n\"If you're looking for some lighter fun with a backbone, and fantastic dad puns, you can feel good spending an hour of your table time with it... I think Gil's game is smart, well-designed, and it sneaks in a challenging game under the cover of humor.\" - Heavy Cardboard\n\"With screwball humor and well-developed mechanics, this game offers both charming flavor and solid design. The Networks is basically UHF: The Board Game. It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"All-in-all, I really enjoyed The Networks. It is approachable, funny, and smart all at the same time. I know that this is a game that I can bring out with newer gamers because they will have a blast with the theme, yet I can also bring it out with more hardcore gamers due to its subtle depth. Gil Hova of Formal Ferret Games has created an impressive gem; One which points to a bright and successful future for this indie publisher. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of cards and new ideas will make their way into future expansions. Any game that can make me want more while still feeling like a complete and final product has something special going for it.\"- Meeple Mountain\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Like an episode of Game of Thrones, this game is addicting and leaves you wondering how the last 60 minutes flew by so quickly. The Networks is must-see-TV and I highly recommend you check it out.\" - League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"...it\u2019s strong in all its elements \u2013 theme, gameplay, strategic challenge, accessibility, length, graphics, humor \u2013 across the board, making for a fantastic game that\u2019s greater than the sum of its already solid parts. A game of The Networks is more fun than drinking from the fire hose, and in the end, fun is what it\u2019s all about.\" - Up With Meeple\n  At this pledge level, you can stay subscribed to updates about the game.

I heartily encourage you to consider buying the base game from your favorite game store. You'll support their business, and you'll be familiar with the base game by the time The Executives arrives at your door!\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. \nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name an Executive!\nHere's how it works. Each Executive is double-sided, with a female figure on one side and a male figure on the other. Each Executive has a stock name for their power, e.g. Mr./Ms. Rich, Mr./Ms Cheapo, Mr./Ms. Telethon, and so on. But at this level, you'll supply us with the Executive's real name, like \"Martha Higgenbottom III, Esq.\" \nYou're welcome to choose your own name, the name or nickname of a friend or loved one, or a fictional name you just think sounds cool. I will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name a Network!\nHere's how it'll work. There are 5 player boards, just as in the base game. These player boards will be divided into a Network Name board, showing the name of your network and your player color, and an Executive board, reminding you of what powers you have.\nThe Network Name boards will be double-sided. The existing network names from the base game (U62, VCK, PKW, ICS, and MOO) will still be on one side of the board, but the name you select will be on the other, along with a brand-new design.\nI will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nWant more copies of the game? You can add them on here!\nI will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to help manage add-ons. So while you can pay for these add-ons by increasing your pledge, you can also wait until the campaign ends. Either way, you'll submit the add-ons when you give me your mailing address. Then, if your pledge isn't enough to cover the add-ons, BackerKit will prompt you to cover the difference. \nI used BackerKit in my previous campaign for Wordsy, and I found it made my job exponentially easier. Hopefully it will help you out as well! \nNote that all these prices are without shipping. I will calculate add-on shipping costs closer to the end of the campaign.\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks base game for $50 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks base game to your pledge) by adding $90 to your pledge.

Instead, they'll be packaged in external expansions that will be available once the expansion is out in stores.\nThis means the stretch goals below are not exclusives. However, they will be tougher to get ahold of than the base game or expansion, so this is your best opportunity to pick them up! \nCOMPLETE! At $30,000, the project has been officially funded. Hooray!\nCLEAR! At $40,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will now receive 20 clear plastic cubes to replace the black timing cubes from the base game. A lot of people who play The Networks like to place their timing cubes directly over the number of viewers they're getting that season, in case they have a show on at the wrong time slot. Transparent cubes will make that a lot easier!\nCOMPLETE! Meet the Gorilla! At $50,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 13th Network Executive.\nThis character is the 800-pound gorilla. When playing, you will get extra money at the start of each Season ($2M per player in the game), and extra Viewers at the end of the game (1 Viewer per player in the game). The downside? You go last every Season, regardless of your score. Quite a challenge!\nCOMPLETE! Meet Continuum! At $60,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 14th Network Executive.\nThis character is a time traveler! Once per Season, you may spend money to run your time machine to take two actions on your turn. If you don't do that during the Season, you may run it at the end of the Season to consider one of your Shows as being in its proper time slot.\nWhen you run your time machine, you'll take an Anomaly card and put it on top of the Star Deck. Any player who gets that card, either through drawing from the top of the Star Deck, or in the following Season, when the card becomes one of the Stars available to Sign, puts it in their Green Room. You can spend an Anomaly to get two actions on your turn.\nCOMPLETE! At $70,000, we will give each Network Executive its own logo! This will make them easier to distinguish from one another.\nI have a signature up there, but they won't necessarily look like signatures. Rich may have their name written in diamonds, Butcher will be sharp and maybe drip something red, and so on. It's going to look cool!\nCOMPLETE! OK, this one is exciting. At $80K, I'll provide replacement scoring markers in all colors that will replace the squares that came in the base game. These scoring markers will look like cute little TVs! And they'll still stack nicely like the original discs.\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nCOMPLETE! ...and here's the companion to the $80K stretch goal! At $90K, I'll provide replacement turn order marker in all colors that will replace the discs that came in the base game. They'll look like little remote controls!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nAt $100K, you'll get a new Season Marker that will replace the current one. It's going to look like a TV tower!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nWhen I launched this Kickstarter, I was going to ship out the base game along with Executives, in the same package. But at $125K, I will be able to manufacture the base game first, get that on a cargo ship ASAP, and deliver it to you in a separate package a few months before Executives!\nIn a week or two, I will have a better estimate of when I can fulfill the base game if we reach this stretch goal. Right now, it's looking like we can deliver it no later than April 2018, possibly sooner.\nThis stretch goal will only affect folks who pledge at $75 and up. \nAt $150K, all backers who pledge $29 and up will get all starter Shows, Stars, and Ads from the base game, with special rules on how to incorporate them in Networks: Executives!\nThis stretch goal has been requested by a few backers. I had to figure out a way to smoothly incorporate them into the experience, but after some testing, I think I have it.\nAll Starter Shows will now all be gray \"no-genre\" cards, but will have the same names and art as from the base game.\nIMPORTANT - If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, and you want to back at the $29 or $35 levels, make sure you pledge at the International Executive or International Executive with Bonuses levels. Those will give you better shipping rates!\nNote that there's a slight omission in the pledge level bullet points for the International Executive pledge level. There should be a bullet point for a physical copy of the On the Air expansion.\nFor this campaign, I am providing a $7 discount on shipping for all backers. This won't reduce your shipping cost to $0, but I hope it will take most of the sting out of the shipping bill.\nIf you're backing in Canada, you will not have to pay any extra charges beyond shipping. All rewards will ship from Starlit Citadel, based in Vancouver.\nIf you're a customer within the EU, your rewards will ship from within the EU. This means people who live in EU-member countries will not have to pay VAT. Hooray!\nKeep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within the continent of Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are in the EU and choose either the $29 or $35 pledges, your package will not be tracked by default, as that increases shipping costs significantly. If you fall into this category and prefer your package to be tracked, message me and we can work something out.\nOne more note on current events: At the time of this campaign, the UK is still part of the EU. The current plan is to ship all EU rewards (including UK rewards) from the UK. \nIt's unlikely that will change by the time of fulfillment, but if it does, I will send UK rewards from within the UK and EU rewards from a different fulfillment center within the EU. \nEither way, if you are in the EU right now, you will not have to pay VAT!\n   Gil Hova - Game Designer\n Travis Kinchy - Illustrator\nHeiko G\u00fcnther - Graphic Designer\nKickstarter Page Graphic Design\nDaniel Newman\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nGil Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nCarrie Margulies\nJosephine Stewart\nMain video animation:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video music:\n\"Magic Forest,\" \"Enter the Party,\" \"Eighties Action,\" \"Surf Shimmy,\" \"Egmont Overture (Beethoven),\" \"Malt Shop Bop,\" \"DarxieLand,\" \"EDM Detection Mode,\" \"Teddy Bear Waltz,\" and \"Lost Time,\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have three successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks' base game, Wordsy, and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. All of my projects have shipped to backers around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks: Executives will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are mostly done. This game is less than a month away from being ready to be sent to the manufacturer. In fact, I will begin the pre-production process with my manufacturer during the Kickstarter campaign, which should save us some time.\n\nSecond: One lesson I learned since the original Kickstarter campaign for The Networks was a better understanding of manufacturing and quality. Since then, I've switched manufacturers. Ever since the second printing of The Networks, I've used Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. I've also used them for my game Wordsy. They deliver incredibly high-quality products on time.\n\nThird: I will be using several board game fulfillers to deliver The Networks: Executives to the US and most of the world. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. \n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics. I've used OTX to deliver two printings of The Networks and the first printing of Wordsy, so I know they're reliable.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Thank you for keeping an eye on the campaign!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Business Partner", "descp": "This level is only for retailers!

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

Optimized sheets now consume 15% less ink!\n  WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nThe best thing you can do to help improve Overworld is to back our project. The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world. We would not ask for your pledges if we were not confident in our ability to fulfill the obligations we have set forth for ourselves. We have worked hard to hone our craft and learn everything necessary to produce quality games at competitive prices and at last we have the tools we need to do so. Now, we need your help to make it all real! Our customers are our #1 focus and we are honor-bound to provide the most friendly & prompt service and communication we possibly can. \nPlease do not hesitate to contact us on Twitter @MagicMeeple, find us on Facebook.com/MagicMeepleGames, send us message directly on Kickstarter, or you can even email me directly at ian@magicmeeplegames.com!  \nYou can learn more about Magic Meeple Games HERE.  \nMost of all, we want to thank each and every one of your for your belief and support in this project!

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Be sure to keep up with us on our website to see our next project.\nIn this project our scientists have captured the essence of a genuine \"Fog Monster\" and transferred it into a marvelous machine. Now with the flick of a switch you'll see fog creep and crawl across your game terrain creating immersive atmosphere like never before. Prepare yourself for new gaming adventures in mysterious Fog!\n  Easy to use, just add water and watch as the fog creeps across your terrain! (Dwarven Forge Sewer terrain pictured)\n\"Fog Monster\" Features:\nColorless - Will not stain or leave an oily residue on your terrain.\nOdorless - No unpleasant burning smell.\nRuns on water - No expensive formula or \"juice\" to purchase.\nCool low lying fog has the same creeping effect as dry ice.\nLong lasting - Over 3 hours of continuous fog (Fog Monster version).\nAdjustable volume - You control how much or how little fog you want. The longer it's on, the denser it becomes.\nInstant - Fog instantly begins pouring out when it's turned on and stops when it's turned off.\nPLAY\n\nWhich Monstrous Fog Machine Should You Buy For Gaming?\nIt depends on your game play. There are two Fog machines in this project for two different playing styles. Both machines use the same internal components to make fog.\nThe first machine is the \"Fog Monster\" which uses a pipe system to deliver the fog into your game. This design allows you to hide the pipe behind your existing terrain pieces so that the fog enters like it is part of the natural environment.\nThe second Fog Machine is the The \"Dark Crypt\" Fog Machine. The Dark Crypt is meant to be placed in the game terrain and produces fog that exits through the doors and windows.\nUpdate: Smaller clear pipes system now available in the Fog Works Pipe Pack Add-On , see the prototype video below.\nOther Uses for the Fog Monster Fog Machine:\nPhotography\nFilm\nSpecial FX.\nPLAY\n\n How Does It Work?\nWith the simple turn of a switch the Fog Monster will immediately begin producing Fog. Fog Monster uses an ultrasonic transducer that atomizes ordinary water and turns it into a cool dense fog that rolls across your game terrain with creeping, crawling ground effects. (Technical explanation of the process found here.)\nNOTE: For players with wood, card game tiles and boards, paper or cardboard terrain. Fog is humid air. Fog will cause moisture build up.  Owners of paper or wood based game pieces should take moisture build-up into consideration before deciding to use fog in game as fog moisture may cause paper or wood based pieces to peel or warp.\nUpdate: Cardboard and wood users please watch the video below for possible compatibility with terrain using our Flexible Tube Kit Add-On.\nPLAY\n\nWe have not found any problems from moisture build up on nonporous game pieces that use water or oil based paints. We have used wax paper under our set to protect any porous, wooden, or cardboard, table top surface from moisture.\nPower Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n  Power Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n   In depth overview of Fog Monster on Dwarven Forge Sewer Terain\nPower Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n    See a Featurette of the Dark Crypt Fog Machine.\n          Fair shipping charges.\nBased on international and domestic requests shipping will be collected  after the campaign ends. This will bring fair pricing to everyone and will not artificially inflate the campaign with shipping costs. You can see these approximate prices below.\nDelivery Options\nIn the USA Some rewards come with free shipping as listed. These will be delivered to our warehouse in the USA by ocean shipping, then shipped by USPS to your address. However, you also have an option for rushed air delivery direct from our factories fulfillment center at the additional cost below. (Note: If you choose express, instead of the free shipping, it will be additional as per below.) Direct shipping from our factory will start once all components are finished and placed in boxes (See approximate shipping times and prices below).\nAll International buyers must choose air delivery direct from our factories fulfillment center as per the pricing below. We have worked hard to get this pricing and save you money. For some the air shipping is cheaper than waiting for ocean shipping. All duties, taxes, and or VAT will be the sole responsibility of the buyer.\n  The prices below are approximate and reflect one Fog Machine only (either plastic or resin). Additional rewards may increase shipping.\n   Stretch Goals\nAs Kickstarters go stretch goals are a great incentive, however the molds required to make them are also very expensive. If a manufacturer were to offer all stretch goals from the beginning they either have to set the project cost very high (perhaps prohibitively) or set it low and take the risk that there will be a windfall of profit to manufacture everything. If there is not they may end up raising just enough money to fund the cost of the molds! This is why we are offering only the fog machines to begin and stretch goals after we have achieved the cost of the molds and production costs.\nCredits: Promotional video music \"With Honor\" (Heroic Score) used under license by Really Slow Motion. - Music \"Reverie\" in Dark Crypt Featurette by Vindsvept.

We formed Real Game FX because we love games and wanted to deliver real world and special effects that we believed would add immersion to tabletop games. \n\n As an experienced manufacturer we looked at the success and failure of a number of Kickstarter projects and saw potential problems that came from offering too much too soon. Additionally we saw that shipping funds being included in the overall funding goal artificially inflate the project as shipping costs do not contribute to covering the actual manufacturing cost.\n\nBy starting the project with only the Fog Machine rewards we know that when the project funds we will have covered the actual manufacturing costs. This assures us all that the project is now funded and ready for delivery to our customers.\n\nOnce we fund past the project amount it then opens up more project rewards and just gets better for everyone since we are then able to get preferred pricing on additional molds from the factory and offer more to our customers.\n\nIn short, we want what everyone wants and that is a successful project. We will use our 11 years of experience in manufacturing, customer fulfillment, and support, to avoid the pitfalls that newcomers often experience.

Over the last year and a half we have loved playing it at conventions and chatting with fans about their best investigations, biggest blunders, and more.\nIn many of those conversations, you told us that you want more. More Means Cards, Clue Cards, Scene Tiles, Events, and Roles. This expansion provides exactly that!\nDeception: Undercover Allies expands the base game by bringing you the following:\nAll of the new cards were designed with a goal in mind of bringing more balance to the Murderer's chosen weapons. We have added many more cards to make the less chosen causes of death (like Illness/Disease) more viable options adding more uncertainty to the game and creating more interesting end game narratives.\nWe've also got a ton of Stretch Goals ready to go to add more fun and charm to a game that so many of our fans love.\nThanks for looking. Thanks for playing. And thanks for your support!\n                                        Add-Ons\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.\n At some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nRegional Theme Packs\nInfluenced by Deception fans from all over the world, we've created add-on card packs inspired by regions outside of Hong Kong. Add some local flavor to your game with these Regional Theme Packs! Be sure to check out the various reward levels, some of which include add-ons for discounted prices!\nMarker and Badge Upgrade\nLooking for ways to bling out your game? This is the add-on you are after! Metal badges to replace your cardboard punchouts and plastic (or resin) microscopes to replace the bullet markers brings your game of Deception to the next level.\nSleeves\nEnough sleeves to protect your game. Add $8 for sleeves to outfit the base game (All Role Cards, Means Cards, and Clue Cards). Add $4 for sleeves to outfit the expansion (All Role Cards, Means Cards, and Clue Cards).\nPremium card role deck made by Board Games Maker.  High quality board game printer with capability to print as few as one copy of a game.\n                                                           Click above to read the review!\n            Cost:\nWhile we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking:\nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time:\nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, we will not release the game to retail stores until at least two weeks after the last U.S. shipment has gone out. You will not see the game on Amazon before you have it.\nOther:\nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had some great success recently, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Yes, you can wait for this to be available at your favorite online retailer, but we will be including some exclusives that you will not get otherwise and at a price 20% lower than the MSRP of $29.99. Plus, the game should be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer, And finally, we're really nice people - just ask our mothers.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought 10 games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Avenue was released at Essen 2016 and the English language version of the game quickly sold out when it reached US stores. We've brought Avenue into the universe of Kodama and added a few twists to make this great game even more enjoyable.\nThe enchanted forest of the kodama is flourishing. But with so much growth, the ancient paths to the sanctuaries within have become overgrown and lost. Now the forest guardians call upon you, their loyal kodama, to restore these paths. Help your kodama build these paths, gather offerings for the guardians, and win their favor. \nKokoro is an exciting family game that can be played with up to eight players (thank you for unlocking the stretch goals)! Each player has a forest map to draw their paths and turns are simultaneous so the game plays quickly. Connecting your sanctuaries to offerings will gain you favor. Choose wisely because you never know exactly when the sanctuary will score. And you shouldn't be too greedy, if a sanctuary is not connected to more offerings than your previous sanctuary, you lose points!\n    And we are very confident that people that enjoy Kodama will love Kokoro, so we are including a special set of Kodama cards in each copy of Kokoro sent as rewards for this project.\nNote - the Kodama & Decree cards shown here are included in the Spirit Compass ($19) and higher Pledge levels.  The Kodama Deluxe Cards are a different set of promo cards (detailed below) and are included in Grove Companion ($26) and higher pledge levels.\nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is a game for 2-8 players that plays in 15 minutes. Designed by Eilif Svensson and Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby, and originally released as Avenue. Kokoro includes all the rules of Avenue, but with dry-erase boards instead of paper scoring sheets. Kokoro also introduces a new \"B-side\" forest map, with a variable set-up that gives you 90 different starting configurations. \nAnd as our first stretch goal, we are introducing a new mechanic - decrees.  Decrees give everyone new path drawing option(s) and/or scoring rule(s) for each game. With the dry-erase boards, random set-up and decrees, you can play as much as you want and always face a new challenge.\nFor more information, we encourage you to view the videos directly below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.\n  These reviews were originally posted for Avenue - Kokoro is the same game, but also includes two expansions with more options to increase replayability. \n                                                  Note that anything marked with these symbols are:\nPromo - an item that Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Essen) will get in their rewards, and will not be included in the retail edition of Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama. These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nKickstarter Exclusive - an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Essen), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is the 38th project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 37 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is a proven game, Avenue designed by Eilif Svensson and Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby. We've made this great game even better so you know the game experience you are getting.\nThis game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nThe game features art from the incredibly talented Kwanchai Moriya (Kodama: The Tree Spirits, Capital Lux, Catacombs, and Dinosaur island). \nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. Prices include US shipping. \nThis project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Indie Boards and Cards on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more! \nFOREST CROSSROADS: (Pledge $1 or more) Thanks for the support!\nSPIRIT COMPASS: (Pledge $19 or more) One copy of Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama with all stretch goals.

While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out before Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process. \nIf you want Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \u2013 all you have to do is sign up for the Essen email list by giving an email address here. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pickup (NOTE: we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). \nAll the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. \n                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 38th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Our refugee weavers respond well to the challenge of learning this skill.\nFinishing: when a rug is finally cut from the loom after months of weaving, we triple wash the rug using cold water, then press it to ensure it retains its intended shape.\nOver one million knots in this rug have been individually inspected for quality prior to final shipment\nOur Story\nThe Anka Cooperative has already had an extraordinary impact on women\u2019s lives.\nOne of these women is Neriman from Damascus. Neriman is in her early 40s and has six children. Unlike many of her unfortunate relatives, she made it safely to the Adiyaman refugee camp in Southeastern Turkey. Neriman is college educated, and prior to the war she worked for many years as an accountant. But in the camps, of course, there are no accounting jobs, no freelancer websites to apply her trade. Idle time brings painful memories. She jumped at the chance to work at the carpet workshop. It\u2019s a new skill, but she is learning\u2013\u2013and just as important, she is earning.\nNeriman is paid the same as her Turkish counterparts. She is saving to buy gold earrings for her daughters, and hopes to save for a home for when they return to Syria. Neriman represents the 250 Anka weavers who have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances, and are the reason Anka exists.\nWhere We Work\nOur workshop in Sanliurfa empowers 25 women in a safe, clean environment\nSanliurfa: The Sanliurfa camp has a capacity 10,000 and a current population 14,000 living in containers. The camp has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and even a TV. It's a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshop is in an activity center that also houses an art room, restrooms and laundry facilities. We employ 25-30 weavers in a well lit and ventilated hall with windows and A/C.\nNeriman weaves with her daughter after school in one of our six workshop tents in Adiyaman refugee camp\nAdiyaman: The Adiyaman camp has a capacity of 20,000 and a current population 29,000 living in tents. It has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and TV. It's also a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshops are in six tents. We employ 225 weavers in a well lit and ventilated tents with windows and A/C.\nOur future site in the Gaziantep Refugee camp in S/E Turkey\nComing in 2017, Gaziantep: This campaign will allow us to expand. We have been approached by camp management to expand our training and empowerment model the refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. This expansion will cost the Anka Cooperative over $100,000 for looms, supplies, training, transportation, instruction, etc.\nThe Three Pillars of The Anka Cooperative\nEmpowerment Through Employment: The weavers love their work, not only for the income, but also because it provides companionship and a place to share laughs and to stay active. As a skilled weaver can weave up to 10 sq feet per month, an 9'x12' rug will employ one weaver for nearly one year. Weavers are paid the exact same as Turkish weavers.\nThese women proudly display this rug they crafted for an Embassy in Turkey\nCultural Integration: The Anka Cooperative helps refugees learn traditional Turkish language, culture and customs by learning the craft of weaving and by interacting daily with Turkish teachers. We partner with other charities to expand our reach beyond the refugee camps.\nMany of our rugs will delight children of all ages\nEducation & Awareness: We use our proceeds to support charitable organizations that tell stories of refugees' lives and struggle for dignity. We further strive to share our fundamental belief that empowerment and dignity comes from work, not a handout. We teach women to fish, we don't give them fish.\nTeaching Her How to Fish\n  Rewards  \n$25: Rug Coasters\nReflect on your impact with every sip when you back us at this level\n  $50: Framed Rug Fragment\nShow your support for Anka by hanging this handmade carpet fragment in your home or office\n  $250: Carpet Christmas Stockings\nStunning and meaningful Christmas stockings are made from world class handwoven rug fragments.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nWe have a variety of already woven rugs we are offering as rewards.

While we're thrilled about the possibility of helping so many more refugees, the cost of establishing a new operation is challenging. Kickstarter provides us a unique platform to raise awareness about our approach to sustainably helping refugees.\n\nOur Team \nFatima, Hind and all the refugees we work with\nFatima and Hind both arrived in the Sanliurfa refugee camps almost in 2012.  After a struggle of several months, Hind came to the camp from her hometown of Hama\u2013\u2013a city which dates back to Biblical times. Fatima arrived from Edlin\u2013\u2013this town was one of the first to rebel against the Assad regime. Since they began weaving in 2013 they have become the very best of friends. Both in their mid 30s, the ladies enjoy their work as they laugh and socialize. They represent the 250 Anka weavers that have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances. It\u2019s an honor to have them on our team, as they are our reason Anka exists.\nNeslihan, CoFounder and Volunteer CEO\nAs the founder of Woven Legends, Neslihan has been producing high quality, hand-crafted carpets for over 35 years and has won numerous international awards for her carpets which are considered to be among the finest in the world. Neslihan has often been credited with birthing the rug renaissance in 1980\u2019s by exclusive use of handspun wool and natural dyes.\nIn 2012, she approached local officials in Turkey in order to teach weaving skills to Syrian refugee women at the camps. As an American and a native Turk, Neslihan feels a personal and moral obligation to support the Syrian refugees in Turkey. Through Anka, she has pioneered the idea of sustaining their livelihoods by promoting the art of carpet weaving. Her personal rapport with the refugees convinced her that Anka can expand from serving 250 refugee women to empowering 20,000 refugees by 2020.\nNeslihan has one son, Kent, and considers the tens of thousands of women she has empowered over the decades as her many daughters.\nJosh, CoFounder and Volunteer Chief Strategy Officer \nJosh and friends in Sanliurfa camp - Oct, 2016\nHaving lived, worked and volunteered on four continents, Josh brings a global and practical approach to helping fulfill Anka\u2019s mission\u2013\u2013to provide dignity of work, transfer of skills and cultural integration through the creation of traditional crafts.\nDeeply affected by the refugee crisis he saw while working in Turkey, Josh identified ways for US businesses to lend their expertise to help address this humanitarian dilemma. \nJosh is especially grateful of all those who work to support refugee issues. He would also like to thank The University of Notre Dame's Fellow Irish Social Hub and the incredibly supportive ND family!\nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter!  \nActual sketch by Syrian Refugee and the inspiration for our name: \"Anka\" - a mythical bird that which obtains new life by arising from its ashes.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur co-founder is Turkish-American and has been training women to weave rugs for 35+ years.

Combine brutal biology, relentless robotics, mind-bending physics and volatile chemistry as you compete to become the most infamous monster-building scientist. The nefarious possibilities are almost endless\u2014the parts in one XYbrid deck can create more than half a billion different monsters. \nEach card is transparent, so building your monster is a creative experience unlike any other game\u2014and because each card has different art on either side, the path to ultimate infamy is always uniquely yours.\nGAMEPLAY\nPlayers take turns drawing parts from the Lab and using them to build monsters that will increase their infamy score. Each monster begins with a core part, and is complete when it has a head, two arms, and legs. Secret Breakthrough cards help players formulate strategies and unleash surprises each round\u2014will you go for brute force or cunning combinations?\u2014while Mission effects raise the stakes as the game goes on. After 3 rounds, the most infamous player wins!\nLearn all the rules with the digital guide, and watch the Learn-to-Play video:\n                          The spirit of the Brand-a-Bot pledge level is to let players put their personal, permanent mark on XYbrid by including their initials in a piece of card art. In science fiction, you often see arbitrary letters and numbers adorning robots and machines\u2014this is your chance to become those arbitrary letters and numbers! Here are the rules:\nYou submit a sequence of up to 3 letters and/or numbers with your survey after the end of the campaign. This can be your initials, or birthdate, or any creative, meaningful group of 3 alphanumeric characters. I handle everything from there. \nI reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Some reasons may include: offensive or suggestive content, trademarked content, submissions greater than 3 characters, submissions with special characters, etc. \nIf your submission is rejected, I will work with you to come to an acceptable alternative. \nStylistic choices such as color, font, and placement are at the discretion of the artist. Please know that the goal is to make your \u201cbrand\u201d large and bold (not to hide it within the art).\n  Transparent cards are what make XYbrid a uniquely visual gaming experience. Unfortunately, most manufacturers aren\u2019t equipped to produce transparent cards\u2014it requires special machines, inks, and material. Start to finish, the creation of a XYbrid deck is simply more expensive than it would be for standard paper cards. The basic pledge level of $29 helps cover the increased production cost of making something that looks and plays extra cool.\nThe funding goal of $14,500 is based on close and specific coordination with two manufacturers who provided quotes for producing XYbrid. After factoring in additional fees and shipping estimates, I believe this goal is the most realistic target that allows for a reasonable game price.\nThe pledge levels are simple by design. As this is my first foray into game production, I chose to focus on getting the game itself right, and avoid the added complexity of extra components, perks, or stretch goals. This strategy keeps cost down and removes distractions during the critical production and fulfillment phases.\nFor this project, shipped rewards will come from the United States. While I am happy to send copies of XYbrid anywhere in the world, I do not have distribution partners in Europe or Asia at this time. Please know that customs charges and value-added taxes (VAT) may arise but are different for every country and are the responsibility of the backer upon delivery.\nYou can find more details about manufacturing and delivery in the Risks and Challenges Section below.\n  ABOUT THE DESIGNER\nI'm Gabe. My day job is in graphic design and user experience. I get paid to create things people enjoy interacting with, and over the years I\u2019ve directed more than a few projects that required unusual art production\u2014hence my confidence in bringing a transparent card game to life. I'm committed to understanding how players consume fun\u2014I study what motivates people to engage with, learn, and solve problems; then I use that knowledge to make stuff.\nI've been concocting game ideas since I was a kid, but XYbrid is my first public game design. It grew from my love of modular creativity (my childhood was all Mega Man and Lego) and my love of mind-blowing, weird science. In fact, many XYbrid cards are inspired by real-life scientific concepts.\nMy favorite tabletop games are quick to play, but allow for deeper strategy to develop as players learn. XYbrid was designed, developed, and tested over 4 years to provide this type of play experience, built around a unique visual style. My hope is that Kickstarter will bring people like me together to make this quirky, creative game a reality.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING\nThe concept and vision for XYbrid has been vetted by two proven, global game manufacturers. The vendor I am planning to use for manufacturing is located in Hong Kong, and has assured me that their company can accomplish the printing of two-sided transparent plastic cards. Producing XYbrid as I have described above is contingent on their word and ability.\n\nThe production process will begin almost immediately after funding. With the exception of adjustments for the Brand-a-Bot pledge level, the art for all 116 cards (and the rulebook) is already finished. Box art is nearly finished as well, needing only to be transferred into a technical format for manufacturing.\n\nTIMING\nMy delivery target is November 2017.\n\nThe process for review and approval of products manufactured in Asia can take weeks. I have accounted for a reasonable amount of back-and-forth in the timeline, but errors and/or misunderstandings resulting in unforeseen rounds of revision can extend the production timeline and delay delivery.

Dino cooking!  All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens.  \nDo you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors?  They'll definitely excite potential guests...  but you better make a large enough enclosure for them.  And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security.  Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends.  You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores...  but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face).  So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?\nWhen we first played Dinosaur Island we knew we had something extremely special on our hands.  We had an accessible worker placement game that mixed some of our favorite gameplay elements rolled up in a theme that is ridiculously fun and perfectly integrated with mechanics.  I love games that have simple mechanics that lead to incredibly tense decisions. Like a dice pool as a resource (DNA), set-collection, turn-efficiency, a clever auction mechanic, and extremely tense decisions about where to spend your time and energy?  Yes, please!  You can also focus on upgrading your laboratory to make dinosaur creation more efficient.  But if you do, it means you're spending less time on opening new rides.  And the constant pressure to keep your guests safe while still turning a profit every season creates interesting decision making on players. It\u2019s a nail biter, for sure.\n   Dinosaur Island is a unique worker placement game with a combination of fascinating mechanics that is unlike anything you have ever seen.\nSCALABLE GAME LENGTH: One of our favorite aspects of the game is the scalable length mechanism that can change the length of the game from sixty minutes to two and a half hours.  Regardless of player count!  If you're looking for a shorter game at the end of the night or the main course of a game-night, Dinosaur Island has you taken care of.  \nWe also have a unique mechanic we call the \"Plot-Twist\".  At the beginning of every game two Plot-Twist cards will be dealt out that will break the rules of the game in myriad ways.  These rule-changes will drastically alter your strategy and decision making throughout the game.  No memorizing the optimal strategy here.  Dinosaur Island will keep even the most experienced gamer on their toes each time.  In addition to the Plot Twists, the goal cards in each game will be unique, creating a totally different feel to each and every game of Dinosaur Island you play.  Familiar mechanics and new strategy welcome you each time you sit at the table.\n       The Deluxe edition comes with everything you see above plus shiny metal coins, special Spot UV on the box, metallic ink on the box, a special numbered edition, and it will never be reproduced for sale again.  This will be your only chance to get your hands on the delectable, chrome Deluxe edition of Dinosaur Island!  \nThere will also be some very special stretch goals as the campaign continues that we hope to add exclusively to the deluxe edition of the game.

In this case we were incredibly lucky to bring on Peter Wocken (graphic design Dead of Winter, Xia) and Kwanchai Moriya (illustrations Catacombs, Kodoma) and work with them to create this beautifully bonkers art look that evokes the feelings of late 80s/early 90s graphic design.\nYou know, back when dinosaurs were amazing scale covered multi-colored terror lizards.  Not dumb birds with feathers.  We wanted to go back to our own childhood and bring out the colors, patterns (oh, the patterns!) and feeling of sitting down and playing a game of Sim City to the look and feel of the game.\nWe leaned heavily on collectible card games, old board game design and specifically the artwork of Paper Girls (which is an amazing comic that you should all be reading).  We couldn't be happier with the way the game looks.  It\u2019s bright colors, really fun art and a sense of really living in the world that Peter and Kwanchai created.  It doesn't look like all the other board games out there, and we are really happy that it doesn't.\n                                                                                                      These are all the stretch goals we had planned for throughout the campaign.

By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible.  We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.\nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU (inclusive of the UK unless Theresa May really gets to it), US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.\nWe are charging 25 dollars for shipping during the campaign for international backers, and will refund any difference to you after the campaign ends.  Some backers in remote areas may have to pay additionally above this amount, but our goal is to not surprise people with shipping charges and wanted to be up front about potential costs.

Beautifully balanced, infinitely accessible and positively reviewed across the board, Keyflower sees players develop individual villages over the course of four seasons through the clever combination of auctions and worker placement. Keyples - your in-game workers - are used to bid on tiles to add them to your village, but can also activate these locations no matter who controls them.\nThe excellent Farmers and Merchants expansions added even more replayability, as did a selection of special promotional tiles. Now, on this pre-order campaign, we're delighted to announce the latest mini-expansion: Keymelequin!\nAll aboard!\nWhen this fine new vessel arrives in port, it transports two new characters, Paulo and Sven - special two-colored Keyples. Sven, who is a translator, co-ordinator and peacemaker between the blue and yellow Keyples, disembarks from the Keymelequin at the end of spring. Paulo, who has similar abilities with red and green keyples, arrives on the Keymelequin at the end of the summer. Paulo and Sven will facilitate team work and co-operation between their respective factions, with powerful and interesting results. For more information on the expansion, why not check out Richard's Keymelequin Geeklist over on BoardGameGeek?  \nKeymelequin is playable only with a copy of the game Keyflower, and it can be used with the base game on its own or in conjunction with any combination of the other Keyflower promotional tiles and expansions.\nThis campaign was created to help bring the latest printing of Keyflower to gamers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Game Salute does not hold the rights to sell the game beyond these countries. The game is readily available in other territories through local partners - please contact your local game store for more details! \nIf you would like to add copies of the Keyflower: Merchants or Keyflower: Farmers expansions, we will have limited quantities available for backers to add during the pledge manager for those who have backed the campaign. Alternatively, you can pledge at the highest level of this campaign to receive the base game, both large expansions and the brand new Keymelequin pack.\nWhat about the Promo Tiles?\nWe know that our backers love promotional items, and Keyflower tiles are highly sought after. While we have some (but not all!) remaining from previous campaigns, we couldn't guarantee that there would be enough for everyone and have not put them in pledge levels on this page. Instead, when the campaign is complete, you'll be able to upgrade your pledge through Pledge Manager and add on any tiles that we have available on a first come, first served basis. We have Trader tiles, as well as Emporium and Monument tiles. Please note, we have no Beekeeper, Storyteller or Pig Shelter tiles.\nAnd Key to the City: London?\nWe'll also be making Key to the City: London available via the pledge manager when the campaign comes to an end. Please note that this will also be in limited amounts on a first come, first served basis! Here's the full rundown of what will be available post-campaign and how much each item will cost. Only pay for items that are in this campaign - the items below will be add-ons in the Pledge Manager when the campaign is over! \nThank you all for your support! If you're new to the Keyflower universe, we know you're in for one of the finest gaming experiences around. If you're already well versed in the game, we hope Keymelequin keeps you coming back for more! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame Salute has delivered dozens and dozens of successful Kickstarter campaigns, and is a publisher of games recognized for their high quality components and production values.\n\nWhile printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date that allows time to handle difficulties. That said, there is always a possibility that a project may be delayed for some reason, and of course, vice versa, should the games arrive before the estimated delivery date, we will send them out as soon as we receive them.\n\nWe're so confident that you'll enjoy Keyflower and Keymelequin that we're backing it up with our Game Salute Guarantee. If you don't enjoy the game when you receive it, just send either back to our headquarters and we'll issue you a full refund, no questions asked.\n\nAlso, sometimes people may want to cancel their pledge after the campaign has ended, and that\u2019s fine too. We can handle this for you \u2013 all we need is for you to email Support@GameSalute.com with your Kickstarter username and full real name. Please note: when we receive your funds, we only receive around 90% of what you paid thanks to various fees and charges, so we offer a 90% refund if you want to cancel your pledge.\n\nThanks for supporting Keyflower and Keymelequin!

The Dragon Tray comes in many different designs and features everything from a single large well to multiple well holding areas. The multiple well designs are intended for board games that have tokens, coins, or other items that need to be kept in place during play.\nRubber Feet.

The feet protect your table and guard against spilled liquids.\nWall Hanging. All Dragon Trays come with wall hanging hardware installed, allowing you to display and store your epic piece of gaming hardware in your home. \nFinishes. Finishing is an art. We have spent countless hours refining and perfecting our finishing process to bring you some of the most stunning pieces of art available. Many woodworkers avoid custom finishes as it is very time and labor intensive. High quality finishing is a source of pride at Dog Might. One third of our shop is dedicated to the finishing process. \nOur in house professional artist has over 20 years of experience, and mixes all of his own custom tints and varnishes. Every product has a triple coat of varnish, guaranteeing a lifetime of durability and performance. In creating products that are intended for everyday use at your gaming table, we feel that hand rubbed oil finishes are not of high enough quality and durability for our products. Our custom varnishes and tints do not require reapplication, are highly water resistant, and help protect from UV rays and humidity.\nStability. All Dragon Trays are created from hand selected wood that is banded for strength and stability. Banding the wood prevents warping and other movement that would degrade the product.\n\"I LOVE this tray. It's solid, and the quality is just what I'd expect from Dog Might.\" - Raine from Initative:Tabletop\n  \"The level of craftsmanship is clearly on display here with Dog Might Games Dragon Trays.

We are passionate about our work and know that gaming comes first. We use all of our products in our weekly Pathfinder game - everything we make has been battle tested. We are a small team that does everything in house: artwork, modeling, programming, hand selecting lumber, staining, shipping, customer service, and of course, craftsman woodworking. Whether you like to or not, you will be dealing with the owners directly, not faceless minions. This gives us total control over all aspects of the project and allows us to maintain the high quality woodworking for which we are known.
