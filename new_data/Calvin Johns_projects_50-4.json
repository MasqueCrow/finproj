[{"backer": "Calvin Johns", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Glory is a dry erase fantasy adventure for 1-4 players that plays in 60-90 minutes. Both sides of your hero board, and every card in the game is dry erasable. On them you will find check boxes to track all sorts of things throughout your game.\nYour playing area will expand as you collect coinage, information, goods, abilities, and fate. As your adventure takes you back and forth across the kingdom, you will collect points of glory by defeating monsters and helping towns. Earn 20 glory to win. Along the way, your improving glory score will lead to greater personal power.\nEach turn you will roll & move,  add modifiers from cards, choose direction, and potentially expend health to march. Turns are snappy, until someone takes a battle.\nThere are several decks and types of locations. But when you land on a battle or lair space, the rules shift to dice fighting. \nAs you gain glory it progressively becomes harder to gain more. Ergo, you must push yourself to face ever greater challenges. Near the end of the game, players may choose to fight monsters to the death in order to catch up or secure a victory. Is it better to sit back and stay safe, or put everything on the line?\nGlory: First Edition runs a 7.8 on boardgamegeek.com with 104 ratings:\nThe best light weight game on the market in my view. Fast paced, wonderful presentation, balanced and always a fun game.\n-Slimeman, 44 games rated\n\nSimple rules, very easy to learn, and a ton of fun to play. There are many paths to victory, so no two sessions are the same\u2026\n-raitoning, 82 games rated\n\nFantastic game with great replay value and love the option of 1 player scenarios as well. Every piece in the box is high quality and hasn't let me down : )\n-00Bogey, 26 games rated\n\nFun light game. Material quality is amazing.\n-HerbinLegend, 68 games rated\nSolo play uses the same mechanics as multiplayer, but the win condition changes to a race against the fate deck. Each hero has a different scenario to solve with 12 fate cards, drawn once every second turn. Fate spaces become hazards therefore, and 20 glory does not win you the game (but still improves your resources). \n\nFor the adventurer, trouble is coming from the north. Goods normally bought at the castle are in the south-west lair. A dancing danger is available to the south east. Two quests are known. If you visit the both the west and east towns, you gain a coin. But will these benefits help, or are they bait, wasting your precious time? No guts, no glory- but just as true: to the rash, death. You must find the right balance of preparation and boldness, logistics and direct conflict.\n Two Add-Ons are available: \nDragon Shine cards ($12 USD) and\nPVC map ($30 USD).\nYou can buy these items together by choosing the Deluxe Pledge, saving 14%.\nAll shipping charged after the campaign in USD", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manufacturing process has already begun: we started a pre-order campaign in Dec 2020 for first edition owners.

A galactic age.\nAn age of bounty hunters, vagrants and bleeding-heart outlaws.\nThis is the NEW REBEL ERA, and the only thing worth a damn is the sweat off your back, the bullet in your chamber and the fuel in your tank. The galaxy is a lawless expanse, known as the FRONTIER GALAXY, and you are an INTERSTELLAR OUTLAW. Together with YOUR SHIP and YOUR CREW you have to eke out a living in the Frontier Galaxy, and chase down the intergalactic dream of freedom and success.\nORBITAL BLUES is a new lo-fi space western roleplaying game from SoulMuppet Publishing, written by Sam Sleney & Zachary Cox.  A roleplaying love-letter to off-beat sci-fi, vintage music, and cooperative old-school styled roleplay, Orbital Blues allows you to play out rules-light tabletop adventures in the style of space westerns such as Cowboy Bebop, Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nStepping into the shoes of Interstellar Outlaws, players band together to form Crews, and navigate a hard-going, gig-economy living on the fringes of a space-faring society.\nDeveloped on the critically acclaimed rules-lite system of Best Left Buried, Orbital Blues uses a simple D6 based system with 3 basic stats - MUSCLE, GRIT, and SAVVY - to handle rolls and uncertainty - putting the narrative and relationships of the player characters at the heart of play without the baggage of hefty mechanics, classes or roles. \nIn addition to the three core stats, characters also have GAMBITS, and TROUBLES. Gambits are a measure of a character's special talents or unique abilities, whilst Troubles track the heartbreaks, set-backs and blues that Interstellar Outlaws gather around them on their adventures in a difficult universe.  With these simple values and a wealth of gambits and troubles in the core book, players can build a wide variety of unique, storied characters to explore the Frontier Galaxy. \nWorking together, Crews generate a scrappy ship to call home, and must balance their Credits & Debts  in order to stay afloat. Whether it's knowing how they'll pay for a bowl of bell peppers and beef, or where they'll find another clip for their 9mm, the session-by-session play of Orbital Blues is driven by  the rollercoaster lives of Interstellar Outlaws and the work they have to constantly seek out.\nWhether it's hauling salvage across back-water systems or getting boots on the ground sniffing out the Frontier Galaxy's most dangerous bounties, the core book of Orbital Blues is brimming with generators, adventure hooks, play prompts and even a sand-box setting for storytellers to get memorable campaigns going, whilst player characters contend with their own interpersonal relationships and troubles. \n\nOrbital Blues is a 120-Page Trade 6\"x9\"Hardback Book,  with writing and creative direction from Sam Sleney and Zachary Cox, furnished with stunning art from Josh Clark and layout work from Lone Archivist. Edited by Jared Sinclair, Orbital Blues is tight, stylish roleplaying package for all your lo-fi, sci-fi needs. \nWe're printing Orbital Blues with two alternative covers; the standard Day cover, saturated with the big blue sky and the desert dust,  and a Kickstarter-exclusive night-mode cover for those who like to keep their book collections subtle and sophisticated. \nDay Cover\n*WIP - As a Kickstarter Exclusive we really want this one to shine...\nWe use a size slightly larger than A5, Trade (6\" x 9\") across all of our books, to help us stuff more goodness into each page. The hardcover books are planned to be offset, allowing us to feature higher-quality paper, smyth-sewn bindings and all kinds of bells, whistles and ribbons with additional funding.\nThe internals of the book are being beautifully laid out by Lone Archivist, incorporating art, text and tables seamlessly into visually stunning and easy to navigate pages and spreads.\nSpread pages from Crew Ship Generation.\nA spread from The Sutler System, a sandbox adventure included in the core book.\nAs for shipping physical books,  US Distribution will be handled via Exalted Funeral, and the UK & RoW distribution will be handled in house by the SoulMuppet Publishing team. If the campaign is successful and exceeds expectations, we've got specialist fulfilment contractors in place to help fulfil and navigate shipping.\n For backers who pledge for the PDF version, we\u2019ve successfully distributed files via DriveThruRPG and Kickstarter previously and are confident we can do it again.\n\nThis campaign aims to fulfil orders for a print-run of Orbital Blues. At the time of writing, the manuscript is finished, gone through extensive playtesting with a public playtest beta, and is currently being laid out - we're just looking to get it finalised and printed in the quality it deserves, and into your hands. We have pledges for the core book at .PDF and Physical Hardback tiers to deliver on this plan.  \nFollowers of SoulMuppet Publishing know the work and care that's been put into our flagship game, Best Left Buried. With Orbital Blues, we're looking to do the same for sci-fi roleplaying as we did for dark fantasy roleplaying with BLB. We want to make a modern, robust,  and affordable game with a lifetime of support and releases.  Once this Kickstarter funds, we'll immediately start enacting plans to give this game the same longevity, support and accessibility that Best Left Buried enjoys.\nTo stay true to the vintage music roots that inspired the game, we've also collaborated with musician and tabletop writer Chris Bissette to create a  cassette tape LP of music from the universe of Orbital Blues, with Chris performing as the fictional band The Deltas. The tape comes beautifully packaged in a crimson red rave case with an small adventure on the case insert. You can pick the tape up with your book in our Bounty Hunter pledge.\nIf you're eager to dive into our visions and the sounds of Orbital Blues, Creative Director Sam has compiled a living playlist of music, containing tracks and artists that inspired the writing, creation and atmosphere of Orbital Blues.\n Music has been a huge influence in the writing of Orbital Blues, and Sam has curated this playlist to reflect the sounds and styles that have imbued the project with so much life. We have no affiliation with any of the artists in this playlist (though if anyone knows anyone, hook us up... - S) and it's purely a curation of tracks that inspired the making of the book. You can listen and follow on spotify here, and you can expect updates to the playlist whenever we have pen to paper in the future.\n\nWith Orbital Blues already sitting pretty as a completed product, and now funded, the only way is up. We're looking to support Orbital Blues as a flagship game here at SoulMuppet Publishing, and we know the best way to do that is with more adventures and expansions to the core book. Along with additional art and higher production values, each incremental amount raised for this campaign after we hit goal will fund further material from guest writers. Depending on how far we go after funding, we'll also look at adding additional tiers with extra merch. Keep an eye on the tracker below!\nOnwards and upwards, and as we approach the final 24 hours of this campaign, we're setting our sights on one last stretch goal - an upgrade to the cassettes that so many of you have pledged for. How much can you upgrade a 60 year-old storage medium, we hear you wonder. Well, at 700% funding we'll be;\nAdding Limited Edition Orbital Blues Guitar Picks to each Cassette\nPutting more content on the inlays\nAdding an A6 Tri-fold Scenario to every Cassette\nWe're looking into ensuring the Cassettes are of the highest quality, so even if you don't have a tape player, they will still make for stylish display pieces in their own right. Currently we're looking at BandCDs to fulfil the cassette prints, and you can see a portfolio of their work below - we're confident the Orbital Blues Cassette will be a gorgeous compliment to an already stunning game.\n\nUpon reaching \u00a360,000, we're proud to announce we'll be putting this additional funding towards adding the talented Basheer Ghouse to our roster of contributing writers on Orbital Blues, with one last job...\n The job was simple. Run the briefcase to the Rock of Tariq, make sure no-one opens it, and get the sort of pay-out that crews retire on. The journey wasn't exactly safe, but for that sort of money, who cares?\nYet when you arrived at the Rock, you found your employer dead and no-one able to pay you.\nNow half a dozen factions want the cargo, and most of them are willing to kill to get it. Now you're in a race against time. Figure out what's going on, offload your cargo, and get out of there. Or else you'll join the growing list of bodies on the infamous Rock of Tariq.\nBasheer  (@BasheerGhouse) is a writer and cultural consultant based out of San Jose, California. In addition to work for companies like Kobold Press and Rowan, Rook, and Deckard, he's independently published RPGs that range from absurdist comedy to collaborative horror. His contributions can be found in products like Alien Archive 4, Warlock Grimoire 2, and Spire: Shadow Operations, and his personal work can be found at his itch.io page.\nFor us, Basheer is delivering a pulp pressure cooker of an adventure, where Interstellar Outlaw Crews will find themselves pitted against dangerous opponents in a high-risk, high-stakes, and high-reward play of intrigue and action.\nIn reaching 50k, we're confident in announcing that a set 4 Orbital Blues dice will now be included with all Interstellar Kingpin pledges. This will not increase the price on that pledge.\nWe'll have some proofs of the dice with us within the week, but rest assured, they're just as glossy and polished as the rest of the project.\nIf you want to pick up these dice outside of the Interstellar Kingpin pledge, they'll be available in the post-campaign pledge manager for add-ons.\nUpon hitting \u00a345,000 in funding, we've added Giuliano Roverato (@KnightRamen) to our ever-growing team of contributing writers! Giuliano is a Brazilian narrative designer that lives for good food, tough choices and exploring weird dungeons forgotten on the corners of our reality. Best known for the culinary adventure, Bakto\u2019s Terrifying Cuisine, he is wondering if the post-fantasy RPG Brave Zenith will ever see the light of day. Oh, and he really wants to write a bossanova inspired adventure for Orbital Blues too, so let's hear about what he has in store for us!\n\"I want to see the golden shores of my old home, feel its warm sands on my feet, hear the bittersweet melodies, the ones sang to me in bedtime stories by sobbing workers. Day and night the people of Tradis station toil away, forced to clean the planet-side wasteland that the corp calls the \u201cfuture of living.\u201d\nWe are tired, angry and dying. We have nostalgia for a home that is unknown to us. This is not a strike. This a call for help. Bring us home, outlaws. Chega de Saudade.\"\n\nIn Giuliano's stirring exploration of themes of home, nostalgia, place and being, Interstellar Outlaw Crews will visit Tradis station and discover the meaning of Saudade, know the plight of its workers, and be tempted by corporate money beyond their wildest dreams. Here, you can\u2019t save everyone.\n\nThought-provoking and emotive, Giuliano's pitch is one we're incredibly excited for, and we're thrilled to have him onboard.\n Music is a key part of Orbital Blues, and we want to make sure that comes across in a full and proper way. At 400% funding, we've commissioned Chris to further extend the EP Cassette by a third, adding 3 all-new, original tracks to the runtime on both the cassette itself, and in the MP3 collection. These tracks will be perfect for use as background in your games, as atmospheric cornerstones or rip-roaring soundtracks to the adventures of Interstellar Outlaws.\nAt \u00a335,000, we added the work of Tom Mecredy to Orbital Blues' roster of adventures, providing an open, sandbox-styled storyteller's toolkit adventure for your games of Orbital Blues.\nPlaceholder!\n You'll have seen Hagstrom's glossy ads, with their smiling, weather-beaten workers mopping their brows, or relaxing in sleek habitation units, surrounded by their enthusiastic families. You'll have also heard the rumours that Hagstrom's workers are actually indentured to the company, forced to pay off their passage with hard graft. Wollaston's Hold is only a jump away - spool up the drive, and find out the truth.\nAll That Glitters pitches your outlaws into a system full of trouble - a corporate cold war is about to turn hot, revolutionary workers are amassing arms to throw off their oppressive masters, and an ambitious pirate queen is looking to pull off an audacious bullion heist. Keep a hand on your gun, don't trust anyone, and you might just make it out in one piece.\n\nTom Mecredy (@TomMecredy) is a writer and game designer based in the north of England, drawing upon his passion for history and Cold War espionage thrillers to weave tangled conspiracies and revolutions across the stars.  Tom's recent work includes High Speed Low Drag, an introspective, solo-play experience about going to war and the effects it has on soldiers, and Condotto, a Forged in the Dark game about running a company of mercenaries in 14th century Italy.\nAll That Glitters adds a true sandbox experience to Orbital Blues' adventure roster, with a variety of Factions, NPCs and jobs for crews to engage with - it's a style of play that fans of games such as Blades in the Dark will be familiar with, and we're super excited to see it added it to the ever-growing library of supplemental content storytellers can utilise for Orbital Blues.\nUpon reaching \u00a330,000, we added Momatoes to our writing team! Momatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs. For her stretch goal, Momatoes plans on writing a confounding yet compelling mystery wrapped around a deeply human heart. Not a literal heart, though\u2026 unless\u2026? \nPlaceholder!\n Alexin Arius was a pioneer, an eccentric inventor who built wondrous automatons and augments. Now, decades after their disappearance, a desperate sheriff hires a crew of Interstellar Outlaws for what looks to be a straightforward bounty: track Alexin in a promising new location, the long-forgotten Everjoy space station and amusement park.\nBut not all is what it seems, and the supposedly abandoned Everjoy is steeped in endless mystery. Rust and decay run rampant - but why does the jingle still play over the stale air? No customer had set foot in its towering rides or souvenir shops for years - but why do the animatronic mascots still greet you with a smile? And the wide-eyed children who watch you from edges and corners - who are they, and what secrets lurk in the utopia they\u2019ve built?\nVisit Everjoy now, where the good times must never end.\n\nMomatoes' EVERJOY adventure will now be available in .PDF, and will be distributed, fully illustrated, along with Sinta Posadas' A STARBORN RESISTANCE, once the core book has shipped, ensuring that everyone will have a nice shiny core book to run their adventures with! We can't wait to see what Momatoes has in store for us, and what else the future may bring for Orbital Blues!\nWe've received nothing but kind words and praise for our art direction, so as such we're taking the leap to collect all the creative energies that have made this project a reality, with Wayward Stars: The Art of Orbital Blues. A coffee table art book in miniature (we're looking at 6\" x 9\" A5 horizontal) Wayward Stars will delve into the artistic process, world-building and step-by-step explorations of how a tabletop game's art is made, with words from Josh Clark.\nPlaceholder!\nA deep-dive into the worldbuilding of Orbital Blues.\nWayward Stars will be available as an add-on, or available in the WAYWARD STAR, SPACE COWBOY 2 or INTERSTELLAR KINGPIN pledge levels, and physical copies of Wayward Stars will ship alongside core books in August 2021.\nPostcards from the Frontier Galaxy were our first stretch goal,  available from \u00a315,000. These will be included free at all pledges levels of Space Cowboy and above. We're polling 12 pieces of art to decide 3 final pieces, and Bounty Hunter pledges will receive a collection of all 3. Interstellar Outlaw pledges will get 2 of the postcards, and Space Cowboy pledges will receive one.  These Print Postcards will add no additional costs to pledges or shipping. \nAt \u00a320,000 we added the talented Sinta Posadas to our writing team! Sin Posadas (@diwataMANILA) is a game designer and illustrator obsessed with the galaxy and all of its possible tragedies that lie in wait, just out of reach. \nSin has pitched us an adventure called A STARBORN RESISTANCE, which we'll be releasing in .PDF form.\nPlaceholder Cover.\nVaris X-0 was once a gleaming jewel in the crown of the Wings of Valor Confederacy. The Confederacy constructed \"Harvester Homes\" of the Scintilla Commune, a string of asteroid belts fitted onto an intra-atmospheric nuclear power harvester, home to any colonist willing to risk their necks for the promise of cheap lodging and a regular wage.  \nAfter a cheaper extraction method was found a few million light years away, the Confederacy abandoned the system, leaving the Harvester Homes to rust. These days, it's just a few Interstellar Outlaws trying to keep the place afloat: salvaging equipment, finding food and power, fighting off bandits and worse. In this delapidated backwater, communities need help to keep things afloat. But what happens when a representative of the Confederacy returns, promising to restore glory to the Scintilla? At what cost? To what end for the Confederacy? And what's in it for you?\n\nUpon reaching \u00a320,000 in funding, A Starborn Resistance began development, and will release as a .PDF adventure shortly after the release of the physical Orbital Blues core rulebook in August 2021. Should we reach levels of funding to commission a several contributing writers, we'll compile their works into a compilation for physical release later in the year.\n\nOrbital Blues is a SoulMuppet Publishing Production, but it has been brought about by a crack-team of independent talent to make something fresh & exciting. Here's the run-down on who's who.\n\nSam Sleney (@samsleney) is a freelance writer, and Creative Director for First Falling Leaf Publishing. Orbital Blues is Sam's manuscript and creative vision, born out of a lifetime love of space westerns, and being raised on the records of Bruce Springsteen in lieu of a father figure.  Together with artistic realisations from Josh Clark and the mechanical mind of Zachary Cox, Sam has fused the team's talent into the Interstellar Blues Explosion that is Orbital Blues. \n\nJosh Clark (@tinywoodsman) is an artist and creator who has worked on everything from album covers to business cards and video games to podcast art. His work can be seen in First Falling Leaf's \"Sins: Dead City \", From Sorrow To Serenity's \"Trifecta EP Project\" and in the worldbuilding booklet \"The Quiet Future\". He can be found at TinyWoodsman. As our lead artist, Josh brought the world & creative vision of Orbital Blues to life from the Day 1, and made the project what it is today. \n\nZachary Cox (@JellyMuppet) is the Managing Partner of SoulMuppet Publishing, dabbling in everything from printing, distribution, management and social media. The original creator of Best Left Buried, Zach has contributed to the mechanical writing and masterminded improvements on Best Left Buried's engine for Orbital Blues, adapting the original SRD and mechanics to perfectly accompany lo-fi, space western roleplay.\nJared Sinclair (@infinite_mao) is an editor and sometime writer of games and games-related material. His work as a writer includes Anti-Sisyphus, What's So Cool About Outer Space?, Prismot!, and The Vanilla Game. He also runs Spear Witch, an independent online bookstore specializing in small-creator game books and zines. As our editor, Jared cut the manuscript of Orbital Blues into shape, making it into a lean, cohesive and accessible book that cuts right to the heart of thematic play. \n\nLone Archivist (@LoneArchivist) is a game and graphic designer based out of Southern California. His work includes writing and design for a handful of third-party modules for games such as Mothership and Best Left Buried as well as several self-published system-agnostic game supplements. When not working on games he can be found crate-digging for a new Jazz record or adding yet another book to the TBR list. Lone is currently hard at working coalescing the manuscript, art and style of Orbital Blues into a tight, stylish and striking print. \n\nChris Bissette (@Pangalactic) is a Manchester-based game designer and musician. His game The Wretched - along with its original soundtrack - was selected as one of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Best Games of 2020 and has spawned hundreds of games using its Wretched & Alone engine. Chris is performing as the fictional band The Deltas on their debut Cassette LP, Orbital Blues, which you can pick up alongside the core rulebook as a keynote piece. You can find Chris' music, games, and more at LootTheRoom. \n\nSin is the designer of the Planted RPG series, a small collection of tabletop rpgs where you play as sentient plants defending your homes from evil bugs. Their other works include explorations into your deepest fears in the Deep, Deep River, fanciful food trips in Lutong Banwa, and playing out the dramatics of being agents of a Tower racing against the Apocalypse in Navathem's End. They're currently working to complete Navathem's End after it was successfully funded as part of the recently concluded #OurShores Kickstarter campaign. You can find their other melancholic games here, on their itch.io page. Sin will be writing A Starborn Resistance, an adventure for Orbital Blues achieved as a stretch goal. \n\nMomatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs.  Momatoes will be writing EVERYJOY, an Orbital Blues adventure that we unlocked as a stretch goal.\n\nOrbital Blues began life as an internal passion project, that snowballed into release through enthusiasm and available connections in lockdown. We're looking to diversify the team for Orbital Blues with immediate stretch goals for writers and contributors from a greater wealth of backgrounds than the core team, and will be adding such individuals here once we've hired them at competitive rates. If you're interested in writing for Orbital Blues, get in touch here, with writing samples, pitches or portfolios.\n\nWe've had a few people now from various parts of the world asking for more detailed shipping information so they can make an informed decision about pledging. When you take Brexit, the global pandemic and shipping delays, and add them to the fact SoulMuppet Publishing only has experience in smaller scale print-runs from calmer times, it's been hard to make estimated guesses on the prices of shipping for a project that's shaping up to be this successful. However, we've gone away, done our homework, made some enquiries and ran some numbers, and below are our current shipping estimates.\nWe'll update this image where it appears on the main campaign body actively whenever anything changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our book already being in final stages of completion and this Kickstarter serving as a means of production, we don't have any concerns for the completion of this project. As we already navigated the fulfilments in previous campaigns such as Best Left Buried: Deeper and Stygian Library, we also don't have any concerns regarding deliveries and distributions.

Your best friend is Lindsey Lacrosse and you get into all sorts of scraps together. But what will happen when you learn Lindsey has a crush on Ryan Rugby, just like you do? And can it be true that Taylor Tug O\u2019War has it in for you ever since you stole his act at the Talent Show? Anyway, you can\u2019t worry about that now, Camilla Croquet has challenged you to a showdown after school! You\u2019ve got to play this off just right if you want to keep up your ultra-cool but likeable reputation and make it to the Paris Olympics after you graduate.\nThe Game\nPreparing for Paris is a game of personified sports as teenagers at Olympic Academy all vying trying to graduate top of the class to become part of the Paris Olympic Games. It is a game of drama, hijinks and wild fun.\nWhat story will you tell at Olympic Academy?\nPlay as one of 5 available discontinued sports, each with their own strengths, quirks and flaws. Choose from Cricket, Croquet, Lacrosse, Rugby and Tug O\u2019War!\n  Play a series of minigames that you choose - from the first day of school, through the lunch room and detention, all the way to prom and graduation.\n  Ask provocative questions and build scenes with your fellow players during each minigame. Then roll to discover your outcome; anything from total success to hilarious failure!\n  Accrue Chums, Cred and Connections to see who\u2019s going to Paris after Graduation Day!\n  No Game Master or Facilitator required, and no preparation in advance either, making it quick and easy to get this game to the table.\n  Play the whole story in just one or two sittings, perfect for oneshots and highly replayable for fun time and again!\n  And even more content if we hit our stretch goals!\nThe Goods\nAfter we score a goal with this Kickstarter, you will receive a 40 page PDF with 5 character playbooks, beautifully laid out by Maria Mison. Both the game text and playbooks have been edited from version 1.0 to create an easier and more intuitive play experience. An example of play has also been included to help you jump into the game right away!\nFirst draft of a front cover, NOT FINAL\nSample layout by Maria, NOT FINAL, but still looks so cool right!?\nYou can see more of Maria\u2019s work here!\nNerd in Chief\n Hi! I\u2019m Logan Timmins, a transgender, Australian tabletop gaming nerd. I have been playing and running tabletop games of all sorts for years, and also publishing my own on my itch store. I have 12 games of all genres and types under my belt, and I'm excited to bring another fun and unique game to you! I like to make games that empower the players to tell meaningful and memorable stories, and I have grown a lot as a designer since publishing my first game.\nYou can find more of my tabletop games here: https://breathingstories.itch.io/\nYou can also hear me talk about my game design process on Yes Indie'd Pod and on my Twitter.\nI want to thank Christopher W Reynolds of ninjaHELL! Productions and Okashicon for running the game design contest this game was originally written for.\nI am proud to say Preparing for Paris was a finalist in this contest, with a final placing of third! \nA bronze medal, in Olympic terms!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nPreparing for Paris is currently available on my itch as a PDF but I want to make it more beautiful for the people who are loving it and will love it in the future. I need your help to make this game the best it can be! I want you to have this fun, drama-filled game as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.\nThe majority of funds raised will go to paying Maria for her work, with the remaining covering Kickstarter fees and some 'just in case' funds.\nThe System\nPreparing for Paris is heavily inspired by Powered by the Apocalypse games, as well as the Firebrands Framework by Meguey and Vincent Baker. No facilitator or Game Master (GM) is required, just you and 2-4 friends! P4P also requires no preparation beforehand, you can just read the rules and dive right in.\nWhat it borrows from PbtA is the degrees of success. This makes rolls and consequences more interesting and gives players more of a choice in how their character is affected by circumstances beyond a mere 'you succeed' or 'you lose'. During each minigame, after setting the scene, you will roll 2 six-sided dice and add your relevant stat (either Fame, Fortune or Fans). Add it all together to see how well you do, and narrate on your own terms how it all turns out.\nLearn more about PbtA here and find the original PbtA game Apocalypse World here!\nWhat is borrowed from Firebrands is the use of minigames and poignant questions to drive the story telling. During the game, players will choose minigames to play (anything from 'Go Viral' and 'Throw a Party' to 'Class' and 'Detention') and ask questions of fellow players that create drama, tension, and close relationships.\nPlay continues through the various minigames until the climax at Senior Prom, it will surely be a night to remember\u2026\nFind the original Firebrands game Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands here.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000 - New Character Option! - UNLOCKED! Introducing Fire Hockey, the most overlooked of the 4 Hockey siblings. (**Fire Hockey is originally called Pelota Purepecha and is from Native Mexican culture. As such I will be hiring a sensitivity reader from Salt and Sage Books to ensure the character options are not harmful in any way.)\n$1,500 - Pay bump! - UNLOCKED! Both Maria and I will get a pay rise to help us continue creating things we love and enjoy. Support your indies!\n$2,000 - New Character Option! - UNLOCKED Check out the new kid on the block called ESports. Seems different to the rest, and some wonder if Olympic Academy is even the place for them...\n$2,500 - Form-Fillable Character Playbooks and a New Monitor! - UNLOCKED This epic stretch goal will unlock 2 awesome things! Firstly, I will be able to hire excellent graphic designer and tabletop game creator Vee Hendro to make the character playbooks form-fillable! This will allow users to edit the playbooks on their laptop or other compatible devices, so no need to print them out or take notes on a separate document! Everyone who backed at a level at which to receive the Preparing for Paris PDF (or higher) will receive these form-fillable playbooks.\nSecondly this stretch goal will allow me (Logan) to buy a monitor to expand my workspace. As I've continued to create games, work on projects, and be on streams it has become more and more necessary to have a second screen. If we hit this goal I will be able to buy a new monitor and even pay for shipping!\n$3,000 - More Minigames! At this extremely excellent stretch goal, I will be able to hire 3 indie tabletop game designers to write one brand new minigame each! I'm so excited to work with these awesome folks and pay forward the support you've shown me. Each designer will be paid $0.20AUD/word or $100AUD, whichever is higher. Our wonderful guest designers will be an awesome team of Aussies; Mitchell Salmon, Pidj Sorensen and Steve Dee!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPreparing for Paris is already a finished and playable game and has been playtested multiple times with different groups.\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but not my first game.

We were left with only our sun, our small cluster of planets, and a new, twisted moon. Something, birthed from the sky-eater, fell to our planet and began to twist and warp it.\nIt was the end of our world before anyone living now can remember.\nMany generations later, the remnants of our people wander the twisted land and fight the bioluminescent night-crawling creatures as they search the ruins of our castles and cities for ancient magic and technology to help us survive. The brave and hopeful of us work to keep our pocket-sized towns together and alive.\nNow, so many years after our stars were devoured, you head into the world with a gun at your side.\nI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\nWith your friend, a gun, at your side...\nGUN&SLINGER is an RPG about a weapon and a wanderer. A Maestro and two players (Gun and Slinger) set out into a dead planet mutated by a god's forgotten child and hunt strange bounties, investigate the world, and unlock hidden powers. During play, they seek to learn the nature of what\u2019s hunting the Slinger, figure out why the Gun is sentient, and discover how the world died.\nKey Features:\nTell the story of a post-magic world and the people working together to survive.\nExplore the nature of a twisted reality and a force that hunts the players.\nUse Two different playstyles for the Gun and the Slinger with unique capabilities and mechanics.\nAnswer Questions & Prompts at the table to establish a bespoke setting to adventure in.\nYou can be a magical, sentient gun.\n Rewards: \n $12 gets you the final full-color PDF.\n $20 gets you the completed full-color paperback & a digital copy of the PDF.\n $100 gets you all of the above AND an exciting, secret note in your book.\n All backers get their names put in a Special Thanks section in the book.\n All physical tiers get a sticker included in their order!\nbook mockup, final cover may vary. cover art by Sadia Bies\n GUN&SLINGER in podcasts! \nI\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure of guesting on a few awesome podcasts to talk about and play GUN&SLINGER! If you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a fix of G&S, or some extra info on the design, then check these out!\n Party of One with Jeff Stormer\n Game Closet with Taylor LaBresh\n Rollin\u2019 Bones with Ryan Howard\nGive \u2018em a listen and share with your friends!\nIn GUN&SLINGER, the player-characters are bound together by fate, promises, and magic. One of them fills the role of the Slinger, the other embodies the Gun.\nA Slinger that\u2019s hunted by evil\nThe Slinger is a wanderer, looking for something in this twisted world. They\u2019ve been touched by the Twist and can pull on it for power. They must be careful, though- if they pull on the Twist too much, they\u2019ll lose themselves in it.\nBeing marked, they are hunted by something- a strange, horrifying creature of the Twist\u2019s design. During setup and through play, you decide as a table what this creature is and bring it into scenes using the Maestro\u2019s moves.\nA Gun that\u2019s more than a Gun\nThe Gun may live in a shell of cold steel, but they were not always this way. During setup and through play, you learn about the Gun\u2019s past and how they became trapped in this new body of violence.\nThe Gun may not have arms or legs, but that doesn\u2019t make them unable to affect the world around them. The Gun can use their connection with the remaining elements of Magic in the world to, well, do magic! The runes engraved on their body shape the form of their connection and, in turn, their spells. They can also reach into an ethereal plane of magic that resides alongside the physical realm to move and manipulate things.\nA sample of the Gun\u2019s character sheet\nEach player in GUN&SLINGER interacts with the mechanics differently, all the way down to their stats. Take a look at the section of the Gun\u2019s sheet above. The three starting stats are intentionally a little bit vague for a couple of reasons.\n G&S encourages players to be flexible with stat definitions. The way you approach a situation should dictate what stat it uses, and vise-versa. The Gun could attempt to intimidate people with any of these stats, it\u2019s just up to you to decide how that looks!\n G&S also allows players to, as they progress, create their own stats. In one playtest, a player gave their Slinger the Stat \u201cThe Bigger I Am\u201d and used it as an opposite to \u201cLight On My Toes\u201d. Any time they did something bull-headed or with a physical presence, they\u2019d use this new Stat and force their way through.\nThe way the stats are named in G&S gives you quite a bit of insight into the character they portray all while setting a tone and giving flexibility. You\u2019ve got a 2 in \u201cI've Been Around\u201d. What\u2019s that mean to you? Do you know about the local flora? Can you navigate easily to places you've never been to? That\u2019s up to you, Slinger.\nIn GUN&SLINGER, all conflict is resolved using a deck of playing cards. When a player wants to do something under pressure or with an uncertain outcome, The Maestro presents them with how difficult it'll be to do, and the players need to figure out how best to overcome the challenge.\nIn order to solve the problems they face on their quest to help fix their broken world, they\u2019ll need to tap into the cards they have (through imaginative game-mechanical twists on Go Fish and Blackjack), their stats, and any other tools they happen to have at their disposal.\nAs you venture through the world, tackle problems, and fight monsters, you\u2019ll get to change your stats and rework the game into something that\u2019s truly your own. \nGUN&SLINGER comes with a unique post-post apocalypse setting replete with room to be shaped into something special as your group plays through it. Elements are defined to a certain extent, then ways for you to create specifics or changes are outlined and some examples are given.\nIt\u2019s a world of hope and struggle, mutated by the forgotten child of an unknowable god that ate the stars, leaving behind only your sun, some neighboring planets, and a new moon of strange energy that never leaves the sky. There are aesthetic elements and keystones provided in the book, and some facts about the nature of things like The Twist and Magic are established, then everyone playing is given some prompts and free reign over making this setting something all their own.\nOne playtest took place in a desert land with demons, industry, and gold being key aesthetics. Another was in rolling planes with a never-ending storm, strange new flora, and magic soaking into the planet through the rain.\nA sample of these setting elements: The Twist is a force that mutates the planet for unknown reasons.\nThe Maestro controls the world and works with the players to bring it life. They create challenges, intrigue, and consequences for the players based on their actions. They have the use of a very unique and powerful threat in the form of two Joker cards that can bring an intense sense of pressure and immediacy to any situation. Finally, they also interact with the Go Fish and Pairs mechanics differently and have a unique list of Moves they can make whenever they\u2019re able to afford the cost.\nThere are systems currently in the works to allow GUN&SLINGER to be played without a Maestro.\nCalling The Thing That Hunts using Joker cards\nThe Maestro\u2019s Face Moves\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI want GUN&SLINGER to be the best thing it can be. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on the game, and I want to turn it into a physical thing with a level of quality and production that I feel it deserves. I\u2019m here on Kickstarter with this project to raise the money to pay a fantastic team the money they deserve so we can make something kick-ass.\nOur goals & challenges\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise $4,350 to give the product a final physical form, complete with graphic design and art. The final product will be a 40+-page full-color paperback, with professionally-done layout and visceral artwork.\nHere is our estimated budget for creating GUN&SLINGER.\n $1,450 for writing, game design, sensitivity consulting, and editing.\n $1,800 for layout and art (lots of art!)\n $300 for printing from Mixam Press.\n $350 as a just-in-case cash reserve.\n $450 for Kickstarter\u2019s fees and credit card processing.\nThis brings us to $4,350 needed to make this book a reality.\nThe Team\nNevyn Holmes is a game designer based out of central Texas.

She is excited to help bring the world of GUN&SLINGER to life and inspire players to forge their own paths through its scarred and twisted landscape.\nJamila R. Nedjadi is a game creator and Reiki-Shaman. If they were a magical and sentient weapon, they would scream charming obscenities to keep your spirits up and attack people with tapioca pearls.

[Instagram]\nStretch Goals\nAt $6,350, Viditya Voleti will be writing a new playset, SWORD&BEARER, that will include a new setting, setup section, two new characters, and art by Nadhir Nor!\nHere's the pitch:\nSWORD&BEARER is set within a massive city that shares aesthetics with idealistic European and South-Asian architecture. In this world, magic is relatively commonplace and used in daily life. There\u2019s been an industrial revolution, and many things are powered by a mix of coal and magical energy harnessed from the world. Patrols and the army make use of firearms, and artful melee weapons have become a thing of decoration.\nThe Twist in this setting has taken its place among the ruling classes of the city, driving them to control and capitalize on its people by making them just comfortable enough to be complacent. It is a caste-based capitalistic society where the upper echelons have been infiltrated and manipulated by Magic\u2019s hungry and self-driven sibling, the Twist.\nViditya Voleti (Twitter, Itch). Viditya is a QPoC game designer and writer who loves exploring the medium in several avenues! A true goblin of the community, he wears different hats from making games, consulting, Twitter worldbuilding, streaming live design nights, reading and reviewing games, and really anything he decides will be fun! All of this gets collected on his Patreon.\nNadhir Nor is an illustrator from Malaysia. From folkloric visuals for musicians to cheesy queer romance tucked between his art books, he's very interested in seeing how the modern society can navigate between what's mundane and magical.\nAt $7,250, Adira Slattery will be writing an alternate character for the GUN, the DEMON, to be included in the final book, with fresh art by Josef Rahaman and a sigil by Ezra Rose!\nHere's the pitch:\nTHE DEMON is an optional playbook replacing either the GUN or the SWORD as a companion. Instead of existing as an object, the Demon lives within the arm of the SLINGER or the BEARER. It only remembers how to cause pain, and it doesn't want to let go. \nAdira Slattery is a trans Jewish game designer, poet, and podcast human. Her work spans comedy, horror, and intimacy. Adira has designed a number of amazing projects, and her work in very thoughtful spaces of game design will be sure to make THE DEMON a powerhouse of a character option.\nJosef Rahaman is a concept artist from Arizona with a major passion for games & the creativity that births them. Throughout attaining a degree in Digital Culture, he jumped at every opportunity to expand his expertise knowledge of creative processes.  He aims to imbue that spirit of ingenuity into everything he does with the hope that it will inspire joy and creativity in others. His work and flexibility of styles is a perfect fit to bring THE DEMON to life!\nEzra Rose is an illustrator, zinester & multi-disciplinary creator living on a small farm in Western Massachusetts with queer chosen family.

It'll include everything from the way the math works out in the system, why decisions were made, and guidance on important aspects of the system.\nThis will not only make it easier for those interested to make things for or with the GUN&SLINGER framework, but it'll make the reasoning behind some design decisions plain & clear, so future designs will be built from a better understanding!\nAt $22,000 raised, Pam Punzalan will be writing MECH&PILOT with art by Gio Manning!\n Here's the pitch:\nPlay as a PILOT who has found that their survival now depends on the miraculous technology of a Mech. Play as a MECH excavated from the remnants of a strange past civilization, who reached for the PILOT in its desperation and now finds itself uncovering its memories through experiencing the world with the Pilot. \nExplore a fantasy-like world with fragments of highly advanced magitech societies born from space ships scattering its surface. Some large factions powered by these fragments exist and struggle to keep the rest of the world ignorant of the legacies they are meant to inherit. Mobile Aberrant Geoanimus, corrupted mecha obsessed with non-corrupted mecha and their pilots, wander the lands, corrupting everything they touch.\nPam Punzalan is a queer woman from the Philippines. Her works explore queerness, emotion, memories, violence, reclamation, rebellion, and identity. She's published her own work (Sundo, Asian Acceptance, a lot of micro RPGs), collaborated with others (Maharlika, several Zinequest 2020 entries) and is on a number of major projects (Sina Una, Ancestry & Culture, Five Torches Deep, Spire, Rookwood).\nMisael \"Gio\" Manning is a Filipino Canadian concept artist and illustrator.

I do!\u2019 \nPeter Pan - J.M. Barrie \nExperiencing visions of a mythical land throughout your childhood, you are suddenly transported to the Inspirisles, a kingdom ruled by the fey. Responsible for a pact made long ago by your ancestors, you must now earn Belief and the respect of their gods or find yourself trapped there forever.\nINSPIRISLES is a completely original tabletop RPG aimed at teenagers. It will promote empathy, life skills and deaf awareness with an emphasis on teamwork and creativity.\nPlay as teens gifted extraordinary powers. \nMeet famous characters and fearsome monsters from Celtic folklore. \nWork together to heal a crumbling land and restore a fractured kingdom. \nLearn British/American Sign Language as you cast spells and solve puzzles. \nBecome apprentices to the gods.\nOffer Belief to earn your tickets home. \n\nThis project came about after running my teen Dungeons & Dragons group Hatchlings for over a year. I wanted to create something for them. Something they could have a hand in building. And something I could take beyond the group to use in schools and communities as a workshop model. Inspirisles is the result of this, a game for young players that reflects my interest in folklore and my ongoing work with the deaf community.\nThough Inspirisles is aimed at children, it can be enjoyed equally by adults and we are especially encouraging parents, educators and tabletop beginners to invest in our game. Many of us have fond memories of 80s fantasy classics such as The NeverEnding Story & Labyrinth. Inspirisles aims to capture some of that nostalgic magic and transport its older participants back to a more carefree and imaginative time. \nStandard & Limited Edition book mock-ups\nA5 premium-colour hardback with over 150 pages of material, including...\nHistory of the islands and their Friends. \nCreating your Foundling character.\nCollection of spell, ability & item cards and the tools to invent your own. \nA host of worldbuilding ideas & mechanics to breathe life into your quests, including using the arts in roleplaying, creating challenging environmental puzzles, alternative ways to earn Belief, rules for Inspired apprenticeships, exploration, downtime & Doom.\nScriv\u2019s Tour: Follow the famous bard as she journals the key locations & personalities you will encounter during your adventures.\nScriv\u2019s Story: Fiction retelling the moment our bard met Athelyn for the first time (Limited Edition only).\nMenagerie of monsters from Celtic folklore & the tools to invent your own. \nStarter adventure: \u2018Duster Trials\u2019. \nStunning art from cover to cover, including maps for locations and encounters. \nTwo page spread of Josh Somerville\u2019s spectacular knot art (Limited Edition only).\nDyslexia friendly fonts throughout to prioritise accessibility. \nHandouts: Blank character sheet, Shaping alphabet (BSL & ASL), milestone certificates & Grail template.\n* terms in bold explored below.\nPage sample by Anna Urbanek of Double Proficiency\nBelief is the keystone of the Inspirisles. The energy binding all things. In its absence, the land and its children would fade from life and from memory. \nIf Belief were to run dry, it would have terrible repercussions. Imagine something calamitous like Earth\u2019s polar caps suddenly melting or electricity disappearing from the globe overnight. \nThough Belief is generated through such things as exploration, the arts, work and even battle, these pale in comparison to the amount collected from human children. \nAs children believe in magic less and less, the inhabitants of the Inspirisles must come up with new and increasingly creative ways to convince them otherwise.\nBelief gathered from Earth is taken to the World Tree and released over its roots. This energy then spreads throughout the land, healing the foundations of the islands.\nShaping\nA place where the gods walk freely, where dragons are hunted for hoarding Belief, where a war rages between Friends, where reforging an ancient sword can reforge a kingdom, where sign language is used to cast spells, where there is no death, only Disbelief, and where heroes rise and fall together. \nIt is also a setting to reflect the struggles of our own world. You\u2019ll find environmental calamity, political greed and social injustice to name but a few. Making Inspirisles relatable to our future generations was an ambition from the very start. However, we would never want to push an agenda, so building a platform for whichever stories need to be told has been our sole responsibility. \nHibernation\nOur system and its mechanics are entirely built around the theme of Belief. Players must work together to collect this wondrous commodity, reaching the heights before deciding whether to stay and enjoy the renown or return home and reunite with their true families.\nMoving away from systems found in many popular tabletop RPGs, Inspirisles is largely aimed at young adults and does away with traditional mechanics such as racial bonuses, class systems, ponderous combat and even death.\nThough our players should expect an open, sandbox experience, it\u2019s nice to have an overall goal in mind. As such, the concept of healing the land as a team for rewards and progression is at the heart of Inspirisles.\nAs with any roleplaying game, Inspirisles will throw challenges at its players. As well as social and environmental encounters, Foundlings (players) will inevitably come across familiar monsters of Celtic legend, such as the Questing Beast who will stalk them across the land. Within the book, you\u2019ll also discover many nasties of our own invention and the tools to invent your own.\nDon\u2019t go it alone!\nAttributes\nFoundlings will have six attributes: sword, shield, speed, smarts, social & survival. When facing obstacles, they can lay down up to three cards representing spells, abilities or items. These cards display unique properties that will have an impact on their attribute bonus. Players then roll 2d6, adding the attribute bonus plus any additions from the cards. If the obstacle they are facing is truly perilous, they may turn to their Grail Pool as a last resort, a resource only carried by Foundlings.\nSample obstacle resolution\nObstacles can include social interactions, puzzles, environmental challenges and battle. Whether the obstacle is resolved through roleplay or combat, if it requires a check, it is always contested between player and Grail Guide (Game Master). \nWith every failed encounter and instead of suffering injury or death, Foundlings will instead experience Disbelief. If too much Disbelief is accumulated as a group, players must pull together to reduce it using the Belief they may be saving for a rank or new cards. This balancing act encourages empathy between participants, but also prevents Doom from affecting the islands.\nQuesting Beast\nGuinevere & Arthur, our Grail Guide choices\nOur version of a Game Master is called the Grail Guide (GG). A participating adult or teenager will take on the role of GG and become the spirit of King Arthur Pendragon or Queen Guinevere. It will be their task to guide the players on their journey, making decisions on the rules, lending voice to the citizens and fangs to the denizens, and encouraging everyone to work together, share the limelight and have fun.\nAs the GG, you also have the unique opportunity to gift your players their Grail Pool, a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 & d20). Foundlings are the only beings able to carry this water poured from the Holy Grail. Even a sip will offer them an edge when facing the greatest of challenges and most dangerous of foes.\nTalking of the Grail, with the book will be a template for the holy vessel that GG\u2019s can cutout before sessions. This prop is then placed in the centre of the playing space and can be flipped whenever a player finds a theme or scenario too difficult. The GG can then move on swiftly without disrupting the overall session.\nSafety tool\nIt is also the responsibility of the GG to add tension and peril to the experience. If their players accumulate too much Disbelief, they can consult a Doom chart. This will change the Inspirisles in dramatic ways, such as causing a volcano to erupt, introducing the Questing Beast to hunt Foundlings, having Excalibur seized by an enemy or building a troll bridge on the outskirts of a city. \nSpelunking\nAs a player, you take on the role of Foundling, a human teen drawn by fate to the islands. Instead of selecting a race or class, Foundlings are trained by one of eight fey clans, otherwise known as Friends. The Knockers, Glow, Wyrmbitten, Capra, Piskies, Giantheld and Bucca populate distinct locations from city to forest, tin mine to tundra. Seven of these races work tirelessly to restore Belief and prevent the collapse of the Inspirisles. Whilst the eighth, an exiled people known as Glimmers refuse to help, sheltered far beneath the surface where the cracks go unseen and the tremors unfelt. \nKnocker\nAs a Foundling, once Belief is gathered, it can be used in 3 distinct ways...\n Pilgrimage to Avalon where the World Tree sits. Belief is offered to its roots in exchange for training.\n Patronage to the Inspired. Belief is offered in exchange for spells.\n Provide for the community they were embraced by. Belief is offered in exchange for items.\nRegardless of how Foundlings offer Belief, they will earn the favour of the ruling houses and feel their reputation and power grow. \nFoundling sheet B&W\nThe Inspired are the closest thing the islands have to deities. Their influence can be felt across the kingdom at all times and ultimately players will need to impress them if they are to return home.\nAs well as being great teachers of magic in the form of Shaping, they have trades in their homelands, allowing Foundling players to become apprentices and earn Belief through hard work and dedication.\n Kilna of the Fire has his forge.\n Egrain of the Earth has her vinyard.\n Athelyn of the Water has their bath house.\n Vorm of the Air has his skyship.\nKilna at his forge\nTravelling via All\u2019s Well, a mysterious portal leading to the British Isles, on their 15th birthdays, the brightest and bravest Foundlings are sent Earthwards to collect Belief. These elite are known as Dusters.\nWith the help of a Wellwisher, a common mammal transformed by Athelyn to be more like you and I, Dusters will be guided to a child without Belief, a teenager struggling to feel magic in their life.\nPlayers will then roll a six-sided Dusting Dice (d6), revealing the target child\u2019s particular sensitivity. 1: Fear 2: Joy 3: Wonder 4: Help 5: Story and (6: Other - determined by GG). Through roleplaying this sensitivity, Foundlings must convince the child that magic exists before collecting their Belief to take back.\nWellwisher\nAs well as speaking the common tongue for the sake of interactions with humankind, the fey use a form of sign language they believe communicates right to the heart. \nThe technique is known as Shaping, a term derived from the hand and finger movements used and a deeper meaning of shaping the world around them. Spells are solely expressed through Shaping, with gestures building energy before being released from the fingertips.\nSpells are taught only by the Inspired. Only they know the deeper intricacies of the language necessary to harness magic.\nThough optional, we are introducing British Sign Language (BSL) and Sign Supported English (SSE) into our game. We are using it as part of the spellcasting process and to solve some of the setting\u2019s most challenging puzzles, encouraging our young players to learn the alphabet and more as they play. \nWhen you back our core book, whether digitally or physically, you will gain access to a video workshop on the art of Shaping produced by our friends in the deaf community. Whilst not a comprehensive introduction to British Sign (see Stretch Goals), it will teach participants enough to encourage them to pursue the language beyond the game. \nThe core book will also come with an American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet sheet. The video tutorial unlocks through a stretch goal.\nMilestone certificate\nPersonal thank you via social media: acknowledgement of your support via the platform of your choosing.

He earned a creative writing Masters degree and went on to try out the life of a novelist. Rich, however, is a born socialite and before long was craving collaboration. He returned to playing Dungeons & Dragons a decade ago after a hiatus of 30 years and is now DMing for groups of teens and adults. With Inspirisles, he has the opportunity to work with creatives he admires in the community, honour a decade working with the deaf and fulfil a dream of producing something his daughters will be proud of.\nKathryn Oxenham (@Kessa_Brae) got lured into D&D by her husband Rich and has never looked back. A born geek, she attended a theatre school for ten years as a child and found that this helped with her crippling shyness. Hatchlings and Inspirisles were very much Rich\u2019s baby until she finally could no longer take an evening of gaming (Sims or Stardew Valley) interrupted and became his sounding board, editor and anchor when his flights of imagination bordered on the absurd. Kathryn works with vulnerable deaf adults, finds it incredibly rewarding and has loved the opportunity to achieve level two in BSL. In her spare time she enjoys baking, writing fan fiction, gaming, D&D and acting as referee to her young daughters.\nLiam Hocking (@LiamHocking1) is a designer for Inspirisles with a fervent interest in promoting inclusion within education for teens and young adults.

Liam is now a principle educator who works closely with young people experiencing a range of vulnerability issues. He is constantly searching for new ways to improve learning environments and researching ways to incorporate roleplaying and gamification within academia for young adults.\nOur website", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhilst we are furiously dedicated to the project, we all have commitments outside of INSPIRISLES. If we run into any unforeseen issues, I have a talented and dedicated community to call upon for help. \n\nThis is our first time using DriveThruRPG and though it is a tried and tested process for many independent creators, there is still uncertainty there. However, because of their print-on-demand structure, only books purchased by backers are ever printed.\n\nThough our stretch goals are not unrealistic, if we don\u2019t unlock the 7k tier, we won\u2019t be able to produce (at least initially) an American version of the core book. This would be a disappointment for our US backers and could turn some away.\n\nIdeally, we wish to hire a layout designer for the core book (Anna Urbanek of Double Proficiency), but if we do not significantly surpass our funding goal, we will need time to learn Affinity Publisher.

Many generations ago, the forerunners abandoned the rings and left behind the current inhabitants. The rodents of the Great Tree have built a life and home but are in need of new resources to continue to grow and prosper. \nRailroads extend to the outposts and airship ports to assist with exploration. The residents of the Great Tree live in a time of adventure and exploration, but also a time of danger. The forerunners did not just leave behind the rodents, but their way of controlling them as well. As the rodents move out into the ring to find the ruined forerunner outposts, they are met with the many threats left behind by the forerunners. \nTake on the adventure and exploration! Defend the realm from ancient threats. Join us and enjoy Brass Rings. \nBrass Rings is a small tabletop RPG meant to fit in a pocket. The purpose of this is to give away at gaming conventions and other events to engage people and remind them of us after they have left our table. \nWe won't be selling this game after the Kickstarter, it will only be available through Kickstarter and events.\nThe gameplay is narrative-driven with a small dice system used to decide the test. With a handful of dice tosses you can determine the fate of the rings of Saturn. \nBrass Rings will be distributed via 2 PDF\u2019s. One will be printable on 1, 8.5x11 sheet of paper (print to the edge of the page capability is necessary to get the proper formatting). The other will be formatted to fit the screen of a smartphone and be read easily. \n\nBut wait, you say 8.5x11, that doesn\u2019t fit in my pocket! Well not only are you getting a new RPG but a craft project as well. Once the PDF is printed (front and back) you can then fold it into a pamphlet so it fits in your pocket. The folded book will be about the size of a standard US playing card. \nFirst, we thought it would be fun if a bunch of people were at an event and could sit around between events and pull this out of their pocket to play. The learning curve is nearly non-existent and the game can be learned to play in less than 5 minutes. Character generation takes about 2-5 min for first-time players as well. In less than 10 minutes, the group can be on their fist adventure on the rings of Saturn.  \nThe other reason we are doing this is to help build a community of players. The more people with access to light entry-level games, the more people who can grow to enjoy our wonderful hobby. We are hoping to interact with you here to build games that everybody can play and that can be shared easily.\nWe can't make games without you. Well, we can, but they look really sad sitting on the bookshelf not being played. We like to be engaging and have conversations with you about the games we make and the games you play. We will be holding polls throughout the campaign to finalize some of this game, the adventure, and places within it. We can't wait to get your input and to enjoy this game with you.\nWhat will we do with the funds? We will mostly pay some artist and for some printing. Maybe buy a new strait cutter. Any excess funds will pay for trips to events to distribute the game to the masses!  \n Sign up for our newsletter to get updates and new content every month.  \nDue to its small form factor, there isn't much we can actually add to the physical copy of the game. However, we still have some more content to offer that we think will greatly improve your experience playing the game.\n$100\nThe voice actor for Dr. Crackers will reprise their role to bring you adventures. These adventures, or hooks, will work as a storytelling tool to help your Game Master make the world more immersive. These adventures will be intended to give the players an objective and to help build a narrative about the world of Brass Rings. If this goal is met, all of the \"audio log\" adventures will be available for free on YouTube at no extra cost to the GMs or Players. \n$150\nDr. Crackers Guide to the Rings of Saturn, a brand new pamphlet filled to the brim with adventures and world-building will be available to our backers. Since the game is designed to be a pocket-sized RPG, we thought about how we could possibly sweeten the deal even further. We already put as much game as possible on the pamphlet, so there isn't anything we can really add to it. Then it hit us, why not just release another pamphlet. If we can hit this goal of $150, we will design an additional pamphlet with more adventures, more story, and more locations to fill out the world of Brass Rings even further. Effectively, meeting this goal will literally double the size of the game.\n$200\nThe support from all of you has far exceeded anything we could have ever expected! If we can make this stretch goal, the money will go straight to our artists to make art for printable miniatures! The file for the printable miniatures will be available online for anyone to print, cut, and use for their adventures on the Rings of Saturn and beyond!\n$400\nAfter much consideration, and an unprecedented amount of support from all of you, we have decided that if we can hit $400 we can commission enough new art to make a zine sized 20-30 page game with black and white art. This game will be available for purchase after the kickstarter, but the PDF version of the game will be available to anyone who pledged at least $1 USD to the kickstarter. This means every person who chose the $1 buy-in for the PDF of the pamphlet will also get the PDF of the game should we meed the goal. If we hit this goal, we are looking at a higher pledge tier for people to pre-order a printed copy of the game. Until that happens, if you wan't the full game to happen, every dollar counts, and every little bit of feedback from all of you will help us bring this game to life!\n$400+\nWe don't have any more stretch goals to offer, but we do have more content we can offer! Any extra money pledged will go toward up-scaling our previous stretch goals. Specifically, we plan on scaling our $100 stretch goal up by getting more voice actors and making more characters for our \"audiohooks.\" We think having voice-acted \"audiohooks\" can add a layer of immersion to the game. We also believe it can extend the life of an RPG by giving the GM more hooks and adventures to work with. All of these \"audiohooks\" will be available for free on YouTube, and will expand on the universe of Brass Rings by bringing more characters and possibly even more locations to the rings of Saturn. Keep an eye on the Updates section of the Kickstarter, we will be posting our stretch goal progress there often!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the core game running and tested.

This manual will dive you into a dark world full of terror and despair. The Undeads come back from the afterlife, and eternal beings crave the nullification of reality. You will face ancient horrors, but you will also come to know superstition and occultism, and you will learn to follow the Moon as the only guide in this nocturnal world.\nIn this ruthless setting, players will play night explorers, resilient survivors who adapted to the Lunar Age, an era where the sun is dead, and life still endures only thanks to the last Primordial beings.\nEmbrace the darkness!\n\u201cThou wilt tip the balance since, on thy conduct, fate lies for what is left of us all. Be steady in front of darkness, do not let thy heart cede, and may the Moon lead thee through the silent lands of the continent.\u201d\nNightfell will be published both in Italian and English.\n If the project is successful, we will consider localization in other languages!\nNightfell takes place in the Known Lands of I\u00f9rmen, during the dark times known as The Lunar Age.\nThe World you are going to face is cold and desolate. There are few inhabited settlements, and most races are now extinct. Nights are gloomy, but days show no sun nor Moon and are even more terrifying. Life in these lands persists only thanks to the faint breath of life left to the Primes, deities who are intrinsic to nature and still stand uncorrupted by the dark beings who have breached the Material Plane.\nThe prophecy of the Fourth Truth is now fulfilled, and the dark dimension of \u00c8nferun now corrupts the World. Adventurers in the World of I\u00f9rmen are usually those embracing the power of darkness to use it against the creatures of the night, or rising as a source of faith and hope for survivors. They will face a hostile environment and try not to let themselves be overwhelmed by entities that will try to enslave their spirit. Eventually, they will have to find a way to counter the destruction of reality.\nYou will face ancient deadly forests and grimdark forgotten territories.\nDuring your night travels in the land of I\u00f9rmen, you will find a lot of abandoned villages from the previous Era.\nThe Moon, called Mirithlen, is a goddess who bestowed her radiance on the pale satellite, lighting the nights up without any aid from the sun (the fallen god, Hollon). You will learn to fear and respect her since she will influence many aspects of your journey. She can give you power and courage, assist you in exorcisms, or you can invoke her name through Lunar Divination to ask her for a blessing. Beware, though, since such blessings can also benefit the monstrous creatures that await in the darkness. Some are even more ruthless during some Lunar Phases and appear only during other ones, giving life to a monster-hunting system hinged on the superstition that concerns them.\nLearn how to survive in a world populated by terrible creatures.\nThe use of magic has radically changed over the ages. In the Lunar Age, the sources of eldritch power by which spellcasters thrive are now corrupted by darkness, and usage of magic is now a dangerous practice. The arcane balances scholars of magic used to study are vanishing, and the real power of magic can quickly wear out the souls of practitioners.\nThe use of spells will cost you the very shards of your soul, making spellcasting a priceless resource. The greater your powers, the more dangerous to handle.\nDecades of darkness and death drew the Material Plane closer to the Black Reflection from a morphological and a climatic perspective. The sun no longer warms beaches, mountains, valleys, and green plains are infrequent. Most woods died or became spectral, cloaked by mist and silence. The presence of the last Primes still grants some life, the cultivation of the most resistant plants, and the persistence of some woods and meadows.\nEverything changed, and there is nothing more to smile about, if not the bright aurora that lights up the skies in those rare nights.\nNightfell is a brand new setting for 5th ed. We'll produce a Corebook and a Bestiary!\nAll mock-ups are temporary and the final product may undergo some changes.\nThe manuals will consist of about 200 pages each. A Bestiary with almost 100 new creatures, with monsters dedicated to lore and others inspired by Italian folklore, each and everyone painstakingly adjusted to fit the setting and its dreadful atmosphere. The corebook will contains rich original lore, entire chapters about the background and the history of I\u00f9rmen, religions, and cultures, and description of iconic places for your campaigns. Along with these contents, there will also be a broad study on ethnic groups, including new original alphabets.\nOne of the new alphabets in the book.\nThe Explored Lands of I\u00f9rmen. Dive into this decaying world!\nThe game will encompass several new, dark fantasy flavored playable races, along with new archetypes for the classes of the most famous role-playing game in the World, new backgrounds for your characters, and three new original classes!\nCreate characters who can face the horrors of Enferun!\nHere some of the new options:\n- Lunar Cultist: Soldiers devoted to the worship of Mirithlen, experts in Lunar Divination, and in averting the perils of the night. You will be able to choose which Lunar Phase to be bound to, to gain powerful gameplay benefits.\n- Master of Tradition: These scholars of the arcane and esotericism are masters of knowledge about creatures and legends, coming as invaluable members to parties of night adventurers.\n- Tefillin: Characters who wish to have a closer connection to the Dark World can choose to let themselves be possessed voluntarily by a ghost, becoming Tefillin. Learn how to use your ghost's powers to increase your abilities.\nThere will be also a lot of new archetypes for existing 5e classes.\nThe Nightfell manual comprehends a first \u201dCorebook\u201d, useful for players and masters. Also, we will present 80 new spells dedicated to moon magic, new items and relics are just waiting to be discovered and inspected in the search for their hidden power, and several new game mechanics that will make Nightfell a one of its kind supplement!\nLots of unique items and relics are there to be found in your adventures.\nHere some of the new mechanics:\n Grim Weapons: as you bring down creatures of the night, your weapons absorb their dark essence. When a weapon reaches its Grim Threshold, it will become formidable in fighting abominable creatures, yet a heavy burden to carry, slowly wearing out your soul.\nYour weapons will deteriorate and acquire a will of their own. Grim Weapons are deadly to the creatures of the night, but they are not for anyone to wield.\n Soul Points: In addition to Hit Points, your characters will also have some degree of spiritual sanity to keep in check. When the horrors become too many to bear, when the strain of the night and the assaults of dark enemies will drop your Soul Points to 0, you will be easy prey to shadows and wraiths trying to take over your own body.\n   Influence of the Moon: learn to practice Lunar Divination and learn about the many ways in which the Lunar Phases will affect your game, starting from the mood and powers of your characters, up to the peculiar characteristics of some creatures.\nNew POSSESSED condition for characters and NPCs.\n You can listen an exhaustive interview with Andrea Back, our Game Designer, talking about lore and our New Mechanics here:\n https://comicsclericsandcontrollers.podbean.com/e/s35e5-asking-about-nightfell-with-andrea/?fbclid=IwAR1X5FeSxOHlg3l5_oSd7KB5jsYguzBYzVlUKCSq-PVqNE4lK85j_QwMhto \nHere are some additions to the product:\n  We'll also produce a Deluxe Edition: The Tome of Shadows!\nThe Tome of Shadows will gather together the Nightfell Corebook and Bestiary, a massive 400+ pages book with a black faux leather cover, black foil design, and black book edges.\nEmbrace the Darkness with Nightfell Tome of Shadows!\n- We have dedicated a stretch goal to the production of the lunar dice. This d8 can be used in your sessions to determine the moon phase, practice the Divination, or even in the creation phase of the character when choosing the birth moon!\nWe are ambitious.

We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nAn add-on is an optional item that can be added to a Kickstarter pledge without changing pledge levels. Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You will also be able to change your selection later in the pledge manager. You will receive a BackerKit survey to your Kickstarter mail that will introduce you to the pledge manager.\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intents to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly.

We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

Presented exclusively as a deluxe format oversized hardcover, it's a dark, atmospheric tale set at the dawn of the Ottoman Empire -- a rich, grisly world of dazzling arts and brutal massacres, opulent palaces and bloodthirsty kings. \nDRAGON tells the story of Adil, a fallen old Muslim warrior, and Marjorie, a zealous young Christian nun, two scarred heroes who must overcome inherited bigotries and mutual distrust to hunt a demonic creature that wears the skin of a prince -- Vlad the Impaler, known to history as Dracula. \nA NOTE FROM AUTHOR SALADIN AHMED\nI can't tell you how excited I am about this! \nDRAGON is the Dracula story I've wanted to tell for years, full of everything that matters to me -- horrific creatures, rich history, wildly different characters coming together to confront evil. It's a story centered on the sorts of heroes that are usually pushed to the margins -- heroes who must reach across gulfs of culture and faith to face down the world's most terrifying monster.  \nCertain stories scream for certain artists, and as soon as this tale began to form in my head, I knew I wanted Dave Acosta to draw it. The way he goes from period details through pulp horror and classic comic influences is just breathtaking. He's outdoing himself with DRAGON, bringing to life Ottoman palaces and haunted forests in a way that will completely immerse the reader.  \nWhat you see here is just a taste, and I can't wait for you to experience his art -- along with Chris O'Halloran's dazzling colors and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou's brilliant letters and design -- on massive, gorgeously printed pages. \nA STUNNING BOOK, A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN\nFor years readers have been asking me to launch an original story on Kickstarter, and I've finally taken the plunge! DRAGON is a story that demands total control by the creative team and begs to be rendered as a beautiful physical object. And Kickstarter is the ideal  way to maintain that control and get such an object directly into fans' hands.\nThis will be a lavish book, published as a Kickstarter exclusive. An oversized, slipcovered deluxe format hardcover printed on high quality paper and crammed with extras from creators' notes to concept art to script and pencil pages.\nThere are currently no plans to release DRAGON in trade paperback or digital. For now, this special event hardcover is the only way to experience the story! \nWe're offering a discounted early bird reward tier for those who support the project in the first 24 hours, but our campaign for DRAGON is deliberately very straightforward, with no bells and whistles. It's all about making a jaw-dropping book that showcases an intense story, and getting that book straight to readers.\nOUR TEAM  \nSALADIN AHMED won the 2017 Eisner Award for Best New Series alongside Christian Ward for Black Bolt. His short fiction has been anthologized by George RR Martin and performed by LeVar Burton. His novel Throne of the Crescent Moon was nominated for the Hugo Award and was cited in the Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook. Abbott, his creator owned comic with Sami Kivela, was nominated for the Bram Stoker award. Saladin currently writes Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel for Marvel Comics. \nDAVE ACOSTA is a sequential artist from Metro Detroit, known mostly for his work on Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark for Dynamite. Dave has also illustrated Vampirella, The Shadow, Doc Savage, and the serial killer-thriller Twelve Devils Dancing.\nCHRIS O'HALLORAN is a colorist from Cork, Ireland. He colors Ice Cream Man from Image and has worked on books for Marvel, Dark Horse, Boom, Dynamite and others.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU is a comics letterer, half from Algeria and half from England. He's lettered cool comics like Red Sonja, X-O Manowar, and Protector. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine.\nNATE COSBY is an editor and writer, that's worked on Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more. \n**A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON SHIPPING**\nShipping fees are not included in your pledge.

The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.\nFrom cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any \"system-agnostic\" settings you own.\nPLAY\n\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.\nYeraksys: Dying World\u2014one of the original BYTE RPG settings\nBesides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these\u2014No Coin for Charon, an open world, \"hex crawl\", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting\u2014will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.\nNo Coin for Charon\u2014a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook\nEach rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.\nAs all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.\nAshes of the Heavens\u2014one of the two settings that may be unlocked as Stretch Goal rewards\nTo tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. \nNo other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.\nDo you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game?

Nevertheless, as first-time creators, we took great care in choosing to launch the campaign only when we were absolutely sure we could deliver it. We are very close to the finishing line. The text is already in place, fully written and edited. Layout is already paid for, and most of the art is already done. Funds are needed only for a final proofreading pass and additional art. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout and proofreading done in time. For that, we are giving ourselves plenty of time to have the required printing test so that vouchers for the physical copies may be delivered to backers in time with the PDF version in

The peaceful state of the world is threatened when a mysterious poison known as The False Gold finds its way into the veins of the world's Monsters, causing terrible, maddening Wounds, which drive these incredible beings into uncontrollable rages. The once unbreakable bond of harmony and respect between Humans and Monsters is on the brink of collapse, and it's up to you and your allies to set things right.\nYou play as Monster Care Specialists, elite vets equipped with the knowledge to heal any wound, given enough time and preparation. In the game, you travel this amazing Miyazaki-esque world, going from town to town in hopes of finding Monsters infected with The False Gold, diagnosing their illnesses, crafting cures, and healing their minds and bodies of the strange, magical Wounds which drive them to destruction. To do this, you'll solve local problems, investigate the land and its mysteries, and apply the skills, abilities, and knowledge you'll build up throughout play.\nMechanically, Monster Care Squad utilizes a narrative first system influenced by games such as Rhapsody of Blood, Ryuutama, and Ironsworn. Most rolls are handled by two six-sided dice, and the game is designed to be easy to learn while providing opportunities for deep and evocative storytelling; tools to build incredible and unique characters without the limitations of playbooks, and powerful GM mechanics to plan the perfect session, or create one on the fly.\nEvery adventure in Monster Care Squad follows three phases of play - first a Diagnosis phase, where your party arrives in town, assesses the situation, asks questions, and solves minor problems around the town in exchange for information and leads. Once you've figured out what's wrong with the Monster, then begins the Synthesis phase, where brewing the cures and salves, preparing spells, and making plans is the name of the game. Finally, once everything is in place, the Symbiosis phase has the team face off against this incredible, wounded Godling, attempting to cure its wounds and restore its enraged mind.\nDo a good job, and the Monster may even grant you a portion of its power in the form of magical Monster Gifts as thanks for your aid.\nHelping you through all this are a number of mechanics that put a strong emphasis on collaboration, gentleness, hope, and mutual support - both between the party members, and the party and the GM. Aces are bits of knowledge, special equipment, and abilities you gain through play that you can spend for bonuses on your dice.  Specialties are natural talents and training that your heroes can always succeed at, and the special Mentor system allows the GM to get in on the action, support their party and go on adventures with them. You'll need all these and more to bring peace to the poisoned Monsters and restore balance to the world of Ald-Amura!\n We think that Monster Care Squad is a hell of a rad game, but you don't have to take our word for it. We've set up a preview kit right here that shows off an early form of the game you can check out to get an idea of how it works! \nWant to hear how the system works in play?

A heck of a haul!\nDue to popular demand, we have a print edition now! $60 gets you the hardcover book, produced to the highest quality. This will also include digital download codes for all of the above!\nShipping for the print edition will be handled by our post-campaign page via JetBacker. Based on a few estimates, the average international shipping cost will be around $35. it's a little cheaper to some places (Canada is around $25), and a little more expensive elsewhere (Australia and Europe closer to $40). Domestic shipping is going to be roughly $5.\nIf that's not enough for you, we have an add-on you can add to your pledge. The Monster Care Squad Soundtrack by Jan Martin in exclusive vinyl format. Custom, limited print artwork that you won't see anywhere but on this record, and a specialist, hand made, lo-fi quality, this beautiful relic can be added to any tier simply by adding $60 to your current pledge.\nCheck out Jan's music here!\nImage for promotional purposes only.

Our artist Leafie is bringing both barrels into this project and blasting everyone into the sun with her talent, and I know why you're all here - those pretty pictures, right?\nHere's the deal, if we raise $8500, Leafie will be able to produce the artbook of her dreams, full of the art of Ald-Amura, as well as her own personal work, and every single one of our backers will get a PDF of that for free. Free! - UNLOCKED!\nUp next, at $9500, the ineffable Jan will be recording a 10 track OST that'll be included in every order.

Once you're inside it, it is the world. Something drives the borders of The City ever-onward, crawling towards the horizon. Urban sprawl made real. Neighborhoods appear and disappear overnight, the city is filled to brim with no shortage of interesting characters, cultures...and monsters. That's where you come in, Slayer.\nSlayers is a tabletop RPG of mercenaries and monster hunters for hire. Known by locals as Slayers, players wander a haunted city, cursed long ago to expand towards the horizon forever. Slayers help clean out the monsters that infest the alleyways and shadows, and those that the city seems to be manifesting on its own. \nIt's slay or be slain. Better get to work, Slayer. \nThe Highlights\nA beautiful full color, digest size (A5), hardcover book \n Asymmetrical combat mechanics for each class. No two players will do the same thing in combat, down to how they roll the dice!\nExplore a world that is ever-shifting. While the foundation is given to you in the book, you as a table will build The City together over time.\nWith a game built on making every creature and character unique, you have the ability to hack and create new classes, monsters, and experiences easily. Less time worrying about stat blocks, and more time jumping into the Hunt.\nWhat's Included\nInside the book, you'll find:\n Complete rules for playing Slayers\n 4 classes of monster hunter\nSetting information to start unraveling the mysteries of the haunted city, and how to make it your own\nGM advice on running the game, dealing with asymmetry and balance, and creating Hunts for your players\nAn example Hunt, and two example districts with plot hooks to get your campaign started\n Over 20 monsters for your table to start hunting\nIn addition, thanks to stretch goals, the book will also include:\nEven more monsters\nMonster art\nArt of some of the districts of The City\nA guest adventure, written by Nevyn Holmes\nA guest adventure, written by Banana Chan\nRewards\n$1: You want to support Slayers and help make it become a reality. Thank you!\n$10: The PDF version of the game. This will be made available as soon as it has been sent to the printers, and will be fulfilled using itch.io.\n$15: Slayers, printed as a full color, hardcover book, plus the PDF copy!\n$25: You get the Slayers book and PDF, plus you get my previous game, Score, which was recently nominated for an ENnie for best writing! Save on shipping and get both games at the same time.\n$100: Sure you want to play the game, but what about building it? The City is unique and takes many forms. Backers at this tier get the Slayers PDF and book, as well as the Score PDF and zine, AND will also help design a district for the setting which will be included in the game! Space in the book is limited, and so there will only be five openings for this tier.\nPlaying the Game\nDuring a session, Slayers will go hunting a new monster that lurks somewhere in The City. Each district of The City brings about unique challenges, different factions to work for and against, and of course, monsters to hunt. During play the Slayers will prepare, investigate, and ultimately hunt their target. \nIt won't be easy though. The City itself is dangerous and unpredictable. The factions within the walls are just as likely to stab you in the back as they are to lend you a helping hand. Even if the Slayers can navigate the twisting City, they'll need to fight a monster or two along the way.\nThe System\nSlayers uses a fast paced and rules-lite system, that allows the players to make tactical choices in combat, while keep the action moving forward. The game runs on a simple dice pool system, where any roll of a 4+ is a success. Players will roll different sized dice to represent their level of expertise in both combat and other monster hunting skills.\n You can see a great read through of the of the current rules by Arvid (@breakdown707) on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpD6OTDDTJk \nAsymmetry\nSlayers was born from my desire to have classes in an RPG feel different from one another during play. If a wizard is conjuring the power of raw elements while a fighter is swinging a battleaxe, and they're both just rolling a d20 and adding a modifier, are they really that different?\nI don't think so, and so I infused Slayers with asymmetry in how each class approaches combat. While the entire game runs on the rule of 4+ as a success, how each class gets that 4+ is very different. In the game there are four different classes of Slayer you can choose from.\nThe Blade\nThe Blade is an expert fighter who carves their way across the battlefield with graceful lethality. Moving at a near supernatural speed, Blades are able to hit their foes again and again, tearing them to shreds before they even have a chance to react. To capture this feeling of fast-hitting sword fighting, the Blade uses an exploding dice mechanic to create combos of hits against their foes. \nThe Gunslinger\nWhile most wield blades or flintlock pistols and rifles into battle, the Gunslinger has access to an incredibly rare weapon: the six-shooter revolver. These weapons are specially crafted, and each Gunslinger has a special connection with their six-shooter as they tinker and customize it to their liking. 'Slingers in combat focus on resource management, deciding when to pick up a fistful of bullets to put down a monster, and when they have a chance to reload those metal monster killers.\nThe Arcanist\nThe Arcanist is a spell casting Slayer, whose power comes from a source that is slowly destroying them. The Arcanist\u2019s mind and body are taxed as the corruption from their power source drains them. The more they cast their spells without care, the more that corruption will create chaos in their plans. Arcanists use a push your luck mechanic, because they can freely boost the power and effectiveness of their spells, but with possible dire consequences.\nThe Tactician\nTacticians read a battlefield like a scholar reads a book. They use their expertise in tactics and leadership to coordinate the efforts of Slayers. While their fighting days may be behind them, or never really began, the Tactician ensures that their allies move strategically while their enemies falter. Unlike any of their fellow Slayers, Tacticians are terrible in combat if they have to participate. Instead, Tacticians generate a large pool of rolled dice at the start of combat, and use that them to replace dice rolled by friend and foe alike.\nThe City\nThe setting of Slayers is The City, a literal urban sprawl that lost its name after centuries of constant expansion. Something drives The City ever towards the horizon, swallowing up towns, terrain, and anything else unlucky enough to get in its way. What is causing this cursed expansion? Play to find out.\nNo two groups will have the same experience with The City. You are given the tools to create, change, and define the setting in whatever way best suits your table. In a city that is infinitely expanding, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination!\nThe City\nWhere Are the Funds Going?\nFunding will primarily be going to three sources:\n1. Art. Justin Benford has already done a great job with the character art for the book, which you can see all over this page. Phil Stone will be doing illustrations for the monsters of The City. \n2. Layout. Francita Soto is all lined up to make this book look REALLY nice. She will also be doing custom character sheets. You can check out her portfolio at: https://www.behance.net/francitasoto \n3. Guest Authors. Nevyn Holmes and Banana Chan will each be writing their own adventure to be included in the book. You can learn more about them and their other projects below!\n4. Printing & Distribution. I really want to get a great quality print of this game, and so funding will go into not only getting copies for all of the backers, but high quality prints. I will be using Mixam for the printing.\nAny extra will help offset Kickstarter's fees, mailing supplies, and other miscellaneous costs.\nStretch Goals\n All stretch goals have been reached!\nUNLOCKED - More Art. Let's bring The City and the monsters inside to life.\nUNLOCKED - Even More Art and Monsters. Can you really have enough monsters to hunt? I don't think so.\nUNLOCKED - SO MUCH ART. Let's fill this book with cool art.\nUNLOCKED - Hardcover Upgrade. All printed copies of Slayers will be upgraded from paperback to hardcover!\nUNLOCKED - New Hunt. Nevyn Holmes will write another Hunt to go in the book, letting your group hit the table running and jump right into an adventure!\nHere's the pitch:\nThe Slayers have heard rumor of a strange string of killings in the Revulsion District, known for being a place of the strange and uncanny horrors that otherwise hide beyond sight in The City.  The Cult of The Disjointed Hand has been channeling a ritual to bring an agent of their god to The City. Doing so will evolve their long-term shadow-war with The Sigil of Valiance (a group just as twisted and corrupt) into something more explosive, with the aim to destroy them and take their territory. The Slayers must stop this summoning, as it will surely bring more destruction to The City than The Cult of The Disjointed Hand is predicting.\nUNLOCKED - New Hunt. Banana will write a Hunt to go into the book, bringing the total number of adventures for your group to 3!\nHere's the pitch:\nThe beautiful and sunny district of Opaline is where people come to make it big in their careers. Actors and bards swam here in the hopes of becoming superstars, without realizing the dangers that lurk beneath\u2014a cult of Doctors that collect the living for their organs and flesh, to summon the great God, Devastation.\nMeet the Team\nSpencer Campbell (Game Design & Writing) is an indie tabletop RPG designer out of Chicago.

Even still, there are always risks and challenges to consider. To help mitigate those risks, 90% of the game is already written, so there won't be major delays because of development. I have already spoken with my artists and designer about possibly adding more work to the book if we reach our stretch goals, and we have realistic deadlines laid out. \n\nThe biggest risk is that this will be my first time running a campaign that will support international shipping. Given the current situation our planet is facing, there is always the possibility of delays or mistakes made during shipping, and I will work quickly to resolve them.

This allows a Squidmar Miniatures brush to hold more paint in its bristles without losing its point, and lends it the stability and elasticity needed to make the brush feel properly responsive to your movements. Additionally, this design allows you to use a larger brush than you might have normally to accomplish even finer details! The Tobolski Kolinsky hair is compared to Synthetics well rounded and great at keeping its original shape. Giving you a longer working time during paint jobs and lasts you longer keeping the tip pristine even after working on big projects for longer times.\nSquidmar Brushes - Size Comparison - Equivalent of approximately 00-2 (differs from brand to brand)\nOur basic brush set contains four Squidmar Miniatures brushes, ranging from XS to L. We chose these four because we feel they represent the most common, and best suited, brush sizes for miniature painting. In addition to our basic set, however, we've also designed a tiny brush, for the finest of details, and an XL brush for heavy duty paint jobs! Armed with a full set of Squidmar Miniatures brushes, you'll be ready to take on any painting project! No wargaming army is too massive, no immaculately detailed display miniature too exquisite!\nThe brushes, from Tiny to Extra Large!\nWow, those are some cool ferrules!\nNot only are the brushes wider, so are the handles! They are designed for comfort and ergonomics, adapted to the anatomy of the human hand.  The handles of Squidmar Miniatures brushes are therefore thicker and slightly triangular. This allows the brush to rest naturally in your hand, which lets you relax and focus on painting without risking the dreaded \u201cpainter\u2019s cramp\u201d. Oh, and did we mention the fancy gold ferrule? We thought it\u2019d look cooler that way.\nYour brushes are the safest when they're guarded by an antediluvian squid-being!\nOur brushes ship in a sleek cylindrical storage case. The bottom of the case is lined with a dense storage foam to stick the brushes into. This allows a Squidmar Miniatures brush to rest standing up, and avoids having any pressure placed on the bristles themselves. An open storage case additionally serves as a handy paintbrush stand while sitting at your workstation, your entire collection standing at attention! Handy, right?\nCool and practical in equal measure!\n\nNot only are we Kickstarting world-class paintbrushes, we're also introducing a line of exquisite miniature busts, custom sculpted for our campaign! Each bust is incredibly detailed, imaginatively designed, and bursting with character - sculpted by such renowned artists as Joaqin Palacios and Leonardo Escobar Quintero! There are 5 of these resin cast miniatures in total at 1/10 scale, ranging from 6.5 centimeters to as large as 10 centimeters. The retail cost of these never-before seen miniatures will range from 45\u20ac to 55\u20ac, but all will be exclusively available for 40\u20ac each through this Kickstarter, or even cheaper when purchased in a bundle!\nThese fantastic miniature busts are specifically designed to help you become a better painter, sculpted to enable you to practice (and master!) painting everything from warm, rugged skin to cold, gleaming metal! Don't worry, though, we're here to guide you through it. Each bust is accompanied by a YouTube video painting guide where expert painters demonstrate advanced techniques, made simple!\nSquidmar's Boxart of Illonth\nArmau Lazaro work in progress of Zion & Dea\nMagic in the making!\nThe Squidmar Miniatures paintbrushes are hand-crafted to exacting specifications by experienced professionals, using only the highest quality materials and the finest Kolinsky Sable hair. The union of comfort and practicality in each brush is perfect for experienced painters working to master their craft, beginners who are brand new to miniature painting, and everyone in between! \nThis Kickstarter is a great opportunity to not only grab a set of fantastic paintbrushes but a set of beautiful miniature busts as well! These finely detailed miniature busts, bursting with character, will allow you to grow and develop as a painter. We'll be with you throughout your journey through our custom painting tutorials, where we'll do our best to guide you through a variety of advanced techniques.  \nFinally, a heartfelt thank you from our entire campaign for taking the time to read this, and we hope you pledge a contribution, no matter how small. Join us in our quest for the miniature paintbrush of our dreams!\n\nWhen our Kickstarter campaign has reached its end, you will have the option to add some additional products to your pledge through our pledge manager CrowdOx, such as stickers, Kickstarter exclusive t-shirts, miniature plinths, and brush soap! You can also add additional brushes and busts, if you want more of all that good stuff, and if you change your mind you can also increase your pledge level here on Kickstarter. You\u00b4ll then get too choose your addons at CrowdOx after the Kickstarter has ended.\nHere are some of the great and talented artists that have been helping us out, stress testing and trying out the brushes to make sure the quality is as great as promised!

If any problems should arise with your shipment, do not hesitate to contact us at Sales@squidmar.com! All reports are individually processed by the staff of Fantasia North. \n\nBecause of these possible inconveniences and problems, communication is key. This is doubly true in the chaos of Covid-19.

These additional products include, amongst other things, single brushes, brush soap, exclusive t-shirts and display plinths for your miniatures. Increasing your pledge, adding additional products, or both, will incur no additional fees or processing costs. \n\nREFUND POLICY \n\nYou are entitled to a full refund, including any fees, within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter campaign, no questions asked. After that date we have no way to refund any processing or Kickstarter fees, but we can still refund the cost of the product. If, however, the brushes or busts are already being processed for shipping, or have already been shipped, we can unfortunately not refund the payment. If a product is lost in shipping, or cannot be delivered to you at all, we will fully refund the purchase, fees and all.\n\nThis project is based on Swedish currency, SEK, and all purchases or refunds applicable are processed in SEK. All refunds are processed through Fantasia North, and refund inquiries are to be directed to the Sales@squidmar.com email address. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not accept the terms and conditions found below, please do not contribute to our Kickstarter campaign.

THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH.\nTHE PROJECT\nThe Bone Herder is an Afropunk/Afrofuturistic fantasy horror comic that puts black characters at the center of the story. Often people of color are left out of fantasy worlds or forced into stereotypical roles. I'm not alone in my desire to see settings that extend beyond the familiarity of typical western stories. This project originated from Gail Simone's Comic School, which gave me the confidence to go forward with my idea. \nTHE SQUAD\nOpe, I am Zaire Lanier and I am a writer and narrative designer from the Midwest and I am the writer for The Bone Herder. The sequential artist is Tumo Mere from Botswana and the concept artist is Morgan Madeline. Morgan and Tumo are known for their work in the amazing SWORDSFALL UNIVERSE and more! Sam Willoughby came on to do additional art! Gary Kings and his sister, Harriet did the trailer and music respectively. Please give everyone follows and support!\nZaire: https://twitter.com/Zlanier21     \nTumo: https://twitter.com/ItsTumo  \nMorgan: https://twitter.com/mormadillus\nSam: https://twitter.com/SamRWilloughby   \nGary: https://twitter.com/GaryJKings      \nHarriet: https://twitter.com/Harriet_FerretE                                             \nTHE STORY\nEvery generation, a child is chosen to travel from village to village punishing wrong doers, by flaying their bones and burying them. Cass is the first to break the tradition, but in doing so breaks an ancient pact with the Flesh Folk. \nPreliminary sketch of the first page - Tumo Mere\nColored and Lettered First Page by Tumo Mere\nTHE WORLD \nThe Bone Herder takes place in the mythical country of Koatrom and is inspired by pre-colonial Africa and Afropunk aesthetics. Why Afropunk? It is a battle cry against the norm and a baseline for something different. It isn't easily defined. Fantasy has been built on the shoulders of the Western ideals. While I enjoy it, it does have its issues, prejudices, and hurtful stereotypes. \nThis is why  I am creating the world of The Bone Herder. It is for people, like me, that want to a reflection of themselves in the media they consume. My family tree and genealogy have no known origin. Africa is the framework for my existence and I feel an attachment and at times even a hole for a motherland I never knew. I imagine worlds and stories they might have once been a part of many, many years ago.  \nI based the world around ancient African cities like Carthage and Kush. The ancient cities of Africa are a rich and diverse world. I have created my own mythos surrounding the mysterious and ancient Flesh Folk. \nWhile this story is a fantasy horror comic, I want to portray a strong and loving Black family. Cass's family will come strongly into play and we will see the impact that they have on her personhood as the story progresses. \nTHE DUO\nAnallelli Yosi - Cass's mentor and teacher. Analleli hates what she does, but knows it is necessary. She acts out of a sense of duty.\nAnalleli Concept Art - Morgan Thomas\nAnalleli by Tumo Mere\nCass Ilondyri - The forced apprentice to Analleli. She's vowed vengeance against her mentor and wants to end the practice. \nOlder Cass by Tumo Mere\nCass Concept Art by Morgan\nThe Rewards\nLogo Pin\nCass Button by Morgan\nAnalleli Button by Morgan\n11x17 Print by Sam\nTHE SCRIPT\nI wanted to show you guys a couple pages of the script :)\nPage 1 of Script by Zaire\nPage 2 of Script by Zaire\n THE BUDGET\nART \nAbout half of the funds are going directly to the artists. A lot of Kickstarter comics are already finished, but this isn't the case with Bone Herder. This is helping fund production of the comic, which goes towards myself, Tumo and Morgan, as well as Gary and his sister, who did the trailer and music. We all have already put in so much work and our skills deserve to be properly compensated.\nI believe very strongly in paying artist fair rates for their time and skills. I saved and paid out of pocket for a first page and some concept art. They both believed in the script and decided to come on board for the project. I am trying to pay as close to professional rates as possible. Passion does not pay bills, as nice as that would be\nPRINTING AND SHIPPING\nThe rest of the money goes towards printing, getting books bound, posters, etc. \nThe Promise\nWe will be transparent with every step along the way. I promise to treat this comic and work respectfully. I wrote The Bone Herder with people like me in mind, who want to see more diverse characters and stories in comics. Fantasy has always catered to a Western bent. I want to help change that. I modeled the world partially off of ancient African cities like Carthage, Kush, and places that Africa influenced. The ancient world was more colorful than we were taught. \nI am excited about what I have put together with my team. I hope that you are too and that I will see you at the finish line!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. I believe in the concept, but I haven't ever planned a project of this size before. My name isn't out there a ton, but there has been a lot of interest in the comic. \n\nI believe that my main risk would be attempting to large a scope for my first project. To mitigate this risk, I have been consulting friends and professionals that have run other successful Kickstarters. This ensures that I stay grounded. My artist are being paid through the Kickstarter and I want to make sure that they are able to be paid fairly on time. The rest of the money will be going towards shipping and production costs.\n\nMy challenges are mainly keeping an open line of communication with the team since we are working remotely. We have daily checkins and keep each other encouraged and on track.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Small Bones - Credited Backer", "descp": "Just feel like being supportive?

When I finally broke into freelance illustration, I wanted  to give back to the industry in a meaningful way.\nI've been asking creators what type of stock art is missing in the industry. The response has been overwhelmingly clear. This project is to fill those gaps for you.\nThis project will be a collection of 75 to 100 stock illustrations with a Modern, Sci-Fi, or Lovecraft theme. There will be a total of SEVEN categories of artwork:\nFONTS - ONE font for each of the Modern, Sci-Fi, and Lovecraft Themes.\nFULL PAGE / COVER ART - THREE vertical full page illustrations designed to also be usable as cover art. Each illustration will be divided into foreground, middle, and background images.\nVEHICLES - FIVE images of various modes of transportation. These will include up to 3 variants each with a minimum of 12 total variants.*\nSCENES - SEVEN half page illustrations of action or display of skill. Like the full page art, these will be broken into foreground, middle, and background images. Each image will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 15 total variants.*\nEFFECTS - NINE images of various effects such as explosions, weather, gunshots, and more. These will be accompanied by an appropriate text effect such as: BOOM, ZAP, CRACK, etc.\nCHARACTERS - ELEVEN characters and creatures posed to be used in a scene. Each of these will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 24 total characters or creatures.*\nITEMS - THIRTEEN illustrations of various items and equipment.

We want the mechanical tempo of gameplay to be lightning fast - to keep the drama and fantasy thick, building up that sweet sweet immersive role-play experience. \nYou can always choose to roll a D20 for your Circle Check if you prefer! \nGM's can roll a D20 or verbally confirm their Checks after each Circle if desired.\nThe Epic of Dreams is setting neutral; easily adapting to any world, while excelling at epic fantasy storytelling. Learn to build worlds of your very own, or use your favorites from books and film! In addition, The Epic of Dreams is compatible with any RPG adventure module or setting - As long as you have the lore, you have it all! \nThe Basilisk Edition will feature the Physical and PDF release of the overhauled Epic of Dreams RPG! Where our last offering was full-sized, this time we wanted to produce the book in a cost-efficient way that would still deliver the experience we wanted. \nThe Basilisk Edition will be printed in a softcover A5 format, with 200+ pages of resources.\nWe are offering our standard Softcover experience, but for our Kickstarter Backers, we are offering a Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Art Hardcover copy. \nWe're only printing this Once.\nFrom Players\n\u201cI really enjoyed it. It was a little chaotic, but I know it's in the spirit of the game. I just had to reprogram my brain. I really like being able to do anything. I can really use just my sword, my shield, and my feet. It's just great. You're making me resent dice though and I don't like that lol.\u201d\n\"The fluidity of combat was amazing. The fact that I can use my whole imagination and that I'm not bound to a specific weapon was really nice.\"\n\"As a first-timer I really enjoyed it. I had friends who played LARPs and RPGs but I never played because I thought I didn't have the chops for it. But I tried this one, and enjoyed how easy it was to figure out!\"\n\"Reach and how to actually perform actions were incredibly easy. I feel like I could remember the rules ten years from now without having to reread the book.\"\n\"I really like how when you cast a spell, it's not just checking off a resource from a pool - it's a very personal, risky endeavor. Things can go wrong or weird - and the arcane is supposed to be chaotic and strange. [The Epic of Dreams] really nails that aspect.\"\n \"5 sessions in and I get emotional over the death of a pre-gen? This game does things to me.\" \n\u201cCinematically, it was one of the best battles I've probably been a part of. Every fight of EoD feels like it could be our last, and man, my character is real upset with how things went down. I like the unbound aspect of it. In D&D I would have never tried to carry a wounded friend off the battlefield.\u201d\n  From Game Masters\n\u201cThe system is easy to learn, so I was able to throw together some bad guys on the fly. They were just the power level I intended them to be! It is rare for me to make stuff on the fly that fast for any system.\u201d\n \"I wish we could've played longer. Everyone was there, ready to play and focused the whole time.\" \n\"The Muse character is such a cool idea, and it's so convenient. [By knowing my Muse's characteristics] I was able to figure out how to make new encounters mid-session. I imagined 'Green Eyes, Scowling', and I knew the quest-giver would get offended at how the Barbarian destroyed the white tiger pelt, and try to deny the players out of their pay.\"\n\"I love how seamless everything is. I can just focus on my NPCs and enemies and how they're feeling in the moment. I don't need to think about stats or DC's because they're always obvious. It's pretty great actually.\"\n\u201dFor monster stats I just thought \"What traits would they have?\" and went from there. As for running it, it was nice to have that as an option - where if I'm playing D&D or what have you it\u2019s kinda hard to know exactly what stats a given monster would have. With other RPGs I can come up with them, but it takes many weeks of reading books and playing to get to that point. [With the Epic of Dreams] I was able to do it session 1!\u201d\n   The Circle of the Muse: an Intuitive 'Guessing Game' D20 Core Mechanic where Players match Number Ranges to succeed their \"Dice Rolls\" - Dice are Optional!\n\n Story Focused Hero Characters: By knowing your backstory by heart, and remembering 2 Core Stats, you can discern your entire character sheet on the fly! The Epic of Dreams never limits character concepts by game rules. We also feature intensive Character Creation prompts to create deep, rounded, compelling characters - invaluable for any RPG - as well as Quickstart Character Creation.\n\n Pinnacle Drama Mechanics: Featuring gamified Soliloquies, as well as two different forms of 'Inspiration' points. The Epic of Dreams teaches how fun immersive role-play can get. Everyone at your table will be glued to the scene and obsessed with what happens next.\n\n A Truly \"Magical\" Setting-Neutral Magic System:  In The Epic of Dreams, Story reigns above Rules, and the same is true for our Magic System. Each Ritual cast in The Epic of Dreams has 5 potential outcomes: \"Exceed\", \"Succeed\", \"Strange\", \"Fizzle\", and \"Backfire\". Where many RPG's go to great lengths to determine exact spell effects, The Epic of Dreams instead focuses on a ritual effects', boundaries, and limits - based on a spell's lore, the caster's Measure of Power, and the actual Ritual outcome. Magic is never treated like a gun in a video-game, but rather a small part of a greater spiritual practice.\n\n The Circle of War: A new intense, 'initiative'-less, Combat System where Rounds happen in 3 recurring Phases: \"Decision\", \"Resolution\", and \"Consequence\". The Circle of War is itself a visual cue - placed like a halo of death over where the most carnage lay. In each phase, all combatants act at once, but the speaking order begins with those farthest from the Circle, snaking towards it, with those in the center speaking last. Like a powder keg, everything explodes at once, and every single round, something dreadfully unexpected is bound to happen because of it. Dungeon crawls in The Epic of Dreams are insane. \n\n The Muse Herself: Players get to have their pet characters, why not the GM too? In The Epic of Dreams, the Muse is a demigod-like character that embodies both the audience and the rules of the game itself. The GM partners with the Muse, reading their facial expressions throughout gameplay, using their reactions to inform new scenes. Muses can be any kind of character - the more developed their story and the more detailed their tastes, the more depth a GM can use their relationship to summon new, brilliant scenes - seemingly out of thin air.\n\n Improvisational GM Guide: In addition to the Muse, The Epic of Dreams contains a score of resources aimed at developing GM's into the best storytellers they can be - and how to apply these principles to dream up entire campaigns with minimal prep. (Incredibly useful, regardless of whatever RPG one is actually playing)\n\n Easy to Produce Monster Stat-Blocks: All beings share the same stats in the Epic of Dreams; thus, if one gains enough 'system mastery' to intuit their Hero character on the fly, the same is true for any monster they read about or imagine. If you know the Lore, Level, and the Order Class - you're set to bring that beast to livid life. \n\n Bestiary Sourcebook of World Folklore and Mythology: We utilize the tropes and archetypes from Mythology in storytelling and other parts of life everywhere. In The Epic of Dreams, we use Mythology as a framework and reference point to better understand both modern fantasy works, and more easily create compelling worlds and monsters of our own. We offer an extensive look into the past, with over 300+ classic and obscure beings from the memory of pre-modern man.\n\n 100% Original Art from the Author: Drew has been drawing dragons his entire life. All of the art in the new edition will be penned from his own hand (with a couple extra awesome pieces from very talented painter Joshua Lopez).\nOur original 2018 edition had some flaws. This time around, the Basilisk Edition aims to fix them with a commitment to Newcomer-Friendly, Streamlined Rules Presentation. You can download this Quickstart Sheet (and a bunch more awesome stuff) inside the Basilisk Edition Playtest Kit below!\nIf you'd like to see our prior offerings, they are available for free download!\nThe Epic of Dreams 2018 Edition PDF!\n The Basilisk Edition Playtest Kit!\n  All the game's key rules can be explored in the Basilisk Edition Playtest Kit. \nGame Content Displayed is not fully Finalized.\n Add the following adjustment to your pledge value and get some extra goodies! \nShipping Included!\nTo purchase add-ons: Choose your reward and then in the \"Manage your pledge\" menu select \"update pledge\" or \"change your pledge\" and add the money to your pledge for any add-ons you want to be added to your order. Shipping is already included in the price of add-ons.\nWhat if I told you, you could play as any character you imagined, and you can use your Backstory AS your character sheet? \nThe Epic of Dreams is both streamlined enough that you once you learn how, you don't need pens, paper, dice, or Character Sheets to play; \nAND, the game has enough depth that all the choices in your Backstory sculpt your individual Hero character as nuanced, optimized, and one-of-a-kind.\nAn Example Character on our Variant Illustrated Character Sheet!\nThe Epic of Dreams doesn't limit you for not having prerequisite feats or punish you for not understanding attack matrixes. The sum of its rules are designed to keep math out of your head and keep you thinking in character as much as possible.\nOur fights are quick, intense, and deadly. Our magic system is ridiculously customizable and so rules-lite that Ritual entries in the book are just descriptor fluff plus a few coded adjectives. Every spell cast actually feels magical. There is no 'save-or-suck' and there are no cookie cutter spell effects.\nWhy are you waiting to play games that confine your character moves based on arbitrary grid rules? Why are you wasting your time rifling through a mathy resume when you can instead be fully enveloped inside a crazy fantasy movie starring you and your best friends -\nEVERY.  SINGLE.  MOMENT?\nYour time is invaluable, and you deserve to have your game time chock full with fierce, vivid memories - where the worlds and the enemies ahead are so real you could feel them.  This is an average game session in The Epic of Dreams.\nWitness an example below. \n\nWhat if I told you, you could run a session where your players are actually invested in the story YOU want so badly to tell with them? \nWhat if I told you, you could make the lore and worldbuilding you've spent so much time on feel  REAL, and present them to your players with actual weight?\nFurthermore, what if you could run the best RPG session of your life - without any notes, dice, or a screen? Taking the fantastic world in your heart, and being able to port it into an RPG system instantaneously, and seamlessly?\nThe sum of The Epic of Dreams' parts weave together in a magical way, creating a gameplay dynamic that sucks both yourself -and your players- deep into a boiling, wild fantasy drama. In the same way that your players' brains won't be laden down by 'game rules elements' and thrust into our immersive gameplay - so will you! Because each part of the game is designed to defining things through mutual interpretation and minimal maths, you're not allocating your mind to focus on mechanics. \nWhen you reach system mastery, the game 'clicks', and it's all like the back of your hand. You can then devote all of your synapses to creating the most compelling adventure, and really make your players believe in the world hidden in your heart.\nThis game has undergone over seven years of playtesting. We have forged it such that it will never get in the way of the story you want to tell, and elevate the elements of the world you want to play in. Also, because the game defines it's numerics based on story and lore - The Epic of Dreams is compatible with ANY adventure module, for ANY system. \nWe know the epic story you want to tell- \nAnd we want nothing less than to help you sing it like Dante himself. \n We are attempting to have all of our rewards shipped by Christmas 2020. \nDaring, but much of the book itself is written already, and the rest of the project lays in editing, illustration, and layout. We are doing fulfillment through Exalted Funeral.\nThe \"Official\" fulfillment date will be in March 2021.\n\n$6000 - UNLOCKED! \nGold Foiling and Matte Lamination on the Alt Art Hardcovers of the Book! \n$8000: The Saga of Jormin Jameson\nFor our $8K Stretch Goal, we wanted to make something that benefited everyone involved with the Basilisk Edition.\nWe have had such a fun time with the Basilisk Edition Playtest, that we are going to compile all of the adventures together and release it as a published medieval fantasy adventure Zine.\nThe twist about this one, is that if we break $8K, EVERYONE is going to get it. Digital backers, Softcover Backers, and up! (Digital backers will get the digital version only)\nJoin Jormin Jameson and his rag tag crew of scoundrels and fair folk as they try their best to escort the disavowed noblewoman Lady Erna from her murderous husband, Thane Huldross of Fjaltring.\nThis adventure module will be a great starter adventure to play the Epic with new players and new GMs. It will feature Pre-Generated Player Characters with steeped lore and personas, and an open-ended adventure through a mysterious fae forest in the land of the Norsemen.\nMerch\n We're also making some pretty sick shirts.

Sign-up for our newsletter\nCAMPAIGN OVERVIEW\nMaximum Apocalypse: The Roleplaying Game is based on the acclaimed board game series of the same name. In Maximum Apocalypse: RPG, players take on the roles of survivors of one of many apocalypses, adventuring across the ravaged wasteland attempting to survive the many dangers that lurk around every corner. In order to survive, you will need to scavenge and craft new items while also scrounging for food and fighting off everything from zombies to an alien invasion. \nSurvival is not guaranteed; there are a multitude of ways to encounter death. Alien Invaders harvest survivors for organic components; Robots seek a utopia free from humans, and Zombies are insatiable stalkers. Maximum Apocalypse: the Roleplaying Game combat is a savage and brutal exchange of attacks against overwhelming odds.\nAlong with their companions, players use dice, teamwork, ingenuity, and special abilities to accomplish goals and overcome obstacles. Standing alive together when the smoke clears is the ultimate goal of Maximum Apocalypse: The Roleplaying game. Can you survive the apocalypse?\nDownload the Free Quickstart Guide Here\nWe are looking to embrace Maximum Apocalypse's artwork and will be printing all of our books in graphic novel softcover format (7\" x 10\") in full color.  We have included estimated page counts for each product but these page counts are subject to change based on production and potential unlocks during the campaign. \nAll books will be fulfilled digitally through DriveThruRPG\nWe have two different pledge levels that feature digital rewards. The $10 digital pledge gets you the core rulebook in PDF and the higher digital bundle gets you every PDF for $30.\nMaximum Apocalypse: The Roleplaying Game's Core Rulebook will be a 7\u201d x 10\u201d softcover full-color book of ~96 pages. The book will feature Gustav Rangmar\u2019s extraordinary artwork throughout along with some commissioned pages of other artists. \nAll the core rules for the game\n10 Different Character Archetypes\n11 Different Personal Apocalypses you may have survived\nDetails on Crafting, Combat Rounds and Vehicle Chases\nAdditional tables, appendices and charts to make playing the game easier\nMaximum Apocalypse: RPG's Monster Manual will be a 7\u201d x 10\u201d softcover full-color book of at least 60 pages. The Monster Manual presents a horde of post-apocalyptic enemies and monsters, including aliens, zombies, robots, and even supernatural creatures that players may encounter as they explore the apocalyptic wasteland. Each entry features easy-to-use game statistics and artwork to feed your imagination.\nEach Entry is categorized by apocalypse\nQuickly lookup stats, traits, and special abilities\nAn Essential Resource for Game Masters\nMaximum Apocalypse: Game Master's Guide will be a 7\u201d x 10\u201d softcover full-color book of ~96 pages. This Guide examines how to use the Maximum Apocalypse RPG rules to create environments and formulate your own scenarios. It is the essential book for Game Masters and when combined with the Monster Manual, makes the perfect set of tools to run any adventure.\n3+ Premade Scenarios that you can dive right into\nAdditional tables, charts and resources to make running a session a breeze\nAdditional rules, clarifications and examples\n16\" x 10\" Quick Reference Screen organizes all the useful charts and tables right in front of you\nWe always like to offer more to our Kickstarter backers. If you back now and spread the word... we just might be able to squeeze more into these books!\nFor more details on a specific Stretch Goal, check our updates.\nCharacters are customized based on 5 Core Aspects: their primary archetype, secondary archetype, personal apocalypse, age, and a lucky mutation.  Character creation is a straightforward process.  All characters start with the same base stats which are then augmented based on your choices.\nIf you are familiar with the board game, you know about the many different survivor classes in the game.  The first things players do is select a primary and secondary archetype based on these classes.  You can be a Gunslinging Priest or a Firefighting Thief or select the same archetype twice.\nThe world of Maximum Apocalypse has suffered several society ending calamities.  You will select a personal apocalypse that your character survived whether that's a zombie apocalypse, food riots, or an alien invasion. This apocalypse will give your character an edge fighting certain enemy types and other bonuses.\nLast but not least you will select your age and roll a die for a lucky mutation.  A youthful age will boost your stats but means you haven't been around long enough to become proficient at the many skills you'll need to survive.  Mutations range from being quick on your feet to being born with a psychic ability.\nDownload Character Sheets Here\nMaximum Apocalypse RPG gameplay is broken up into two distinct phases: The Regular Phase and Combat Rounds.  The regular phase borrows the best parts of rules-light, storytelling games and allows for the freedom of movement, story, and character interaction while still having a robust crafting system for everything that you scavenge along the way.  Combat rounds are more structured action sequences of conflict involving hostile forces and dice rolling.  This allows Maximum Apocalypse RPG to combine the best of both worlds: fast-paced storytelling with gritty and meaningful combat.\nMaximum Apocalypse RPG uses a d100 percentile system to easily manage dice rolls and degrees of success. For the most part, all you need are two d10s and to roll under your listed stat for any skill check.  The lower your roll, the better the success: \nTara, the Thief, is attempting to open a locked door with her Lockpick skill, of which she is Proficient. She rolls her dice and gets a 57 (5 on the 10s die and 7 on the 1s die). Because that is below the 80 of her Agility Stat, she has a Success and the door is unlocked.\nFor a more in-depth look, check out some of our full play sessions, previews or upcoming streaming schedule below:\nWatch the Nerdarchy Stream (streamed 6/9/20)\nRETAILERS\nWe will be handling all of our retailer orders outside of Kickstarter for this project, but always appreciate retailers pledging a few bucks to follow our updates and stay connected to the project.

Retailers can expect standard wholesale prices on all our products with no minimum quantities.  Retailers will get everything before Distribution when the Kickstarter fulfills.

Where dreams must be woven by witches to allow the inhabitants of the vales to dream and rest properly?\nWhat if those strange things are just the tip of the iceberg?\nAs you explore the Exalted Vales, prepare to dive in a world that lives and breathes mysticism.\n The book is about 250 pages, hardcover in full color, with a lot of illustrations. The book is written by Renaud Bartens, veteran of the video game industry, game design consultant and author, who has been running D&D campaign for more than twenty years.\nFor players, this book offers new races, classes, archetypes, backgrounds and feats to create unique heroes, whether they were born in the strange lands of the Exalted Vales or are simply passing through.\nFor game masters, it is a complete guide to the mystic region of the Exalted Vales: Locations, characters, mysteries and plenty of help to bring the unique themes of the Exalted Vales to life.\nAnd for the whole party we bring you \u201cA Shadow Among Them\u201d, an epic and mysterious campaign for 1st to 16th level characters that will put their cunning and resourcefulness to the test.\nThis campaign is shipping friendly to USA, European Union, Australia and Canada. (See the FAQ for details about Canadian shipping.)\nInspiration\nThe key feature of Exalted Vales is its theme.\nMysticism is a powerful energy in our societies, root of the most vibrant civilizations, incredible architectural feats and unimaginable pilgrimages. But depicting such phenomenal events in our favorite fantasy setting in a comprehensive, but still compelling manner can be quite a tall order for dungeon masters considering all the work they already have on their plate. That is why the Exalted Vales were born, to allow players to experience this unique flavor of play.\nA fully realized world\nOne of the characteristics of mysticism is that it requires more than just \u201cambiance\u201d to be fully realized. It's not enough to say that the city in which the players arrive is mystical, it must be given substance, strangeness and oddities must wait around every corner.\nExalted Vales gives to the dungeon master the tools and the content they need to fulfill that promise.\nIn Lusan - the city of a Thousand Oracles - people with strange powers of divination are everywhere. In the clock-makers' district, connoisseurs know where to find Alizager's little stall. This honorable artisan practices a very peculiar trade: he only sells small beautifully crafted wooden boxes. When a customer shows up, he looks into their future to find out when they will open the box, and then he puts exactly what the customer will need at that moment in the box.\nA change of scenery \nThe result for you, the dungeon master, is a real change of scenery for your players. The Exalted Vales can be added as a peninsula extending from your existing world, or used as its own setting for a new campaign. The guide contains enough material to allow you to play several campaigns before you have to take over with your own mystical creations. And with each description of the mystical Manifestations, there are several hooks for other adventures.\nIntrigue and investigation\nExisting role-playing scenarios offer players a wide array of battle-oriented adventures. The goal of the campaign \"A Shadow Among Them\" is not to compete directly with campaigns like these. The campaign is full of action and danger, but the focus is on unraveling the intrigue and mysteries of the story.\n Narrative intention\nIt is sometimes difficult for a dungeon master to immerse himself in reading a large campaign. Also, a campaign with a grand and expansive plot can be difficult to completely wrap your head around. To address this, our team has over the years developed a very specific method for writing the campaign: establish how the players are supposed to experience each scene (the intended emotional experience), and only then explore the details of the scene.\nWe begin each scene with a description of why it was written the way it is, the goal we had in mind, and how the players are supposed to feel.\nThe result is a new approach to presenting a campaign: the narrative intention. The campaign is described in such a way that the reader is presented with the genesis of the story and how progressively, using the rudiments of Joseph Campbell's work, this story is transformed into a campaign.\nWe believe this approach has great benefits for the dungeon master:\n Familiarization. By following the reasoning that leads to the story before being presented with the finished story, they better understand its inner workings.\n   New methods. Following the creation of a campaign step by step with professional narration tools allows you to acquire new methods of storycrafting to use with your own content.\n   Improvisation. When a campaign provides its narrative intention and a dungeon master adapts it, improvisation comes more naturally. You know where you are going, you know what your tools are, and the rest comes with ease. And that's when the real improvisation starts, not the kind where we panic and invent a castle and three monsters on the fly, but the kind where we know exactly what the players are supposed to experience in this castle, and adapt content as they choose their own path through it.\n  The book is already written and the campaign has been playtested for two years, but we still have a lot of content planned. Help us achieve these goals to make the Exalted Vales an even more exciting guide!\nIf you want to see a sample of our work, and a taste of the campaign, a free introduction scenario is available to download:\nFree introduction scenario\n\nWe have designed new Classes, Background features and Archetypes for all the classes of 5th Edition to allow the players to fully immerse themselves in this mystical realm.\nWhen creating a character for the \u201cShadow Among Them\u201d campaign, you can choose to stay traditional or experience the strange world behind the Tapestry.\nAll rules are fully compatible with 5th Edition.\nHere are some previews:\n\n\nWhen time comes to let your players draw a random magic item after an epic battle, or to show them the terrific threat they\u2019re facing, nothing beats a beautiful illustrated card.\n This 50+ card deck contains all the monsters and items as quick and easy to use reference cards. Spend less time digging through the rule book and more time playing!\n\n\nThe core book comes with all battlemaps needed for the campaign. But let\u2019s face it, there are groups of players that just have a knack for getting into unplanned trouble.\nAlternatively, some groups play exclusively online.\nIn both cases, the digital pack has you covered. Our artists realized the surroundings of the areas your players visit during the campaign so you can let them wander freely and with ease.\nThe second group of battlemaps visit the most iconic places and cities of the Exalted Vales, for even more adventures. \nFrom our own experience as dungeon masters, we know it's always time consuming to find tokens for each battlemap and each battle.\nTherefore, the digital pack contains not only maps, but all tokens for online play. Monsters, characters, npcs and more.\n The digital pack contains 75+ full color squared battlemaps - with and without grid, and more than 50 tokens to flesh out your battles.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaud Bartens is a Lead Game designer and writer. Today a consultant in the video game industry, he is at the head of the Exalted Vales project. With over 20 years of experience as a dungeon master, he combines passion of the game, knowledge of game mechanics and writing talent.\nJonathan Lefaucheur has been an artistic director in the video game industry for 12 years. He has participated in dozens of projects, from fighting games with Tekken to zombie invasions with Zombie Night Terror (2016). A huge role-playing fan (especially if he can play an assassin), he oversees artistic cohesion and visual coherence.\nKarl Monnerais works in the printing industry. He brings his expertise to ensure that the book will live up to everyone's expectations. New to the world of role-playing, he has only recently discovered the joys of fumbling Stealth checks.\nWilliam Martin is coordinator and project manager for the French government and for international organizations.

He has participated in the publishing and shipping of illustrated books for children.\nChlo\u00e9 Rondonneau is a delightful artist.

Where are all the other stretch goals?\nThere aren\u2019t any. With this project, I\u2019m interested in making one great source book; Terra Oblivion, not Terra Oblivion plus a ton of other things I have only a passing interest in producing. Terra Oblivion is what I\u2019m excited about, and this is what I want to create. Anything over the intended amount is great and will go into making this book better, bonuses for talents, and giving me just that much more resources for the next product.\nStarting with GODSEND Agenda, HELLAS, ATLANTIS: The Second Age, and MYTHIC D6, I've created many successful Kickstarter gaming projects enjoyed by many. Now I am focusing on Terra Oblivion.\nWith the help of other talented men and women, I've created products for PDF and physical print and maintained a level of consistency and quality that rivals larger publishers.\nYou may have noticed that there are no additional charges for shipping. This is intentional.\nBecause  shipping cost is one of the biggest issues in a Kickstarter, this time  around I have decided that the onus to pay the fair share of the  shipping falls to the backer. I know that sounds harsh, but I\u2019m actually  trying to save people money in the long run. Rather than increasing the  cost of each reward level by a static amount to try and predict total  shipping costs, I\u2019m completely individualizing the process.\nWhen  the project is ready to ship, everyone who is entitled to physical items  will be given a special coupon code that may be used to purchase the  item for $0+shipping.\nI know this isn't how it\u2019s usually done but this helps in several ways:\nThis helps make the Kickstarter successful and takes out the hidden  variables created by the hardships of International Shipping Rates.\nIt takes some of the burden off my shoulders and allows me to focus on producing the game.\nIt allows you to know with certainty that the generosity you afford me goes 100% toward the project you funded.\nIt allows me to ask for less money knowing that I don\u2019t have to factor in 2-3 thousand dollars for shipping.\nIt allows you to control how and when you want your items shipped.\nThank you for your understanding and your generosity.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKhepera Publishing is an experienced RPG publisher.

Diverse voices from around the globe are creating new games every day. We want to be the place where everyone can play, meet new people, and get their games into more players\u2019 hands. In simplest terms, we really just want to answer one question for every person in our community: What\u2019s missing from your table today?\nWe try to answer that question in 3 major ways: intuitive & seamless online video play, a creator-driven marketplace, and robust player matching services.\nOur online play interface is called \"The Table\", and is meant to recreate that intimate feeling of playing face-to-face with a tight group of players. \nCrisp high quality video chat puts the best part of the game front-and-center: the people. Show critical information through screen sharing. Upload visual aids to enhance your game via your Asset Tray. Text chat as a group or privately, allowing you to communicate however is most effective for your game.\nRoll any combination of dice by selecting them quickly from your Dice Tray. Add stat modifiers from your character sheet, track critical successes & failures, and add up your totals automatically. Draw cards from any deck of your choosing, including standard 52 card decks, tarot, and custom decks from your favorite games. Show your results live to the entire Table, or set them to Private for discreet gameplay.\nFully modular character sheet tools ensure you have what you need to play any game, even homebrew content or custom systems. We've designed our character sheet system from a standardized set of form fields, stat trackers, pools, tokens, note sections, and more - everything you need to play any RPG system. Character sheets are automatically indexed, with a Table of Contents generated for easy navigation. Everything is drag-and-drop - no code required! \nMatch with players who share your interests, based on information listed in your Profile. Use advanced filters to find exactly who you need based on desired complexity level, specific game experience, and location. You can even use Role to find experienced Game Masters to run your Table! \nRole is a people-first role playing community, and that means you\u2019ll always have tools to meet new players that align with your interests. Browse until you find someone you want to match with. If they match back, you\u2019ll be able to chat and set up your next game together!\nReal names & location data are always optional \u2013 you only have to share what you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nWe\u2019re designing a premium marketplace that puts creators first, making it easier for players to discover, learn, and purchase new games from diverse voices in the role playing community. Basic game info such as complexity, player count, and time commitment is always easy to find & search by. Creators can upload a free teaser of their game to help players quickly understand the basics, sample the world, and get excited to play more.\nSay goodbye to review bombs & trolling. Instead of a traditional review score system, Role uses a recommendation engine. Players recommend what they love, not trash what they hate.\nPlayers never have to worry about buying new games without people to enjoy them with. Every game is directly linked to our Player Matching tools, ensuring that every new player can find people and play together.\nBackers of this campaign will be the first to join the Role private Early Access program, where they can play with each other and help shape our tools before we launch to the rest of the world! In addition, we're offering a slate of rewards that include premium features, game supplements, and exclusive items only available via this campaign.\nAll of our backers will be able to play in our Early Access program, and will receive a shout-out on our \"Thank You\" page!

These digital supplements will be exclusive to the Role platform, and available first to backers of this campaign!\nFirst, we're extremely excited to reveal Lancer: Battlegroup, the official expansion from Massif Press!\nLancer: Battlegroup is a new, standalone rules system for the Lancer setting, designed for use at your tabletop and in digital, grid-free play. Blending Lancer\u2019s deep unit customization and imbued story with tactical-narrative action, Battlegroup casts the players as pilots and officers in a battlegroup deployed to the front line; as the first tremors of interstellar war test Union\u2019s integrity, you and your party members will face the enemy with new weapons and old tactics, thrown into combat with only one goal: survive, and return home.\nAs big OSR fans, we're very pleased to bring everyone Isle of Ixx from Swedish designer, Skullfungus!\nThe Isle of Ixx is both a light OSR-style ruleset and a sandbox adventure in one. The rules are based on \"Into the Odd\" by Chris McDowall, and have been chosen for their simplicity and ease of use, so that the focus can lie on adventuring and discovering the island. The system itself is also easy to adapt to any style of OSR-ruleset you might have in mind, should you prefer that instead!\nThe setting text will be written in an open-ended way, often asking the players questions about their characters and surroundings. This way, they'll be a big part of the setting and will get to influence much of what goes on in the story!\nThere will be roughly 16 key locations on the map for players to explore, ranging from cities, villages, lairs, and dungeons. There will also be tools for the game master to create their own content, in the form of generators and sample maps they can use for their own dungeon adventures!\n We're also proud to be partnering with Swordsfall to launch The Fifth Ebon Expedition, the newest expansion to this massive Afropunk universe!\nThe Fifth Ebon Expedition is a 4+ player campaign set in a unique Mission style. Your group will be part of the larger expedition, fighting to establish forward camps, and with it a railway for a future supply line. If your expedition is successful, then the question is... can you defend it?\nFrom popular Filipino creator, Sword Queen Games, we're bringing Voidwalkers - a tarot-powered game that combines mysticism with deep space exploration for an experience unlike any other!\nVoidwalkers will be a complete stand-alone science fiction TTRPG where mysticism and space-magic guide creative and intuitive stories. In this Powered by the Apocalypse game, characters must learn how to harness and balance the wild space-magic, the VOID, within themselves, while navigating and staying clear of its wild manifestations in the physical world. You must rely on creativity, luck, and relationships in order to succeed and thrive out in the Void. Players will use a tarot deck as a way to generate intuitive stories and resolve challenges. A unique tarot deck will be created for this game, but any tarot deck may be used!\nIndie designer Steven Medeiros, in collaboration with the Role team, is developing Astra - a unique blend of classic OSR and cooperative action where players pool their dice rolls and act together as a group.\nAstra is a rules light 3-6 player OSR-style tabletop role playing game with a focus on cooperative group dice pool mechanics that allow players to work together and overcome obstacles. It explores heavy themes of interpersonal connections, self exploration, and building community. Suitable for one-shot or campaign-style play, it features quick & easy character creation and narrative driven gameplay.\nLast - but certainly not least - we're working with Magpie Games to bring players a brand-new supplement for Masks! Cataclysm at the Metajunction will bring new levels of superhero action to this popular superhero RPG.\nCataclysm at the Metajunction is a playset for Masks: A New Generation, a Powered by the Apocalypse game of teen superheroics. This playset will give you everything you need to play through superheroic tales in the endangered Metajunction, along with two new costumes, or playbook variants, for you to use with existing Masks characters.

Cataclysm at the Metajunction provides the support for doing just that!\nThis playset includes: a 32 page full-color, illustrated playset, including custom moves and villains.

Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren\u2019t in the same place together. \nHaunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative Alice is Missing puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another. Right at home with games like Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, and Firewatch, it\u2019s designed to feel as much like an event-style experience as it does a role-playing game.\nAlice Is Missing runs over a single session of 2-3 hours, with 3-5 players. In the first 45 minutes, players create their characters, their relationships to Alice, and their ties with each other. The next 90 minutes are spent uncovering secrets and unearthing clues in an attempt to discover where Alice is, and who is behind her disappearance.\nThough text messages seem to be the most common mode of communication in our modern era, they are rarely utilized as a storytelling medium.\nThe integration of texting into the gameplay unlocks a brand new way to play RPGs that is unlike anything you\u2019ve likely experienced before. It\u2019s personal, immersive, and perfect for remote play.\n\nPowered by simple but unique card mechanics that give everyone equal footing in telling the story, the game runs without a GM, or gamemaster, and instead empowers the players to create the story together.\nWhile in-game time is fluid and the text messages could take place over the course of a day or more, the actual gameplay lasts a total of 90 minutes and is accompanied by a beautifully cinematic, licensed music playlist (featuring artists such as Message To Bears, This Patch of Sky, Justin LaPointe, and Be Still The Earth) which acts as both a timer and a soundtrack for the game.\nYou\u2019ll start by choosing characters, drawing a motive for how that character acts, and assigning relationships to one another. Then, using the appropriate prompts on your character card, each player will record a secret voicemail to be played at the end of the game.\nYou\u2019ll then establish some important information about your town of Silent Falls by choosing suspects and locations you think could have played a part in Alice\u2019s disappearance. Lastly, you\u2019ll receive Clue Cards that will be used during the game to generate information about the mystery you\u2019re unraveling.\nOnce the timer starts and the game begins, you\u2019ll flip your Clue Card when the number on the timer hits the number on the Clue Card\u2019s back. This will often result in you drawing a card from the Suspect or Location deck and combining it with the prompt on the Clue Card to create the information your character uncovers.\nThis clue is then worked into the text conversation between the characters organically.\n\nThese clues will continue to be revealed throughout the game, building tension and heightening the stakes until the 10-minute card flips, and the game comes to its climactic end.\n Once the timer goes off at 90 minutes, players will have the opportunity to send one last text message before the secret voicemails play over the closing music track. Once the voicemails are finished and the current song ends, the game comes to a close. \nBy putting its lens on the relationships, tensions, and story arcs between the characters looking for Alice just as much as the search for Alice itself, the game challenges players to explore aspects of emotional intimacy and personal connection in a unique and accessible way.\nAlice Is Missing inherently deals with mature themes and potentially-difficult topics such as gender, sexuality, violence, and grief. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to bring on the incredibly talented Lauren McManamon (Girl Underground, Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG, Codex) as our editor to ensure these topics are approached in a thoughtful and responsible manner. \nWe\u2019ve also included important tools to help navigate these themes at the table (and off the table) to ensure everyone has both an exhilarating and positive experience.\nThough the game has been in development for the last year, in an unintentional way, it mirrors the reality we now face during this era of social distancing; the craving for connection despite the distance that may be between us.\nAlice is Missing provides a unique way to play without the traditional hang-ups that come with trying to structure a Virtual Table Top session. Since the only time you'll need to 'go to the table' is to grab a card. The meat of gameplay exists on your mobile devices.\n We\u2019ve put a great deal of work into ensuring Alice Is Missing will be available as a marketplace item on Roll20 not long after the campaign ends. With the lack of in-person gaming opportunities given the current social distancing orders in place around the world, we hope by making the game available in this format quickly, it will allow players to share a unique roleplaying experience together from the comfort and safety of their own home.\nThe Roll20 version of the game will not replace the use of players\u2019 phones for sending text messages back and forth during the game. It will instead serve as your shared table during online play, allowing everyone to interact with the cards that drive the narrative forward.\n For those of you who would rather not use Roll20, we are offering a PDF with a Print on Demand cards via DTRPG to use with your other messaging systems of choice. It\u2019s important to emphasize, however, that the cards need to be communally accessible individually via a cloud or other software to manage remote play in this way.\nWe plan to release the digital version of Alice is Missing in July 2020. We plan to release the physical version to our backers in November 2020, with the game being made available to stores soon after through a global publishing deal with Renegade Game Studios. We will use DriveThruRPG for all of our digital fulfillment.\n For this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item.

Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death.

That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

The story  unfolds as you resolve these chapters by making choices, performing tests or simply listening.\nUNIQUE HEROES\nPlay strong characters. Each Clan member has their own story, strengths and weaknesses. You will learn about them as you play them, by acquiring new individual Hero cards in a non linear way. Some of these cards will be the result of choices you made during the adventure.\nSCENARIO BASED \nConquer a mysterious land, found a colony and resolve mysteries. Scouting missions, search or rescue parties, raids, escape, defence, investigation, or intrigue. Whether it's located on the modular and expandable wilderness game board or in the colony camp, each scenario provides a new challenge to overcome in order to gain access to the next scenario.\nPREDATORS & PREY \nFace hidden threats, which are controlled by a predation-based AI system. Use your perception and your pets to detect these threats before you face them, as an ambush can be fatal. Your enemies are vicious enough to target the most vulnerable or the highest ranking members of your group.\nWORSHIP SYSTEM\nBeg your gods to help you. Use your willpower, offerings, and the fervour of your companions to obtain permanent modifiers that will benefit all who share your faith.\nSURVIVAL... \nExploit scarce resources to survive and keep your clan together. Hunt for food. Collect that precious wood that will be a source of heat and an essential material for your constructions.

The cover will feature a black logo, and we have a Kickstarter-exclusive tier that adds #softcover2, a sketchbook that is showing alternative work, processes, and also includes a slipcase. And yes, the slipcase has a nipple. Because. \nThe single #hardcover2 book\nThe slipcase edition containing #hardcover2 and #softcover, a collection of sketches, processes plus alternative and additional artwork\nThe exclusive prints are showing artworks that are not in the books and are made by David 'Loopydave' Dunstan, Craig Elliott, Olga 'ASU Rocks' Andriyenko, Mariia Solyanik and as an extra: Davi Go.\nMany of the artists contributing to #hardcover haven't published any adult art until taking part in this project. We wanted them to be free to create any content without boundaries. The book contains diverse depictions of sexuality including LGBTQ artworks and we wouldn't want it any other way. There is absolutely no discussion about the reasons, so please don't waste everybody's time leaving inappropriate comments over our social media and this campaign. The same goes for people trying to save our souls. We already accepted our place in hell.\nYou can check out the full list of artists and links to their pages here.\n\nEven here on Kickstarter, promoting a book celebrating sexuality and the human form, we cannot show you the beautiful art contained within. We share the sentiment of sadness as we have no other option. The campaign would get rejected for anything but extremely cropped images, to a level where showing them defies the purpose of their creation. What we CAN show you is how the first campaign turned out!\nMore images here: https://www.hardcoverart.com/gallery-book\nThe artists contributing to this book will all be compensated for their effort. 80% of the profit goes straight to them. We want to be clear that by supporting this project you are also directly supporting the artists. As the publisher of Kim Jung Gi, Karl Kopinski, Jesper Ejsing, Claire Wendling, and the Superani Group, \u00c9ditions Caurette has a wealth of experience in fulfilling books like this.\nIn case you don't have a credit card to back the project, please reach out to us on orders@hardcoverart.com and we'll be happy to provide you with alternative methods of purchase (and getting all stretch goals of the campaign too!).\nThe entry phase for the third book just launched as well and will be reachable through this link. Please have a good look at the briefing and better start early enough with your entry. Even though the deadline feels months away it will come sooner than you might expect.\nWe heard each of your concerns from the last campaign and put a lot of effort into improving the shipping process. So we figured out a good price with our partners and will now offer global tracked shipping only! For the EU it is 10\u20ac, and outside the EU 15\u20ac for the single books. For the slipcases and bundles, it will be EU 15\u20ac and outside the EU 35\u20ac tracked shipping. You will know where your shipment is at any time (as far as the post-service of your country provides updates).\nWe would have loved to show you images of the products, but using this platform comes with a price for all of us, which means that to actually use it, we aren't allowed to share the products with you. So they will be a surprise, and you have to trust us, just like last time :)\nJust like last time, if we go higher than this we will obviously add more stretch goals!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the content and layout is finished.

Swashbuckle and swindle your way to victory as one of four unique captains. Raid ports, bury treasure, fall in love, and defeat your nemesis as you compete to become the most legendary pirate on the open sea.\nYour decisions will make waves throughout the Caribbean as each player takes part in shared adventures woven together by our companion app. Choose wisely. In Sea of Legends, the fickle winds of fate can fill your sails or turn against you at any moment. With twenty-six writers, crafting over 400 unique stories, you'll never play the same game twice.\nNavigate the shifting tides as you pursue multiple paths to victory and forge your own tale. Will you answer the call to adventure? The sea awaits! \nWe have officially unlocked a HUGE stretch goal! Join our crew today and at the All-In Pledge Level and you'll receive this new faction for free. This faction will be fully produced with cards, miniatures, and stories for the Golden Horde. Back now and get 'em while you can!\n\n\nIn Sea of Legends, you'll manage multiple adventures between your Lover, Nemesis, and Captain, while building up the ultimate crew and acquiring treasure. The first player to gain 10 Notoriety wins! But if left unchecked, the NPC Factions can also claim victory. That means that as the players compete, they might also have to band together so they don't all lose.\nPlayers roll dice and activate character abilities during combat.\nEach turn, players may move and take one of three possible actions: attack, visit a port, or go on an adventure. When attacking, you'll gather your dice and utilize your crew,  ship, items, and Lover abilities to gain the advantage. But your Nemesis will interfere, so keep your wits about you as you face down mythical monsters and evil empires.\nVisiting the tavern will gain players gold and items.\nYou can always stop at a port when you need a break from all the fighting. Find a Hideout to bury gold, while your crew rest and relax. Or maybe you need a bigger ship? Then stop at the Shipyard and get yourself a fancy new vessel. Perhaps a few of your crew aren't pulling their weight? Toss 'em overboard and find some replacements at the Hiring Hall! Or stop at every scoundrel's second home, the Tavern.\nBeing a pirate can really parch your throat! Why not stop and have drink? Play some games and earn yourself a few spare coins while visiting the Tavern. Who knows? You might even overhear a juicy rumor. Each rumor will lead you to a relic hidden on the map.\nAdventures are branching narrative with unique rewards and stories.\nEach adventure is part of a larger branching narrative that takes place in the Sea of Legends app. This is a choose-your-own-adventure like you've never seen before. You might help your Lover out of jam, hunt down your Nemesis, or even befriend the strange denizens of the Caribbean! Your adventures will help you find gold, items, notoriety, and other unique rewards. But whatever you choose, the Sea of Legends app will take note and connect your stories with those of the other players at the table.\nThis is a sandbox game and there are multiple paths to victory. You can hunt down relics, battle monsters, or build your very own pirate empire! It's up to you, but you can bet your dusty doubloons that your rivals won't give up without a fight. If you're raring for a shot at the pirate's life, take a look at our beta rule book and prepare for your maiden voyage! \nHow to Play Sea of Legends\nSea of Legends Solo Play Through\nFaction Overview\nEach time you play you can select one to two factions for the game session in addition to the ever-present Spanish Armada. These factions determine adventure arcs, items, crew, and Lover/Nemeses you will discover. Each faction has their own unique mechanics and objectives that they will pursue during the game. They are presented below. Disclaimer, as is the nature of Kickstarter, the mechanics presented below may change before release.\nThe Dread Tide\u2019s undead soldiers will try to form up into clusters of the three and transform into Skeletal Colossus. The colossus will infest ports, destroying them, and when the Dread Tide infest 5 ports they win--taking over the Caribbean with their undead hordes.\nThe Children of Tlaloc, our merfolk faction, move toward the corners of the map to collect relics. Once they have found them, they bring the relics back to Tortuga to summon the Sea\u2019s Firstborn. Together, they\u2019ll hunt for relics, chasing down captains who have them and once they gain four relics, they win!\nThe British Empire invades the Caribbean for queen and country, they take over shipyards to gain power and then move to unclaimed ports. They can spend their newfound power to take over that port and when they take over 4 ports they win.\nUnlike other factions, the Atlanteans have a uniquely combative dynamic between their characters. The Atlantean King In Exile doesn\u2019t start out hostile to the players. He\u2019s been deposed and has come to the surface looking for aid. If the Atlantean Seekers catch and kill the king they win, leveraging his relics and throne to take over the Caribbean. It's up to the players to defend the King In Exile from the dissidents and in exchange they get access to Atlantis\u2019 powerful artifacts.\nThe Ordo of Nocturnus sends their initiates to infiltrate the ports, establishing secret cults. Once they have five in place, they summon their demon-prince, Nocturne. Once unleashed, he will move across the map to devour his disciples and gain ultimate power. If he\u2019s not stopped, he will cover the world in darkness.\nWhen the Aztec Reawakening is chosen, players will receive a cursed Aztec coin whenever they\u2019d gain 5 or more gold at one time. These coins have negative effects similar to Nemesis abilities. If Jaguar champions attack you, you may choose to give up the coin to avoid them or if they best you, they\u2019ll take it by force. Once acquired, the champions will offer these coins to Quetzalcoatl. When Quetzalcoatl gains 6 Aztec coins, they\u2019re able to summon their empire from the ruins and win.\nWhen playing with Sea\u2019s Fury, the coven of sea witches believes all pirates are guilty of stealing their relics. The Spirit of Vengeance summons Sea Elementals that will try to sneak aboard your ship and take relics back. These elementals do not start combat when they take back their relics, so players either need to be aggressive and attack the water spirits before they catch up with the player or they will chase them down after they\u2019ve lost the relics.\nIn the Harpy\u2019s Descent, the player with the most Notoriety will get a Hunted token, the Harpy chases down that player. If the Harpy defeats them in combat. The Harpy takes the token and their Notoriety. When the Harpy steals 6 Notoriety, she wins. However, if a player defeats the Harpy they gain all the notoriety she has stolen from the other players.\n*The images above are mock-ups. Shipping is TBD.\nThese add-ons will be available through our pledge manager after the campaign concludes. So, save your doubloons for after we complete this wild adventure and then pick and choose which add-ons you fancy.  \nAs part of our lofty stretch goal, we asked for you to help shape our newest faction. Our crew of backers took part in shaping the story, design, and characters for the Golden Horde. You can follow the journey in the following updates: Update 14: Faction Face Off, Update 17: Monkey Business, and Update 20: The Golden Horde Advances Bearing New Add Ons. \nPLAY\n\nDiscover a world of desperate duels, dastardly villains, and romantic rendezvous. Make terrifying enemies and powerful allies all within the Sea of Legends app. Our app tracks and responds to your choices. Each decision you make will shape the Caribbean, introducing new challenges and adventures for each player at the table. The combinations are nearly infinite.\nThe Sea of Legends app pushes far beyond the traditional bounds of choose-your-own-adventure books, creating unique stories and endless replayability.\nThe Sea of Legends app procedurally integrates characters and storylines from NPC Factions, Lovers, and Nemeses in play. This also means that other players\u2019 Lovers and Nemeses will show up in your stories! Together, these elements combine to create an anthology of interwoven stories that are unique to your playthrough. Players will see their choices make an impact both on the board and in the tales of competing captains. The app assures these stories aren't repeated, prioritizing unplayed storylines in your game sessions until every adventure has been experienced.\nThe Dice Tower Preview: Sea of Legends\nRahdo Runs Through: Sea of Legends\nMan Vs Meeple: Sea of Legends\nAnt Lab Games: Sea of Legends\nQuackalope: Game Play for Sea of Legends\nBattlecast: Sea of Legends - Sandbox Pirate Board Game - Kickstarter Preview\nPirates Parley: Review & Overview for Sea of Legends\nSea of Legends board game zapowied\u017a\nSea of Legends: Art Spotlight\n Shipping Details \nThese are projected shipping rates.

In this project, we estimate the same quality! We use resin cast on manual full-cycle manufacturing. \nPlease note that each mini comes unpainted and unassembled.\nSince founding, we produced more than 40,000 miniatures already. \nEach of our projects was a challenge for our team. In the first project (Savage Orcs) we needed to produce 3,500 miniatures, in the second (Canitaurs&Felitaurs) there were more than 5,000, and for Pi'Rats about 25,000 miniatures. Each stage of increasing the volumes of production wasn't easy for us, but we always tried to do everything for our fans to justify your trust.\nAnd now we can say that we can efficiently produce many models with excellent detail. We improved the locks between the parts (we had such a problem in Canitaurs project) and reduced the number of parts in miniatures. \nThe project is a collaboration of Punga Miniatures and Fellowship Games. \nFellowship Games is a partnership formed from individuals from around the board game industry. We have several years experience in publishing, manufacturing, design/development, and distribution/fulfillment. We've formed a network of contacts that uniquely position us to work with creators from around the world (and here in the US too!) on making their dreams a reality! Working with Punga is just the first of many projects planned for the future!\nPunga Miniatures was created by several friends in 2017. From the very beginning, we really liked unusual concepts, so we created our first big project by our original concept Savage orcs inspired Polynesian culture. After the successful launch of this project, we have greatly improved our production, and also started working in 3D and increased the team. \nToday Punga is an association of extremely talented people who, by some miracle, gathered in one place in the center of the city of Ufa, in Russia.

A sleepy kingdom on the cusp of disaster. A wicker gate hanging by its hinges, with Somewhere Else lurking beyond. Three guardians who can save everything-- if they can stop squabbling long enough.\nWelcome to Wickedness, a fantasy RPG by M Veselak about the resilience and power of queer community. Form a coven between three mystical archetypes (the innocent and gentle Pure Heart, the volatile, revelrous Wild Spirit, and the uptight, scholarly Old Soul) and try to keep your world of magic and mystery in balance with the mundane world, in spite of its ignorance, poverty and violence.\nThe Game\nWickedness is a peculiar tabletop game written for exactly three players and one tarot deck, with no dice and no GM. It uses a bespoke tarot-drawing system loosely inspired by Jay Dragon\u2019s Sleepaway, but is itself a departure from the Belonging Outside Belonging framework developed by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum.\nThe game is played in three acts: in the first, players discover their coven, the sanctuary they call home, a mundane fantasy nation, and the treacherous underworld lurking beneath it. Each player will be assigned one of the three coven archetypes (The Pure Heart, The Old Soul, and The Wild Spirit) by the tarot deck, and then together they\u2019ll create the world where they live, and the underworld's strange laws and denizens. Finally, they\u2019ll ask heavy-hitting questions about the covens\u2019 relationships to one another.\nIn the second chapter, the cards point to a series of challenges detailed in the games\u2019 interpretation Guide, and the players respond: the coven can fall prey to their archetype-specific follies in order to collect cards, spend the cards to solve challenges with wisdom, or use the vast and terrible magic powers at their fingertips-- which is miraculous, but costs the user a piece of their essential nature, striking out and maybe even blackening and replacing a truth on their character sheet. So the players have to strike a balance between keeping the worlds from falling into darkness, and keeping one another from falling apart. If the scales tip too far in any direction, it\u2019s entirely possible for the game to come to an abrupt and apocalyptic end.\nThe final chapter tempts the coven to go their separate ways, but also offers them opportunities to learn from their past mistakes and heal, and finally they'll face their ultimate fates, determining the future of the kingdom, the underworld, and the art of magic itself.\nBecause of the speedy episodic storytelling, the players will witness years of trials, triumphs and transformations in just 4-8 hours of gameplay. Jay Dragon joins our friends Jeeyon Shim and Brennan Lee Mulligan for a three-part actual play below:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWickedness is already a complete game: it\u2019s been fully written and extensively playtested. We\u2019ve decided to bring it to Kickstarter so that your support can turn it into the best possible product it can be. While we considered a few different ways to distribute Wickedness, a Kickstarter was the best tool for promotion, production, and distribution.\nThis Kickstarter has a higher funding goal than many equivalent Kickstarters of a similar size and production budget. Everyone involved in the project is in some way a marginalized creator, and we felt it was important that the budget reflects the value of their contributions. Even if Wickedness won\u2019t fund as quickly as other projects, fair pay and economic support are our highest priorities.\nThe Wickedness Budget breaks down as follows:\n 950$ for printing, shipping to the distribution site, and packaging. The plan is to release the game as a set of three 32 24-page zines, each half-letter size and full color, with uncoated paper. We plan to use Mixam for printing.\n 1750$ for covers, interior art and layout.\n 1300$ for editing and writing, at industry-standard rates.\n 1000$ for project management, promotion, and recording an actual play.\n 200$ just in case money!\n 580$ for Kickstarter and credit card fees.\nEach of the zines will contain a portion of the game, allowing them both to serve as a beautiful collection and a useful tool for playing Wickedness. The first zine will contain the rules needed to play the game. The second zine will contain an interpretation guide, that explains how to understand and translate the cards of your tarot deck. The third zine will contain the covenmate sheets and setting pages, along with alternate sheets by our stretch goal contributors. \nThe zine bundle itself will have two sets of alternate covers - the regular one by our interior artist Tucker Donovan, and a limited edition alternate cover by Sadia Bies. Sadia is an incredible artist in the Philadelphia region, who is planning on making a beautiful metaphorical triptych representing the three covenmates of Wickedness (the Pure Heart, the Wild Spirit, and the Old Soul) as abstract god-archetypes. \nSome examples of Sadia's work\nStretch Goals\nOur first three stretch goals are as follows, after which we'll announce our plans for gracefully expanding the game with a load of new contributors, concepts and challenges:\nFUNDED - Pack The Zines With Illustrations\nAt 100% funding, we\u2019ve budgeted for 13 illustrations total, including art assets for each of the Covenmate and World Pages, illustrations for each tarot suit in the Interpretation Guide, and three silhouetted spot illustrations in the main rules text. Our first stretch goal is to expand the number of spot illustrations in the core rules and the interpretation guide-- we would really like to see the game\u2019s three archetypes represented each with a diversity of body shapes and gender presentations. With $7000 dollars, we can add six more illustrations, to capture more of the diversity of the Pure Heart, the Wild Spirit and the Old Soul.\nFUNDED - Alternate Set Of Play Pages by Jamila R Nejadi\nIf we reach $8000, in addition to three sets of the original six play sheets (The Pure Heart, The Wild Spirit, The Old Soul, The Sanctuary, The Kingdom and The Underworld), Wickedness\u2019s third zine will contain an alternative version of each page, designed by special guest writer Jamila R Nedjadi, who will be doing a cyberpunk reimagining of Wickedness's characters and setting. (This is very exciting!)\nFUNDED - Pay Rate Increase\nAs outlined in our original budget, everyone involved in the project is being paid a fair rate competitive with industry standards. But at $9,000, we can do even better, increasing the pay scale of our team of marginalized creators closer to what their talent and perspective are actually worth.\nFUNDED - Even More Illustrations\nWith $11,000 dollars, in addition to covering the limited edition zines, we can ensure there's a story-inspiring image on every page. These images will flesh out the text with marginalia of witchy trinkets and tools, as well as the phantasmal effects of the underworld.\nFUNDED - Alternate Set Of Play Pages by Caro Asercion\nIf we reach $12,000, in addition to three sets of the original six play sheets (The Pure Heart, The Wild Spirit, The Old Soul, The Sanctuary,  The Kingdom and The Underworld), Wickedness\u2019s third zine will contain a second alternative version of each page, designed by special guest writer Caro Asercion, who will be doing a magical realist / urban pastel reimagining of Wickedness's characters and setting. (This will mean that the game can present a fantastic past, present or future!)\nFUNDED - Pay Rate Increase\nOur priority with Wickedness has always been a fair rate for our designers and artists. At $13,000, we'll be able to make sure everyone can survive and thrive in these difficult times.\nFUNDED - Alternate Swords Challenges by Quinn Milton\nAt $15000, special guest writer Quinn Milton (stunning artist and author ofLet Me In) will write new challenges for the Swords suit, challenging the coven with new scenarios centered on outside ignorance and violence.\nFUNDED - Alternate Coins Challenges by Adira Slattery\nSpecial guest writer Adira Slattery (co-author of the seminal work Draw A Square In The Dirt With A Stick And Then Stand In The Square And Yell \"Sex Is Here\") will be writing an alternate set of challenges for the Coins suit, presenting new takes on the pressures of poverty and exploitation if Wickedness clears $16000!\nFUNDED - Alternate Wands Challenges by Raine Grayson\nAt $17000, dramaturge, activist, and Queeries blog founder Raine Grayson will grace us with an alternate set of challenges for the Wands suit, creating even more messed up fantastical metaphors for mental illness and gender dysphoria.\nFUNDED - Alternate Cups Challenges by Kira Magrann\nFinally, at $18000, special guest writer Kira Magrann (author of A Cozy Den and Something Is Wrong Here) will step in to write an alternative Cups suit at $18000, designing totally new interpersonal challenges to test the bonds of the coven.\n  The Team\nM is a games tinkerer, body liberation essayist, and elusive cryptid.

The towns are overcrowded. Food is expensive. Guilds control trade; nobles control the taxes while priests pray for our damned souls.\nOut there, beyond those walls, are beasts, bogies, monsters. They inhabit the forests, live under the fields, dwell in the ruins of our burned-out fortresses. They kidnap the lone wanderer, harry our caravans, and when they are bold, they attack our towns.\nThis land is wild, untamable, and in it we struggle to survive. We who thought we could conquer it, subjugate it\u2014we are guests here, our days numbered.  \nNew to Torchbearer? Read Thor's primer here. Download our introductory chapter here. And our work-in-progress character sheet here. \nA Second Edition: One Book Becomes Three\nWe have been hard at work on a new edition of Torchbearer for over three years now. Based on the feedback we received from you and from our own campaigns and demos since we launched in 2013, we wanted to make a couple of tweaks to the game. Well, those \"couple of tweaks\" rapidly spiraled into a massive revision. Check it out:\nNew format and layout! The game is now a two-book set: The Dungeoneer\u2019s Handbook and The Scholar\u2019s Guide \nClarified, revised, refined and expanded rules from seven years of playtesting and feedback\nThe Dungeoneer's Handbook\n275 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper!\nRevised character creation which includes tighter Nature question results\nRevised leveling costs\n10 levels for all classes (up from 5), including revised benefits for levels 1-5\nNew class: Theurge, a mad seer possessed by the immortals\nNew arcane spell memorization system, The Memory Palace\nNew divine magic system, The Immortal Burden\nNew invocations and spells with revised, clarified format\nA Scholar's Guide to Dangers Various and Sundry\n332 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew easy-to-process difficulty factors format throughout\nRevised skill format\u2014much easier to parse\nRevised and clarified reward system\nIconic monsters all in a revised, cleaner format \nNew loot tables\u2014with more treasure!\nNew camp and town events (they're so good!)\nNew demo adventure: Revised and updated Dread Crypt of Skogenby! \nThe Lore Master\u2019s Manual\nWe came up with so many new rules and ideas around the game that they wouldn't fit in two books. So we're offering a third book full of optional material for the game. It includes:\n200 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew class: the thief, go from a knife-wielding cutthroat to the shadowy power that rules this town\nNew class:  the shaman, fueled by the Immortals of Beasts, channeling their wild power\nNew stock: the Troll Changeling; they're part troll, part human and all trouble\nNew conflicts: Banish, Abjure, Bind and Battle\nNew settlements like Borderland Fortress, Shire and Walled Town\nLots and lots of gear in a comprehensive list\nRules for making base camps\u2014good for tackling those megadungeons. \nEconomic rules so you can crash the economy of your town\nTravel rules\nSimple guidance on town adventures\nMore spells and invocations\nMore monsters!\nWild new rules for spiritual quests \nAnd more!     \nBooks are not enough to express the full majesty of Torchbearer.  We have revised and refined our action card deck as well as the equipment and light cards. The game master screen has been updated to include the revised edition information. And we're adding metal coins, custom wooden dice and a wooden card holder on top of all of that. \nBut these items are not merely gorgeous swag to adorn your gaming shelf, we have designed each of these items to be a useful, efficient part of the Torchbearer experience at the table:\nAction cards facilitate conflicts, making them move more smoothly.\nEquipment, condition and light cards offer easy reading of your current load out for you and for the rest of the table.\nUse the coins as a prop for loot or use them to track light during an expedition or hit points during a conflict.\nThe dice are marked to clearly represent the 4+ target number of Torchbearer, but we've also included pips so you can use them to roll for armor and on tables! Dragons for scoundrels, axes for successes and the sun for a 6. \nAnd the card holder ties it all together. You can drop your action and equipment cards into the slots on the left. While on the right you can use your copper, silver or gold coins to track your light and hit points.  \nFeasting Table pledge tier items (yes we know we need more dice)\nMetal coins shown here by Campaign Coins.

We even made a chart for you, because it wouldn't be Torchbearer without one\u2026       \nupdated 5 PM EDT 4/21\nThese are prototypes of our dice!\nYou\u2019re a scoundrel, a villain, a wastrel, a vagabond, a criminal, a sword-for-hire, a cutthroat.\nRespectable people belong to guilds, the church or are born into nobility. Or barring all that, they\u2019re salt of the earth and till the land for the rest of us.\nYour problem is that you\u2019re none of that. You\u2019re a third child or worse. You can\u2019t get into a guild\u2014too many apprentices already. You\u2019re sure as hell not nobility\u2014even if you were, your older brothers and sisters have soaked up the inheritance. If you\u2019re cursed with visions from the Immortals, the temples won\u2019t take you in. You question their authority and subvert their power, so you are outcast like the rest of us.\nAnd if you ever entertained romantic notions of home-steading, think again. You\u2019d end up little more than a slave to a wealthy noble.\nSo there\u2019s naught for you but to make your own way. There\u2019s a certain freedom to it, but it\u2019s a hard life. Cash flows out of your hands as easily as the blood from your wounds.\nBut at least it\u2019s your life.\nAnd if you\u2019re lucky, smart and stubborn, you might come out on top. There\u2019s a lot of lost loot out there for the finding. And salvage law is mercifully generous. You find it, it\u2019s yours to spend, sell or keep.\nA Roleplaying Game of Desperate Adventure\nTorchbearer is a roleplaying game of desperate adventure. The expeditions you undertake are taxing on your body, your mind and your very nature. To survive, you must carefully manage your food, water and light resources. To excel, you must fight for what you believe in. To prosper, you must fill your bags with loot and treasure.\nThis triumvirate of competing needs creates a delicious tension unique to Torchbearer. Players are asked to weigh these forces in every decision they make. Some may seem easy or frivolous to start, but the deeper you become enmeshed in an adventure, the heavier and more costly each decision becomes. \nVarg, Karolina and Beren by Jordan Worley\nThe system is based on our award-winning Mouse Guard roleplaying game system. Using the same core rules, character builds and conflict system, we have created a grimmer, harsher world. One that can stand the test of time, providing you with years of adventures.  \nSystem Preview\nEager to dive right in and create an adventurer?

Arik is a massively talented artist living in Brooklyn. He's done some of our favorite covers for some of our favorite bands: Earth, High on Fire and SLEEP. When we heard he was available we hunted him down in the wilds of Brooklyn and made the most dignified pitch we could muster.   \nFortunately for us, Arik has a soft spot for nerds with dark, weird dreams. He signed on not only to do the cover but a number of interiors as well. We're honored to have him as a part of our adventuring band. Maybe if this goes well we can talk him into doing more work for us\u2026  \nOur music track\u2014In Tenebris Lux\u2014was composed specifically for this project. It is a collaboration between Bismuth and Vile Creature. \nVic + KW: Vocals\nTanya: drum programming, bass, synth, vocals, mixing, mastering\nOur video was orchestrated by the Master Burner, Chris Allingham using art by Kurt Komoda and Jordan Worley.  \nWe are are small group of friends living in New York and New Jersey (and Helsinki). We have been making roleplaying games since 2002. \nWe have created/designed/published: The Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Mouse Guard, FreeMarket, Torchbearer, Inheritance and Miseries & Misfortunes. \nWe strive to make baroque games contained in beautiful books.   \nThe Burning Wheel Gold Revised Edition\nAnd we have won numerous awards for our games: Origins awards, Golden Geeks, Indie RPG awards, even a thing called an Outie that Ken Hite gave us back in 2003.\nOur Beliefs\n We love roleplaying games. If you ask us, you\u2019ll hear us go on and on about how and why we love them.\n We make games we want to play and we play them as much as we can before releasing them. Corollary to that, we play by the rules we design, and design our rules to be used. A game cannot be experienced through reading it, and though our games often come in the form of books, they are meant to be played, not read. \n Each of our games is an attempt to say something new about the art of roleplaying games and game design in general. Each of our games is an iteration of the last, built on the experience of players at the table in an attempt to advance the state of the art in a small way.\n We speak through our work. Our thoughts, concerns and questions about the world around us are expressed in our work. Rather than editorializing or explaining, we prefer to let the work speak for itself. If you disagree with ideas presented in our games, it is our hope that you design a game to express your own concerns.\n We love our fans. We thrive on hearing about how you play, and talking with you about our games and games in general. That said, and this is a hard thing to say, we make games for us, not you. We hope our games will challenge and fascinate you, not cater to or coddle you.\n We are unconcerned with popularity or convention and will sacrifice a great deal in service of a compelling idea. Though it\u2019s painful to admit, we accept that our games will likely never be popular with a broad audience.\nYou can read more about our Beliefs and Instincts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWelcome friend\n\nWe begin today another adventure with Burning Wheel Headquarters.

We've done our best to find the fastest, safest and cheapest solutions for you (pick two). If shipping is too expensive for you, we respect your economical opinion, but there is no way we can satisfy your needs in this matter. \n\nAnd lastly, we present to you the biggest challenge of this project: We seek allied adventurers and other brave souls to join our band and assist us on this great quest. If you can carry a pack, heft a spear or bear a torch as part of our adventuring band, then we welcome you on our quest.

Uncover lost civilizations, invent ways to cross into other dimensions, act as ambassadors to alien races on new world, and push back galactic, tyrannical powers! \nWe're looking to make a standalone, premium, lush hardcover that will be graphic novel size (6.625 x 10.25\"), have approximately 330 pages, and a full-colour interior. The book is largely written and being laid out loosely with artwork direction prepped in advance.\nMany of the stretch goals will be about adding additional art and improving the book proper. I hope to be able to include the poster map and stickers below so that each group will have everything it needs in a book and be able to make their own customized map to play with at the table.\nGalaxies in Peril is a Forged In The Dark game about new superheroes just learning of their powers and testing their limits. They use their abilities to push back chaotic and evil forces in the city and then take the fight to them to wrest control over the city back and make sure it remains safe. Heroes balance their personal life with their responsibilities and figure out what their goals are outside of keeping the city, planet, and galaxy from certain peril. In Galaxies in Peril you will:\nForm a team based on how you want to engage with the fiction and build the world with your friends. Take on the cases that no one else will as private detectives (think X-Factor, Batman, Doctor Strange or John Constantine), focus on learning what you don't know and finding out all the secrets of the world as explorers (think Fantastic Four, Wolverine and the X-Men, or Planetary), or focus on changing the status quo and really shaking things up in the world as rebels (think The Authority or X-Men).\nCreate a character based on an archetype like the agent, inventor, leader, occultist, outsider, or vigilante. \nWatch your character grow and learn to use their powers as a result of what's happening in the fiction. You push yourself to do new things with your powers as the need arises and aren't limited to a certain powerset or skills based on character creation.\nCreate a physical artifact at your table with your friends as you lay down stickers on a poster map of the city to show locations of important factions and people (hidden underground labs where mad scientists bush the boundaries of science, skyscrapers where mob bosses make plans to wrest control of the city from the people tighten their iron grip over the city, and holes in the world that lead to the center of the Earth), events taking place (timequakes and portals to other dimensions opening up), or objects (the cosmic chrysalis or time shard). \nMap & Stickers by Galen Pejeau, Design Not Final\nThe idea is that once a team hits Tier II, they unlock a new map as well\u2014for the North American continent (so you can set your city anywhere in NA, and hopefully we can do maps for other continents as well). This means you can face down bigger threats in the city, and have bigger things start to go down elsewhere, too, leading to more conflict and difficult decisions that need to be made. At Tier III you unlock the map of the world and start to face down global threats. At Tier IV you're up to a map of the galaxy. Galaxies in Peril supports any kind of play a group wants, but also those mega-campaigns that start in the city, lead to global conspiracies, and culminate galaxy-threatening factions and schemes in a grand Hickman-ian comic book epic for those that want it.\nEarn reputations and resources by doing what is important to the characters, whether that be finding a missing person the authorities don't care about, discovering lost civilizations or alternate dimensions, making sure the will of the people is heard, or taking down forces poised to take over the world.\nYou can then use that reputation and resources to expand and grow your team, become more adept at using your powers, and learn new techniques so that you can take on even bigger threats, go places you never could before, and be a force for change the world over.\nJonathan Rector is back with all new, original art!\nForged in the Dark games are based on the system presented in Blades in the Dark, by John Harper (also funded through kickstarter).\nThe game features a robust core resolution mechanic which asks the group to characterize actions as desperate, risky, or controlled. Each choice provides a range of multiple outcomes, beyond simple success or failure. Characters can work together, gather information, defend the city and then set up daring plans to take the fight back to them and do more than just protect the status quo. \nThere is an online SRD for the game where the rules are available in their entirety if you want to learn more! All of these rules will be present in the book so it is completely standalone.\nJonathan Rector is back with all new, original art!\n\nGalaxies in Peril is a kind of spiritual successor to Worlds in Peril, also made possible by awesome backers like you on kickstarter, but it used the Apocalypse World system. I think we did a whole lot right with Worlds in Peril and it still plays great today but I found that moving to Forged in the Dark solves a lot of the problems that some groups were having with Worlds in Peril:\nThe action roll ensures that everyone is on the same page and that the fiction is clear in everyone's mind. This is a big deal when everyone has different types of powers and different power levels altogether. \nThe resistance mechanic and Tier is a really clever way to communicate the fiction, have the heroes still be able to face off against threats and foes beyond them, but also communicate when they need to either regroup so they can later take the fight to them later, or gather more information and so become more effective. Likewise, the teamwork maneuvers work well for going up against tough antagonists.\n Forged in the Dark games use stress and conditions, which we hacked into Apocalypse World. Clearly, we love this mechanic, but I think the Forged in the Dark is far more elegant than the Minor/Moderate/Critical economy we had in WiP and makes things easier. \nCharacter creation is a little more streamlined than the two book process of Origin + Drive. Character playbooks have drives built in, origins function as a world-building and advancement tool for backstory.\nThe systems for advancement are more satisfying and intuitive than Drive Books and advancement points. Leveling up your team feels great because it's tied to the world and marks the progression from fish-out-of-water, new heroes, to heroes having the resources and experience behind them to take the fight to beings at the world and galactic level.\n Forged in the Dark games require a certain level of setting baked in, one of the major things fans wanted more of from Worlds in Peril.\nInstead of relying on the Bonds mechanic to inject personal drama into the game we've added downtime clocks that players choose and write in to show the responsibilities weighing on them and having to make hard choices since there are a limited number of downtime actions that can be taken.\n Forged in the Dark games are also intuitive enough that fans of Worlds in Peril and Apocalypse World won't feel like the design and philosophy have taken a completely different direction.\nJonathan Rector is back with all new, original art!\nWe're offering Worlds in Peril as part of some of the pledge tiers and it also gives you an idea of what we've done and are hoping to do with Galaxies in Peril in terms of quality, amount of artwork, and the comic we made to introduce the game.\nHere's a video of me flipping through it: \nAnd here is the intro comic:\nClick for the full Intro PDF\nShipping will be charged after the campaign ends through a pledge manager to ensure that addresses are up to date and that the cost of shipping is accurate.

A prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe, it tells the story of two Children of the Solstice who will combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform Eclipse Magic, the only force capable of fending off the monstrous creations of the evil alchemist known as The Fleshmancer. \nPromising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.\nComing to PC and Consoles in 2022.\n Key ingredients :\n Engaging turn-based combat. Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\n Unshackled traversal. Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tile-based movement.\n Prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe. Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you\u2019ve come to expect from a Sabotage production.\n Full-on dynamic lighting our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\n The Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre. Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements in order to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and overly lengthy sequences.\n\n   A prequel to The Messenger \nThe story takes place long before the flood, where many islands are waiting for you to explore. As a full-fledged RPG, the adventure promises intrigue, perils and wonders . Those familiar with our previous work may recognize a few faces and get meaningful insight on some origin stories, as well as hints towards the bigger picture of the universe we aim to develop more with each of our games.   \nThe Messenger - Sunken Shrine\nThat being said, newcomers should rest assured that Sea of Stars is absolutely enjoyable as a self-contained experience and doesn\u2019t depend on having played The Messenger. In fact, it will even work the other way around should you choose to play our platformer second!\nTurn-based combat\nNo random encounters, no separate battlefield: Considering immersion a top priority, combat is initiated by physical contact with an enemy, and battle takes place in the same field as navigation, seamlessly, with no loading or transition.\nNo grinding: Character progression in Sea of Stars flows naturally along with the story, without the need for any grinding. This concept is supported by a combat system which relies mainly on strategy and skill rather than statistics. That being said, you will very much be leveling up, increasing your stats and unlocking new special moves.\nSynergies: During battle, everything is based on building up momentum and effects over a few rounds, to eventually unleash massive damage by cashing out on your build up. Featuring six very distinct playable characters, and a lot of synergies between each of them, there are a lot of ways to take down opponents.\nTimed hits: Celebrating the greats of our childhood, we top it off with a \u2018timed hits\u2019 mechanic, where precise player input will increase damage done by your characters, or mitigate incoming attacks. Losing a battle doesn\u2019t mean you should go back and grind, but rather that it\u2019s time to apply what you learned from the enemy\u2019s attack patterns and improve your execution the next time around. With skill and strategy as your main weapons, there is always ample room for improvement when a particular encounter proves challenging.\nSpell-breaking: Making a point to break the potential linearity of turn-based combat, enemies can mount especially strong attacks or spells. While a good use of timed hits will always remove a good chunk of the damage dealt, even the smallest minion can be lethal if left unchecked while casting. \nEnemies in a casting state display a bar with what we simply refer to as \u201clocks\u201d, each with an icon representing the damage type required to break it. For every broken lock, the ensuing spell\u2019s efficiency is reduced. Break all of them, and the enemy\u2019s action is entirely cancelled. This spell-breaking gameplay mechanic truly comes to life when groups of enemies demand clutch reactions and choices as more than one is preparing a spell, coupled with playable characters capable of combo attacks and multi-hit special moves.\nBoss fights: No RPG would be complete without big bosses, and of course Sea of Stars is no exception. For bosses, we are also looking at breaking the potential linearity of rinse and repeat for x amount of rounds to win. Each boss will present different attack patterns to learn, evolving through manually scripted phases and special events.\n\nBanking on the synergies, timed hits and spell-breaking mechanics, bosses will offer ample room for longer-haul strategies, giving players the freedom to see how much damage they can really deal in a single round with enough preparation time.\nBoost: To shake things up even more, performing a regular attack generates \u201cEclipse Orbs\u201d, which can later be absorbed to double the effect of any action (regular attack, special attack, healing, spells, etc...) \nDepending on the situation, it may be wiser to save your orbs for later, perhaps to quickly get rid of an enemy that begins casting a spell with too many locks, or, in the case of longer battles like bosses, to dish out as much damage as possible once everything has been put in place for damage to be increased during a short window. \nUnshackled traversal - no rigid tile-per-tile movement\nPutting our platformer experience to good use, we make a point for moment-to-moment gameplay to present satisfying controls, micro challenges, and varied traversal opportunities. In other words, venturing through the rich environment should be accompanied by a feeling of freedom. While multiple paths and approaches can lead to your objective, leaving the main road and exploring less accessible (or hidden) areas will be rewarded. \nClimb, jump, run, swim, vault and dive as you progress through villages and dungeons of all kinds. Anytime it feels like you can interact with something, the odds are that you can. Hoist up on rooftops, or jump off ledges into deep natural pools to explore underwater tunnels. Stick to the main objective, or follow your curiosity and see for yourself what wonders lay hidden.\nWorld Map\nTraveling between points of interest takes place in a classic World Map view where adventurers can roam around, free of enemy encounters. Those who like to go off the beaten path will find many optional areas concealing upgrades, vanity items, and side quests. \nSailing\nSince traveling between islands is a key part of the adventure, the party naturally gets its own boat. With full analog control, you will be invited to negotiate waves, and take advantage of the upwards and downwards formations to optimize for speed. While it isn\u2019t anything that will ever block the casual sailor wanting to get to the next objective, we expect a lot of adventurers will be spending extra time sailing the world to play around with waves, look for sunken side-areas, secondary islands, or simply take a break from the hardships of heroism. \nThe boat also acts as a mobile base of operations, which can be explored in close-up character view, where the party is fully settled in, and available for banter and guidance in-between major story beats. \nIf you ever find yourself struck by the infamous \u201chaven\u2019t played in two weeks\u201d RPG curse, you can rest assured that someone on your boat is ready to offer clear reminders as to what you should be doing next. \nFull-on dynamic lighting and shadows\nTo truly convey the story of warriors using the power of the moon and the sun, we had to go hard on the lighting system. Spectacular spell effects thus being a given, the game also features real-time dynamic day and night cycles, which the player eventually gets to control with full granularity.\nFocusing sunlight through a prism in order to open some secret area may only be possible at high noon, while a magic flower blooms exclusively in the evening. You may want to follow a trail of glow-in-the-dark aquatic plants only visible at night, while some monsters like to sleep during the day.\nAll of this ties into properly telling the story of Solstice Warriors , while also allowing for multiple puzzles and mechanisms dealing with light, shadows and reflections. Oh, and to make sure this world truly comes alive, we are also throwing in weather variations! Please back us.\n\nSix unique playable combat characters\nSea of Stars features six unique playable combat characters, each with their own backstory, personal objectives, play-style, special skills, and synergies with the rest of the party. In this multi-layered story, motivations sometimes align in unexpected ways. In the interest of allowing you to go into the game without any major spoilers, we will only be revealing the two main protagonists here. \nBorn on the Summer Solstice, Zale is optimistic and bold. He wields a sunblade, through which he can absorb Eclipse Orbs whenever his attacks need an extra kick.\nAs a blade-dancer, he walks the path of the Guardian God Solen. The Elder Mist foretold that, in order to find his light and achieve his full potential, he will first need to \u201cstare at the night inside of him\u201d.\n\nBorn on the Winter Solstice, Valere shows curiosity and balance. Gifted with Lunar Magic, she can absorb Eclipse Orbs in her moonstaff to dish out massive damage.\nTrained in the martial ways of the monk, she walks the path of the Guardian Goddess Luana. The Elder Mist sees great potential in her, believing she might one day be the one to \u201ccreate paths on water\u201d.\n Garl was born a regular kid devoid of any special powers. Along with his training as a cook, his innately strong constitution makes him a capable defensive fighter, giving him the tools to support his two best friends in their Solstice Warrior duties.\nThe Elder Mist saw something peculiar in the stars about him, as it seemed his heart just may be warm enough to \u201csoothe a long tormented soul\u201d.\nEven though we will be keeping our favorite ideas under wraps for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re happy to show you above a few of the things we've been working on for the protoype!\nFor the sake of your enjoyment once the game releases, we want to be very careful with spoilers. However when it comes to mentors, villains, villagers, critters, pirates and abominations... as a full-fledged RPG, you can rest assured that Sea of Stars will have it all.\n\nSabotage\u2019s award-winning composer Eric W. Brown, AKA Rainbowdragoneyes, is back to rock your socks off yet again. He was so delighted to apply his musical genius to a full-fledged RPG production that he even built his own studio at home!\nIn Sea of Stars, the music and SFX include instruments from all over the world, blending the catchiness of retro music Eric is known for with modern sound design\u2019s best practices. Taking full advantage of the Wwise engine, all things audio are dynamically layered and adjusted to transition seamlessly through day and night cycles, indoor and outdoor areas, weather variations, and, of course, battle. \nSea of Stars is built in Unity, the engine which our technical team has been working with for over 8 years. It is our best companion for fast iteration, as well as the development of the specific tools we need to bring this new world to life.\nEven though the game might seem simple at first glance, a closer look reveals visual effects seldom seen in 2D pixel-art games. Notably full-on dynamic lighting, which was mandatory given the narrative emphasis on the Sun and Moon.\nScalding desert suns, unsettling blood moons, lush underwater bioluminescent reefs, foggy swamps and dark caverns. We have the tools necessary to ensure each environment is brought to life with the utmost attention to detail to take you on a gripping adventure full of wonders.\nFor those interested in the technical aspect, here are a few of the components we are working with to tailor our own rendering pipeline based on URP (Caution : buzzwords ahead!) :\nPost processing effects such as Bloom, Color Correction and Ambient Occlusion\nPixel perfect rendering\nFully dynamic lighting of sprites including normal mapping, pixel depth writing and shadow receiving\nShadow casting sprites from multiple angles and punctual/directional light sources\nVolumetric lighting\nScreen-space indirect lighting\nAnimated Height fog\nWater shading including transparency, refraction, reflection, absorption, subsurface scattering and contact effect\nWater simulation for rivers and oceans\n  Languages\nThe Messenger is known for its quality localization that keeps the story intact, and we won\u2019t settle for less when it comes to Sea of Stars. Everything will be localized by finely selected external partners who have a track record of excellence. Extra care and resources will always be directed towards ensuring that every language our games release in lets their player base enjoy the stories and events at the same level of quality as everyone else.\nAt this time we expect to release with full support for the following:\nPlatforms\nThe game should be completed sometime in 2022, and is designed to be played on PC and console. For specifics, rest assured that we are in touch with the key players of our industry, and that the game will be wherever the players are.\nIt is hard to predict platforms as we seem to be at the dawn of a new era, but we are keeping close watch, have extensive porting experience, and fully intend on supporting all current generation platforms with Sea of Stars.\nNot only is the entire team that brought you The Messenger working on Sea of Stars full time, we also doubled its size!\nWe\u2019re a studio that bets on focus, meaning once we enter production all hands are on deck working full time on a single project. Our team now counts 16 cherry-picked members, all cut from the same cloth and working from our studio located in downtown Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada.\nOperating with minimal management and completely open work schedules, our team is composed of self-driven artisans who seek to be unleashed rather than controlled.\nEven though the vision for the game is clearly defined, everyone is given the tools and encouraged to express themselves in bringing everything they want both to the company\u2019s culture and to our games. \n\nCampaign Stretch Goals\nNeither incomplete nor bloated - A stretch goals philosophy.\nWhatever happens with the stretch goals, the game will get made in its full vision. We won\u2019t tack on features that would bloat the game to add more incentives, or remove systems that would make the game incomplete if we didn\u2019t reach objectives. \nThe Crypt : an in-game memorial site for backers\nFound on a seemingly uncharted island, The Crypt is an underground area built to pay homage to our fantasy world\u2019s founders, or to be more precise, top-tier backers. Keeping things as spoilers-free as possible, it is still worth mentioning that the place is not disconnected from the world\u2019s lore, and will plays some role in the overarching story.\nSupporters of the campaign who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers will be immortalized in the game as a unique interactive object within the crypt. \nThere are 3 tiers:\nCommemorative stone (Level 1)\nA stone in the first room of the crypt, displaying the name of your choice when interacted with. Get it for yourself, or for someone dear to you!\nStatue (Level 2)\nIn the second room, which is a bit more luxurious, you can have your own statue displaying the name of your choice, along with a short body of text. A great place to leave a positive message for other adventurers, or to immortalize your positive intentions for someone special.\nClaiming your statue will be a simple process of selecting how you want it to look by customizing its parts, sort of like in a character creation menu. Body type, hair, height, weapon of choice, clothing, etc.\nMonuments (Level 3)\nThe final room, which the crypt was built around, looks especially beautiful at night, as a sunroof lets the moonlight shine on an array of mirrors, filling the air with magic and peace.\nFor monuments, our artists will get in touch with you to create a fully customized character of your choice. Whether you want to be there as yourself, see the hero you envision taking form, invent a fantasy creature, or show the world a special pet. \nAlso interactive, monuments will display the name of your choice, along with a lengthier body of text.\nWhether you choose to leave a message for the world, pay homage to a loved one, or  write a backstory for your fantasy character, our team will work with you to ensure your immortalized presence in our world is meaningful to you.\nThe Cryptwalker\nIn debating whether or not to add an NPC to The Crypt, we opted to leave it up to the community! It is said that this mysterious character who roams the halls may actually come from a different time, and certainly a different place. Could this mysterious presence be \u2026 you?\nShould someone choose to take it upon themselves to ensure The Cryptwalker is added to the game, they will play a key role in defining the character\u2019s personality. This fully animated character\u2019s appearance will be directed by said backer, and will be quite the conversationalist, telling stories and touching on philosophy, to make sure adventurers who enter The Crypt take some time for introspection.\nRest assured that while your input will be considered to the extent you want it to, we\u2019ve absolutely got your back should you not have many dialog subjects to contribute. We are the studio that brought you The Shopkeeper, after all, and there is certainly more where that came from.\nThe vinyl\nSabotage is excited to partner with iam8bit, who were integral to the vinyl renaissance since their first release in 2010. Since then, they've minted nearly 100 videogame soundtracks on wax, and always do so with a premium ilk, from mastering to design to packaging. We previously collaborated on The Messenger vinyl soundtrack and were super happy with the results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter\nLet us be direct : it would be risky to base the funding of an ambitious project like this on Kickstarter alone. As always, we want to remain fully transparent with anyone who wants to support us : 16 people over 3 years is intense budget-wise for a small studio. Taking the bulk of risks ourselves by reinvesting the gains from The Messenger, all we ask for is to hear a big \"YES\" from our fans and other potential players, enough to feel confident Sea of Stars is a game enough people want to see releasing.\nOf course, it is now common knowledge that the value of a Kickstarter goes way beyond the amount of money raised during the campaign; it also makes for the best early feedback loop a game studio can hope for. Again, we are committed to this project. All we ask for is confirmation that Sea of Stars is something you want to play.\nOn a final note we absolutely want to thank everyone who has been supporting us since the beginning, especially our wholesome Discord community.\nWithin The Messenger was the hope for some connection, that some would \u201cget it\u201d, and choose to share their own experiences so that the values portrayed in our fantasy might, to some extent, live, if only within the hearts of those it touched.\nInspired by the overwhelming response, we chose to trust in our fanbase completely, and were thus compelled to create a crowdfunding campaign to reveal our next project as early as possible. Being so engaged with our community both in chat and through the Alternate Reality Game we run on the server, it would have been truly annoying not being able to discuss what we were so excited about on a daily basis. \nNow that everyone\u2019s in the know about Sea of Stars, the fun can begin, unhindered once again!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware that Kickstarter projects often come with a certain level of risk for the backer, but we want to reassure you that this game will be completed no matter what happens during this campaign.\n\nOur team has extensive experience shipping games of all scopes, and we are surrounded by veterans from other studios who we can always rely on for sanity checks and feedback. \n\nIt is our promise to every backer, that to the best of our knowledge and experience, the Sabotage team will always make sure the finances are aligned with the vision, that this vision is clear, shared by the team, technically feasible, and validated by players. Challenging each other is embedded in our culture, and no stones will be left unturned.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep me posted!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBacker exclusive HD wallpapers for your desktop and phone\nGet the updates\nYou can upgrade your pledge as long as the campaign is running!

But let's not stop there! Let's add more content to Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with our stretch goals!\n\nWe reached all of our stretch goals for the campaign and we couldn't be more excited! Thank you to everyone who contributed and helped us make this a reality. \nWe obviously can't promise that Swords 'n Magic will be accepted by Nintendo but now we can afford to focus on porting in case we are. We promise to do everything within our power to get the game there and keep you in the loop every step of the way.\nWe love this community and couldn't imagine developing a game without all of you right behind us.\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is a cute, cooperative, open world video game centered around the joy of discovery. This game is a passion project that I've been bringing to life for over two years now. Swords 'n Magic and Stuff is a love letter to all the game worlds I lost myself in growing up.  The game is being developed with my wife and daughter in mind. We'd searched for years for a game like Swords 'n Magic and finally I just decided that I'd have to take matters into my own hands.\nThe game is a casual journey of discovery. You take the role of a blank slate adventurer just waiting for their chance to carve out their destiny. With no classes, levels or restrictions, you can be whoever you want to be, use whatever weapons and items you can buy, loot or craft, and play however you wish. You can seek out epic adventures laden with legendary treasure or enjoy the simple life of owning a small farm, crafting furniture for your home or even just traveling the world as a simple merchant. In Swords 'n Magic and Stuff you play at your own pace with no hand-holding.\nTirawyn is a high fantasy world where a good king has befallen a terrible curse and fled his throne in an attempt to save his kingdom from himself. The people of Tirawyn are in a state of panic as evil begins to lurk in all corners of the realm and novice adventurers begin to take matters into their own hands. But are they causing more trouble than they're worth? \nWatch the lore episode from the Swords 'n Magic devlog below to learn more about the history of Tirawyn and how the world came to be. \nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff has been designed and developed live on Twitch.tv from the ground up with an audience of passionate fantasy RPG fans. This game is a tribute to this wonderful community who has supported it from its humble beginnings and because of that, fan input has always been a high priority for me. So much so that some of the in-game clothing designs and lore books were actually created by the Swords 'n Magic community through a content submission system for our most creative fans. We plan to continue this effort, and in doing so, keep as connected as possible with fans, treating your ideas and opinions with the respect and consideration they deserve.\nJoin our Discord to see frequent updates about the game, share your ideas for the game and to chat with like-minded adventurers!\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff stands out because of all the individual pieces that fit together to create a dynamic, immersive world for you to lose yourself in. While we understand the excitement of exploring dangerous lands and fighting powerful monsters, as long-time Dungeons and Dragons players, we also understand that the downtime in an adventure should be just as engaging. Which is why a lot of our features revolve around town-life and the act of owning and decorating your own home among many other non-combat gameplay features.\nOur core design pillars are exploration, discovery, curiosity and growth. We use these to drive our core gameplay loop which is designed to be as follows: Players explore a new area, discover something interesting, seek out more about that new interest driven by curiosity and not a quest log with tick boxes, then return to their home to rest and evaluate the items they've discovered in order to progress and grow as a character and a player. Of course, we also believe that getting lost in loops within loops is a very intriguing part of open world game design, which is why we've not only designed specific zones to fit into this loop, but also sections of each zone and even the items within those sections. Everything is driven by discovery and curiosity, which is why it's so important for us to create hand crafted content that's unique and engaging for players of all ages and skill levels.\nHere's a breakdown of some of the most noteworthy features in Swords 'n Magic and Stuff to get an idea of all there is for players to experience:\nPlay with your friends in networked multiplayer\nCollect and discover hundreds of items\nUse anything - No class or level restrictions\nHands-off quests - No breadcrumbs or quest markers\nDual wield anything\nBuy, tame and collect dozens of mounts and pets\nSeasons and weather effects\nSeasonal events and unique seasonal items\nMini-games like tavern dice and target practice\nJoin factions and rise through the ranks\nTitles that show off your accomplishments\nBuild or purchase homes and furniture to decorate them with\nFish, hunt, grow and harvest resources to cook hearty meals with\nGather materials and craft your own furniture and weapons\nExplore a wide variety of dungeons\nPvP Arenas to test your mettle with your friends\nCollect clothes, hats and armor to customize your character\nNon-gendered character creation\nTwitch integration to get your viewers into the action\nA private, dedicated server you can host yourself\nFully mappable keybinds and gamepad support\nWe don't believe in hand-holding or tick boxes when it comes to questing. We're approaching each quest as a separate adventure driven entirely by curiosity. Instead of accepting a quest from an NPC, you'll have the opportunity to add intriguing information to your journal to keep track of information for later. Finding a book about an ancient sword forgotten by history isn't just lore, but a treasure map in its own right. Asking around could lead you on a new epic journey to find that long lost weapon and learn about why it's important along the way, if that's your thing.\nMany games offer multiplayer, but not many offer what Swords 'n Magic plans to. I want to give players the best and most connected experience possible. Playing together means also being able to play apart. You aren't tethered to your friends when playing. Explore the world at your own pace and party up when you feel like it. And when you're ready to join another friend, take your entire character and everything they're holding with you. No need to make a new character for every new server.\n\nHost a game directly through Steam for up to 8 players or host a dedicated server wherever you like so you and all your friends can come and go as you please. Password protect your worlds or invite anyone and make new friends.  Customize your hosted world with options that cater to how you want to experience the world.\n\nSwords 'n Magic is designed to sidestep a drawback my wife and I have experienced many times with multiplayer RPG's. We hate having to start new worlds or new characters when we invite a new friend to play with us. In this game we're doing our best to make sure that not only can a new friend join at any time, but with no level restrictions, they can join in on the fun right off the bat. You can simply share some of your higher tier gear with them, or if they'd prefer to work for it themselves, you can trade your gear out at your house for some of your weaker items and join in on their adventure as an equal. \n\n\nBacking the game gets you access to exclusive Kickstarter rewards. All tiers which include game keys also include access to these rewards. When the game launches we'll also be offering a Hero Edition, which includes even more exclusive in-game content. Because we believe that pay to win mechanics are a dark cloud over the game industry, none of our exclusive in-game rewards offer any actual gameplay advantages and are merely cosmetic. \nWant to back with PayPal? No problem! Head over here to do so:\n\n\nBonus reward!\nGuess what! Because of how much more this campaign has brought in than we expected, we decided to add a new reward for everyone to show our appreciation. Every tier that receives a game key will also get a super cute, in-game, baby fox pet. Here's some awesome concept art drawn by our artist, Kitsunne.\n\n\nKindred Games was founded in early 2018 by me, Michael Kocha. I started Swords 'n Magic and Stuff as a solo project under no studio name thinking it would be a quick 3 month game project I used to learn Unreal Engine. But when I started streaming the game and began growing a small, but very dedicated fanbase, features and ideas started piling up and the game became a bigger project, eventually growing into my dream project.  \n This is when I began Kindred Games. I knew from the start that the studio needed to represent the passion I felt for making games with an audience and my family in mind. Kindred, which means one's family, was such a perfect word for how I wanted to treat this project and ultimately my game studio.\nSix months into development I'd built a nice little prototype of what I thought the game could feel like. I released it to many of my most dedicated fans and received loads of feedback and praise. Though I thought the game only had a couple hours of content, some of my testers racked up over a dozen hours in the project looking for every single secret and trying to find every item in the game. That's when I knew what the core focus of the game needed to be. The joy of discovery.\nI got to work learning more about Unreal Engine and taking the project more seriously. I knew the prototype was a success and that the game was going to be something worth investing my time into. I brought on a programmer (Not Moz!) to add multiplayer to the game at this time as well.\nBut it's hard to make a video game while living in a hotel room for 2 months.\nShortly after we started implementing multiplayer my wife, Janna, was relocated to a state halfway across the country and I had to take 3 months off from the game. Partly because of packing and selling our house, and partly because we were stuck in a hotel room for two months before we could find somewhere to live near Janna's work. This was a huge setback for me and the programmer. When I finally returned to the game I'd lost all motivation and ambition. After nearly 6 months of working with the programmer we still couldn't even play the game together. Nothing was working right and all I'd done in 6 months was build half of a new zone and a single dungeon. \nSo I quit.\nI threw in the towel and let the programmer go. This was the lowest point in the development of Swords 'n Magic and probably in all of my game dev career. I had failed to keep the game and my passion for it alive and it really hurt watching my community slowly disappear. My streams had stopped entirely. My testers hadn't received an update in months. Everyone knew that Swords 'n Magic was now dead. Lost in the indie game graveyard with hundreds of thousands of other unfinished games that had real potential.\nI took a few weeks off to reevaluate my goals as a gamedev. Eventually my 3 year old daughter asked me one day to play the game again and asked why I hadn't been working. I loaded it up for her and she sat on my lap and took the gamepad.  I watched her explore the world for the thousandth time as she asked me questions about who the different NPC's were, what they were saying, why they were where they were and if she could be friends with them. She asked me questions about where she could find a better sword and how to get gold so she could buy another potion to drink. She ran away from the monsters and tried hugging all the sheep. Finally she asked if I would make a new character for her to meet. Within the hour I found myself adding more content into the game for her to play through and I knew Swords 'n Magic and Stuff just couldn't be over. Not yet.\n\n\nOne year later\nThe game has changed a lot. Many of the original mechanics have been reworked and now the game features fully functioning multiplayer. I've hired a different programmer on to help with this. I've also embraced the fact that I can't make this game alone this time around. If I'm going to build a game for a growing, loving community then I would need their help in more ways than one.\n\n\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is being developed by a team of two developers: Me, (Michael, aka Kindred) and Moz. But we're not the only ones contributing to the game's success. Since I've been streaming the development of the game for over two years I've also grown a small but very dedicated and hard working mod team. Many of these wonderful people have proven to have other very useful talents in places outside moderation so they deserve a mention here as well.\n\nSpecial thanks:\n Gideon - Youtube Video Editor\n Cameron - Website Developer\n Janna - Community Manager\n Brendan - Illustrator\n Wendy - Social Media Management\nEven though these awesome people don't do any work on the game itself, they are still a huge help. Without them I don't think anything would get done around here.\nI've been a stay at home dad for just over 5 years. Since quitting my job in retail I went to school for 3D art and animation for games and earned my bachelor's degree. My goal was always to make games, but I didn't think making my own games for a living would ever be a real possibility. Luckily the opportunity presented itself when we learned that child care cost more than what I made at my job. My wife's career, however, was just beginning to take off and she went on to support the family while I followed my dream of being a dev dad.  \nJust over a month ago my wife, Janna, was informed that the position she currently held was being eliminated. This put her in an awkward spot where she had to choose between applying for positions across the country that she didn't want, or to leave the company she had invested her life into for 12 years.\nAfter a few weeks of serious contemplation she decided that it was time to put all of our cards on the table with Swords 'n Magic and Stuff. \nNow that she's helping full time with Swords 'n Magic we have no other income until the game launches. Kickstarter is a chance for us to fund the development of the game without having to go bankrupt in the meantime.\nWith your help we'll be able to see the rest of the development through without worrying about how to put food on our tables, but we'll also be able to give the game the love and attention it deserves. We've budgeted a chunk of the funds for a custom soundtrack and already have a musician ready to go. We're putting some funds toward marketing to make sure that the game has as many eyes on it as we can get. Some of the funding will go into custom animations and sound effects for the game as well as any additional tools and software costs we run into along the way. And finally, we plan on paying our wonderful programmer, Moz, a cut for all the hard work he's already put in with nothing in return. It's not every day you find a skilled programmer who has enough love for a project to work for a revenue share. We're very lucky to have him so you can play Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with your friends and family. As it was meant to be played.\nBut in the event that the Kickstarter fails, we still plan to continue the project. We hope you understand that this means we'll have to cut back heavily on the game's features and content. We'll have to cancel the musician, deal with limited animation and sound effect assets, we'll have to find a way to market the game on no budget and worst of all, rush the project to completion. This means the game won't be what we envision, but I couldn't move on from it without knowing that we did everything we could to make it succeed.\nI truly believe wholeheartedly in this game. I hope that you'll consider supporting us in this project so we can bring  my passion project to life. I can't wait to see you in the game. Thanks for reading. <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBased on all the Kickstarter horror stories of games being abandoned after a successful campaign, I think it's obvious that the biggest risk is this game not being completed. \n\nI've been working on this project for over two years and have restarted the project twice for different reasons. I've since brought on a programmer and have grown a fantastic community through Twitch and Youtube. I think having this many people counting on me, requesting regular updates and cheering me on has kept me on track far longer than I could have done on my own and I have no doubt it will continue to motivate me to finish. \n\nIn the end we think being open and honest is always the best course of action, especially when asking for a community to fund a large project like this. Without your help, this project can't happen, so it's only fair to keep you in the loop when we run into problems or setbacks. \n\nWe promise never to leave you in the dark about the status of the project or issues we encounter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Every little bit helps", "descp": "We get it.

Our goal is to reinvent familiar tools to make them easier to pick up, and more powerful.\nPlayers can battle, run, and explore worlds with intuitive video game controls. Storytellers can easily spin up epics, with easy access to gorgeous weapons, art, and designs to breathe them to life. Creators can share work such as art, writing, music, and more on our built-in marketplace.\nWhether they're across the table or across the world, jump into your next adventure with friends in a click. \nIn this Kickstarter, we're bringing you not only the Multiverse system, but also our very FIRST verse. We break down our system in terms of what's in it for players, storytellers, and creators. \nNew or experienced, a friendly and intuitive approach.\nWhether you've never played a tabletop game before, or just a DnD podcast fan wistfully wishing you could play along, or someone who has ran homebrew games for years: Multiverse is for you.\nJoin from any web browser - on PC, mobile, or tablet! Then get connected with in-game voice, video, and/or text chat. We want to offer a variety of ways to connect so you can choose how you want to play.\nIf your friends don't own Multiverse yet, that's alright! They can always join you on the adventure, but they won't be able to make their own games or unlock cosmetics by themselves.\nBecome the story you want to see. \nBuild up your character's appearance in our highly customizable character creator. Players can choose from a variety of Kinds, body types, and other features. Assets can be easily recolored in our engine so you can be exactly as you imagine.  \nFrom customizing skin color to hair style, our character generator captures a wide variety of appearances. Let your imagination be the only limitation.\nTo simplify the process of character sheets and skills, our character creator walks you through step by step. Depending on the Campaign, choose your character's alignment, stats, personality traits, and more. We hope to make this process as easy as possible, knowing that often times loads of math and manuals can be a turn-off to jumping into your first role-play game. We don't believe in boring tutorials.  \nPlayers navigate the rich world created by storytellers with intuitive controls. Point and click to freely move around and explore, ease in how players navigate. Shift between combat, exploration, and creative controls seamlessly. \nWhile we keep dice and turn-based combat in your pocket, we are also bringing to the table real-time mechanics. Experiment with live combat and other real-time activities. More than a one-to-one port, we want to open up new opportunities to innovate tabletop gameplay.\nSee the world through your character's eyes. \nIn tabletop role-play, all players being able to imagine the scenario they're being told is key to a good game.... but what if that doesn't have to be the case? As the Storyteller, see what happens when you can give players completely different perspectives within the same game.  Change language text based on proficiency! Turn off the lights on half the party! Flip the screen on a disoriented player!\nWhether they are joining from their phone or computer, our Story Teller tools enable a customizable experience for each player. \nBring the battle to the screen. \nWatch every hit land with our expanding library of combat animations, compatible with every character and NPC, easily creating beautiful battle scenes.\n All the tools to craft the ultimate adventure. Design with ease, and without compromise. Set the stage, prep a puzzle, lay some traps...\nCreate your world.\nBuild your world with tools at different levels of focus. Put together the big picture with a map and city editor. Design interior and exterior scenes, placed in the map, in the level editor. The level editor uses a tile system, but you can choose to place items on a grid or freely. Cycle through different layouts and effects to get just what you want. An ever-growing library of assets and tiles, lighting controls, and environment effects lets you easily set up unique story settings.  \nFeaturing Medieval Fantasy City Generator by Watabou / watabou.itch.io\nWas a new town founded? A house wrecked? Come back to these tools at any time to refine and alter your world to reflect game events. \nUsed to keeping manuals, notes, and scripts open for reference? You can easily access that content on screen with our pods system. Reference world lore or keep the current quest at hand. Easily pull up what you need when you need it, but tuck it away when you don't. We want to emulate that feeling of having your references open and ready, but without all the clutter. \nTo further assist you, our search system also allows you to easily find the content you want without having to memorize where it was. Say goodbye to losing your page.  \nLearn more about the customization options you have in our tool customization section further below.\nThe magic of role-play is in improvisation \u2013 and we want to make sure Multiverse can be your magic wand. As such, we are building tools to let you easily, on-the-fly: forge items, change plans, gift player abilities, add new stats, switch game modes, seduce a scythe, and so much more.\nWhatever you and your players can dream up, our tools let you make happen. \nYour tools are our pods. Simple user interface elements that you can resize, drag, hide, and customize to your heart's content. Pods handle things from chat to level editing tools, from story information to player statistics. \nBelow are just some of the pods we have been working on. \nWe want you to layout your pods however you want. If you like keeping your tools hidden away to focus on the game action, you can minimize them. If you love having your eye on everything, hand at the wheel for any development, you can maximize your pods or even pop them out into new windows. \nWhatever flow works best for you, we support it.\nIn the Marketplace, create the stories you want to see, bundle them with other creators, and allow new audiences to play in your world! Stream, Build, and Sell. Musicians, writers, illustrators, animators, pixel artists, modders\u2014 Multiverse grows with you.\nJust some ideas of bundles we expect to see on the Marketplace include:\nEnvironment tiles\nWeapon sets\nOriginal sound tracks\nInterior assets\nStories for campaigns\nCharacter portraits\nCustom icons\nStream from within Multiverse, play with your viewers directly with in-game features! \nIn addition, we want Multiverse to easily plug into streaming platforms. Streamer mode enables you to choose what you stream, so you can hold your audience in suspense. What if you could even play with chat? By bringing the tabletop role-play genre to the digital medium, we can discover so many new ways to play.\nWhy the change in language? Taking bias out of our fiction, together. \nOne of the core values at Multiverse is ensuring everyone has a chance to play the way they want. Tools to create fictional settings where no one is othered. RPGs provide a space where players can be the representation they want to see. It makes other aspects of building a game platform harder, but Team Multiverse understands first hand that the effort is always worth it. Make no assumptions and make the player the priority. Pushing back against the old school table top role-play language many of us recognize allows us to embrace new gameplay experiences, and encourages us to problem solve more creatively!  \nIntroducing the FIRST Verse\nThe Multiverse team is building all the pixel art assets you need to jump straight into a game. We have to start somewhere, so the first Verse begins with a fresh take on a fantasy RPG setting. Verses and the assets that come with them will be made by our team, by official partners, and by any individual creators in our marketplace!

Only one more stretch goal to go, and it unlocks ineffable digital gods to worship! Tell your friends!\nSomewhere beyond the static, the servers of a digital universe called World churn endlessly, instantiating a pristine utopia for the pleasure of the Users who inhabit it.  This sprawling, post-scarcity metropolis is built on a cloud of data where the only true commodity is Memory: the privilege to record, store, and view the priceless recollections that stitch together an identity.  Users are careful never to barter away their Core Memories, the fragments of truth that make them real people...\n But you did. Whether by choice, foolishness, conspiracy, or the growing bitterness of a peace-less immortality, you cast aside the last remnants of your Memory and the oblivion you found was as dark and deep as death\u2026 Yet even that did not last. For Users bereft of a sense of self, for those who don\u2019t remember but can\u2019t die, there is only Pocket World.\nYour search for Memory has taken you into a Pocket Partition, a miniaturized dimension sealed away from the rest of World. Can you steal the ancient, pure Memories that await you and reconstruct your Core before the Troubleshooters catch you or your battery runs out? Will the instance break down and collapse from the unstoppable Glitch that followed you here? Can you escape in time?\nPlay to find out!\nA nameless User finds someone else's Memory, and for a moment, feels alive again.\nPocket World is a fusion of story game and dungeon crawl, pairing Old School adventure sensibilities with Forged in the Dark game-play.\n EXPLORE a haunted partition, with content generation tools that help everyone visualize the fictional space and the dangers lurking within.\n CHALLENGE players with a robust system of threats and game states, from risk/reward die rolls to chaos and alarm conditions.\n OVERCOME the partition with tense resource management and powerful special abilities, wielded by characters free to specialize in violent or non-violent methods.\n DISCOVER your character's true self by claiming Memories that unlock great power, and perhaps even restore identity...\nA deadly Widget Cultist on the hunt for spare parts.\nPocket World is a \"digital dungeon crawl\", including rules to create a User, find out what's wrong with them, and see them through a season of connected Partitions, gradually gathering the Memories they need to escape and return to World, restored.  The core tension of the game comes from two competing clocks--ESCAPE and CHAOS--that drive players to take decisive action and risk losing everything in a madcap race for Memory as the Partition crumbles.\nThe Game Boss (or GB for short) has tools for content creation that are comprehensive. Tables for room and threat generation follow the conversational flow of dungeon exploration, while prompts for terrain, mood, and environmental details allow anyone to imagine a fantastic and wholly unique Partition.  You could also use the generation prompts and tools of Pocket World to create a Metroid-style data dungeon for use in any old school game system!\nBosses also come equipped with poignant lists of questions that build out each player's vision of their User and the Partition throughout play. By the end of a delve, you've discovered a rich story of struggle, loss and nostalgia, one that everybody helped create. \nThe final zine may use colored paper, or 1 color printing.\n In addition to the zine, we are looking to produce a metal-and-enamel pin for diehard Hello, World fans who back at Moderator tier or higher! A mockup is below, though the design is subject to minor changes.\nPierce thin clothing and lanyards with this concealable pointed weapon!\n Right now our budget is for a 28-page zine if we meet our first goal, loaded with art and tables, but we have some ideas for additional design elements to add to the game if we can make it a 36-page (or higher!?) print run!\nThese Stretch Goals aren't the end of the line for Pocket World. If there is enough interest, we will look into drafting another zine full of additional modules, each complete with a map and special rules for interacting with unique characters, manipulating different economies, and contending with truly unstoppable monstrosities. We believe strongly in the philosophy of adventure first, and the more people play Pocket World, the more Pocket World we'll make! \nGuided by a nefarious VIRAL CAT, a hapless User careens towards his doom.\nCharles (@umbral_aeronaut) is going back to school this fall to study law.

My name is Francita, and I\u2019m a graphic designer from Chile. Currently I am working as freelancer, mostly for people in the TTRPG community, but I\u2019m hoping to get a full-time job in the US, and relocate there. You can see my portfolio here, or follow me on twitter here.\nI had an idea recently of doing enamel pins. No, you know what? That\u2019s not accurate. I had this idea of doing enamel pins A LONG TIME AGO. I just could never decide of what. Then, recently, I thought how nice it would be to design a series of pins inspired by LGBT and TTRPGs, so people could proudly wear them at cons or just in everyday life.\nThen I just did the designs, and made up my mind to create this Kickstarter, and here we are.\nI have to admit the thing I am most excited about this is be able to wear one of these pins myself. So, yeah, let\u2019s make this happen?\nThe Designs\nThere are 14 designs in total, which are (now 17, including the first set of pronouns pins!):\nThe 14 main designs\n\nCritically Ace\nCritically Agender\nCritically Aro\nCritically Bi\nCritically Demi\nCritically Fluid\nCritically Gay\nCritically Intersex\nCritically Lesbian\nCritically Non-binary\nCritically Pan\nCritically Poly\nCritically Queer\nCritically Trans\nEach pin will be 1.75\u201d at its maximum width. They will be a hard enamel pin, gold, and each pin will have their backing card.\nPin assembled with backing card\nUpdate: In addition, we have decided to unlock the first set (purple) pronoun pins at initial launch!\nPurple Pronoun Pins released at base funding with graphic and mock ups.\nTimeline\nMarch 2nd: Kickstarter campaign goes live!\nMarch 31st: Kickstarter campaign ends. Surveys will go out. I will wait a week for the survey responses.\nApril 13th: Production begins!\nMid-May: Quality assurance takes place. After that, shipping starts.\nAfter I start shipping, it will depend on your location how long it will take, but generally it would take in between 1 and 3 weeks to reach you, so you should expect the pins to arrive in June or July, which will be the approximate time that the pins will be available in my Etsy store as well.\nThere\u2019s an Early Bird rate of $9, available for the first day of the Kickstarter. Then, the regular Kickstarter rate is $10. After funding, the pins will be available at my Etsy store for $11.\nBudget\nPie chart of budget\nThe way the budget will be distributed is the following:\nProduction - 40%\nActually making the pins, of course.\nShipping - 22%\nSending the pins to YOU.\nFees & Taxes - 16%\nKickstarter fees, any other fees, and taxes.\nDesign - 11%\nThis goes to me, for the design of the pins. I love designing things for the community, and this cut of the budget will allow me to keep designing awesome stuff for you folx.\nHandling - 11%\nAs I told you, and many of you know, I\u2019m not from the US, but it would have been very inconvenient to produce the pins here in Chile and then send them to the United States and all other places (because shipping here is not very good, and that\u2019s being kind) so, because of that, Dyer (BasiliskOnline) will help me handle the situation. That means, he will be the one receiving the pins from production, packaging them, and shipping them to you. And for all this trouble, plus storing a ton of pins in his space, he needs to be paid for it.\nThe initial Kickstarter goal is to make 100 units of each design. Now, I will only know how many actual pins of each design I will have to make after the kickstarter ends and the survey is filled. So, these amounts are the minimum amounts I have to make (manufacturer requirement) and any pins that are not claimed in the Kickstarter will become stock for my Etsy store, where you will be able to purchase the pins afterwards.\nStretch Goals\nBut, the fun doesn\u2019t end here. I have amazing stretch goals for you. I\u2019m particularly excited about this, because it pairs so well with the main pin designs.\nSo, without further ado, pronoun pins!\nStretch Goal tiers! Different colors per tier (Purple, Pink, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow)\nEach +$1000 over the main goal will add a set of pronoun pins to the production. This will be unlocked by color, and there are 6 colors to be unlocked: purple, pink, green, blue, orange and yellow.\n\n\n\nI love every single one of these pronoun pins, and I realy hope we can unlock them all!\nMockup of some of the pins\nFAQ\nHow do I choose which pins I want?\nA survey will be sent your way after the campaign ends, and I will wait until April 12th to send the work order with the survey answers and start production.\nWill I be able to choose from the stretch goal pins too?\nOf course. Be aware though that the amount of pins according to your pledge are the slots you have to choose pins from both the main designs and the unlocked stretch goal pins.\nWhen will my pins arrive?\nPins should arrive either in June or July. Shipping is scheduled to start at the end of May.\nWhat size are the pins?\nEach pin will be 1.75\u201d at its maximum width.\nWhat color will be the metal of the pins?\nGold.\nWhat are the various shipping prices within the US?\n1-9 Pins: $5; 10-13 Pins: $6; 14 Pins: $7; 15-17 Pins: $10, 18-20 Pins: $15.\nWhat are the various shipping prices Outside the US?\nAll prices estimated through pirateship.com\nUK & EU: 1-8 Pins: $15; 9-20 Pins: $25\nAustralia: 1-8 Pins: $18; 9-20 Pins: $28\nCanada: 1-8 Pins: $13; 9-20 Pins: $21\nRest of the World 1-8 Pins: $16; 9-20 Pins: $26\nI would like to back, but shipping prices are so high!\nWe completely understand! Shipping prices can be a real killer for physical goods kickstarters, especially for small time creators. Something I've seen work well in the past is to arrange for some local friends to all go in on a single higher pledge together to split shipping! (eg: instead of 3 of you each getting a 3 pin pledge, get a 9 pin pledge and share the shipping cost!)\nCan I buy a pin for someone else in the community?\nYes! We have 2 new tiers (Pay-it-Forward Domestic and Pay-it-Forward-Abroad) so you can buy pins for someone else. We will find homes for these pins ourselves, probably through a giveaway that is gonna be done after the Kickstarter funds but before the manufacturing order gets sent, so we know which pins they want.\nI want to buy more than one pin for someone else, How do I do it?\nFor Domestic (USA): add an extra $15 to your \"Pay-it-Forward Domestic\" pledge ($10 pin + $5 shipping) to add one more pin.\nFor Abroad: add an extra $28 to your \"Pay-it-Forward Abroad\" pledge ($10 pin + $18 shipping) to add one more pin.\nAdd as many pins as you want just adding the extra amounts listed above.\nI want to get a pin for myself, and a pin for someone else. What do I do?\nChoose the amount of pins you want for yourself with the corresponding tier, and then:\nFor Domestic (USA): add an extra $15 to your pledge ($10 pin + $5 shipping)\n For Abroad: add an extra $28 to your pledge ($10 pin + $18 shipping)\nAdd as many pins as you want just adding the extra amounts listed above.\nContact\nIf you have any inquiries about the campaign, the pins, myself or anything else, send me an email to byfrancita@gmail.com or contact me on Twitter.\n\nAnother mockup of some of the pins", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, so I was specially careful with calculating the amounts needed to make this project happen, but still I could have made mistakes in doing the math. That's why I have a little Oops amount already considered in the Kickstarter goal, for if something happens.\n\nThe designs have been already looked at by the manufacturer and discussed with me what would be the best way to get them done. Still, there could be minor changes to design if some problem arises with production. My manufacturer has been specially helpful in guiding me through the process, since this is my first time producing enamel pins, so I expect everything to go as smoothly as can be in that regard.\n\nEven though I wish it didn't happen, there will be pins with minor imperfections. I will do quality assurance in May before shipping and only ship those I consider of a decent quality.\n\nThe handling and shipping of the pins will be done from the United States (BasiliskOnline will be in charge of that), so it will be easier to complete the process than doing it from Chile, where I live.\n\nI am expecting this campaign to go well, and there's a possibility that it doesn't go well. There's also the possibility that it goes way better than I anticipated, and we are left with a lot more pins to ship than we were ready for. In that case, I am going to hire more people to help handle the packing and shipping of the pins, so it still gets to you in time (I am really hoping to see a bunch of you with #CriticallyPins at Gen Con).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Pin x 1", "descp": "1 x enamel pin of your choice (from the unlocked designs).\nINCLUDES:\n1.75\" Hard Enamel Pin\nBacking Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Pay-It-Forward Domestic", "descp": "With this tier you can choose to buy a pin for a member of the LGBTQIA that is experiencing economic hardships within the United States.

Kickstarter United has not called for any direct action or boycotting of Kickstarter's services as of now. It is important to put their cause front and center and acknowledge their efforts to receive recognition from the company.\nThis campaign stands with Kickstarter United's ongoing fight for unionization. For more info, head to their website or follow them on twitter.\n You are all Goblins, congratulations! \nYou are also all barreling through space in a ship made of junk and scrap, how lucky! Your goal: to make it to Junktopia, the rogue planet in the middle of space, a utopia for the Goblins, with your ship intact and as much Junk as you can to further its beauty!\nSpace Goblins! is a HIGH CHAOS AND TRULY OUTRAGEOUS RPG meant for 2-5 players with rotating referee play and an emphasis on wild Goblin-created mayhem!\nThe Game!\nUsing Nate Treme's Tunnel Goons as a base, Space Goblins! has a simple and easy character creation and resolution mechanic for \"anything goes, describe and roll\" storytelling and gameplay! A uniquely designed-by-me rotating referee and clearly defined phases of play make for an easy game to pick up and learn-through-play as well as a great way to get everyone involved! From goblins new to RPGs, new to being a referee, or veterans of all types, Space Goblins! is a great place to mess around and share a good time with others! It's also great for children!\nSpace Goblins! is encouraged and compatible with Legos or any other interlocking plastic building block collection as your Junk collection, collaboratively and physically building up and breaking down your Junk Ship as you play! Each session have fun creating a unique ship which you can hold in your hands and play with! Break it down after you're done or keep it as a reminder of your amazing and wonderful journey to Junktopia! Other amazing features include:\nCreate Goblins that embody the most Goblin of stats: Scrapper, Tinkerer, Rascal, and Rude! \nCollaboratively create your Junkship that embodies the most Goblin of design elements: Rough, Tough, Scoot, and Shoot! \nRoll an unnecessary amount of d8s together to figure out what ship you crash into when looking for Junk!\n Set Game Length of 3-5-8 rounds allows you to play a short campaign of Space Goblins! sessions, troupe style play throughout several journeys to Juntktopia, or a very quick and fun one shot!\nWhy Kickstart?\nI'm choosing to take Space Goblins! to Kickstarter so that I can properly finish up this game and polish it to a state I'm proud of. Space Goblins! as a game has been done since I released it last year, and it has received many playtests and small QOL updates. \nThe $1800 I am asking for with this campaign is to bring Space Goblins! to print as well as to hire other collaborators to illustrate, layout, and edit my words that are currently just text in a PDF. Most of the budget is going towards paying all involved in the project (seen below) fair wages. The rest is going towards the print run and shipping. I'm giving my collaborators a lot of freedom with what they do with the game in terms of illustrations and layout, so the budget is slightly inflated to assure they will not be underpaid for their work. Any extra profit that is made after calculating printing + shipping + fees, and paying collaborators for their work, will be split evenly amongst all members of this project.\n\nThe Goblins Who Made This!\nViditya Voleti - Prolific Game Designer! - Viditya Voleti (me) has been called by many titles, but most important of them is A True Goblin. He has been designing games forever and even got a degree in Interactive Arts. Viditya has made many games, including the profound Space Between Stars, the incredible VOLUME (an accompanying zine to Adam Vass's TOME), the life-changing The Fire Flickers Between You, and of course the world-shattering Space Goblins! His passion is to allow people a chance to tell fun stories through play and to make each play experience unique not only in narrative but also tactility, gameplay, and goblin-ness. You can find his work at vidityavoleti.itch.io and their social media at @vidityavoleti!\nGlo Wan - Illustrator! - Glo is an incredible illustrator and designer who has already brought Space Goblins! to life with the cover! Their style is unmatched and is the pinnacle of Goblin, which is why they are perfect for the job and will be contributing a few more spot illustrations within the zine itself! Glo's work can be found in the following place! Website: glowanart.com/ Twitter: twitter.com/glooblin  Instagram: instagram.com/glooblin/\nJamila R. Nedjadi - Layout Artist! - Jamila R. Nedjadi may be a professional tarot reader and prolific game creator, but in their heart of hearts Jammi is a space goblin. The kind that swings around a space sword and sings space songs in space! Until the next life, where goblin glory awaits, you can find their games of magic, story, and emotional connection at Sword Queen Games (link: https://temporalhiccup.itch.io)\nTyler Crumrine - Editor! - Tyler Crumrine previously edited Viditya's fantasy zine VOLUME as well several RPG products for World Champ Game Co. and Apollyon Press. He's also the designer of Beak, Feather, & Bone: A Map-Labeling RPG. As editor, Tyler will be making sure everything in SPACE GOBLINS! reads well and is easy to use at the table. Find more about his work at www.crumrine.info\n\nReward Tiers\nSpace Goblins! is a project I want to keep pretty simple and straight forward! The reward tiers offered are designed to make getting the game into your hands (digital or physical) as easy as possible AND also affordable for the work being done by the wonderful team of creatives so they get paid properly!\nOf course, if you want a little extra Goblin in your game, there's a special tier for a unique, handwritten starting room for your Ship on the JUNK SHIP TABLE to give you a fun jumping-off point on your first game! This here is for the Goblins who want an utterly ruined yet completely playable addition to their Print Copy of Space Goblins! I'll personally fill in the first room on your JUNK SHIP TABLE as a seed for your first journey to Junktopia! I may also leave some other notes and graffiti (and a thank you) here and there, who knows where Goblin Inspiration comes from?\nFinally, I will lick your zine giving you the absolutely true goblin product. \nCommunity Copies\nThis project will be supporting the spread of Community Copies towards those who are unable to financially give to this Kickstarter during its duration. The Community Copies will be broken down as followed:\nAll digital backers ($10 Pledge) will contribute another digital copy towards the Community Copies stash. This ensures a 1:1 of digital copies for Space Goblins!\nAll backers who pledge at the Physical Community Copy tier ($25) will secure an additional Physical Zine to be added to the stash and will be offered to those who wish to claim a physical zine!\n People who pledge Only $1 will be reached out to first when the Community Copies are available. Afterward, all unclaimed Community Copies will go on the Space Goblins! itch.io page so anyone can claim them at any point.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter and also my first time with shipping out zines!

RPG - #Zinequest"}}, {"backer": "Calvin Johns", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Growing up, my friends and I inserted ourselves into our favorite stories. Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Redwall...we had our own original characters for all of these properties, and so many more. Characters we put time and energy and love and thought into creating. Characters that meant a lot to us, because they were a part of us, but also better: maybe stronger or smarter or older or braver.\nProof Copy, not at all final.\n I think anyone who engages with media and pop culture, especially when you engage as a kid, is bound to create an original character or two. And these characters are great, because they help establish your understanding of a literary world and of storytelling.\nBut there\u2019s this tendency online where, when a female-presenting person does this and presents their character online, their character is usually treated with disdain. The character is called \u201cunrealistic,\u201d  or \u201cwish fulfillment\u201d--and these might be true statements, but when has fiction ever had to be about realism? There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be a part of your favorite franchise, or to be better than you see yourself in real life. \nProof\n There\u2019s this thing that\u2019s become something of an old adage, now, online, that goes:\n\u201cThere\u2019s this girl, and she\u2019s so beautiful and charming that everyone wants to be with her, and she\u2019s incredibly rich, and she\u2019s super smart and can make anything she thinks of, and she really strong and tough and has trained with the best martial artists and fighters in the world, and she\u2019s bested them all, and she\u2019s just a normal human but she\u2019s stronger than all the superpowered people around her and she knows how to defeat them if she has to, and she\u2019s also thoughtful and adopts needy children and helps raise them to be strong like her, and...and...and..and what if I told you she was Batman?\u201d\nBecause, here\u2019s the thing...Mary Sue is a dirty word almost entirely because of the internet. It became a way to push girls down and tell them their ideas were stupid and overpowered and \u201cunrealistic.\u201d\nSo instead of treating the term \u201cMary Sue\u201d repressively, I want my game to embrace everything that makes Mary Sues great and fun.\nThis game is about embracing the perfections of a character, and making them as overpowered and ludicrous as possible. You and your friends will work cooperatively to create a Mary Sue and determine incredibly important things (like their hairstyle, their special powers, their unique feature, and the genre they come from) using a D12, a character sheet, and a little creativity. The sillier, the more over-the-top, the better!\nThis is a game about empowering yourself to make those characters you used to make when you were 5 or 8 or 13 years old, and to do so entirely without shame.  This is the party game Let\u2019s Make a Mary Sue!\nBecause, truly, the best thing about making an original character (do not steal) is making it! \nProof\n  WHY MARY SUES?\nI grew up when websites like Fanfiction.net and Deviantart were just starting to find success, so I have an intimate familiarity with Mary Sues and the negative attitude towards them. But what's great is that there's been a perceptible shift in favor of Mary Sues in the past few years. The creator of the Mary Sue Litmus Test is on record as no longer supporting thier test, as the term Mary Sue is used to \"tear down female characters simply for having a prominent, active role in a story.\" Websites like The Mary Sue have appropriated the term and used it to offer a feminist perspective on pop culture. The dialogue has generally shifted to regard the term \"Mary Sue\" as an outdated, unhelpful one, and that means it's high time for us to take it and make it positive! \nIt's important to note that Mary Sues is not a game restrained by gender, race, or sexual identity: anyone can be a Mary Sue.\nHeadshot of the author as a young Mary Sue.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$400\u2014Every print reward will come with some fun swag!

You will lead your civilization, birth heirs, fight back the terrible monstrosities, and as generations pass, eventually, form nations. \n The game is designed to run out of box with light OSR-inspired rules that push the focus of gameplay onto the player\u2019s own decisions and immersion rather than their character sheet. You are not a grand hero, no matter what your myth may be at the end of your life, but instead a human struggling along with your people to make solace in this dark world. As the leader of a small tribe of humanity, you will found the very foundations of civilization in the face of the suffocating darkness and the horrors within. You will explore the continent, experiment with strange discoveries, invent tools and culture, and, most importantly, slay and harvest the dangerous abominations. Once your threats are slain, you will settle; fortify; and expand your dominion. You will die, be it to disease, age, or slow liquefaction by stomach acid. But fear not, as quickly as you came, your heir will rise to your place and the cycle will continue unto larger kingdoms and greater threats. This is the way of Kingdoms, with the goal of playing out the succeeding generation each session.\nThe Kingdoms Zine Contains:\n Rules for creating a new Adam or Eve, along with unique racial traits that makes your bloodline stand out from the rest.\n Simple steps to breed, creating unique children that will no doubt disappoint.\n Mechanics for civilizing and expanding, designed to easily create and support your great empires and struggling hamlets.\n Discover an unexplored continent, teeming with strange flora and fauna acting as bizarre tools that will surprise you how player ingenuity develops them.\n Eight macabre monsters, drunk on decadence and power, they will challenge you with epic, Monster-Hunter style combats with signature beast attacks, multi-staged boss fights, and crafting materials for special weapons.\n A Unique Weapon System, in carving out legendary weapons from the slain corpses of grotesque behemoths.\n A DM's guide on running a multi-generational epic from the birth of society to the age of steam.\n Kingdoms is inspired by the intense boss battles of Monster Hunter, the grim epicness of Dark Souls, and the turbulent player-driven stories of legendary bloodlines and imperial legacy found in Crusader Kings. The story of mankind is yours to tell in Kingdoms. The players will hammer the foundations of human civilization in a sunless world through slaying the monstrosities of their era and assuming the role of their successors to continue the heroic lineage. Will your blood stand for strength in the face of the Dark? Strive for ingenuous discoveries to avoid bloodshed? Enforce mankind's divine right of conquest by trapping and bending the horrors of the Dark to their will? or Will your kingdom fall from heaven having squandered the resources accumulated from their mythic roots? \n If you want to delve deeper into the mechanics and systems of Kingdoms, see more art from the book, and get constant updates you can check out the writer/artist's blog at www.puddleofstars.com .\nSTRETCH GOALS\n\nThe Dark gives and takes, in this particular instance, it does both. A horrifying new monster will be added to the book to destroy and harass your innocent players.\nFully illustrated deck of trait cards for easy inheritance and additional flavor! (Including new traits exclusive to the card deck).\n A new existential threat faces humanity... Only the greatest of men's spawn could even fathom to face it and keep their sanity intact. Can your people survive? This goal will round out the base monster roster to a final 10!\nAcross the ocean echoes tell of a land of glistening woods, cryptic swamps, and a great burgeoning empire ruled under golden boots. A full blown expansion zine that explores a whole new continent full of new monsters, flora, and a hostile empire looking to challenge preconceived notions of importance and greatness.\nFull art equipment cards covering every weapon, armor piece, and accessory in the base book.  \n Advance your civilization from the birth of steam, to the PRIME of industrialization in this new era! Load guns, mass produce snake oil, and reconsider how you can put those monster parts to use in this age of industry.\nA special alternate cover exclusive to backers of the Kickstarter campaign.\n Software available to all backers that allows you to generate Kingdoms PCs & NPCs on the fly, customize their looks, and create heirs with other characters made through the program.\nWork in progress.\nAdds an optional collection of illustrated antagonist NPCs to cause chaos in your campaign for added tension and drama in the kingdom. They can be as normal as an average man, or perhaps mystically distinct in their own right, either way, they will be a threat.\nA big fat H U G E  list of tables stuffed into the cracks and crevices of Kingdoms. The zine is now bursting at the seems of what one would call a 'zine' anyways, so we are going to have to get creative with our layouts.

Along the way they'll test their mettle and virtue against violence, duplicity, and temptation. In the end, they'll discover that Evil is not so wicked and the Creator is not so good. We play to find out if they'll triumph over the Devil anyway or join the ranks of the Adversary's champions.\nFor Zine Quest 2, we're raising funds to bring Darker Malleus to you as a premium quality, 60 page zine and print-ready PDF. It features:\nA fleshed out rules text friendly to veteran gamers and first-time players alike.\nRandomly generated Hunters with varying backgrounds, equipment, and virtues. Plus, the possibility of playing a traitorous False Hunter.\nA resolution system centering the Hunters' growing Hatred and how it eats away at their Virtues.\nClear advice and procedures for the Adversary, Darker Malleus' GM, to create scenarios and mediate play.\nA luxurious layout that invites meditation on and annotation of the text.\nFull-page, black and white illustrations by Felix Miall.\nAbout the Layout\nDarker Malleus features a layout with generous margins, inspired by early printed books. This style helps avoid information overload. Instead of scanning a cramped page for needed information, it's easy to grasp what rules and procedures are in a spread at a glance. The spacious margins also give room for personal annotations, letting each reader make the text their own.\nDigital mockup. Lifepath spread not final.\nEvery Hunter has the seed of Hatred burning in their heart. This Hatred has a value that goes up to 10. Depending on the Hunter's Lifepath, their Hatred starts at 4, 5, or 6.\nWhen a Hunter acts on the world, or is acted on in kind, and we're not sure of the result, we roll a ten-sided die (d10) and read its result as 0 through 9.\nDice icons modified from originals by John W. Sheldon of Daedalum AP Games.\nWhen the result is equal to or less than their Hatred, it means that darkness and violence have won out in their heart. When the Hunter is trying to do violence or act with cunning, this is good. When the Hunter is trying to express their inborn Virtue or resist the Devil's temptation, this is bad.\nWhen the result is greater than their Hatred, it means that light and virtue have won out in their heart. When the Hunter is trying to do violence or act with cunning, this is bad. When the Hunter is trying to express their inborn Virtue or resist the Devil's temptation, this is good.\nA Hunter facing failure may declare \"Not today, Satan!\" to overcome their weakness, but doing so increases their Hatred.\nA Hunter who, in their weakness, indulges their temptation, increases their Hatred.\nIf a Hunter's Hatred reaches 10, their heart breaks and they fall to Evil, becoming one of the Adversary's champions.\nDigital mockup.

Every designer implements them a little differently; for most of my own games, I add a free download for every game I sell at full price. These free downloads can be claimed by anyone, without question or condition, increasing the availability of independent roleplaying games to marginalized groups and others experiencing financial hardship.\nOnce Darker Malleus is published I'll add a digital community copy to the game's Itch.io page for every backer who gets a digital edition (all backer levels at $9 or more).

The game is about making zines, trading zines, worldbuilding, and character development. It\u2019s a love letter to zine culture, friendships across the distance, cultural exchange, snail mail, and parallel universes.\nIf you are not familiar with the concept of zines, they are DIY self-published booklets with their own underground subculture devoted to making, selling (though usually not for much), and trading them. While there is a niche of zine culture devoted to rpg zines, it may come as a surprise to some ZineQuest participants that the broader community is much, much larger. Zines culture has traditionally been a space where people from marginalized identities and subcultures can get their voice out there without being censored. Zine culture has punks, gamers, queer people, anarchists, people of color, working class folks, feminists, teen girls, neurodivergent people, lowbrow artists, poets and more. Zines are weird, wild, wonderful, and can contain just about anything that can be made out of paper, ink, and staples. And the best part is, whether your zine is mundane, niche, strange, or incomprehensible, there\u2019s an audience for it in the zine community.\nSome perzines\nThis game is about a specific subgenre of zines known as \u201cperzines\u201d. A perzine is a personal zine, where the \u201czinester\u201d writes (and sometimes draws) about their own life experiences, identities, interests, and thoughts. Perzines are perhaps the type of zine most likely to be traded by mail, as well as the most likely to foster friendships across distances. It\u2019s like being pen pals, but also sort of like letting someone read your diary.\nIn Our Own Wor(l)ds is about this experience, but with a fantastical twist. Two players will take the role of characters living in two different universes, somehow able to exchange their zines across the barrier between them. The worlds might be very similar to our own, or very, very different. All that is guaranteed is that both characters will make and exchange multiple handmade zines about their lives, their worlds, their thoughts, and their circumstances, and larger narratives will take form over the course of these exchanges. \nIn Our Own Wor(l)ds will be an rpg in the tradition of story games, with more of a focus on collaborative storytelling rather than stats and battles. Do expect, however:\nCharacter and Universe sheets\nInstructions for creating universes\nInstructions for generating characters\nInstructions for generating plots and overarching themes\nInstructions for creating content for each of the 3 zines each character creates over the course of a standard game\nInstructions for making two different styles of zines with varying numbers of pages \nThe game and other zine content is still currently being written, but as trading and making perzines is a subject I\u2019m passionate about and something I\u2019ve done successfully for several years (I\u2019ve made over 25 different zines, ranging from 16 to 88 pages long), I am confident I can bring this project to life.\nThe final rpg zines will be made in the same DIY style as the perzines that players are instructed to make. It will be cut and pasted together, cheaply printed on copy paper with a colored paper cover, with a stapled binding. Any internal art will either be in the public domain or created by me. The PDF copy of the zine will be made of scans of the pages. A text-only version of the zine will be made available for free on Itch.io. \nUsing these methods, it\u2019s estimated that the cost to make and ship one zine in the United States will cost about $3-$4. The Kickstarter goal assumes a print run of 100 zines, money for Kickstarter fees and taxes, as well as profit for the work that goes into creating, printing, assembling, and shipping the zines. \nOlivia Montoya (she/her) is a queer, neurodivergent, latinx, zinester game dev.

That's the first thing you need to know. The second thing you need to know is this sometimes gets me in trouble, but it has also earned me a number of friends.\nNot too long ago, I was musing aloud on Twitter as I so often do. What could I do for ZineQuest 2 that would be fun, easy, and coincide with my existing plans for 2020? So I threw an idea out into the void: Drunk History but game designers talking about their life. Figured nobody would respond, or they'd laugh and it'd go nowhere.\nI was wrong.\nPeople started volunteering. Just a few at first. Then more. Then I was in trouble. Because you see I have this deal with myself. If I make a shitpost and people respond positively enough, I make it a legitimate project.\nMe (Joe DeSimone) [He/Him] - The Interviewer and an Absolute Fool\nI've made a moderately successful career around games over the years by following essentially only this rule. I've designed educational games for companies because I joked it couldn't be done. I endlessly tweeted at the co-founder of my favorite publisher at the time and it ultimately led to my first editing job in the industry, and a $40K Kickstarter, because a friend said it was a terrible idea. I started a game design learning center and run curricular design there because of this rule. This is how my life evolved. Now there's this.\nNow there's Not Pretty But Wonderful.\nHere's the cover. Jordan Shiveley (@HottestSingles) did me a solid with it.\nI want to be very clear: this book is getting written whether or not this Kickstarter funds. I plan on interviewing people one way or another. I will be attending conventions no matter what. But I'd like the wider hobby to be a part of this effort. I want to share my absurdist shitpost writ large. Because I think it will be a fun time for all those who give themselves over to the idea, and I don't think that should be limited to myself and my friends in the industry. I think that fun should include you.\nBut what is it EXACTLY?\nFirstly, it's a book. It's not a game. But it's a book about games and the people who make them. Every $75 raised will secure one interview with one designer. I will meet up with them at a convention somewhere in the world and then spend up to $50 on alcohol, food, or caffeine for them. They will consume it in a sitting, and then we will chat for an hour or so. I will record this and then I will transcribe it. You will get to read what comes out of their mouth.\nSecondly, it's an excuse for those people to let loose. Go a little wild at the conventions where I'll see them. Because for many of these people, conventions are work. That sucks. Conventions are glorious celebrations of our collective love of games. This is an hour or so where they get to muse and ramble and joke about that.\nBasically how I've approached the people involved with this project. Also me when people ask if this will be a serious, professional endeavor.\nBut what will the CONTENTS be like? Racy? Funny? Horrifying?\nI don't know! That's the fun of it. All of the above? None of them? Probably somewhere between those two extremes. If you want to see a sample of what the contents of the book might look like, well... I've got an entire hour of interview audio and a transcript already prepared. Enjoy! You can find bios of my lovely guinea pigs at the bottom of this page. I have absolutely no idea if this will be representative of any other interview. Let's find out!\nThis book will be done as a PDF and as a Print-On-Demand (POD) text. If you back at a level that gets you the POD, you will be emailed an at-cost discount coupon for one copy upon completion of the text. I may also make an e-reader version of the book. I honestly don't know. Fair warning.\nHere's what it could wind up looking like. Who knows?! Thanks to Adam Vass for this mockup!\nBut isn't drinking wrong at conventions?\nNo and also fuck off. I've been sober for nearly seven years. Several of the people I'm interviewing are as well. The alcohol isn't the point. Whether it's John \"Hambone\" McGuire getting real weird with a bunch of meat, or Mark Richardson drinking seltzer, or Fiona Maeve Geist getting well and truly obliterated... well, that's just how they're getting to a place where they can be goofy, unrestrained, and open. What's the old refrain?\nImage by Adam Ellis from his webcomic Books of Adam (02/03/16)\nWhat safety and sensitivity measures will be in place?\nSafety will come down to self-control, ultimately. I don't intend to infantilize anyone. I'll be doing some basic drink counting and if people go overboard I will put them in a cab back to their hotel. If they ask, I will accompany them and stay as they sober up. That's about it.\nSensitivity is something I'm treating more rigorously. I've lined up sensitivity readers from Overeaters Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and Narcotics Anonymous who feel comfortable enough in their sobriety to handle reading the transcriptions. For (I hope) obvious reasons, I will not be breaking their anonymity.\nSo who are these creators I keep referencing? Here's the list so far (alphabetically):\nFurther down the page is more information on each of these lovely humans. For now, just know that not every person here will necessarily be included in the book. That will come down to funding. I'm looking for $1500 to get this kicked off; that will cover the first 10 of 32 people on the list.  Every $75 raised after that will secure another creator. This will cover Kickstarter fees, taxes, and me spending $50 on each interviewee for consumables of their choice. If you really, desperately want to see a particular creator included, back this KS at their \"Oh no, [XXX]\" pledge level. That immediately shoots them to the front of the list.\nPledge levels? What are those? Are they important?\nYEP! Definitely should've mentioned those earlier. Thankfully they're not too complicated (and there's only a handful despite looking like dozens).\nThis is your entry level pledge, and the one I expect most people to back at. It gets you the PDF of the finished product somewhere near the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021. You can read these on a sitting computer or a handheld computer or even print them out and make your own pretend book. I don't care!\nSlightly better! If you want a book that's bound by a company and not with duct tape from your garage, this is the pledge level for you. You'll get the PDF as above, but you'll also get an at-cost coupon for a softcover Print-On-Demand (POD) version of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You can redeem this coupon whenever you want and they'll send the book to your house for the cost of shipping! Magic!\nHooo boy now we're talking. You get everything as above (PDF + POD), but now the book is hardcover! Also you get to ask one question to one creator. Which creator? I GET TO PICK! You gotta drop the really big bucks if you want that kind of control over your life. But your question will be included in the interview, and thus in the book, as either one I legitimately ask or (if it's wildly inappropriate) one that the creator and I mock viciously. TBH both sound fun.\nBasically paying your way into the Ivy League but more useful for your prospects in the games industry. This is the big kahuna, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. This is the level where shit really slaps. Where it absolutely does fuck. If you give me fifty whole dollars, you'll get a hardcover book, get to ask three questions, pick the creator who gets asked them, and I drop your name in the interview. Your name gets said aloud to someone you admire (or maybe hate!). Think about the power you'll wield. Unlimited power.\nYou're just toying with me (or you're my parents). Why would you pay $150 for this? But hey. Not gonna NOT take your money, right? At this level, one of the creators asks ME a question of your choosing. I have to answer it. Rigorously. Honestly. I mean, it could be anything. You could really mess up my life. $150 is actually kinda cheap for the power to ruin a life. If I weren't running this KS, I might pledge here. Damn.\nWhere will the money really be going? What are the Stretch Goals?\nNo lie, that's the whole shebang. I'm not looking to profit off of this campaign. Making the PDF will be easy enough, and handling book printing via POD is likewise inexpensive for me. My costs are booze, taxes, KS fees, travel, and lodging. The basic thrust of this campaign is the whole damn thing.\nBut if you want it laid out for you.\n(1) $50 will go toward every creator I interview, which will be used for alcohol, food, or caffeine that they must consume while we are talking.\n(2) Every $500-$1000 after the initial funding goal will see me attend another convention somewhere in the world and find a minimum of one new person to interview. This interview will of course be included in the book.\n(3) If we hit $2500, I will hire Mary Georgescu to do layout on the book.\n(4) If we hit some huge amount - tens of thousands of dollars - I will shut down this KS. I don't need that heat in my life.\nThat's it. That's the whole campaign. Below are some further bios of lovely people. I hope you think this dumb idea is as wonderful as I do, because I'd very much like to see this book made real and put into your hands.\nTracy Barnett (They/Them) is a queer game designer, editor, and podcaster.

One player takes on the role of the Claimant, former heir to the throne who was betrayed by their family and robbed of their rightful titles. Others play their most stalwart allies: wise chancellor, devoted knight, idealistic noble, vengeful soldier, or opportunistic outlaw. Conflicting duties and ambitions will push them into points of tension, but their commitment to the Claimant\u2019s ascent ties them together.\nA GM plays the other inhabitants of the cursed and fractured Empire: nobles, commoners, outlaws, and undead wraiths. The GM presents opportunities, foreshadows consequences, and introduces adversity. They present the challenges that make the player characters\u2019 fight for the throne uncertain and exciting. As a group, you play to find out whether the Claimant can take their throne and what sacrifices must be made along the way.\nRebel Crown is a Forged in the Dark game, building on the core system pioneered in John Harper\u2019s Blades in the Dark. It leverages a resolution and advancement system that is character-driven and full of interesting compromises while developing a unique focus on character relationships and a finite campaign arc.\nWe have released a Quickstart version of the rules that you can print and play right now.  The Quickstart includes all the player sheets and a tense starting situation to kick off a one-shot or campaign.\nIt is the year 247 of the Aonaicthe Empire, a centralized dominion that brought three warring kingdoms into unsteady accord. The kingdoms assented (or succumbed) to Imperial rule only in the face of an existential threat: a curse fell upon the kingdoms and the souls of those who die do not remain at rest. Monstrous wraiths plague the Empire, bringing suffering and destruction. Nearly three hundred years of coping with this crisis has changed life in the Empire completely. Fear of wraiths has calcified the already entrenched feudal structure.\nThe three largest houses style themselves kings and queens under the Empress: the ancient house Lolaire, the wealthy house Darach, and the pious house Nathair. Every other house has sworn fealty to these three. The three kingdoms have a duty to maintain peace and control the unquiet dead within their own borders. Peace is maintained by the Empress\u2019s might, and by the fear that open battle would doom the kingdoms to a pandemic of wraiths. Without the ability to mass armies in the field, ambitious nobles must turn to subtler methods. In this context, the Claimant seeks to reclaim their throne from their treacherous uncle. They must face rival houses, members of their own family, and spirits of the unquiet dead in a daring ascent to power.\nRebel Crown builds off the core framework of Blades in the Dark. This system is ideal for playing a connected group of characters with a shared ambition: in this case, the Claimant and the trusted members of their retinue. The resolution system provides constant dramatic momentum, as actions often succeed at the cost of introducing new challenges. This core system has proven a perfect fit for a game that is ultimately about an uncertain climb up the ladder of power.\nThe Playbooks in Rebel Crown are based on different approaches to the quest for the crown, and on the relationships between the player characters. A crucial part of gameplay (and character advancement) is the conflicting impulses of these characters, and the advice they give the Claimant to guide their ascent. The Playbook design produces characters that are both committed to a shared cause, and in conflict about the path to victory.\nThe Claimant is the heart of the campaign: the campaign ends in victory if they claim their crown; it ends in failure if they die. Play the Claimant if you want to support the other players at the table, pulling them into the spotlight, and digging into their characters\u2019 beliefs.\nThe Devoted is a fierce warrior, utterly dedicated to the Claimant. They truly love the Claimant; though that love may be filial or romantic, reciprocated or not. Play the Devoted if you want to explore the tensions that arise when personal loyalty is placed above all else.\nThe Chancellor is a fellow member of the nobility, with greater experience and resources than the Claimant. Play the Chancellor if you want to play the mentor to another character and if you want to explore the tension between providing support and pushing for your own agenda.\nThe Idealist has allied with the Claimant because they believe it is a path to the greater good. They are committed to the Claimant, but equally committed to a cause: a vision of a more just kingdom. Play the idealist to explore how ideals can be compromised in becoming a reality, and if you want to play the conscience to another character.\nThe Outlaw is allied with the Claimant to gain a pardon and redeem their name. They have lived away from polite society for some time, surviving among the underworld of the Empire. Play the Outlaw if you want to emphasize the reality of feudal warfare outside the bounds of noble courts, and if you want to explore the tension between pragmatism and reputation.\nThe Vengeant once served another noble house but was cast out. They seek to bring their former masters low, and have joined the Claimant to see that done. Play the Vengeant if you want a strong relationship with your enemies and if you want to explore the toll that warfare takes in both victory and defeat.\nDraft Character Sheets\nThe characters in Rebel Crown are not a loosely assembled party of adventurers: they are sworn allies on a deadly quest. A campaign of Rebel Crown drives hard toward this objective and may end in victory or defeat. If the Claimant takes the throne, the campaign succeeds and a brief epilogue details the ensuing years of rule. If the claimant dies, or abandons their quest, then the campaign ends in defeat. Nothing is certain ahead of time.\nThis complete arc happens over 12 to 16 sessions of play, depending on the group\u2019s preferred pacing and the setbacks the retinue faces. This is enough time for characters to develop and change, and to see the kingdom slowly transform. At the same time, it gives a campaign an endpoint to play toward and a decisive finale.\nThe ladder of feudal power requires allies, vassals, and land. Rebel Crown\u2019s campaign is driven by the players' decisions: which factions they forge relationships with and which holdings they seize, vassalize, or burn to the ground. Each holding the retinue adds to their domain increases their renown and provides unique resources or advantages. The drive to claim more holdings frames each sortie and provides clear stakes for the players. This structure provides both direction and choice: a singular motivation in an open sandbox of methods. \nDraft Domain Sheet\nRebel Crown includes robust GM tools, providing a framework for introducing obstacles that put the retinue\u2019s ambitions in jeopardy without undermining their victories.  The GM uses clocks to track (and foreshadow) escalating threats within a sortie and across the campaign.  Profiles of each faction, province, and holding give context for the problems the retinue will face, with just enough detail to build on at the table.  The player-facing campaign structure is also a GM tool, in that it allows the GM to respond to the retinue's actions rather than having to worry about driving the story forward.\nDuring a session, the Claimant and their allies choose a sortie to accomplish, then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the sortie in progress. Their objective might be to form a new alliance, to conquer a holding by force, or to protect an imperiled village from the restless dead.  The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the sortie (succeed or fail). Then the retinue has downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and seek solace. After downtime, the players look for a new opportunity to pursue. This loop allows us to see the characters in moments of action and quietude, both how they fare in heated conflicts and how they recover and prepare for the next foray. \nRebel Crown will be a professionally printed, saddle-stitched zine.  This core zine will include the rules of play and the campaign framework for reclaiming Craobhan, kingdom of moss and crag.\nRebel Crown: Serpent & Oak will provide two additional starting situations for your campaigns: new factions to contend with, and new kingdoms to reclaim. They will explore the culture and history of the other kingdoms of the Aonaicthe Empire and provide materials for making a second and third campaign feel fresh. Serpent & Oak will be a professionally printed, saddle-stitched zine.\nThe Boxed Set will be a custom-printed box with a linen finish and gold foil stamping. It'll be packed with both zines, along with custom Rebel Crown dice and pencils.\nAll rewards will ship together in August 2020.\nMockup of the Boxed Set\nThis is our second Kickstarter. Last ZineQuest, we introduced Goblinville, a game about broke goblins going into dangerous places to get the things they need for their ramshackle town.  Goblinville was selected to showcase at the Boston Festival of Indie Games and it's been played at conventions across the country.  You can read about it on the Indie Game Reading Club or check out the First Look by Adam Koebel.\nGoblinville gave us a ton of experience to apply to Rebel Crown: from launching and running a Kickstarter, to shipping and fulfillment. This is a labor of love for us. Michael, who does the core design and writing, is a computer science teacher during the day. Eric, who does the art, layout, and development, is an artist and graphic designer. We think Rebel Crown offers something a lot of RPG groups are looking for, character-driven play threaded into a compelling campaign, and we are going to pour our hearts into this game.\nMichael & Eric at PAX Unplugged\nThis game would not exist without John Harper\u2019s generous licensing of Forged in the Dark games. Starting from this excellent framework allowed us to build on a design foundation we already loved.\nWe were also inspired (as always) by Luke Crane's The Burning Wheel, as a model for bringing character motivations to the forefront of play.\nRebel Crown's epilogue mechanics were inspired by Meguey & Vincent Baker's The King Is Dead, another game of feudal succession and divided loyalties.\nWe were influenced by the account of Henry Bolingbroke's rise in Shakespeare's Richard II,  by Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories, and by the stories of Daenerys and Stannis in A Song of Ice and Fire.\nFor the campaign structure, we looked to games like Crusader Kings II and Total War, where expansion always creates new opportunities and new liabilities.\nWe\u2019re indebted to the playtesters who help us develop this system and to those willing to back this project.  Thanks for believing in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is in some ways a smaller project than our last ZineQuest. We are creating two zines rather than four, and have established affordable and effective procedures for printing and fulfillment.\n\nThere are always risks for small creative teams like us, but we have taken steps to mitigate these. We are offering a simple campaign, without stretch goals or external partners. We are doing all the writing, development, art, and layout ourselves. We\u2019re running all international fulfillment through Shopify to limit our exposure to fluctuations in international shipping and duties costs.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to fulfilling this project on time and communicating our progress clearly. One of the most meaningful pieces of feedback from our last campaign was that our campaign was \u201cprofessional, transparent, and stress-free\u201d.

They are the poetry of the broken and the inhuman breakers: haunting things, deep and dark and bellowing things, unfathomable things that consume all that edges to their precipice.\nSunken is a tabletop roleplaying game about these things.\nIt is a tabletop roleplaying game about these things and the sea.\nIt is a tabletop roleplaying game about how your characters find their doom among these things while at sea.\nSunken shifts the focus of the world of Trophy onto \u2013 and below \u2013 the vast and treacherous Salt Sea, expanding \"That Silent Howl\" from Codex: Void into a full stand alone system that remains rooted in the mechanics of Trophy Dark.\nWhat's It Like?\nReturn of the Obra Dinn, The Terror, Alien, Bioshock, Sunless Sea, Rime of the Ancient Mariner ... Sunken frames naval and sci-fi horror in a world of dark fantasy. \nHow Does It Play?\nAs a Rooted in Trophy game, Sunken heels toward evocative storytelling over a simple framework \u2013 perfect for dramatic one-shot sessions. The original Trophy ruleset has been modified to put emphasis on the themes of dreadful ocean expeditions while keeping the overall structure lean and straightforward.\nCharacter creation is a simple spin of the cypher: Choose your background, your job, your faction, and \u2013 if you choose to believe in that kind of thing \u2013 a patron saint.\nSunken's magic comes in the form of answered prayers to eerie saints\nYou might be the estranged heir of a great family, turned marine under the black-skull flag, hoping to regain the worth of your heredity. Or maybe you're secretly a Company automaton, stationed as a surgeon with that crew of vagabonds, ensuring through subterfuge that valuable secrets stay within corporate hulls.\nEach voyage is divided into five tides, a series of distinct acts that uniquely raise the stakes and tension of your adventure. As you take risks to weather these tidal terrors, you'll roll dice to determine outcomes. Accumulate dice across three pools:\n The Flesh \u2013 For each skill you're able to utilize from your background and occupation, roll a die from this pool.\n The Deep \u2013 Decide how much the power of the sea drives your action, but with each die you take, increase the chances that you lose some sanity. As your mind succumbs to the depths, find yourself steered more and more by the call of the sea.\n The Heavens \u2013 An icon of hope amidst the torrent. Your fellow players can offer you divine intervention: extra effect applied to a success. If the Heavens rolls low, lose some faith in a higher power and hasten your descent into the deep.\nSunken's design heightens the feeling of navigating a capsizing character, encouraging you to pull power from the void while sliding you down an accelerating slope to your doom. \nWhat's Included?\nWhether digital, print, or both, you get:\n Rules \u2013 A standalone nautical hack of Trophy.\n Voyages \u2013 Three in total. Inky beasts, bred with dark magic. A utopia built within the carcass of a leviathan.

Chapters will be divided by original patterns. Note: This is mockup and not a final spread.\nWhich Three Voyages?\n A Covenant of Silence \u2013 A prequel/sequel/reboot of \"That Silent Howl\", where your crew finds itself infested with the East Passage Company's most profitable \u2013 and predatory \u2013 cargo. Find the nearest friendly face and hug them dearly.\n This Colossus Beneath \u2013 A hard-fought tip leads to the rumored dwelling of the Company's missing founder: a submerged utopia architected within the corpse of a leviathan. The timely shock of a breaching insurrection may provide opportunity to poach this belly of the beast.\n Futility's Wreck \u2013 Slogging through the icing shawl of the south, the crew of Futility find themselves not half a league from a hulking barge inhabited by cultists adorned in death's mark. This cursed band think and breathe as one, and they collect proselytes unfettered by the hardening sea.\nAre There Stretch Goals?\nOh, heavens yes. \nAnd they've been hit by the generous backers that have come before you.\nRichard Ruane (Barrow Keep) and Natalie Ash (Richter: The Rotting City) will be adding their haunting storytelling to the zine's Shanties & Lore section, adding characters, settings, and terrors in the form of found fragments.\nA second mini-zine will be included with all reward levels, with a Kickstarter-exclusive print run being delivered to print backers.

You are a member of the Red Right Hand, a disgraced intelligence agency fighting a guerrilla war against covetous noble houses in the streets and atop the rooftops of Laenfendport, an Edwardian fantasy metropolis.\nBased on Trophy Gold - which is also Kickstarting right now! - , Night Reign adapts that game's push your luck mechanics, fragile characters and costly sorcery to tales of revolution and vengeance from the shadows, with innovative card based mechanics that to push the theme and feel of stealth gameplay home. As part of Kickstarter's ZineQuest 2 campaign, you'll get a complete RPG in zine form, with a capsule setting of faux-Edwardian urban dark fantasy that will appeal to fans of Dishonored, Thief, and Blades in the Dark. \nThe Zine\nNight Reign is part of Kickstarter\u2019s ZineQuest promotion, and will be available as a 48 page, b&w A5 format zine. We\u2019re working with Biddles Books (who also printed Quietus) to produce an authentic zine feel, using a cream bookwove paper to give it a nice heavy feel for a relatively small product.\nEveryone who backs at the zine level will also get a complimentary PDF version of the zine via DriveThru RPG. The PDF will be available in pure black and white for home printing, and a colour version to emulate the paper and coloured cover of the hard copy zine.\nLaefendport\nThe scabrous, rainslick metropolis of Laefendport was mere decades previously nothing but a collection of hovels and shacks, home to scavengers who scraped a meagre existence salvaging whatever they could from the many ships dragged into the notoriously treacherous waters to its immediate east, and wrecked on shores so jagged and jutting it seems as if the very earth was reaching up in protest. Its name meant Liars Port, a reference to the treachery of both its tides and its residents.\nLet me walk through the stinking alleys, to the music of drunken bearings. PJ Harvey, The Last Living Rose\nThe rain there, black as a moonless winter sky, viscous and inert, falls near constantly and poisons all but the hardiest, most unappealing plants, deforms and drives animals mad, and leaves anything it touches greasy and stained. For centuries, only the desperate or the touched would go anywhere near Laefendport.\nUntil, that is, the Eisenhart Process, an alchemical process by which the Night Rain can be filtered and made combustible. Suddenly, there was a freely available source of fuel literally falling from the sky. Free, at least, until the noble families arrived to harvest it. The city and the influence of the Nobles grew at a malignant rate, until both seemed to cover everything.\nThe people call the Nobles' oppressive regime The Night Reign. You're here to end it. By your hand, the Night Reign will fall. \nStealth\nYou're outnumbered and outgunned, but the shadows are your greatest weapon. Night Reign uses a modified form of blackjack to model the push-your-luck, tense tactics of stealth video games, and lets you really feel the threat of being caught. \nFreedom soon will come, then we'll come from the shadows - Leonard Cohen, The Partisan\nThe higher your score, the more stealth tokens you'll gain, which can be used to achieve the goals of the adventure. If the deck ever runs out, you fail your mission, and a perfect score allows you to reshuffle the deck - but go bust and you'll be caught and have to fight your way out! Do you hide and wait for the perfect moment, or make a risky dash for glory? \nGuile\nThe riskier the action, the greater the reward. When you run up against opposition that can't be totally avoided, it's down to you and your wits to find a way around it. The wilder your plan, the quicker you'll be through, and time is always counting down. \nThrew my bad fortune off the top of a tall building. PJ Harvey, Good Fortune\nBut the more cautious you are, the more information you'll get before you make the draw. Play it your way!\nViolence\nSometimes, things are going to get nasty. Whether you've been caught, or you're more about spilling blood than hugging the shadows, members of the Red Right Hand didn't get that epithet for nothing. Simple to run, but tactically deep, Night Reign's combat system is all about reading your opponent's moves, choosing when to defend and when to strike, and can run anything from a single master swordsman to a rioting mob in just a few rounds. \nOn a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man, in a dusty black coat with a red right hand - Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Red Right Hand\nBut be quick - the longer a fight takes, the more chaos tokens you'll accrue, and the harder it will be to go unnoticed - and the messier and darker things will get in Laefendport.\nDevilry\nLaefendport does not traffic with gods. The sea swallows everything that dares come near, and the sky pisses down black tar onto the land. If ever anyone prayed to a god here, their prayers were demonstrably not answered. Instead, Laefendport has the Sisters. They are not things to worship, they are things to blame misfortune on, to curse, to avoid. If you mutter their names in a prayer, it is to ask that they overlook you for another day.\nWell, if you're gonna dine with the cannibals, sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten. - Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Cannibal Hymn\nAt any time, players can draw from the Sisters deck to create an unnatural effect - bursting into a flock of crows, filling a room full of impenetrable shadows, or summoning a swarm of rats to do their bidding, amongst other macabre powers, and gain an automatic 10. But draw the card that corresponds to the sister whose power you are leaching, and they'll turn their eye on you.\n\nUNLOCKED!

Though the drought has made things difficult for the people, they have hope, because they know that when the sun reaches its peak on the hottest day of the year, they arrive, and they bring miracles with them.\nProcession is a game about monsters and miracles. It is a game about imagining a village, and then making it better through unconventional means. It is a game about empathizing with bizarre beings. You do not play any single character, but embody the town of Edmund Valley as a whole and the bizarre creatures that pass through it.\nProcession is a short single-player game, and is inspired by both Avery Alder's The Quiet Year and Takuma Okada's Alone series. The only thing required to play the game is a deck of cards, but I would recommend using paper and pencil as well to record your thoughts. The game is 8 pages long including the front and back cover, and features Wendel Dietterlin's Renaissance art, Procession of Monstrous Figures.\nDue to differences in available printers, US versions of the zine will be printed on letter-sized paper and UK versions of the zine will be printed on A4 paper. If you do not live in either the US or the UK, the PDF reward will come with printing instructions if you want to print your own copy!\nStretch Goals!\nProcession is now getting stretch goals! These stretch goals will unlock new PDFs to add more variety to the game! Backers at any level will receive all unlocked stretch goal content! Stretch goal rewards will be delivered at a later date.\nStretch Goal 1 ($600): Procession Expanded\nProcession Expanded doubles the number of events that can happen during the Procession, with new rules to allow you to play with two suits of cards or stick with a single suit and choose one of two options each time you draw.\nStretch Goal 2 ($750): Four Suit Procession\nFour Suit Procession adds new events that can happen during the Procession, allowing you to play with a full deck of cards instead of just one suit!\nThe People Behind Procession\nTyler Magruder is a nonbinary tabletop game designer and writer. The guiding principle behind their game design is finding a way to make the gameplay resonate with the themes and stories being told. Also they just really like monsters. You can find their work on itchio and Patreon, and their thoughts on Twitter.\nChloe Montgomery will be handling UK printing and shipping!\nWendel Dietterlin the Younger was a German artist who worked in the 17th Century.

The focus of the game is very story-driven, with an emphasis on collaborative storytelling and worldbuilding over stats and crunch.\nBuild your family and the house in which they live, then embark on an expedition into the land of giants in order to collect the things you need to survive - without being seen.\nThe game uses a simple 2d6 system for conflict resolution and an easy-to-pick-up story-building system to help GMs build engaging scenes on the fly.\nUnder The Floorboards is a low-prep game designed for one shot play but with tools to enable campaign play over multiple sessions. The game provides locations, hazards, and tools to quickly design your own content to keep surprising your players, and is perfect for convention play or to keep on your shelf for game nights when your whole group can't be there.\nThe zine contains:\nAll the rules you need to create characters and play Under The Floorboards\n10 unique locations for Expeditions - now upgraded to 16 locations after hitting the first stretch goal! \n12 Enemies and Challenges to populate your Locations\nTools to create your own Locations, Enemies, and Challenges\nGuidelines for campaigns and extended play \nTest print of Under The Floorboards. Jewelry, buttons, flowers and stuff not included in your pledge, obviously. The typos won't be there either.\nThe zine will be a 44-page, A5 saddle-stitched booklet printed in black ink on 130gsm silk interior pages - now upgraded to 160gsm natural paper after hitting the second stretch goal! - with a sturdy heavyweight cover in a classic mustard yellow intended to evoke beloved clothbound books from childhood.\nStretch goals will unlock additional pages, as well as increasing the quality of the interior pages to 160gsm natural paper for a real premium finish.\nUnder The Floorboards ships anywhere in the world for a flat fee of \u00a33, which will be collected through Kickstarter. There will be no need for you to enter extra information or payments to external services.\nWho are these little people and where do they live?\nThe game begins as players collaboratively build a family of Floorboard Folk, describing their relationships to one another and building the space that they call home. \nThe players then decide what they need so badly that they are going to plan an Expedition into the land of the giants to get it.\nWhat does an Expedition look like?\nExpeditions are divided into three phases - Scouting, Borrowing, and The Return.\nIn the Scouting phase, players collectively describe the Location that the Expedition takes place in. They will identify their goal and the hazards in the way of attaining it, and devise a plan of action. A simple system helps the GM determine how accurately the Scout remembered the Location, and how Lucky the group will be.\nIn the Borrowing phase, the players travel away from their home to the Location they scouted in the first phase. This is where the story truly comes alive. The GM uses the results of the Scouting phase to introduce Complications and Dangers to the Expedition, keeping the players on their toes as their plan tries to unravel. Success depends on how well they have prepared, and their ability to react to the ever-changing land of the giants.\nDuring the Expedition characters will have to rely on their own wits and skills as well as each other, and will forge bonds and live through tales that will become the stuff of Floorboard Folk legend.\nThe final phase, The Return, sees the characters put the Expedition behind them and head home. This is the time to reflect on what happened, further develop the bonds between your characters, and slowly begin to build the legend of your family. And, if you feel up to it, now may well be the time to begin planning the next Expedition.\nWhere are these Locations?\nThe Locations of Under The Floorboards are the mundane spaces that we giants take for granted, made fantastic when seen from the perspective of the Floorboard Folk.\nUnder The Floorboards comes with a set of locations designed to test the wits of your players and build epic stories on a tiny scale. Traverse the teetering spines and towering cliff-faces of The Library, where one wrong move could send you tumbling to your death on the hard floor below; sneak through the cramped tunnels behind the Skirting Board, where rats and spiders lurk in dark corners waiting to pounce; or brave the ashen coals of the Fireplace, with no way of knowing when they might erupt into flame once more.\nThe game comes with ten Locations within the house of the giants, and stretch goals will help unlock a set of six new dangerous spaces outside in The Garden.\n\u00a31500 - Six New Locations\nThis goal has been reached, adding 6 Locations over 12 pages to the zine! \nSome of the new locations are:\n The Bird House: A wooden bird house and bath in the middle of the garden. It's high and it's exposed, and birds come at go at regular intervals - birds who would love a tiny person as a snack. \n The Bone Yard: A burial ground at the back of the garden for the snacks and toys of the dog the giants keep in the house. Something has been taken from you and buried here. Do you dare retrieve it?\n The Bramble: Beneath the hedges is a tangle of piercing thorns and choking weeds, where danger is hidden until it is right on top of you. But the giants drop things, and they often end up here. Does the risk outweigh the reward?\n\u00a32000 - Thicker Paper\nThis goal has been reached, upgrading the zine to gorgeous natural paper throughout!\nRather than 120gsm silk, the interior pages will be printed on 160gsm natural paper for a classier, more satisfying finish.\n\u00a33000 - More Art\nWe'll add more interior artwork to the zine. Most of this will be added to the Location pages.\nChris Bissette (Twitter: @pangalactic) is an ENnie-nominated TTRPG designer and musician from Manchester, UK. He has been playing RPGs and story games almost as long as he has been reading and is passionate about shared storytelling and building weird, surreal worlds.\nHe is best known for his blog Loot The Room.

All the writing is already complete and the zine is in layout, with test prints ordered. \nAssuming stretch goals are met, all that remains to be done are the final pieces of art.

Brand new content has been long in coming, but it\u2019s finally time to unlock the remaining quantities of 1st Edition boxes alongside the release of our biggest Hyborian Age expansion ever.\nThose who wish to wet their swords for the first time and veterans from previous campaigns shall join ranks and heed the call of Conan the Conqueror!\nNot only is the Adventure Mode (our original one vs many system) gameplay you know and love making its return, but we\u2019re also adding a revised version of the solo/co-op rules featured in the Conan Monolith Sourcebook. Regardless of which version of Conan you own, or plan to purchase, all of the new content will pair perfectly with what you have.\nTo celebrate its 5th Anniversary, we are making the Conan: The Boardgame, the 2015 classic 1st Edition available again in limited quantities. Combined with the new mega-Conqueror expansion you\u2019ll be able to enter the savage worlds and raise your own bloodied sword. \nThis new expansion will boost options for ALL owners of the Conan Board Game. To play all of these new scenarios, you require only the core version of the game; however, King Pledge and Barbarian Pledge owners will find further options in some of the included scenarios.\nAll of these scenarios will be presented in the Tome of Skelos: a 60+ page hardcover book in the style of our previous titles. Inside, you will find 6 brand new scenarios for the original Conan Adventure mode (one vs many mode) that make use of all the new miniatures, maps and tiles. We will add a seventh scenario if its Stretch Goal is unlocked.\nWe\u2019ve also included an updated version of the solo/co-op rules that debuted in the Conan Monolith Sourcebook as well as a campaign of 7 specially designed solo co-op scenarios, where players will choose their heroes, gather equipment, and gain powerful Boons to complete their escape across the Pictish Wilderness. The Version 1 rules can be found below as well as a description of the gameplay. The Tome will also feature brand new artwork created for this campaign.\nIf you are using Internet Explorer or Safari and you can not see the following animated images, please click here. \nSolo/cooperative rules allow players to play through specially designed scenarios that eliminate the role of the Overlord. Instead, the players themselves will control the Overlord\u2019s tiles and miniatures.\nClick the download link below for a look at these rules. Note these are the V1 rules and are provided courtesy of Modiphius. Our rules will be laid out in our own style and there will be minor updates to the system. These changes, as well as a closer look at the solo/co-op system, will be explained in a forthcoming KS update. \n\nThe pirates of the Red Brotherhood have spread out from the Baracha Isles and haunt every shore of the Western Sea. It is said they have even raised sail on the inland waters of the Vilayet. This organization, composed mainly of Argosseans, maintains a notorious rivalry with the Zingaran Freebooters, and their bloody feuds have turned the tides a deeper shade of crimson. \nThese are tales of high seas and high adventure. These are the tales of the Red Brotherhood.\nFred Henry is returning to the design table and cooking up four new Adventure Mode scenarios. These exciting adventures make use of the brand new double-sided pirate ship game boards and only require the core/retail version of Conan AND the all-new contents featured in the Conan the Conqueror expansion.\nIf you are using Internet Explorer or Safari and you can not see the following animated image, please click here.\n A Hero steps from the mists of time to aid King Conan against an invisible threat. But behind this man stalks a threat older than the Earth itself.\nIf you are using Internet Explorer or Safari and you can not see the following animated images, please click here.\n\nThe Hidden chambers expansion offers 4 mini maps that represent secret rooms. Once you find the door and pick its lock, you may enter the gloomy depths to find treasures, special items, or\u2014perhaps\u2014death. These Chamber Boards are set alongside the main game board, denoting a separate floor or level rather than altering an existing room. \nDepths of the Lost Citadel\nAs well as offering brand new options for scenario designers, The Hidden Chambers Map Expansion also comes with its own special solo/co-op scenario AND an Adventure Mode scenario for the new Citadel map\u2014\u201cIn the Depths of the Lost Citadel\u201d. These scenarios require the core/retail version of Conan (or King or Barbarian pledge) and the new Conqueror expansion.\nPlayers will assume the roles of hired swords with a mission: enter the lost citadel of an ancient sorcerer and steal a fabled artefact. To manage this dangerous feat, they must avoid traps, uncover secret doors, and battle the unspeakable horrors lurking beneath. And even if they manage all this, it is unlikely the sorcerer will let them leave with their lives.\nFor solo/co-op mode, this expansion will allow players to add an optional scenario to the campaign offered in the Tome of Skelos.\nDuring the feasting of swords, it's not always convenient to pass the dice to your friend, or  even worse--your enemy! Many have asked, so we're offering a comfort dice pack as an add-on. Happy slaying! \nThis Kickstarter offers you the opportunity to pick up a great modern classic, OR if you already have it, then just the latest action-packed mega-expansion: Conan the Conqueror.\nClick on the picture for a complete overview of the 2015 Retail Box\nClick on the picture for a complete overview of the 2015 Barbarian Pledge\nClick on the picture for a complete overview of the 2015 King Pledge\nThe game boxes in the Hyborian Conqueror pledge levels are French versions; however, we are producing an English language localization pack that will be included with your pledge if your delivery address is outside of France.\nThere is also a very small percent chance of being sent a French version of the Barbarian box and King box included in the Barbarian Conqueror and King Conqueror pledge levels.\nAny pledge with a delivery address outside of France WILL receive the English language localization pack\nThe English language localization pack will contain:\nEnglish language versions of all the French tiles, cards and rulebooks that are included in the King box.\nThe English language localization pack will ONLY be included in those pledges with a shipping address outside of France\nSo, if you pledge for the Hyborian Conqueror level or the Barbarian Conqueror level, you will receive  the paper-only proxy Upgrade to King Pack (ENLLP.)\nBased on a survey on our Facebook page 68% of respondents wanted these proposed SGs and 32% did not, so we have decided to offer these SG\u2019s in a way that considers everyone. As some of our previous backers already own these miniatures from Mythic Battles, we will make the miniatures optional but will add the activation tiles to every Conqueror box, so everyone will have the game play necessities.\nIf you want the miniatures, during the pledge manager you just have to select/add the ones you want and they will be added, for free, to your order. We cannot, however, send these later to backers who forget or neglect to select them as part of their order during the pledge manager. This is a backer responsibility.\nIn interest of being completely transparent, the shipping prices for those who decide to take these free minis versus those who don\u2019t may differ slightly. We do not expect any dramatic increases in shipping fees based on these Stretch Goals, but again, we believe this way is fair for all.\nThese stretch goals will only be a free option for those who pledge DURING the campaign (any pledge level other than the \u201cpledge without a reward level\u201d). Those who wait until the campaign is over and jump in for a late pledge will have the opportunity to purchase them during the pledge manager.\nFinally, because we wanted to make sure ALL our fans got something out of these Stretch Goals, we have dug deep and if we reach our goal, we will offer an additional Adventure Mode scenario on top of those offered in the Conqueror pledge, raising the total of AM scenarios to 7!\n\nDuring the Pledge Manager we will offer what remains of our existing Conan board game stock. All of this material will be limited quantities and dependent on what remains at the hubs. Quantities will be marked and will reflect changes as items are chosen by others. We will provide an update with more specifics prior to the launch of the pledge manager as we don\u2019t yet have all of the accurate information we need. \nPlease note we cannot ship any items or pledge levels containing items from previous Conan Kickstarter campaigns to the following destinations: Brazil, Oceania, Mexico and Asia. These items only ship to Europe and North America. The availability of these items is based on existing stock that's already at the hubs. We are hopeful that after this campaign we will be able to offer reprints for most of these older items world-wide during a follow-up campaign. We will discuss our ideas for this soon.\nConan is a miniature-based board game that pits 1 to 4 players representing Conan and his fellow rogues against another more nefarious player\u2014the Overlord. Like any good villain, the Overlord controls hordes of savage tribesmen, beasts, and soldiers from an age undreamed of.\nThe gameplay is asymmetrical. The Overlord commands a massive horde of monsters and villains, as he strives to meet his objectives. On the other side are the heroes, each controlled by a player in a more first-person fashion, giving the game an RPG feel.\nEach scenario can be played out in approximately one hour and takes place on one of several beautiful game boards. Regardless of which role you play, you must stake your wits, mettle and martial prowess against your opponent.\n Gaming Rules superb rules breakdown video: \n Latest Rulebook\nHeroes\u2019 rulebook\nOverlord\u2019s rulebook\nFRANCAIS \nR\u00e8gles des H\u00e9ros\n R\u00e8gles de l\u2019Overlord \nThe new Adventure Mode scenarios featured in the Conan the Conqueror expansion are inspired by Robert E. Howard\u2019s only Conan novel\u2014The Hour of the Dragon\u2014as well as other Howard classics and the wild speculations of our lotus-maddened designers. In any case, the flavor of high adventure will be stinging like wine on your palate!\n Three years ago, based on popular demand, Matt John wrote a brand new mode for the Conan Monolith Sourcebook based on the existing Conan board game system, where the Overlord\u2019s role is dictated by these new rules and the special rules of a given scenario (Note that Solo/Co-op scenarios are ONLY playable using the Solo/Coop rules; Adventure Mode scenarios CANNOT be played with the Solo/Coop rules). \nIn this mode, the Hero gameplay remains the same, but the Overlord is given commands based on activation tokens and the special rules of the scenario. Some scenarios even flip the script entirely, presenting their own unique mini games. Overall, the gameplay is at once familiar and different, but nonetheless challenging.\nBest enjoyed as a campaign, all of these brand new scenarios see players choosing Heroes,  collecting gear, spells, and even improving their characters with \u2018Boons\u2019.\nAs the story goes, your captain has lost his mind and your ship has burned down to a blackened husk. Your only hope at survival is to travel east from the coast and into the depths of the Pictish Wilderness. And that\u2019s not much of a hope at all, now, is it? Will you face the green hell alone, or bring up to three friends along with you?\nIt\u2019s time to join the thriving player community centered around the Overlord forums for an ever-expanding library of content: 100\u2019s of scenarios, painting articles, gaming aids \u2013 a vast collection of fun and adventure for this popular board game.\nThe Overlord EN\nThe Overlord FR\n Free - Scenario creation tool \nOur amazing website \u2013 full to the brim with Conan goodness\n On top of the people from Monolith, a huge team of passionate professionals have worked on Conan.

Recently they were able to hold a vote to decide on the formation of this union, and while we will not know the results of that vote for some time, I still stand in support of those workers and recognizing KSRU. \nIn compliance with the discussions they've been having with senior leadership their social media has gone dark, but you can still find out more at their website.\nHi! I'm Kales! I write games under the name A. Fell, and I publish them as Paradoxical Press! This game is built on the back of a story I have been telling, over and over again, with two dear friends of mine over the last two years. It's truly the result of a labor of love, and I'm so excited to turn it into something real and tangible you can hold in your hands and share with your friends, much like the tokens in the game proper.\nMemoria is a game telling sprawling character histories over long periods of time. Inspired by such games as Microscope by Ben Robbins and Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands by D. Vincent Baker, it tells the kinds of stories I like to tell best-- jumping around through time, dealing with the ever evolving relationships between characters and only as much politics as you want to exist, with a very freeform structure to scenes themselves. It is a game that explicitly and deliberately refuses to engage with major character death as a source of angst within the story itself. Yes, the game can take place over centuries; no, you don't have to explain how if you don't want to. The point is the characters.\nThe intro to gameplay, featuring one of the art pieces done by Serj.\nThe game uses small remnants of memory at its foundation-- tokens and echoes. Tokens are tangible-- gifts, letters, random knick-knacks, even scars and tattoos. Echoes are less tangible, more sense memory than anything else, but they carry the same weight. You call tokens and echoes in scenes shared with other characters as well as solitary moments you narrate alone. You can move in and out of scenes as your  characters or as the rest of the world, building an epic history of friends to enemies back to friends to lovers-- just as an example-- as the world shifts and pivots around you.\nCurrently, you can find Memoria on Itch as a digital-only download; however for the purposes of Zinequest I'll be offering the PDF only at half its usual price and producing a 5.5x8.5 (roughly A5 size) zine so you, too, can hold this game in your hands! They'll be printed and bound by me (time to flex the bookbinding skills I learned working in the library in college) and should hopefully be shipped by June, if not earlier.\nThe zine features beautifully done art by Lu which will span the entire front and back cover, inset pieces by Serj, and a gorgeous piece of art by Sam (which you can see a snippet of in the header for this project.) \nAt the $15 tier, you can get the zine as well as a PDF of the game, which will have the new cover art and some interior layout tweaks. (If you already own the PDF, never fear-- the updated PDF will become available on the Itch page when the updated PDF goes out to backers, and you can always get the physical version only for $12.)\nFor $20, you can donate a physical copy to someone who might not be able to afford it. (Those will be available on a first-come first-serve basis, and will cost nothing on your end.) For every additional $10 over the base tier you pledge I'll add another physical copy to the pool (so a $40 pledge will donate three copies).\nIf you're international and outside one of the countries listed, message me! I will work something out with you as much as I can.\nThe budget may look a little small, but that's because I laid out the game myself and made some art happen already. Here is a breakdown of where the money is going:\n $100 for the new cover art, done by the lovely Lu, and other small pieces of art, including the header image which was done by Sam! \n $50 for the art in the game already, done by Sam and Serj, as royalties for the work they did to help make this book beautiful.\n $150 for the printing, binding, and shipping, which I will be doing all myself (not using a third-party printer or fulfillment service).\n $50 compensation for myself.\n $50 for Kickstarter fees.\nand $50 as a buffer.\nWe're fully funded! That's incredible! Let's talk about stretch goals!\nYou might be saying to yourself: Memoria exists as a game already! What more could we want! If you were following me during the several months or so I was writing this  game, you'll remember I was talking about a supplemental, featuring scene frameworks and potential dynamic seeds to serve as a jumping off point for players. One of those scene frameworks made it to Itch (a dance, a duel, which you can download right now for PWYW.) \nI've always been planning on writing it, but it would be really, really neat to be able to print it as well. If we can reach $800 I'll release the supplemental, containing Firebrands-style scene frameworks, character dynamic seeds, and an additional variant (or perhaps two) as a PDF bonus to all backers. That money will go towards paying for the writing and layout of the supplemental, which I estimate will be at least another eight to ten pages of content.\nBut you all are here for physical zines. So here's my promise. If we can reach $1000, I'll be able to print and bind the supplemental for all physical backers. It's a bit of a hefty goal, but it'll cover the costs of printing and shipping the additional weight.\nIf the project funds but a stretch goal is not reached, any extra funds will go towards the following things:\nPaying my artists more for the work they've done.\nMy day-to-day work for bringing the game to you in its best state possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game is already fully written, apart from the supplemental, so the real risk here is with fulfillment being done on time. For the sake of transparency, I have projected fulfillment to be complete by June since I am planning to move states in April, and that will suck up a lot of the time I could be spending binding zines. I know myself well and I know I will want to get a head start on fulfillment sooner, but I have given myself wiggle room in case of unforeseen circumstances.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "My Undying Friendship", "descp": "Get updates on the project from me!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PDF Only", "descp": "Get the PDF version of the game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["118 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "I Already Bought The PDF!", "descp": "This is the print-only version of Memoria if you already bought the PDF.

They're all based off the same single-player system, which uses a deck of cards and a six-sided die to generate prompts for the player to expand on. \ncover art from Alone Among the Stars\nAlone Among the Stars is a solo adventuring game about exploring strange and fantastic planets and experiencing wondrous sights. I wrote it in the summer of 2018 while I was playing a lot of No Man's Sky really late at night. If you'd like to check it out before backing the zine, it's available for PWYW on my Itch.io page here. \npage 1 of my example playthrough of Alone Among the Stars\ncover art from Alone in the Ancient City\nAlone in the Ancient City was the first hack of AAtS that I wrote. It's about wandering through an old city with new eyes, and was inspired by trips to cities such as Venice and Montreal. If you'd like to check it out before backing this zine you can find the plaintext version on my Itch.io page here. \nAlone Among the Twisting Trees is a new game I'm writing for inclusion in this zine! It's about getting lost in a mysterious forest and the strange artifacts that you find inside. It was originally conceived through playstorming with Quinn Vega and Avi Margolis as an adaptation of another game I wrote, Alone on the Rocky Beach (not included in this zine).\nIn addition to these games, there are a ton of other hacks that have been inspired by Alone Among the Stars. If this zine doesn't stick out to you but you're still looking for a cool single-player experience, I'd recommend checking out the rest of these hacks! I've tried to compile all of them in this Itch collection, Alone at the Table. \nI think anyone can make a game, and hacking is a great way to get started. A number of the hacks in the Alone at the Table collection were made by first-time designers, and in order to make hacking the game even easier I'm including a template that you can fill in to make your own hack in the back of the zine, as well as a page or two of useful design tips to get you started. You could even use the journaling pages to start playtesting!\n\"In Alone in the Ancient City, designer Takuma Okada translates the melancholy, No Man\u2019s Sky-esque galaxy-wide wandering of Alone Among the Stars into a more humble joy, one of discovering a city on your own. Ancient City captures the feeling of traveling through a place with a history and weight belonging to others, but wholly unfamiliar to you. Okada eschews the oft-trod territory of metropolitan tourism and spectacle in the pursuit of a more intimate exploration.

It will include these three Alone games in a new layout by Quinn, a blank template of an Alone game with some pointers so you can make your own hack, and blank journaling pages in the back of the book so you can start writing right away. \nthe cover for the zine!\n The zine is 5.5\"x8.5\" and will be printed through Mixam. The cover will be color on 110 lb. paper with a matte finish, and the inside pages will be black and white on 80 lb paper. \nIn the spirit of Zinequest, I've tried to keep the budget low while paying collaborators fairly. The total comes out to $500 given a 50 print run. \n$225 for printing, shipping, and fulfillment: This should cover a 50 zine print run and shipping related costs for a mix of US and International orders. \n$75 for the cover art by Shannon: The art is already paid for and completed, but this covers the amount that I paid out of pocket for it already.\n$150 for layout by Quinn: This is a tentative layout budget for about 20 pages, some blank journaling pages, and a cover.\n$50 for fees: This is to cover Kickstarter fees!\nAs you may have noticed, I haven't really budgeted for paying myself. This is partially because I've already made some money off these games selling them on Itch.io, but it's also because I really want this project to fund and put it out in the world. If it funds over the goal, the first thing I'll be doing is paying myself and upping the print run to 100 copies. Beyond that I've been throwing around some ideas for stretch goals but haven't settled on anything yet, and I don't really want to assume a huge overshoot given the nature of Zinequest. If it looks like we will though, I may announce some extra goals on this page. \nHi! My name's Takuma Okada, and I'm a Japanese American writer, musician, and game designer.

The Queen is dead.\nOur Queen Crumbles is a collaborative storytelling game for 2-4 players about revenge, inevitable death, and saying goodbye to those you love. It is set in the weird-fantasy land of Halloway, where the dead whisper to those who listen and the fundamental forces of nature can be bent to your will. The game is meant to be played in a single sitting, and is focused on developing interesting and dynamic characters over the course of a few hours\u2014no matter your roleplaying experience.\nYou will take on the role of The Knight of Whispers, The Gravity Witch, The Hangman Golem, and The Bloody Historian, the four most loyal retainers of a once great Queen. Go on an epic fantasy road trip as you pursue the Queen\u2019s killer to the Tree Under the Mountain, and use what time you have left to say farewell.\nThe Gravity Witch\nThe Queen of Halloway was once revered and feared in equal measure. She ruled over a vast and wild land at the edge of the world, home to human, fey, and magickal creature alike. The land itself defied all taming\u2014deserts bloomed with crystalline roses, boiling rivers ran through the forests, and towering prisms gathered on the plains like the eggs of some great beast\u2014yet still the people of Halloway made their own place there.\nOn the far coast, the Lonely City presided over the Queendom. It was here that the Queen held court, brokering peace and passing judgement as she saw fit. She felt safe behind impenetrable stone walls, guarded by her army of living statues. \nThen the Assassin came, and the Queen's peace was shattered. By the time the Queen's retainers arrived, she lay dead in a crimson pool at the foot of her throne.\nThe Queen's closest friend, the Gravity Witch, moved first. She gathered from the throne room a pile of broken statue shards. With quick motions and practiced sounds she spun the fundamental forces around her will, and formed from the shattered stone an amalgam body from the disparate parts. And with a groan, she threw gravity into chaos, and drew the soul of the dead Queen back from wherever it meant to go\u2014into the amalgam body.\nYet this is only a temporary solution. The reforged statue is not fit to hold a human soul for long. She will soon crumble.\nThere is, therefore, only one thing remaining to the Queen: Revenge.\nThe Hangman Golem\nOur Queen Crumbles uses a new GM-less storytelling system centered on progressive character revelation\u2014though you start the game with only a vague idea of who your characters are, each scene lets you dive into their history and personality a bit more. Players build scenes around a collection of character traits and story elements, allowing you to do on-the-fly worldbuilding alongside your friends.\nEach player will choose a playbook from the available character archetypes, The Knight of Whispers, The Gravity Witch, The Hangman Golem, and The Bloody Historian. The players will also share two table playbooks, The Queen, and The Assassin. Playbooks contain an assortment of character traits, items, and abilities for the players to choose from as they travel on their journey. Instead of character advancement that makes you more powerful, Our Queen Crumbles features character advancement that makes you more interesting\u2014every box you mark on your sheet drives the story forward, giving you a better picture of the character you play.\nCharacter Sheet Mockup\nWho is the Little Stone God? Why does the Knight of Whispers carry the Salt and Iron crowns? What is the Tree Under the Mountain? Only you can decide.\nThe game trusts players to come up with conflict, intrigue, and answers to the questions they have.\nOur Queen Crumbles is a supremely hackable system, and I already have plans for additions to the zine. Backers who support the game at the Gilded Vessel tier will get to come up with their own character archetypes, which I will turn into additional character sheets. These sheets will be collected and released to all backers as the Our Queen Crumbles: Retainers expansion.\nThe zine will be a 24-page printed booklet with a beautiful two-color cover illustrated and designed by Lonely Egg Studio. Internal illustrations by Al Lukehart will show off the fantastical setting throughout the text. The zine will contain everything you need to play a game of Our Queen Crumbles in a single sitting, including character sheets for each of the 4 playable characters, rules for setting scenes along your journey, and a map of Halloway depicting the path from the Lonely City to the Tree Under the Mountain.\nZine Mockup\n Crumbling Vessel ($5) - The complete digital collection of Our Queen Crumbles. This tier will get you everything you need to play the game, along with the Retainers expansion.\n Cracked Vessel ($10) - The physical version of Our Queen Crumbles. This tier will get you the beautiful zine, as well as the complete digital collection.\n Pristine Vessel ($20) - The signed physical version of Our Queen Crumbles, plus some extra physical goodies. This tier will get you the zine, pre-printed character sheets for your first game, and a stack of my postcard-sized hack of Our Queen Crumbles, The Golems of Claypit.\n Gilded Vessel ($60) - The storyteller's version of Our Queen Crumbles. Along with all the physical and digital rewards, I will create a custom character sheet for an archetype chosen by you. These character sheets will be compiled into Our Queen Crumbles' first expansion, Retainers, and you will be credited as the creator of your character.\nOur Queen Crumbles was originally written in June of 2019 for the annual Game Chef RPG competition, and was one of the five English-language finalists.  I received some really encouraging feedback during the jam, and decided to refine the game and bring it to print as my first fully produced RPG.\nIn October 2019, I co-wrote a party-game hack of Our Queen Crumbles with Adam Vass, which we called The Golems of Claypit. The \"Golem Game\", as it came to be known, was a hit at Big Bad Con 2019 in Walnut Creek, CA. I got to play the game with a lot of my favorite RPG designers, and I was convinced that the system of character development was really fun to engage with.\nBy early January I had assembled a crack team of creatives to make this zine a reality, including Adam, Al Lukehart, Jessica Fong, and Sal V Cloak. Budgets were drafted, art was drawn, and marketing was dumped everywhere I could find.\nThe next chapter of this game's history is up to you.\nThe Bloody Historian\nJason Brown (he/him) is the lead designer for Our Queen Crumbles, and is solely to blame for the strange things hidden inside this zine. Beside writing games, Jason writes about games as the Indie RPG journalist for the Ennie-nominated blog Cannibal Halfling Gaming. Follow his game design and journalism here.\nAdam Vass (he/him) is the production consultant and graphic designer for Our Queen Crumbles, as well as the co-designer of The Golems of Claypit. He has created many small-press RPG's as World Champ Game Co, including last year's amazing Zinequest project: Tome & Wish You Were Here. He is also currently running his own Kickstarter for Cobwebs, a neo-noir RPG.  Follow him here.\nAl Lukehart (they/them) is the lead illustrator for Our Queen Crumbles. They have done art for such illustrious RPG's as: Ben Robbins' Follow, Justin Ford's Saviors of Hogtown, and Eli Kurtz's Errant Deeds: Tall Tales in the Blackwood. They are also getting ready to release a serial webcomic, PARSLEY, later this year. Check out their work here.\nLonely Egg Studio is the cover illustrator and designer for Our Queen Crumbles. Jessica Fong is the illustrator responsible for the amazing cover art, and Sal V Cloak was in charge of the graphic design and textual elements. They are also in the process of developing a surreal adventure video game called In the Keeper's Shadow, as well as running their own Zinequest Kickstarter for Invoccultas.\nThe Our Queen Crumbles team stands with Kickstarter United OPEIU 153.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks to Our Queen Crumbles are delays associated with my lack of experience publishing physical versions of my games\u2014namely printing and shipping.

This roughly 32 page A5 zine has everything you need to generate natural formations, forgotten ruins, enemies, wyrd magics, and ancient monstrosities. It has a simple turn-based combat system, rules for building your hold, and tips on how to implement your hold into your RPG world.\nInspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, DELVE aims to capture that feeling of building and protecting a fortress in an unforgiving subterranean world.\nAll you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1\" grid), and a deck of playing cards. \nThe Under-King has put out a bounty to all the holds demanding a Void Crystal, a rare and powerful gem found only in the deepest caverns. \nEach round your dwarves will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts \u2665 and Diamonds \u2666 are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units while Clubs \u2663 and Spades \u2660 are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From ancient libraries to goblin lairs, these subterranean locales will become part of your hold's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you might just unleash a horde of ravenous insects in which case, you'll need to fight.\nCombat in DELVE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking without weighing you down with book-keeping. Essentially, all enemies follow the same goal of trying to reach the surface by killing their way through your hold. They can move one grid space per turn, as can all of your units. Once they get into combat, check the rock-paper-scissors style chart to see which group has the advantage and reduce each side by the STR of the other. \nOnce combat is over, it's time to build! As long as a room has access to the hold via a mineshaft or another room, it's good to go. Just pay the cost, and draw it in an available grid (empty or repurpose an old \u2663 or \u2660 grid space). At this stage, you'll also have the opportunity to build traps, reinforce, and hire units to defend your hold.\nJust, be careful as you get deeper though as the black joker is waiting. Drawing this card releases an ancient monstrosity, a randomly generated beast that needs a well stocked army and hold to defeat. \nThe Story of Blood Fate Hold\nThe hold was off to a rough start as their chosen site led straight into the lair of the mud goblin clan, Rushk. The initial group of soldiers sent with the expedition where wiped out in this surprise attack.\nDeciding that bad luck doesn't just strike once, they built a spike wall to defend their stairwell. A good choice as the next pick strike revealed a hive of cave wasps. Some miners perished but the overzealous wasps dashed themselves upon the spike wall.\nFinally, Blood Fate was started, a barracks built just beyond the hive. It's honey would sustain the expedition and our new soldiers would have somewhere to stay while the miners delved deeper.\nA string of good luck found trade goods and resources by the plenty and so they built a stewpot kitchen to hearten the fighting spirits of the soldiers, a shrine to bless their good luck, and finally, a stairwell to descend deeper.\nThe old adage of \"fool me once\" had become mantra for Blood Fate as they focused their efforts on defence. Rock fall traps on the stairwell, and a dead dwarf alarm that would warn of any approaching threat.\nTheir militaristic efforts where rewarded as after ignoring a buried temple (who knows what god it was built to), they broke through to a structure. A cavernous mansion filled with chandeliers, suits of armour, and a blood stained altar. A vampire queen's coterie. Her thralls poured from the shadows, overwhelming the miners and marching through the hold at their dark mistresses behest.\nThe boulder trap dashed the first zealous few on the stairs, weakening their numbers. The stew heartened soldiers fought bravely, managing to strike down all but one. The vampire queen herself. One soldier swore an oath to the gods and launched himself in a frenzy of spinning axes, injuring her before having his head torn from his shoulders. His sacrifice was not in vain however as his bravery bought the reinforcements called by the dead dwarf alarm time to arrive. \nBlood Fate Hold reeks of death and garlic, they say a fool is someone who doesn't learn from past mistakes and these dwarves are no fools. Every room is decorated in holy symbols to gods old and new and once a year the dwarves let blood in a rememberance ritual called Vampik.\nUNCOVERED - For passing \u00a31200 I'll pay an artist to make a better quality cover for DELVE.

Players generate character through a simple yet diverse lifepath-style character creation system, at each stage learning more about the infinite Loom they inhabit. Before long, they'll be undertaking mythic and perilous journeys through a decaying, waning universe of fading Gods, strange realities, and the dizzying remains of strange and wondrous civilizations.\nWhat's in this Book?\nUNCONQUERED will feature art by Peter Violini!\nThe UNCONQUERED book will contain the core rules for the UNCONQUERED RPG; full character creation tables with over 100 unique randomly-generated or selected options to create fully-developed, unique and interesting characters; tips for running a great game of UNCONQUERED; dozens of charts and tables of esoterica and miscellanea to develop a living, breathing, infinite Loom; and a setting guide, bestiary and starting adventure for the Jewelled Sands Of Zun R\u00fct, an introductory Sphere to allow new players the opportunity to play immediately . \nCreating an UNCONQUERED Character\nCharacter creation in UNCONQUERED can be as complex as a tree of choices or as simple as rolling 10d6 in order.\nUNCONQUERED character creation follows a lifepath system, whereby players will generate their characters randomly or through selection of several stages of development: where they were born, their culture and social strata, the omens of their birth, a brief story of their life thus far, their occupation, and a significant event that set them on the path of adventuring.\nBirthplace examples from just one of many Spheres.\nEach d6 list reveals a little more about the characters, allowing players and GMs to procedurally generate or carefully create unique and varied characters in only a few minutes. Each choice made or rolled bursts with the suggestion of a vast, living Loom and hints at how characters might inhabit it and move through it.\nExamples of cultural backgrounds and social strata.\nEach step gives the players  role-playing prompts, mementos of home, and cultural attire and armaments that combine to create fully developed, unique characters. These character creation rules are an excellent way for a Chronicler to generate quick and easy NPCs to further populate your games!\nExamples of playable lineages.\nExamples of personalized mementos.\nOccupation tables for potential adventurers.\nIndividual-Based Experience\nCharacters in UNCONQUERED don't earn experience and progress themselves in the traditional, \"kill monsters, acquire gold\" manner - players generate or choose pairs of XP triggers that match and develop aspects of their personalities, based on birth omens and the stories of their lives thus far.\nBirth omens and associated XP triggers.\nA Rules-Light Framework\nUNCONQUERED uses a flexible, rules-light mechanical toolkit that allows the action, intrigue and adventure to keep flowing without needing to constantly check the rulebook! Based on the KNAVE toolkit by Ben Milton, UNCONQUERED allows for a depth of customization and personalization for long-time TTRPG veterans and is intuitive and easy for first-time players. UNCONQUERED is also fully compatible with the toolkits and bestiaries of other OSR games such as KNAVE, Maze Rats, Basic Fantasy RPG, B/X, or AD&D/OD&D.\nA rules-lite system that is easy to pick up on.\nA Million, Million Spheres\n The UNCONQUERED book will feature all manner of tables, charts and passages of history, myth, rumor and lore to help players and Chroniclers develop their own versions of the infinite Loom and the million million Spheres within. A universe rich with culture and flavor awaits exploring!\nDozens of tables and charts to develop your own infinite Loom.\nThe Chronicler's Handbook\n A section of the UNCONQUERED book is dedicated to GM tips for new and experienced Chroniclers alike to help run the best adventures for you and your friends. Tools from the TTRPG Safety Toolkit by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk are included to assist players and Chroniclers on techniques to build effective communication and trust at the table, ensuring everyone is having fun, is comfortable, and feels safe.\nChronicler goals from the Chronicler's Handbook section.\nWho are We?\nMonkey's Paw Games is an independent tabletop role-playing game publisher based out of Montreal, Canada.\nUNCONQUERED is written by Nicholas Masyk, along with the help of a hand-picked cast of amazing writers, designers, illustrators, editors, and consultants.\nLogo courtesy of Highland Paranormal Society\nWhat is SWORDDREAM?\n *DREAM stands against hate & prejudice in all forms.

It is a one-shot, rules-light game, focusing on collaborative and thematic storytelling and is designed to be flexible in how you bring it to the table:\nAn epilogue for any fantasy game following character death - especially a TPK!\nA world-building prologue for any game needing a haunted forest or other cursed place. \nA stand-alone game exploring themes of dark fantasy and supernatural horror - with a glimmering of hope and redemption. \n(Test print. Dice, adventuring equipment and escape from the forest not included).\n Candlelight is a game for 1 or more players and a GM. Character creation is simple, taking place as part of the game introduction. The game uses six-sided dice of 2 colors (light and dark) and each session runs approximately 3-4 hours. While the game is based on dark fantasy and horror themes, conversations about player expectations and the use of safety tools are encouraged to best fit the tone of game you want at the table. Ghost stories can be bleak, dreadful, terrifying - but also reflective, inspiring and even hopeful. The paths you choose through the forest are up to you and your group.\nCandlelight is Rooted in Trophy, using the core system of Trophy Dark to tell as story of desperate characters pushing their luck in a place that constantly threatens to overwhelm them. The key difference here is that the characters have already met their doom - while Trophy Dark progresses through a series of Rings and escalating horror, Candlelight starts at that final Ring where the characters have just died. It is at the dark heart of the forest that they will begin their journey, retracing the steps they took while living, seeking hope and an escape from the forest before they become a monstrosity that haunts it forever.\nTo explore a wide range of fantasy-horror stories, Candlelight is compatible with any of the incursions (scenarios) from Trophy Dark. Detailed instructions are included for adapting your favorite Trophy Dark incursion for Candlelight, and any character creation options from Trophy are easily transferrable to Candlelight.\nThe following are some of the core mechanics adapted from Trophy Dark:\n Occupations are now Memories, skills or significant experiences from your life.\nYour Doom is similar to a Background (an insight gained from the way you died).\n Rituals are now Dirges, terrible outpourings of anguish and dread that have the power to alter the physical world around the spirits.\n Risk Rolls work much the same, although spirits are much weaker without their physical bodies...\n Ruin Rolls are called Reckonings and work similarly - occasionally used as flashbacks to learn what occurred during the failed incursion of the treasure hunters.\n Devil\u2019s Bargains are now Desperate Prayers, offered to the darkness without knowing what ancient entities of the forest may answer - or what the cost of drawing their attention might be.\n Hope and Despair are elements adapted from Quietus, with Despair replacing Ruin, and Hope offering a glimpse at something like redemption. \n Reduction Rolls are called Haunts, which have a chance to lower your Despair. \n Conditions are called Manifestations which result from increases to either Hope or Despair.\nYou may have noticed the looming growth of the Trophy RPG on Kickstarter. Candlelight joins the scene as another way to explore this fantastic game. \nCandlelight is a complete, stand alone game which includes rules for play, tips for running the game and a series of tables to quickly add character creation and story options to your game with little preparation.\nSample layout and test print\nSample layout and test print\nSample layout and test print\nCandlelight will be printed in black and white at an estimated 32 pages. Successfully reached stretch goals will expand the page count. The zine will contain:\nRules for the game, a blank Character Sheet, tips for running the game including principles of play and safety tools.\nDetailed instructions for adapting Trophy Dark incursions for Candlelight.  \nExpanded tables for Dirges (Rituals), Drives of the spirit characters, options for your Doom (backgrounds), Memories (including extensive options related to relationships, identities and roles), Lures (story threads to draw the spirits out of the forest), Beliefs of the Afterlife and many more evocative elements to inspire your game. \nDesign and layout featuring the atmospheric textures of B. Zentz. \n Additional tables by guest authors (UNLOCKED!)\nGorgeous ink illustrations by Ezra Rose - with additional art (UNLOCKED!)\nStreamlined options for adapting characters from D&D and other games.\nAn introductory scenario for playing the game.\nart by Ezra Rose\nShipping - worldwide shipping is included in the cost of all physical pledges. As the printed zines will be under 3.5 oz shipping weight, they are considered letter-size for First-Class Mail International so this should be relatively straightforward.  \nA game of Candlelight begins with a brief introductory story created during a conversation between players and GM, outlining the recent events which led to the death of the treasure hunters. Each player then begins character creation by naming their character and establishing how they died (their Doom). Answering a few more prompts, they will list a few significant skills or occupations they had when alive (Memories) and what they hope to resolve by escaping the forest (Drive). As the game progresses, players will attempt to enact powerful changes on their environment by unleashing Dirges. They will face Reckonings when they come across something from their dark past, increasing their Hope or Despair as a result. Eventually one of these states will reach a tipping point and signal the epilogue for that character.\nCharacters are built in much the same way as Trophy Dark. While many terms have been adapted for a game of desperate spirits instead of living treasure hunters, Candlelight encourages you to use your favorite Rituals, Occupations, Backgrounds and Drives from any Trophy Dark incursion.  \n(Sample layout and character sheet)\nFUNDED! $1200 - The Awakening.

By focusing on the characters reckoning with events that have already happened, it enacts a story that goes beyond the story-focused questions of agency and narrative, and confronts what those actions mean in the context of a character\u2019s identity and the often-overlooked contradictions identity holds.  In a fun and engaging way, Candlelight reminds us that death is not the end of story; there is the question of what that story meant that remains to be explored.\"\n-Natalie Ash, Ember and Ash Games\n\"Such a thoughtful and emotionally evocative theme- by playing as ghosts, we get to be gently reminded of how very alive we are.\"\n-Skye Z.

You play as rotten bastards: corrupt politicians, decadent aristocrats, and other greedy elites. You are each determined to maximize your own wealth and comfort while your actions tear society apart around you. Eventually, society will tolerate your abuses no more. But the iron confidence that is your privileged birthright makes you certain you will avoid that doom. You'll do anything to make sure you get yours (and get away with it).\nOligarchy includes three incursions, storylines to follow as your rotten bastards careen toward a doom they think they'll avoid:\n Eye of a Needle (Theme: Collapse) They keep saying it's the End Times. That the Final Judgement hangs over all men's heads like Damocles' sword. Well, no Seven-Headed Dragon will keep you from fleecing the rubes as long as they let you. So what if the signs are becoming visible? They were always there if you had the eyes to see them.\n Sleep Furiously (Theme: Greed) The more you accumulate the better you feel. You are a dragon among your hoard. Extracting and exploiting free lands and free hands, doing what the Market demands. You love, no, you LIVE for that. Where there's demands you will find the supply. Anything is a commodity if you're flexible enough.\n Trail of Plenty (Theme: Promises) Elections are a hopeful time, and the fine wool of hope makes a fine blind over ones eyes. This campaign makes many promises as the dust chokes half the nation and the floodwaters rise. Each one is a mask over your scheming and disdain.\nDecadent Elites\nYou conduct your sordid business and pork-barrel legislation using the excellent framework provided by Trophy Dark, a tabletop roleplaying game system by Jesse Ross. The basics are simple: when you take a greedy action, state what you hope will happen and build a pool of light and dark dice based on fictional circumstances and what you're willing to risk. Roll and take the highest result to find out your fate. Did you get away with your exploit? Did you make things worse? Did the consequences of your actions bring you to Ruin? Play to find out.\nEverything you need to understand the core rules of the Trophy system is freely available in a System Reference Document. Click the image below or visit TrophyRPG.com to read them for yourself\nClick above to visit Trophy's website.\nTrophy is now on Kickstarter!\nThe Gauntlet is crowdfunding a series of Trophy books until February 23, 2020. By backing their campaign, you can explore the doomed world of this system across three volumes:\n Trophy Dark, a one-shot game of doomed treasure hunters and psychological horror, set in and around a vast, ancient, and accursed forest.\n Trophy Gold, a campaign game of old-school dungeon delving. Your treasure hunters are not doomed, but merely desperate.\n Trophy Loom, a system-agnostic setting book that guides you through the steps necessary to bring the bleak world of Trophy into awful life.\nClick here to visit the Trophy Kickstarter page to learn more about the dark tales you might tell with your play group.\nThe Campaign\nWe're on the campaign trail to build a constituency of backers to help us bring Oligarchy into its own awful life. The backer levels are simple:\n Electorate ($1+): You've given us the vote of your dollar, the only vote that matters. In exchange, you receive our thanks and nothing more.\n Digital Lobbyist ($10+): You've paid to play, and so you shall enjoy some basic fruits. You will receive our thanks and a PDF copy of the Oligarchy RPG zine. You will also receive a print-ready file you can send to any print shop to make your own physical copy.\n Print Lobbyist ($20+): You've made a substantial investment. You deserve a substantial kickback. In addition to the rewards of the Digital Lobbyist tier, you'll also receive a print copy of the Oligarchy RPG zine via standard mail.\n Esteemed Donor ($50+): Only the finest treatment is due to such a generous benefactor as you. You get everything from the Digital Lobbyist tier plus four print copies of the Oligarchy RPG zine via standard mail. Buy enough copies for everyone in your play group and save $30!\nThe end product is a half-letter size zine printed on multipurpose copy paper with a heavy card-stock cover. Filled with darkly beautiful engravings from the public domain, Oligarchy will leave a stain upon anyone's memory. \nCommunity Copies\nEvery person who backs our campaign at or above the Digital Lobbyist level creates one community copy that will be freely available on our Itch storefront when the game arrives there (estimated June 2020). Community copies help someone else grab a free copy if their budget doesn't enable them to pay the listed price. For this project, community copies on Itch will include a PDF copy of the game as well as the print-ready file.\nThe Ills of This World\nNo Stretch Goals?\nAs chief executives of this grand experiment, we the creators have legislated that all profits shall be shared between us.

How will you protect yourself and your friends?\nBarrow Keep is a low-prep, old-school setting driven by playbooks and adaptable, easy-to-run scenarios. You play the young residents of the Keep, coming of age while dealing with mysteries, treacheries, and intrigues.\nInspiration & Compatibility\nIn summer 2018, my friend Maria Rivera asked why there weren't any old-school style games for a Game of Thrones-style setting. This project owes a lot to Maria's initial question and her commitment as a reader and playtester. The original game we ran with several other friends was deeply inspired by Beyond the Wall from Flatland Games, TSR's Known World Gazeteer series, and Whitehack by Christian Mehrstam.\nAs the project has continued through several campaigns and one-shots, it's grown past its Ice & Fire roots and been inspired by a wide range of writers of gothic, young adult, historical, and romantic fantasy, including Ellen Kushner, N.K. Jemisin, V.E. Schwab, Lois McMaster Bujold, Tamora Pierce, and Mercedes Lackey.\nBarrow Keep is compatible with:\nOld School Essentials from Necrotic Gnome \nSharp Swords & Sinister Spells by Diogo Nogueira \nThanks to stretch goals, we'll also be releasing materials compatible with:\nBest Left Buried (Print, PDF) from SoulMuppet (See Questing Beast's review)\nTrophy Gold/Rooted in Trophy (Kickstarter, Twitter) from The Gauntlet \nThe Physical Zine\nThe 32-page zine includes:\nProcedures for making your own Barrow Keep, giving each player choices about the Keep's rulers, attendants, and mysteries\nGM advice and pointers focused on running the first session\nA tour of Barrow Keep's locations, factions, and arcane technologies\nA bestiary of the Keep's catacombs and the surrounding woods\nOSR-compatible character and magic options\nThe Barrow Keep: Den of Spies cover by Minerva Fox\nDigital Supplements\nAlong with the zine itself, everyone who backs Barrow Keep will get:\nSeven OSR-style playbooks compatible with Old School Essentials and other OSR systems, including The Hostage, The Spy, The Wielder, The Lost Familiar, The Revenant, and The Wolf\nSeven playbooks adapted for Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells, 2nd Edition \nTwo scenarios set in Barrow Keep: \"Treacherous Kin\" and \"The Changeling Spy,\" compatible with almost any OSR system\nHandouts for players and GMs\nWorksheets and a relationship map for creating your own custom version of Barrow Keep\nReserved PDFs, Watchful Advisers, and Knights Errant\nWe've set aside 25 copies of the PDF zine for $3 for backers who self-identify as students, members of marginalized communities, or experiencing financial hardship.

Some tried to stop it, but not enough did. The earth\u2019s systems broke down. The sun turned cities into kilns and the sea crept steadily inland. Millions of fish washed ashore, birds fell from the sky, and blight wiped out trees. Towering floods and withering droughts led to displacement and social collapse. Those who did the least to cause it suffered the most.\nWe only got one try \u2014 and we failed. \nLost Roads is a fantasy role playing game that follows migrants on their journey through a harsh, unforgiving world. Humans, once rich with magic and resources, exploited nature beyond its means. Modern society collapsed, falling to a pre-medieval level of technology. Pockets of civilization now huddle within barren and twisted landscapes, connected by the Lost Roads\u2014defunct, reclaimed pathways.\nThe player characters, driven out by climate disaster, travel the Lost Roads together in search of a place to call home. Each character has a role and an elemental domain\u2014earth, fire, water, or air. They can use their magic to enhance or pervert nature to reach their goal; but harming the environment empowers a malevolent, supernatural Storm.\nIf you survive the Lost Roads and reach the Borderlands, journey\u2019s end, you bring new hope. If you fail, humanity dries up and blows away like so much parched grain. You survive not just for yourself and those around you, but those who will come after. For without you, there are no roots from which a new society can flourish.\nThe game is designed for 2-5 players including a GM, and is inspired by The Road, A Quiet Place, Annihilation, Fast Color, and similar stories. It can be run as a one shot or a short campaign lasting 2-5 sessions.  \nLost Roads offers a new system to tell a unique tale of environmental trauma in a bygone, fantasy setting. This game is rooted in story-games of a similar tone, such as The Quiet Year, Versus Nature, Legacy Life Among the Ruins, and Downfall. Players can revel in rich, sensory narrative about their relationships, themselves, and the perilous world around them. But Lost Roads also draws inspiration from the stress and grit of mechanics that reward player ingenuity, character competency, and managing time and resources.\nThe system was built from the ground up to be highly modular. Play cycles fluidly through several phases with a push and pull between survival, sheltering, and moving on to new places.\nLost Roads uses an elegant D6 die pool system with varying degrees of success and failure, designed for exploring tense survival stories of eco-migrants and supernatural climate fiction. If you roll well, your Motif\u2014a magic symbol inspired by nature\u2014reveals hidden secrets.\n Download: A preview of how to make Survival Rolls.\nWhen characters take refuge, simple scene-by-turn rules allows them to steal a moment to share a meal, a story, a dream. Then go forth once more to see if you can edge closer towards finding a home. \nThe characters you play are the Tarnished\u2014eco-migrants on a dangerous journey after society\u2019s collapse. This marginalized group shares the gift of magic as it fades away. \u201cTarnished\u201d is the image your detractors see: the wear and tear on your body and clothing, viewing your capabilities negatively rather than cherishing them.            \nYou gather hope to use magic.\nEach character has a Role\u2014a character\u2019s walk of life. Each Role honors three vows, and fulfilling any of them increases Hope\u2014what characters need to use magic, to stand firm against the Storm, and increase the community's prosperity. The four roles are: \nHEART. You devote yourself to the survival of those who need it most. Defend the vulnerable. Heal the injured. Deliver goods. \nKEEPER. The wilds guide your spirit, you must let both flourish. Defend wild places. Clean polluted spaces. Find and restore carbon sinks. \nRECLAIMER. You discover hope amidst fallen ruins and discarded scrap. Scavenge wreck and ruin. Shore up structures. Find and mark renewable resources. \nSEEKER. You seek paths like a meandering river. Branching, flexible, determined. Overcome obstacles. Blaze a trail for others to follow. Find and mark hideaways. \nA practitioner of earth magic.\nEach character also chooses a Domain, a source of primeval magic which is fading from the world. Your domain influences what your magic does and how it manifests.\nEARTH. A duality of trembling and unyielding. You have power to phase through solid barriers and form protective fields.\nFIRE. An apparition of igniting and searing. You have power to emit a gush of flame or pass through fire unharmed.\nWATER. A source tidal and unfathomable. You have power to raise waves of water or summon water spirits.\nAIR. A shield, gusty and windswept. You have power to slash with wisps of wind or discharge electricity.    \nDownload: A preview of the Character Sheet, Seeker Role, and Earth Domain. \nHumanity is on a collision course with nature.\nThe Long Storm is a malevolent force of awesome, destructive power. A trembling vortex of metaphysical energy and dying magic. It embodies the decay of human society. You cannot defeat it. At best, you can only hide or escape from it.\nMistaken\u2014creatures of eco-horror\u2014are spawned in the eye of the Storm. These are chimeric horrors adapted to survive in extreme environments, hunting human prey.   \nA complete game features five core phases:\nIn Worldbuilding, create a fantastic world together with flow and balance between human and natural communities, science, and nature. You create four Landmarks that stand the test of time, and draw them on a map. Then, you choose the Decay\u2014a negative human trait such as ambition, greed, or wastefulness, that leads to environmental collapse.   \nA map of the arctic tundra from our session with Emily Care Boss and Dane Fogdall.\nThroughout a Traversal (scenario), you play in the wreckage that comes from balance lost, moving from one waypoint to the next by fulfilling the vows of your character. You weather the Storm and find help and hope in those around you, to seek possibilities of working with the world and each other, and risk losing it all.\nWhen you Face Your Fears, you confront the Storm on an epic scale. These are gripping scenes of bravery and tragedy, as the landscape and entire community struggles against the elements. If characters spend enough Hope, they can withstand the destruction, or rebuild afterwards.\nDuring the Hole Up phase you reach a landmark and the season draws to an end. Soak in community activity, human connection, relationships, and tending to the hurts of others. Let out the pain and grief people are bottling up\u2014the antidote to feeling powerless.    \nPlay thematic scenes together at various landmark locations.\nAt this point, you can end the game if you\u2019re playing a one-shot. Or, when you\u2019re ready, begin a new Traversal and keep playing until you complete four seasons.\nFinally, you reach Journey\u2019s End to determine the epilogue. The outcome depends on your community's prosperity. Rejoice and reflect upon your year of travel together, or witness the final lash of the Long Storm. \nThe zine will be a 60-page, 8 \u00bd x 5 \u00bd saddle-stitched booklet with a stunning sepia-colored cover image spanning both sides and interior pages printed in black ink.

Preview the journey ahead on their map.\nSession 1: Listen as they try to survive an unforgiving arctic landscape and regroup at an  ancient landmark made of dragon bones.\n\u201cLost Roads is a love letter to a world on the brink of ruin, bound up with hope and horror. Play to see what heroism looks like on the other side of disaster.\u201d \u2014Emily Care Boss\n\u201cLost Roads is a poignant game that manages to make a weighty topic both approachable and engaging. Characters can be powerful forces of hope and leadership, but the game asks you to make real choices and sacrifices to do so.\u201d \u2014Dane Fogdall\n\u201cLost Roads has been such a relevant experience for me. Playing the game helped me to combine my worries about the state of the world (global inequalities, climate crisis) with my enthusiasm of telling stories of hope, friendship, and trust.\u201d \u2014Gerrit Reininghaus\n\u201cLost Roads captures the fraught feelings of migrating away from home and allows players to share in the hope and adversity of the road.

Indeed, many of the tools provided would be useful in any RPG you think suitable for the weird world of proto-neolithic roleplay!\nOUTCASTS\nThe zine contains instructions for generating a band of pariahs - outcasts from mainstream human culture forced into the dangerous wilderness:\n Classless and level-less: develop characters through interaction with the environment, building alliances, developing skills and forging pacts with spirits.\n Lateral development: special curse templates that can lead your characters down unexpected paths including ghoul, jackalwere and blood-drinker... \n Troupe play: control multiple characters, share them until they have grown into themselves, guide them as though you were their ancestral spirits.\n Build a community: foster young charges, care for the old, build the skill base of your pariah band, the better to face the challenges ahead.\n Die: lay down your lie for the good of your allies, knowing that your spirit can assist the fledgling band from the beyond!\nANIMISTS\nEverything is alive: navigate a world where mountains, rivers, trees and even insects possess their own desires and ambitions!\nRules for generating spirits and determining their attitude to the PCs.\nAn original magic system based on conjuring, binding and bargaining with spirits.\nPSYCHEDELIC   \nThis is a time of chaos: rationality has yet to force reality into a fixed form, and the boundaries between the corporeal and ethereal fluctuate...\nSix psychedelic entheogens with unique properties!\nTravel to the spirit world and find the true name of your enemies.\nCreate your own rituals, customs and traditions from afresh: this is a young world, and your characters are defining a new culture!\nSorcerer's Sage: smoke it, speak with the dead.\nNEOLITHIC\nThe PCs begin in the wilderness, but already humans have begun to build the first cities: what are they doing their, and what force guides their hands?\nGenerate thriving, complex neolithic societies to navigate... or avoid!\nTables and generators for technological development and cultural advancement.\nOLD SCHOOL\n Emphasis on player skill over character skill: play as the characters' guardian spirits,  not as the characters themselves.\n Highly lethal: get them out of danger quickly or be prepared to roll up another one.\n Sandbox style play: GMs are encouraged to create situations and challenges, not linear plots. Let the world come alive and happen around the PCs, with or without their participation!\n Rulings not rule: Take your pick of the guidelines within the zine, and fashion them to the tastes of your table. Use the tools for generating a world and populating it with danger and intrigue without being bound by mechanics.\n Familiar: Uses the traditional six ability scores and five saves so easy to pick up and easy to adapt to other old school systems.\nILLUSTRATION\nDiagrams and illustrations throughout by Sofinho and Hoang Minh Nhat.\nProfessional illustrations by Abigail Lingford and Jef Cox: the more funding we get, the more illustrations they will provide!\nTABLES\nTables galore including (but not limited to):\nMagical side effects and mishaps\nMutations and curse templates\nReasons for exile - why your pariahs were banished.\nDeath and dismemberment\nWounds and infections\nPalaeolithic equipment lists\nNeolithic innovations generator\nRandom tribe generator\nWilderness encounters and generators\nNeolithic city generator\nSpirit reaction roll table (and spirit rewards table!)\nPARIAH: ISSUE ONE\nThe printed zine will meet the following specifications:\nForty pages of monochrome text and illustration printed on A5 90 gsm paper. \nBleached white cardstock (180 gsm)  cover \nAs per zinequest 2020 guidelines, the zine is staple bound.\nMake this happen and we'll make a second issue. \nPariah cover (black)\n WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\nThe bulk of the money raised is used to pay our illustrators Jef, Abigail and Felicia (Nhat). The lead designers (Sofinho and Dzung) are not taking any payment for their work.\nShipping is included in all print orders, wherever you are in the world: there are no additional shipping or delivery fees.\nPrinting costs are our third largest expense. Currently we are planning to print in Vietnam but we may print and ship from the UK for some orders. \nAny additional funds raised will be used to commission more original art/ illustration for the zine. These won't be listed as stretch goals, but if the campaign is successful we will keep you updated regularly.\nIf we are satisfied with the amount of art in the zine and still have funds remaining, we will use this to recruit the services of a high profile professional RPG editor to give an extra layer of polish. We would love to include a professional editor from the outset, but our priority is to get as much high quality art into the zine as we can afford!\nTHE TEAM\nAbigail Lingford - illustration \nHoang Minh Nhat (Felicia) - playtesting, illustration and layout \nJef Cox - illustration\nSofinho (Joey) - playtesting, writing and additional layout\nNguyen Thi Phuong Dzung - playtesting, spreadsheets (!) and additional layout\nFINALLY...\nWe hope you can help us make issue one of Pariah a reality.

However, I am leading this project and if something DID happen to me it would slow it down a great deal.\n\nThe project is written in its entirety but could do with trimming down. Currently, this edit is something i am doing myself. If sufficient backing is achieved, I have approached a well-known professional RPG editor who will be on board. Even if we do not exceed our funding goal by enough to bring them in, I am still confident I can bring the word count down.\n\nOne can never anticipate events, and it is possible that hold-ups could occur at the printing end of things. I believe I've factored this into the delivery date (for the print edition) of August of this year. All being well, we should be able to get stuff sent out before then. \n\nI'm really excited to be getting this project off the ground.

Natural disasters limit the ability of governments to respond, and those governments are involved in wars that are bankrupting them. The global trade network has collapsed. And all this has created waves of migration, which governments are characterizing as ravening hordes, coming to destroy civilization.\nWelcome to the Late Bronze Age Collapse.\nIt\u2019s the turn of the 11th century BCE in the Mediterranean. The kingdoms of the Achaean Greeks, the empire of the Hittites, the trade centre of Troy, and the powerful city-states that line the coast have fallen. Egypt faces ruin. The world, as you know it, is ending.\nYou are one of many who have fled your homeland, finding a community among those now known as the Sea Peoples. How will you survive as order and government collapse? How will you protect your community\u2014your friends and your family\u2014in these most unstable times? Will you ever find peace?\nSagas of the Sea Peoples is a tabletop roleplaying game set in the Late Bronze Age Collapse. The characters are leaders of the Sea Peoples, seeking better lives, struggling against innumerable enemies, and facing the fall of the civilizations in which they were born.\nThe Quickstart is available at Itch.io and at DriveThru RPG. It offers a glimpse of the mechanics and the setting/historical period, as well as providing an introductory adventure.\nThe book will include rules designed specifically for Sagas of the Sea Peoples, a discussion of the Late Bronze Age Collapse and the role of the Sea Peoples in that period, a review of the Sea Peoples themselves\u2014who they were and where they went\u2014and a bibliography of sources in case the reader would like to do some further research or is curious regarding the topic. \nThe current Patreon-only version of Sagas of the Sea Peoples\u2014which has not been independently edited and has minimal art\u2014is 100 pages. The book produced through this Kickstarter will also likely be around 100 pages, though stretch goals might push that up to around 150 pages. It will have black and white illustrations for its interior, possibly with some colour stock art. \n$ 5,500 (CAD): If we are able to raise $5,500 or more, the book will include a chapter on the likely challenges migrants and newly arrived minority communities\u2014like the Sea Peoples\u2014could face. This will help to better situate the Sea Peoples and provide inspiration for the characters' adventures, as well as offer context for the whole project.\nWe would also be able to engage a second sensitivity editor, and Catherine Liao has been kind enough to agree to help with this project if we reach this goal.\n$ 6,250 (CAD): If we are able to raise $6,250 or more, the book would also include some more black and white illustrations. \nDesigner: Fraser Ronald is a Canadian roleplaying game enthusiast and designer who has successfully Kickstarted and delivered Centurion: Legionaries of Rome, Nefertiti Overdrive, and Sword's Edge.\nGraphic Design: Todd Crapper (yes, you read that right) is a graphic designer and a two-time ENnie award winning game designer for Killshot: The Director\u2019s Cut and High Plains Samurai: Legends. \nEditor: Scott Vandervalk is an associate editor for Aurealis magazine and a freelance editor whose projects include Embers of the Forgotten Kingdom, the Baby Bestiary books, Nefertiti Overdrive, Costume Fairy Adventures and Crucible.\nSensitivity Editor: Ben Scerri is a non-binary bisexual Maltese Australian tabletop  and video game producer, writer, designer, and community builder, living  in Melbourne, Australia. \nStretch Goal Sensitivity Editor: Catherine Liao is a freelance sensitivity reader and historical fiction writer.

You can find her on Twitter.\nKim Hu is an illustrator and concept artist with a fondness for soda pops and skeletons.\nJennifer Ryan Kelly is an Irish artist who creates and illustrates, and also animates.

She lives in California with her judgmental german shepherd and even more  judgmental horror movie collection.\nI have published other games which might be of interest to those backing Sagas of the Sea Peoples. The PDFs of select games are available to backers at the Shekelesh level (20 CAD) and above.\nIf you would like an add-on, simply add the cost of it to the cost of the level at which you back and then message me\u2014the owner of the Kickstarter\u2014with your requested PDF(s). Once the Kickstarter has successfully funded and payments have cleared, I will send you links to receive your add-ons through DriveThru RPG. If this would cause an issue, please let me know and I can email you the PDF(s), however please remember that itch.io allows you to receive any updates to the PDF automatically. I will not be able to do so for those who receive PDFs by email.\nI am not including print copies as add-ons to the campaign as the target for the campaign has been very carefully calibrated to meet the minimum needs of Sagas of the Sea Peoples. Because there are costs associated with the print copies, the amount paid for print copies skews the pledge total, and this could mean that on a successful completion I find myself short of the necessary funds.\nIf you are interested in print copies, please message me should the Kickstarter be successful.

You discover the tomb is inhabited by an undead queen and her spectral knights. In your exploration you have learned that she was murdered by the patriarchal structures of her own holy order. The method of her execution has denied her eternal rest. She plans murderous vengeance against the living but offers mercy under two conditions. First, help install her as an eternal monarch upon the religious throne. Second, eradicate the bloodline of those who betrayed her. What do you do? \nDungeons & Dilemmas is a collection of system agnostic techniques for designing dungeon-based adventures that engage the players on an emotional and ethical level. The presented process approaches dungeons as their own unique narrative structure, and the encounters within them as moral puzzles.\nDungeons & Dilemmas treats deeper emotional engagement as an additive dimension of play on top of the exploration, hazard avoidance, monster fighting, and treasure collection elements of traditional fantasy adventure games. All the ideas, tools, and techniques presented speak to the strengths of existing rule systems in common use. GMs and players won't have to hand-wave away or house rule their games to accommodate this material.\nFor several years, I have been using these techniques to keep players emotionally engaged and ethically challenged with adventures that reach beyond the stereotype of \"murder hobos\" and excuses to just \"kill things and take their stuff.\" #ZineQuest has provided a unique opportunity for me to share these ideas with you and hopefully help you think about the dungeon fantasy format in a slightly unique and fulfilling way.\nDungeons & Dilemmas is particularly well suited to games like: \nTorchbearer\nDungeon World\nAny of the numerous OSR-style games such as  Old-School Essentials \nAnd, of course, the current edition of the most popular fantasy adventure game.\nProject Structure\nThe current plan is a 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched booklet with black and white interior.

We would like to extend a big thanks to everyone who made this campaign a success. If you're here after the Kickstarter has ended but would like to get yourself a copy of the game, head over to  https://adamebell.itch.io/. We will be selling additional copies of the .pdf and zine there. We'll also have the community copies that were contributed by backers there where people can claim them. Thanks!\nNo Stone Unturned is a complete tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players. It's designed to play as a one-shot or short campaign, with sessions lasting from 2-4 hours each. Players will create characters and locations and take turns as the Arbiters of the world, meaning there is no set Game Master. \nYou will create a story that features characters living in a world unrecognizable to our own. Their society is starting to pick up the pieces after yet another apocalypse. Natural catastrophes, manmade disasters, and external influences have caused collapse after collapse, but humanity has somehow hung on. Remainders of each of these civilizations and artifacts of their downfalls lurk hidden throughout the world.\nEnough time has passed that many settlements have stabilized and are now looking to expand and explore what is around them. The characters that you will play live in one of these settlements and are tasked with exploring the world around them and acquiring what resources and knowledge that can be found. While that may sound like a noble cause, other societies, recovering wildlife, unstable ecosystems, and volatile remnants from disasters past are scattered all throughout the land. If these adventurers aren't careful, their actions will endanger their neighbors as well as their own homes\u2026\nNo Stone Unturned is a complete game, with all of the rules needed to play contained inside the zine. All you need to play is the zine, character sheets, some notecards, and a handful of d4s, d6s, and d8s.\n Here is a high level overview of how you play the game:\nCollaboratively design a world and a settlement for your characters to live in\nPrivately design other locations in the world and build out a map to explore\nCreate characters, and define their Moods, Aspects, Skills, and Sentiments\nAdventure to one of the hidden location to try to find the things your settlement needs\nSplit the party! Act as Arbiter when your character is not in focus, performing duties relegated to the sole GM in other games\nTrigger action rolls by endangering yourself or the world\nRoll your character's current Mood vs the relevant Aspect. The winning side will add Details to change the fiction and show the results of your actions\nWhen acting as Arbiter, mark the Collateral Clock when the characters act in a way that will leave a lasting impact\nAfter the adventure, return home with whatever you found\nReview the collateral clock of the location you just left and discuss the cumulative effect of your interference\nDowntime! Rest, study what you found, recover harm, scout out the world, and consider plans to address the harm that you've caused. \nGo on another adventure, either by exploring a new location or revisiting an old one\nThe finished zine will be 54 printed pages bound with a red cardstock cover. Shipping to anywhere in the world is included in the zine-level pledge. Check out the samples below:\nA sample spread from the worldbuilding section of the .pdf\nA spread from our playtest copy that was printed at home\nCover of our playtest copy - the final cover will be printed on red cardstock\nThe two community copy models are there so that you can purchase copies that will be put up for free on itch.io. Both the digital copies will be available to be claimed for free by anybody without the means to purchase the game for themself.\n The full rules of the game are available to read over on the SRD for free. These will be updated with any edits to the text that may happen before the game goes fully to print. Feel free to check it out, share it, and play it from there!\nWe filmed a short 2 player playthrough of the game, which is broken into 3 parts for the main bits of the game: worldbuilding, and adventure, and downtime. The videos should give a good overview of what the game is like in play.\nIf the project funds well, we'd like to expand the scope of it a bit with these stretch goals:\n(Unlocked) $500 - Funded!\n(Unlocked) $600 - Adam will design and publish a working roll20 sheet for this game. He created the roll20 sheet for the rpg Mothership, so he has some experience in this area.\n(Unlocked) $800 - Adam has a broad outline of a time travel hack, which he will begin ironing out the details of this and all backers will receive a free .pdf of the hack when it is complete. The pitch is that the players are time travelers who want to stop some great calamity. Instead of creating a world and settlement, you'll create a situation and a means of time travel. Then each player will author a different point in time that you'll need to travel to to try to prevent different precursors of the calamity from forming. Careful, though, too much interference and you'll break the whole dang world.\n(Unlocked) $1000 - More art! We will add more art to the book and also the character sheet. There are a few pages right now that have white space between sections. Funding at this level will allow Sashah to create more art, or alternatively will allow us to commission some external artists.\nThose are all the stretch goals we had in mind that are feasible right now. If we think of any more we'll add them!!  \n This game couldn't exist without the body of work put forth by the rest of the tabletop rpg community. The Ludography page of the SRD and .pdf features quite a few games that were direct inspirations. In particular, The Indie Hack by Slade Stolar laid out Hard, Scene, and Soft Details as featured in No Stone Unturned. This game runs on the Indie Hack Engine.\nAdam and Sashah\nAdam designed No Stone Unturned, and did the layout for the zine. It's been in development for about a year, after an early version of it fell out of his head into the first draft last March. Sashah edited and developed the text, and provided illustrations. They enjoyed drawing the flowers and birbs on this page and in the zine.\nYou can find Adam on most social media as @adamebell. Sashah can be found @zozo_q on Twitter. \nWe recognize Kickstarter United\nWe want to express our support for Kickstarter staff, who are working to form a union. The success of this and so many Kickstarter projects is due in part to the hard work of the company\u2019s employees, and we believe in their right to unionize.\nAt this time, union organizers are not calling for a boycott. Instead, they\u2019re asking supporters to raise their voices and make our solidarity known.\n  We call on Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership to recognize the union now, and we hope you\u2019ll join me.\nSolidarity forever \ud83e\udd1d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first zine that we have made, but we have already gotten in touch with a local print shop and received several estimates.\n\nThe complete text of the game is already written and laid out, and the only thing left is to incorporate the art.

Their kingdom was a verdant paradise of vast rainforests surrounding the range of weathered mountain peaks, and surrounded by saltwater marshlands. Countless stories have been told about their great city of marble and glass, carved into the eponymous mountain. We have all enjoyed the Unani fruit cordials from their jungle plantations and the bitter herbs that grow in their marshland domain. We heard of their great soldiers, clad in woven reed and wielding blades of bronze.\nThe Queen of the Ulunaki was slain a palace coup last night, along with her royal consort, and most of her children. Only the Queen\u2019s youngest daughter was rescued from the massacre by unlikely hands. These unseemly folk bore the Heir to her aunt Baru who could offer refuge to the rightful queen of Ulunak. The Heir recounted the story of their escape to Aunt Baru, who listened with rapt attention. It wasn't until the end of their story that she let on about her suspicions\u2026\n\nThis is a tabletop roleplaying game about the future queen of Ulunak, and the unusual figures who came together to escort her to safety. This is a game for 3-6 players which takes place over a single session of 3-4 hours. \nMost of you will portray the Bearers, skillful and flawed adults who have chosen to escort the Heir to safety. You are a master of one of the six essential domains of the world; Warfare, Society, Sorcery, Religion, Nature, or Crime. To prove your value to the Heir and keep her safe, it is your job to warn of any dangers stemming from your domain. The Veteran may warn the group about an incoming patrol of soldiers, while the Shadow would point out that the kind guide is actually a con-artist. Bearers may also address threats, but doing so on your own Domain is likely to frighten the Heir. As a Bearer, your primary objective is to earn the Heir\u2019s trust as you carry her to the safety of the aunt\u2019s palace.\nOne of your number will play the Heir, daughter of the queen and the rightful ruler of the kingdom. The Heir is an innocent, compassionate young princess who has only seen a dozen winters. As the Heir, you facilitate the game and explain the rules. While you are but a young girl, each of her companions respects your potential as a leader and your word is final if ever a conflict arises. As the Heir, you watch your companions to judge if you trust or fear them. At the end of the game, Aunt Baru allows the Heir to decide the fates of each of the Bearers.\nPalanquin is a game about a perilous journey and people trying to overcome their past. It\u2019s inspired by classic indie roleplaying games such as\u2026\n Dream Askew / Dream Apart, where players own certain elements of the fiction. \n Kagematsu, where one person judges the behaviour of the many. \n Witch: Road to Lindisfarne, centered on a perilous journey, where you discover the pasts of the travelers. \n\nInspired by titles like Judges Guild, Alarums & Excursions, and A Pound of Flesh, Kickstarter is inviting creators to launch two-week campaigns for their own RPG-inspired zines as part of Zinequest 2.

The campaign has a low goal and is only running for two weeks, so spread the word!\nZine Quest 2!\nPalanquin is a 36-page black and white saddle-stitched zine. The best way to play is for each player to have their own copy of the zine double as character sheets.

Augur Magazine strives to create a compassionate, critical, and creative space while publishing fantastic works of literature.\nIn our first two years, we've gone from paying $0.02/word (CAD) to $0.11/word\u2014growth we never could have imaged. With you as our backer, we'll keep growing. Help us to continue breaking down the boundary between literary and speculative fictions, so we can keep creating opportunities for creators around the world.\nIn Ancient Rome, an Augur foretold futures by watching the flight patterns of birds.\nIn Toronto, today, Augur Magazine believes the stories we tell now have a direct impact on the futures we're creating.\nOur mission statement is to find \"stories for the futures we need\". To support this mission, we've developed three key pillars: first, we muddy the line between literary and speculative fiction by publishing uncanny realism alongside classic scifi-fantasy; second, we carefully and respectfully choose the pieces that represent our publication in a process informed by empathy; and, finally, we aspire to lift up under-represented and marginalized voices as often as we can.\nAugur Magazine strives to create a compassionate, critical, and creative literary space\u2014while publishing fantastic works of literature. It is currently the only SFWA-recognized pro market in Canada, and we intend to use that status to create more opportunities for Canadian, Indigenous, and worldwide creators. We are an all-volunteer team that donates thousands of hours per year to our community and, if funded, we can't wait to continue that work.\nWe itching to keep looking for the stories that inform the type of world we want to live in, whether dreamy realism, fabulism, science fiction, fantasy, slipstream, horror, fairy tale, myth, steampunk, apocalyptic, or any other genre.\nBecause we want all of them. And everything in between. \n Like many projects, Augur Magazine was conceived in a basement, back in the summer of 2016. After months of planning, it was launched with a call for submissions for its first project: the Augur Magazine Preview Issue, a collection of reprints that would set the tone for what Augur would publish. More than five hundred submissions later, the Preview Issue launched the same day as Augur's first Kickstarter.\nBy the end of September 2017, Augur was funded for its first two years\u2014paying just $0.02/word at the time.\nSince 2017, the team has had an incredible time working with creators and getting involved in both Canadian and speculative fiction literary communities. We've been overwhelmed by the response to our work, including:\nReceiving more than 7000 submissions since we opened in 2017\nPublishing 65+ creators over 7 issues\nGrowing to a team of 25+ volunteers\nBeing reviewed by Quick Sip Reviews, Maria Haskins, and Locus Magazine\nMaking the Locus and Nebula Recommended Reading Lists\nHaving a story on the Sunburst Awards Longlist\nPublishing 55+ blog posts\nReceiving funding from the Ontario Arts Council to support our creators and boost our rates from $0.02/word to $0.06/word\nReceiving funding from the Toronto Arts Council to create our inaugural conference, Augury\nBecoming an official incorporated nonprofit organization\nSupporting a reading series to celebrate speculative fiction monthly in Toronto\nRepresenting Augur at programming at CanCon, the Toronto Public Library, the University of Toronto, and the Toronto International Festival of Authors\nRaising our rates again from $0.06/word to $0.11/word...and becoming a qualifying, SFWA recognized pro paying market starting with pieces published in Issue 3.1\nSometimes, it seems like too much to imagine it all taking place in the last two years. Our team is so thankful that we've had the opportunity to have these experiences, to work with our wonderful contributors, and to support Augur in growing past what we ever imagined during those first meetings in 2016. \nAugur Covers, Issue 1.1-2.3\nWhat's next? 2020 is a huge year for Augur. This year, we're publishing our first SFWA-qualifying issues. We're reducing the number of issues from three to two, but keeping roughly the same number of published creators. With your help, we hope to add even more slots than previous years. If we break past our goal of $12,000, we'll add more opportunities than ever before for writers to be published in our digital pages.\nBut our first Kickstarter was only built to cover 2018 and 2019.\nIf we want to see as much growth in the next two years as we've created in our first two, we'll need your support.\n If funded, Augur Magazine will be ready to go for Years 3 and 4. That's four new issues of work, meaning at least 16+ stories, 24+ poems, and 4 comics. Our rates will be maintained at their current pro-paying status of $0.11/word (CAD, and assume CAD for all $) for fiction, $60/poem and $50/page for comics. We'll also continue doing our community work as the Augur Magazine Literary Society, including our upcoming partnership with the Ephemera Reading Series and our 2020 conference, Augury (although these projects have different funding behind them).\nThat's where we'll get with $12,000 CAD. If we go past it? Here's what you can look forward to:\n $13,500.00 // Poetry Boost - Augur will publish four more poems per year. That's eight poems we wouldn't publish otherwise, bringing our total up to 32 new poems from 2020-2021.\n $15,000.00 // Comics Boost - Augur will boost comics pay from $50/page to $70/page, putting more money in our comic artists' pockets.\n $16,500.00 // Fiction Boost - We'll add 6,000 words of prose per year. That's 12,000 words total, bringing our total number of stories up to 20-24.\n $19,000.00 // Print Edition - We'll print a collected volume of Augur's Issues 2.1-2.3 and send it to every Lifetime Subscriber who's contributed $100 or more.\n $21,000.00 // Reprint Boost - Our blog will publish 1 reprint every month, paying $20-40 per reprint.\n $24,000.00 // Small Press Boost - You ready for it? Augur opens a small press. We'll start purchasing and printing short fiction (Novella) and poetry books. That's right. Longer short fiction, curated by the Augur team, at your fingertips.

You play an adventuring party of a traditional fantasy story, but framed in a way that shifts your perspective, focusing on the inner lives of the characters. \nThe game is written to encourage players and characters to think about who they are, what they are doing, and why they are doing it. What does it mean to be a Cleric with a personal relationship to a deity? How does it feel to create magic out of nothing as the Wizard? Venture is a game about understanding the archetype through the character, and understanding the character beyond their archetype.\nIf you want to play a game of Venture using an already existent D&D character or party, you can absolutely do that, and you'll create a totally different and interesting story than you could in D&D. If you want to create new characters in Venture, the character sheets give you the prompts and space to do just that.\nDungeon is a game about recapturing the experience of enjoying traditional fantasy narratives. You play a group of young kids playing Dungeons & Dragons while grappling with the perils of high school, and how these things can intersect.\nIn Dungeon, the characters the kids play are tied to the feelings and experiences of the kids themselves. The magic the characters can cast are reflections of the kids' own skills and experiences, and the monsters the kids face are allegorical to the challenges they experience in day-to-day life. Like all of Jay's work, Dungeon is a queer narrative that features genders tied up in high school experiences and a flexible approach to the ever-shifting teenage identity.\nDungeon is born from Jay's memories of being a young adult and loving Dungeons & Dragons, and now grappling with a more complicated relationship with the same game. It's both a love letter to D&D and an acknowledgement of why they had to move past it.\nBoth Venture and Dungeon are games of Belonging Outside Belonging, a tabletop roleplaying game system spearheaded by Dream Apart / Dream Askew by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum. It uses no dice and has no GM; instead each player has a player character and have equal control over the story, using a token economy of strong and weak moves to advance the narrative. The BoB system creates stories of intimate communities and their interpersonal conflicts, struggles, and triumphs.  \nHow do you play?\nIn Venture and Dungeon, each player will pick a playbook that contains lists of traits to choose for your character. In Venture, you will choose two looks, a wardrobe style, and two things you are and two you are not. Additionally, each playbook has two additional questions that relate to their role specifically. In Dungeon, you will choose a name and gender for your kid, a name and look for your hero, and an additional playbook-specific choice.\nThe playbooks all also have moves, which you will use to exert agency in the story; strong moves cost tokens that you gain with weak moves.\nThe base game of Venture has six playbooks: The Bard, The Cleric, The Fighter, The Paladin, The Rogue, and The Wizard.\nThe base game of Dungeon has six playbooks: The Cleric, The Fighter, The Rogue, The Wizard, The Game Master, and The Kid.\nThe Fighter playbook from Venture (layout not final)\nCleric playbook for Dungeon (layout not final)\nAs a group, you will also make choices about setting elements, which are the environmental and societal forces that will interact with your characters. During the story, players may \"pick up\" setting elements and act as their embodiments in scenes where other characters are interacting with them. Setting elements are a way to build your world and introduce NPCs and ideas for your characters to interact and come into conflict with.\nThe base game of Venture has six setting elements: The Darkness, The Celestial, The Arcane, The Mundane, The Authority, and The Underbelly.\nThe base game of Dungeon has four setting elements: The Dungeon, The Mysteries, The Powers-That-Be, and The Denizens. It also features a rotating cast of Monster Elements, which includes (but is not limited to) The Undead Hordes, The Gazing Monstrosity, and The Great Dragon.\nThe Darkness and The Celestial setting elements from Venture (layout not final)\nDungeon setting element for Dungeon (layout not final)\n\nThe Designers\nRiley Rethal is the designer of Venture. She is a 20 year old biology student who has spent the last three summers teaching kids roleplaying games as a summer camp counselor. She enjoys writing games that encourage collaboration and exploration.\nRiley has written many games in the past year, such as The Riot Starts, a gmless game about revolution and community in the capitalist hell of the underworld, Ayekah, a two-player game about a Jewish relationship with god, and It's Been A Long, Long Time, a two-player game about a relationship that is separated and reunites. You can find all of those games and more at metagame.itch.io.\nThis is her fourth TTRPG Kickstarter, so she has some experience with this kind of thing. The first was Synthesis for Zinequest last year, an experimental zine with a collection of small games about meta and perspective. The second was for a print run of Dusk to Midnight, her #sadmechjam game about doomed soldiers in a losing war. And the third was co-organizing Doikayt, a Jewish TTRPG anthology that was successful beyond its contributors' wildest dreams.\nJay Dragon is the designer of Dungeon. They are a 22 year old vagabond who has spent much of their life teaching queer teenagers how to LARP in the Hudson Valley. They write games about gender, emotional experiences, shifting identities, community, and love.\nJay has been writing games since they were 14 years old, but only in the past year have they been publishing. Their first major release was Sleepaway, another Belonging Outside Belonging game, revolving around summer camp counselors protecting their kids from a monstrous Lindworm. They've also released Esoteric, a series of ritual games played in secret (I cannot tell you more than that), and Kid Impossible, a 1+ player game about being a teenage superhero, making friends, and fighting monsters. They also release a series of poetic zines called Games For The Missing & The Found, which they use to express their feelings about games and constantly redefine what precisely a game is.\nThis is their second RPG Kickstarter, with the first being Sleepaway, which succeeded admirably. They promise they don't just write games about teenagers going on adventures.\nThe Team\nRuby Lavin is the layout artist for Venture & Dungeon.

It's about D&D, sure, but more than that it's about the relationships we have with things that were close to us when we were young. The way the playbooks and tools are built instill a feeling of playing RPGs while concretely establishing themes about the interpersonal and connections with games.\" \u2013 Nevyn Holmes, designer of Skel-IT-ons and creator of IndieBytes\n\"this game rules and i would be saying that even if i wasn't also getting money from this kickstarter\" \u2013 Riley Rethal, designer of Venture\nBacker Tiers\nThere are many different options to choose from for your adventure:\n The PDF ($15): get the PDF of the book, fulfilled by itch.io!\n PDF + Donation ($24): get the PDF, and donate a community copy PDF for someone who can't afford the game!

They're outnumbered and outgunned. Supplies are running low. The actions of a brave few could be all that stands between humanity and extinction.\nWelcome to the Last Fleet.\nLast Fleet is a tabletop roleplaying game where you play brave pilots, officers, engineers, politicians and journalists struggling to hold the human race - and themselves - together under unbelievable pressure. The game focuses on action, intrigue and drama in this high-stakes situation. You'll fight space battles, search for enemy infiltrators, tackle supply shortages and navigate faction politics. You'll strive against your own self-doubt and sometimes crack under the stress.\nThe game provides support to create your own evocative setting, or you can play out of the box as the survivors of the Interplanetary Commonwealth. This fractious alliance of planets was wiped out by the Corax - an extradimensional fungus network that dwells in the tenebrium, the same medium that FTL ships travel through. The Corax attack through spatial rifts, launching spore ships to harry the fleet. Victims are paralysed and have their genetic and neural patterns harvested: everything you know, the Corax now know. And worse, your former friends may see you again, reincarnated as a Corax avatar. \nMockup of what the book will look like\n\nJoin the fleet today\nThe playbooks each represent a particular personality, approach or set of issues you want to explore. There are twelve:\n Aries, a hot-headed character who rushes in where angels fear to tread, and is unafraid to speak their mind.\n Taurus, a tough, selfless and principled character who does what\u2019s needed no matter how much punishment is thrown at them.\n Gemini, a charismatic communicator who pursues their own agenda that might not be completely in line with the fleet\u2019s interests.\n Cancer, an experienced leader who cares deeply for their comrades, but may be a little too willing to overlook their problems.\n Leo, a magnetic individual who people want to follow. Where will they lead them?\n Virgo, a serious professional who prides themselves on being the best, but may put themselves under too much pressure at time.\n Libra, a skilled diplomat and negotiator who may be looked to for leadership.\n Scorpio, a secretive manipulator whose motives are in doubt \u2013 including by themselves.\n Sagittarius, a relentlessly curious person who might be an explorer, engineer or spy, or perhaps all three.\n Capricorn, an uncompromising tactician who is willing to take risks to defeat the enemy. Will they take things too far?\n Aquarius, a perceptive investigator who does not shrink from confronting the truth, no matter how painful it might be.\n Pisces, an otherworldly person with strange abilities that allow them to see things others do not.\nIn addition to your playbook, you can choose a role within the fleet. You can play a military officer, pilot or marine, engineer or scientist, journalist or civilian leader. Each comes with its own special move.\nPBTA\nLast Fleet is based on the excellent Powered by the Apocalypse framework pioneered by Apocalypse World. In this case, that means it uses a simple 2d6 based system, with  prompts for interesting, dramatic outcomes from every roll; characters are organised into playbooks that provide everything you need on a single piece of paper; and GM advice is codified into clear principles that tell you not just how the mechanics work but how to get the best from the game.\nUnder Pressure\nThe game's mechanics push forward the central theme of pressure: pressure on your characters, pressure on the fleet, pressure on humanity. You can win almost any conflict if you're willing to pay the consequences, by racking up more pressure on your character that ultimately pushes them to Breaking Point. That's when your character goes off the rails, lashing out at their friends or hurling themselves into certain doom.\nThe only way to keep the pressure under control is by indulging your vices and risking losing control, or by building relationships that matter with other characters. Neither route is risk-free. When you're not putting your life on the line, you're putting your heart on the line.\nTestimonials\n\"I had the good fortune to get in on a playtest of Last Fleet, and Joshua has delivered a satisfying and crunchy deep dive into the action, emotion, and escalating paranoia that make up the life of a Rag-Tag (space) Fugitive on the run from a mysterious, implacable, existential alien threat. I'm very much looking forward to having it on my tables to put into the eager hands of prospective CAGs, politicians, and shady operators.\"\n- Jim Crocker, jimlikesgames.com\n\"From the very first session of Last Fleet, our group felt hunted! The tension that arises from just the premise of the game alone--humanity fleeing an implacable enemy--really fueled not just every action scene, but, especially, the interpersonal scenes as our characters reached out, broke down, let loose, and tried to maintain their humanity at the edge of annihilation.\"\n-Zach Bain, playtester\n\"The beauty of Last Fleet is that you're going to want to put your characters under pressure -- the roleplaying that spins out is just so juicy. It's extremely clever, extremely fun design.\"\n-Nick Bate, playtester\n\"Black Armada is part of a new generation of PbtA designers who are tackling new concepts in new genres with new ideas. Last Fleet is aimed at replicating some of my favorite fiction, and I'm excited to see Josh exploring concepts of authority, tension, and political pressure through that lens. I can't wait to see the finished game!\"\n-Mark Diaz Truman, Magpie Games\nTry the game\nIf you want to see more - and see how the draft game layout is going - you can grab a free download of the reference sheets and playbooks. The current draft of the full game is available to backers in the first update to this campaign.\nActual play\nYou can take a look at how the game plays by watching the playtest recording below. The video kicks off with world building, character creation and relationship generation, but you can skip ahead if you'd like to see the mechanics in action. \nKickstarter Budget\nI'm raising money to cover print costs, art and layout. If I raise enough, there's stretch goals for extra art and setting material, but if I exactly meet my funding goal then the breakdown would look like this:   \nAbout a 40% goes to art and layout, 30% to printing. The rest is editing, Kickstarter's fees, and a small amount of money for me, and contingency funds.\nI will be printing extra books for post-Kickstarter sales, and that is included in the print costs. This means that, while my up-front pay is pretty low, I can expect fair compensation over the relatively short term if the campaign funds.\nThe 10% contingency is standard for Black Armada's crowdfunding campaigns. Stuff happens, estimates can be wrong, and prices are pretty volatile. Having a contingency fund has always proved a good choice in the past.\nFulfilment and Shipping\nI plan to fulfil digital rewards through Drivethru, so backers will have access to the files in their Drivethru library.\nI expect the game will be an A5 book around 200-250 pages in length. I plan to print the books with Biddles Books, who have provided books of exceptional quality for our previous projects Flotsam and Bite Marks.\nPhysical rewards will be shipped with Kixto, who have proved reliable warehousing partners on our previous projects. Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign has closed, so as to ensure that we neither over-charge nor under-charge you. Based on past experience, a single book will cost around \u00a35 to ship within the UK, \u00a38 (\u20ac10) within the EU, or \u00a310 ($14) elsewhere.\nThe project team  \nJosh Fox is the award-winning designer of Flotsam: Adrift Amongst the Stars, and (with Becky Annison) Lovecraftesque.

We've delivered every product in full, and we're getting better at it - our last campaign was fulfilled 2 months early.\n\nI'm a qualified project manager and I always prepare carefully for delivery of a new product. We have a detailed timeline and budget that reflects our best estimate of what's needed to make the project happen.\n\nEvery project comes with its own challenges. Key people get sick, prices change - with the best preparation in the world you can't be certain what will happen during delivery. That's why we always include a sizeable contingency allowance in our timelines and budgets.\n\nWhen things go wrong, we will keep you updated regularly. We never go silent, and we always make sure if there's a risk to our planned delivery date, you're informed as early as possible.\n\nLike our last two projects, this one is special because it takes place ahead of a possible UK exit from the EU. At this time it appears that the UK will officially leave the EU on 31st January, but will not have completed the transition period out of the EU before the end of 2020. We will therefore work very hard to (a) get the books printed before then, to avoid any risk of price changes, and (b) get the books shipped before then, to avoid any risk of delay at the ports. If we fail to achieve this, it will likely have an effect on how profitable the project is, and might delay receipt of the rewards, but it is very unlikely that it will torpedo the project.\n\nFinally, we're supporters of Kickstarter United's efforts at unionising. The most recent news is that Kickstarter are talking to KSRU and we're hopeful this will lead to further good news in the near future. Nonetheless, should KSRU call for a boycott, we intend to pull our campaign from Kickstarter. If this happens, we'll aim to take the project forward in some way, at a later date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Get updates about the project and credit in the Black Armada Hall of Fame.\nINCLUDES:\nDraft Last Fleet rules - instant access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "PDF only (hardship tier)", "descp": "Last Fleet in PDF format at a discounted price for those suffering economic or financial hardship (your call).\nINCLUDES:\nDraft Last Fleet rules - instant access\nLast Fleet PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["69 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Retailer tier", "descp": "Deposit towards the cost of four copies of the game, at a 50% retailer discount.

The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.\nThe first player to slay three monsters or assemble a full party wins the game!\nAs part of this project, we created exclusive and collectible items that you won't get anywhere else as a thank you for supporting us on Kickstarter. These items will not be available online or in retail stores at a later date.\nPLAY\n\nIn Here to Slay, you'll start with a Party Leader and work to assemble a team of Heroes to take on savage Monsters. The first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!\nEvery player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!\nYour heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero\u2019s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero\u2019s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect\u2019s roll requirement. \nEveryone wants to be a hero, but are you brave enough to face off against these monsters? If you successfully slay three monsters, you win the game, but attacking a monster may come at a price! In order to slay that monster, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that monster\u2019s roll requirement. \nBe warned: Each monster has a roll range in which they\u2019ll fight back, and if you score within that range, your party might be in grave danger...\nItem cards are enchanted weapons and objects that can be equipped to your heroes to bestow them with special advantages and skills. Most items give beneficial effects and are meant to be equipped to heroes in your own party, but a handful of items, called cursed items, can be equipped to enemy heroes to give them disadvantages. \nWhat would this world be without a little magic and mayhem? Magic cards are powerful spells with a one-time effect. Some magic cards can give you great advantages, while others are designed to set your opponents back.\nDon't like what your opponent just played? Throw down a challenge! Challenge cards can be played instantly to try to stop another player from playing a hero, item, or magic card. Playing a challenge card initiates a 1V1 challenge in which you and another player both have to roll the dice. If they win the challenge, they still get to play their card, but if you win the challenge, you get to send their card directly to the discard pile!\nOnly fools rely solely on luck. In this game, you can keep a modifier card up your sleeve (or, well, in your hand) to make sure the odds always tip in your favor. Modifier cards add or subtract from the final total of any dice roll. Whether you need to recover from a low roll or sabotage the high roll of an opponent, modifier cards can be a handy tool when luck doesn't seem to be on your side.  \nHere is a quick reference of the tiers (click to see the full spreadsheet): \nWe use BackerKit to handle all add-ons. Two weeks after the campaign ends, we send out a BackerKit survey, and you can select add-ons (and enter your shipping information). US backers can purchase add-ons with no additional shipping charges, and backers anywhere else in the world will be charged just a flat $5 (for any number of items you want).\nBecause Here to Slay has a strong role-playing element, we wanted to include a way for you to bring your own character to the table. So as part of this project, we launched a party leader customizer that you can use to instantly create your own character using artwork that we\u2019ve provided, or even upload your own.\nYou can also see characters that other members of the community have built - and the best part is, any custom party leader card that you create is fully playable in the game!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind some of the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total. They've been an amazing partner on this campaign and helped us grow our community! \nWhen our team first started working on Unstable Unicorns three years ago, we weren't really sure what to expect. We were huge fans of games, and some of us had even dabbled in designing games before, but we had never undertaken a large-scale project and seen it through to completion. The response was more than we could've ever expected, and it forever changed our work and our lives.\nFor the past few years, our team\u2019s mission has been to design highly interactive games that are worth playing over and over. We want our games to bring people together, to help players express themselves, and ultimately to make the world a better place. We learn so much from every project, and each piece of feedback we get helps shape the future of what we create. \nThe response we received on Here to Slay is nothing short of extraordinary. Your support means everything to us. We hope you enjoy what we create, and we will continue striving to delight you every single day.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident in the preparations we have taken for this campaign, we would be naive to assume that no risks or challenges lie ahead.

The grown-ups are gone. And the rain never, ever stops.\nLibret\u00e9 is a tabletop role-playing game that invites you to assume the lives of children trying to survive in a world without adults. To survive in The City you'll need to come together to form a community with other refugee children, overcome the gangs that seek to take what is yours and avoid being devoured by the Sirens of the Storm that lurk in every drop and puddle.\nFinding your way home is an absurd fantasy\u2014in The City everything is a struggle. Whether you're a newcomer, the head of a powerful faction or an established outcast, you'll quickly learn that nobody is coming to save you and that sometimes the only way to survive immediate danger is to embrace long-lasting trauma. How you cope with this stress, and how it affects your future decisions, determines the success of your isolated group.\nThe System\nLibret\u00e9 uses a modified Powered By The Apocalypse system with several new mechanics added, namely Bile: a measure of the characters' susceptibility to the dark instincts that inhabit us all. Bile is the same violence that drives a child to pick up a rock in a schoolyard fight, used to power through the fear that would otherwise paralyze them in the face of horrible death.\nIs your child a pacifist or a coward? A warrior or a sociopath? Is this minor squabble going to better prepare you for the horrors to come or drive a knife through the tenuous fabric of your found community? Will you show mercy when given the chance? Will they?\nAt its heart the system is designed to encourage roleplaying while minimizing unnecessary mechanical tests. Class archetypes help you quickly create and flesh out a character and the flow of the game means that each skill check\u2014whether successful or not\u2014introduces new facets of the story.\nLibret\u00e9 has a simple and intuitive system for creating and developing your own sanctuary through emergent play. Together with your fellow players you'll design an enclave with multiple leaders, factions and problems\u2014both immediate and eventual. For those who prefer to jump right into the game, the free Quick Start Guide features an introductory adventure designed to introduce players to the system and world of Libret\u00e9. \nThe Book\nOriginally released to a French audience in 2016, this Kickstarter marks the first English translation of Vivien F\u00e9asson's Libret\u00e9. While the original French version was lauded for its setting and system, we've decided to bring on Ennie-award winning editors Fiona Geist and Jarrett Crader (MOTHERSHIP, Ultraviolet Grasslands, Fever Swamp, Silent Titans) to give the entire book a thorough re-working to impart clarity and ease-of-use. The layout is being redesigned from the ground up by Dai Shugars (The Demon Collective, Vol. 1, Magical Industrial Revolution) and will be presented as an a5 softcover digitally printed by Mixam with interior art by Mathieu Chevalier and cover/interior art by GMDK veteran Lauren Bryce (The Demon Collective, Vol. 1).\nThe main book and its supplements are already written and translated\u2014an artless, raw-text document of the game will be sent to every backer as soon as the funding period concludes. Your money is going towards making this the best book it can be, a model of indie RPG design and usability. Physical book fulfillment will be handled by Exalted Funeral, and PDFs distributed by itch.io.\nLike all GMDK books, PDFs will be layered, bookmarked, and optimized to full PDF/UA standards for the utmost in accessibility. It is our strong belief that RPGs are for everyone, and we make sure to put in the work so our readers don't have to. \nFleur Du Mall\nFleur Du Mall is the first supplement for Libret\u00e9, and is designed to be an all-in-one adventure setup and location. Taking place in a reclaimed shopping mall, players will try to navigate the tenuous power balance between several factions: the iron-fisted  Glass Watch, the lawless Centrals, and the Boilers who crawl through the maintenance tunnels. If any one group gets too powerful, the stronghold might fall--leaving everyone to the mercy of the Sirains. \nIn the City, dangerous monsters lurk in every pool and puddle.\nFleur Du Mall is already written, translated and edited. It's being provided here as a kind of add-on, without the trouble of managing pledges in Backerkit. If you want the full Libret\u00e9 experience, consider backing at the PDF Deluxe or Print Deluxe level. Physical copies of Fleur Du Mall will be a5 softcovers printed via Mixam, identical in quality to our last book, The Demon Collective, Vol. 1.\nHere's what some reviewers (translated from French) have said about Libret\u00e9: \n\"Libret\u00e9 wasn\u2019t created for players looking into roleplaying games for fun and only for fun. With its radical and resolutely mature bias, the game wishes to provoke strong emotions and thinking around the table, and will ask a bit of rigor and discipline from all involved participants in order to lead them to the proper result. This clearly changes from classic RPGs and can sometimes be a bit complex to set up, since it requires changing old habits and even thinking about what is considered as \u201cnormal\u201d within our hobby. Nonetheless, for all those who are ready to take the required step, the final impression will clearly match the investment.\" \u2060\u2014Vincent L., SciFi Universe\n\"Many (too many) RPGs are beautiful gems only meant to be read (and then kept inside a library), while Libret\u00e9 is the opposite of that, because it was created to be played and even to be felt. It is therefore the perfect example of the great evolution RPGs have experienced since Dungeons & Dragons. This is the kind of games that I write myself to create original experiences for friends more inclined towards blockbusters. A small book where every page and every word is important for the game, and even takes us far beyond, to something like an inner adventure that resonates within each one of us, each time in a different way.\" \u2014Olivier T., UnificationFrance\nAs well as players in Vivien's annual GauntletCon games:\n\"Libret\u00e9 is truly a special game! I am so impressed with [Viviens'] design, it's so elegant and evocative.\" \u2014 @temporalhiccup\n\"This game really opened my eyes to how changes in mechanics can radically drive game play.\" \u2014@TaintedDingo\n\"English speaking roleplaying people, here is the very best of French RPG scene coming to you, in English.\" \u2014@LamSon82225689\nAnd here are some videos of those games, so you can see just what sort of stories you can tell with Libret\u00e9. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k9ekbb_ak0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqhnS_-vr8&t=4614s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSSo3EkkpAE&t=2s\n To avoid getting mired in post-production, we're keeping stretch goals simple and focused; we want to get this book to backers with a minimum of delays and potential problems, so we've decided to eschew fancy book ribbons or hand-outs in favor of what we know we can deliver on-time. \n$10,000: TWO New Supplemental Rulesets: \"Injuries, Sickness, and Care\" and \"Creating NPCs\"\nComplementing the base rules found in the game, \"Injuries, Sickness, and Care\" provides more intricate systems for coping with the ravages of violence and disease. In a world without ready access to antibiotics, where a trip to the drugstore is an armed operation, infection can kill as quick as a knife. In addition to rules for diseases such as gangrene and tetanus, this supplement gives info about treating wounds and nutritional deficiencies for a grittier, more resource-management style of play.\nAs well, we'll include detailed rules for quickly designing other children to populate the world of Libret\u00e9. When you need a child on the fly--whether an up-and-coming gang boss, a new arrival to the fortress, or a mysterious loner who knows more than they let on--roll a few times on our tables to generate a unique character.\n$12,500: THREE Advanced Archetypes: The Adult, The Addict, and The Sirain\nThese Archetypes are meant for advanced players, as they include mechanics that the base Archetypes don't.\nAs The Adult, you're the only grown-up in a city of children; naturally distrusted, but bearing the weight of an entire community on your shoulders. You have a wisdom and strength that they don't, but you'll feel every loss as if it were your own.\nMeanwhile, The Addict knows just how terrible the city can be when you've got nobody to rely on but yourself. A little chemical assistance goes a long way in easing the nightmares, and you can stop anytime you want to. You just don't want to.\nAnd then there's The Sirain: born of the storm, you find yourself at the gates of Libret\u00e9 with no family, no purpose, and no memories--just a desire to find a place where you belong, and a gnawing hunger for flesh that you're desperately trying to conceal.\n$15,000: More Art!\nAt this level, we'll be able to pay Lauren to provide more interior illustrations for both the main book and Fleur Du Mall. We'll also be able to do a larger print run, which means there will be books available after the Kickstarter for anyone who missed out. \nWe are GMDK, a tabletop publishing company dedicated to producing and promoting the work of LGBT+ and other marginalized creators in the gaming community. This is our second Kickstarter, after The Demon Collective, Vol. 1 , which raised nearly 700% of its funding goal. With Libret\u00e9, we aim to show that the same principles that made The Demon Collective so successful\u2014great art, tight editing and intuitive design\u2014can be applied to all types of games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first attempt at this was ambitious; we've scaled things back considerably for the re-release. The new Libret\u00e9 will be svelte and compact, but we're confident we'll be able to deliver just as much of an incredible gaming experience with it. \n\nAside from the form factor, several steps have been taken to ensure the production of Libret\u00e9 goes smoothly. The book itself is written, translated, and edited; all it needs now is art and layout.

Experience the rush of unquestioning loyalty to a darker power and charging into danger with reckless abandon! Raid villages, scout ancient ruins for artifacts, and protect the dungeon from homicidal adventurers.\nInstead of a well established world, the game uses principles taken from Powered by the Apocalypse style games and improv comedy to create the setting. For the Dungeon! relies heavily on player created prompts that are interpreted by the Game Master to reveal the details of the world.\nThe game is designed to be fast-paced, with a focus on creating memorable moments. Because the game is light and has a greater focus on the story, anybody can pick up and play with minimal effort. The fun is created more through the unexpected scenarios the players get themselves into than by studying rules.\nSo how do you play? Characters are represented by a set of short descriptions called traits. They cover a character's skills, equipment, and motivations. Traits provide an easy way to know both who your character is and what they're good at.\nSomething inherent to being a minion is their penchant for chaos. Critical failures are a core part of what makes the game unique and fun. Whenever the characters critically fail the player provides a prompt that the Game Master uses as inspiration for whatever hilariously unexpected misfortune befalls them.\nWith failure comes experience. When a minion rolls a critical failure they write down what they learned from the experience instead of tracking experience points. These experiences can be used just like traits, but only as long as you continue to succeed.\nIn addition to playing as a minion, all players get to influence what is going on in the dungeon. During downtime, players choose from a handful of dungeon actions that alter the world to naturally create interesting story hooks to pursue.\nThere's a lot more that goes into making the game what it is. Feel free to download the Quick Start to get a better idea of the rules of For the Dungeon!\nThere are two ways to get your hands on a copy of For the Dungeon! The digital copy is a PDF and a great option for anyone looking to save some money. The physical copy is a paperback book with original art from our wonderful artist Jared. If you want to see more of his work feel free check him out on Instagram. We ship to most of the world, if your country isn't currently listed reach out either by message or comment and I'll be sure to add it. Here's what you're getting inside the book:\nAbout 70 pages full of original full-color art\nA guide to creating characters and selecting traits\nA List of abilities that define minion playstyles\nHelpful tips for using prompts to create the world\nAdvice to help GM's run the game\nThe game also includes a guide to creating alternate settings other than fantasy. Simple rules for altering and creating new abilities, items, and downtime actions allow Game Masters to run any kind of game they want with the system!\nWe now have add-ons! To receive any of the following just add the listed amount to your pledge total. We will have options for marking add-ons during the end of campaign surveys, but you can always send us a message to make sure we know which add-on you wanted or that the amount pledged is correct. There are currently two available add-ons.\nThe Deck of Many Prompts  ($14 U.S. / $24 Other Countries) - This deck is for those who want to add a bit of randomness to the game without the pressure of thinking up prompts on the spot. Whenever the situation calls for you to establish details simply draw a card and roll a die. The GM will then work the result into the fiction. Note: the image shown is just a placeholder and not the final product.\nMap of Discovery ($16 U.S.) - This is a 11\"x17\" foldable dry-erase map featuring thematic imagery, that players get to explore and discover. It is also a great way to track the consequences of dungeon actions. Whenever the group angers a village or causes mayhem the consequences can be recorded for future use. As a bonus, the back of the map also features a grid that can be used with other role-playing games.

What does that mean? It means that players take on the role of fantasy heroes that are avatars in a virtual reality massively-multiplayer role-playing game. Their characters are aware that they are characters, and they have advantages that normal RPG characters don't have. For instance, if they die in battle, they can respawn at their most recent bind point. Death is no longer the end! It's become a tactical option. But there's always a price, and in Infinity's Edge death means a loss of XP and having to go find your body to get most of your equipment back. \nIt also means that the NPCs in your fantasy game just became a completely new level of meta! They can discuss levels and classes with your characters, tell them where to find trainers, help them locate the best areas for their level and tell them what kind of loot different creatures drop. Higher level NPCs can tell characters about the abilities that they gain when they increase in level, and they can offer quests to anyone high enough level to qualify for them. Parties, guilds, and factions have mechanical effects including long-distance communication with one another through raid channels. \nOne of the most significant aspects of this kind of game is that all the chatter around the table about game mechanics just went from out-of-character to in-character. Your characters can benefit from modern world knowledge and use as much regular slang or pop culture references as they want without breaking character (although NPCs may become a little tired of not understanding what they're talking about!). Characters will be offered quests, allowing them to choose their path knowing full well its difficulty and reward. And perhaps most importantly, from the time of character creation, they can take part in events that will shape the (virtual) world they inhabit!\nAn adventurer faces a scout from the orc legion on the steps of Holdfast, the dwarven stronghold!\nInfinity's Edge uses a unique system designed from the ground up to work with conventional gaming dice but to emulate the mechanics in a modern MMO. At its core, the game works on a percentile system, with a fixed difficulty, or Threshold, for any given task. Characters have seven Attributes and gain Skills, both of which affect a character's chance for success on any given task that uses that particular combination. The default Threshold for success on any given roll is 60, meaning that a character will succeed on that roll if they get a 60 or less on a d100 roll. The higher a character's Attributes and Skills, the higher the Threshold goes, making it easier to succeed on the roll. \nThe most important aspects of a character in Infinity's Edge are the three Meters: Health, Stamina, and Mana. Health is used to measure how much damage a character has taken, Stamina is spent to take actions, and Mana is used to fuel magic or supernatural effects.\nOne of the aspects of the game designed to emulate an MMO is the process of Skill acquisition. In Infinity's Edge, characters gain Skills through use. The first time a character attempts and successfully executes a Skill, they gain that Skill at rank 1. After that, they increase in rank through using it successfully. Five successful uses achieves rank 2, then ten successful uses grants rank 3, and so on. For those who prefer less bookkeeping in their games, we included a couple of alternative Skill progression methods suggested by our playtesters so you can customize to suit your preferences! One is based on overcoming challenges (such as battles), while the other is a straight experience point expenditure system. \nCharacters in Infinity's Edge begin at level 1 and gain levels regularly through experience up to a maximum of level 50. At levels 1-9, the characters are Novices, during which time they develop their Attributes and Skills, and determine what their preferred playstyle is. At level 10, a character chooses their first class. Basic Classes, including the core concepts of Warrior, Rogue, Priest, and Wizard, are available to all characters, and there are six Hybrid Classes that mix two Basic Classes together. A combination of Priest and Warrior is a Paladin, for example, while a combination of Rogue and Wizard is called a Shadowmage. And there are Specialist Classes as well, which can be unlocked via play or by finding a trainer.\nWhen a character chooses their first class, they choose three of six powerful, thematic abilities that establish the class's theme. A priest can focus on healing or buffs, for example. Every five levels after 10, a character may choose one additional ability, completing all of the class's default options by level 25 unless substitute abilities are offered through quest unlocks. Then, at level 30, the character chooses their Advanced Class, and an entirely new level of play is unlocked! The core rules of Infinity's Edge focus on the first 30 levels, but Advanced Classes are already in playtest!\nFinally, although the LitRPG genre as well as numerous anime series (which were a strong secondary source of inspiration) tend to have protagonists who cannot log out of the game, in Infinity's Edge that option is still on the table if you want it for your games. Have the real world impact the game world by incorporating interpersonal conflicts between gamers, corporate politics surrounding game releases, and anything else you can think of! It's all in there!\nPlaytest character Aragil (Base Class: Wizard) selects the perfect spell for those pesky bats.\nInfinity's Edge is a full-color rulebook that is estimated at roughly 75-80 pages in length. Choosing to back this Kickstarter entitles you to either a digital copy of the game in the form of a PDF or a print-on-demand physical copy created via DriveThruRPG. If you're reading this, you probably already know how good their products are.\nInfinity's Edge has already been written. It's currently undergoing edits as we speak, and a portion of the art is already finished, with more in development right now. The funds from the Kickstarter will enable us to finish up the rest of the art rather than having to do it over a long period of time and begin layout immediately upon receipt of the art. But, to reiterate, the longest and most arduous part of the process, the writing and playtesting, was completed before this campaign went live. No additional content will be added to the core rules as a result of this Kickstarter, ensuring that delays will be kept to an absolute minimum.\nPlaytest character Hazmatt (Hybrid Class: Scout) evaluates a new piece of loot\n$10 Infinity's Edge PDF - At this basic pledge level, you will receive a PDF of the full-color Infinity's Edge Role-playing Game. In addition, while the art and layout are being finalized, we'll generate a text-only PDF of the rules that will only be available to backers! You can start playing as soon as the campaign is over and payments have been processed. \n$15 Infinity's Edge PDF + Print-on-Demand - In addition to the two PDFs available at the previous level, this pledge will get you an at-cost print copy of our full-color core rulebook. This will allow you to purchase the book for only the cost of printing, which tends to be at or around $5 for a book of this size (although printing costs change over time and we can't predict that). This still allows you to get the PDF/PoD combination for less than it will retail for once it is released to the general public. Because we love you.\n$20 Infinity's Edge Digital Addict - Everything in digital, all the time! You get the two PDFs and the hard copy of the core rulebook as previously described, but you also get a PDF of every unlocked stretch goal. Based on the pricing structure we have in place, this is a cost effective method of getting the stretch goals as soon as the first one is unlocked!\n$40 Infinity's Edge Hard Copy Addict - We're all bibliophiles here, no judgment. This gets your everything from the previous level, plus when we make the stretch goal items available in print-on-demand format, you get at-cost copies of those as well. In the interest of full disclosure, at the retail pricing that we currently have in mind, this particular pledge level becomes cost effective for you when the second stretch goal is unlocked. We don't want anyone to feel as if they aren't getting a great value!\n$150 Immortal Artwork - This is the big one! You get everything else in all the other pledge levels, but in addition, you can submit a picture of yourself (or of someone else, we aren't picky) and tell us what your character's name and class are. We'll commission a piece of art featuring your character! We've done this a few times already. Here's an example of a fan who wanted a \"scholarly rogue type\", and this is the art we had made for him. You can enjoy the same benefits!\nCharacter Gail, the brilliant prodigy, tames a draco-cat (and names her Athena) as her companion!\nWe'll be delighted just to have the game funded, but we have other ideas we want to explore in this game line, and here's what we're already planning on working on. Again, achieving these funding goals will allow us to accelerate the process significantly, rather than waiting on it to fund via sales after the release of the core book.\nDepending upon the complexity of the material and the art density, we expect these books to be somewhere between 16 and 24 pages (but we can't promise that they won't blow up to be much larger if and when inspiration strikes... that's how this entire game was created, after all). Pledge levels allow you to gain access to these in PDF or print-on-demand form, or both. We've included what we hope are very conservative estimates on delivery, just to be sure that we don't run overly late. Hopefully these are later than the actual releases!\n $4,500 - The Next Level: Dramatically expanding the rules in the core book, Next Level adds Advanced Classes for play above level 30 as well as advanced rules for settlements, large-scale battles, factional domains, and LOTS of new races, along with all other sorts of stuff. Imagine this is the first major DLC that makes your game even cooler, and you're starting to get the right picture. Estimated Delivery: October 2019\n $6,000 - Knights of the Edge: This sourcebook will present an assortment of knightly orders to serve as a framework for your campaign, as protagonists, or perhaps even antagonists if you like to run scoundrels! Written by guest designer Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games, one of the most gifted designers and writers in the industry! We are very excited to have him contributing! Estimated Delivery: November 2019\n $7,500 - The Shorefall Campaign: The playtest campaigns for this game centered around the Shorefall zone and the major events that happened there during the beta-testing of the Infinity's Edge MMO (in-game, of course... there's not really an MMO, just in case you're confused). Get everything you need to run the game here, including characters, NPCs, factions, maps, and of course the epic adventure itself. Estimated Delivery: December 2019\n $9,000 - Digital Grimoire: The Infinity's Edge core rulebook includes the basic magic system of the world and rules for designing your own spells and Magic Skills, but there's always room for more! This includes more Magic Skills than you can shake a wand at, and dozens of pre-made spells to save you time! Estimated Delivery: March 2020\n $10,500 - Need vs. Greed: What's better than more equipment? We're talking about loot! Treasure! Epic drops! Rarities, levels, and scalable items! Everything you can imagine, up to and including an optional system to have characters roll to see who gets a loot drop if they want that extra level of reality in the tabletop version of the game! Estimated Delivery: May 2020\n $11,000 - The Shorefall Chronicles: As a recovering fiction writer, the lead designer for the game fictionalized the events of his playtest campaign in what was intended to be a few short stories but what turned into a novel-length LitRPG saga in its own right. Every backer gets a copy in e-book form! Estimated Delivery: January 2020\nPlaytest character Minion (Base Class: Rogue) retrieves some poison for his blades from his inventory\nInfinity's Edge is the second brand to be released by Kyoudai Games since the company first came into existence back in 2013. In that time, we've released dozens of supplements for our flagship game, Thunderscape: the World of Aden. Thunderscape is available for both the first edition of Pathfinder (PF) as well as Savage Worlds (SW). And if you want PDFs, you'll never get them cheaper than as add-ons for this Kickstarter!\nThunderscape Core PDF (PF or SW): $10\nThunderscape Core Book (PF only): $15 with free shipping)\nThunderscape Class Guide PDF (PF only): $8\nThunderscape Adventure Path PDF, volume 1, 2, or 3 (PF only): $10\nThunderscape Worlds PDF Series, volumes 1-8 (PF only): $10\nAden Gazette PDF Series, volume 1-22 (PF or SW): $18\nPlaytest character Mordock (Base Class: Priest) mends a wound using his Magic Skills\nShawn Carman is the lead writer for this game. Having discovered LitRPG during the summer of 2018, he has consumed a truly disturbing number of novels since that time, created a game to play with his friends, then ended up writing an entire rulebook about it and finding artists that could create it with him. Shawn is the former head writer for Legend of the Five Rings at Alderac Entertainment Group (for well over a decade, we might add) as well as the creative director and chief writer for Thunderscape, the flagship RPG of Kyoudai Games for the past six years.\nChris Camarata is an audiobook enthusiast and a fellow LitRPG junkie who got very excited when he heard what Shawn was working on. He has been an invaluable sounding board and system designer for Infinity's Edge, with a particular emphasis on the races and the settlement building rules.\nMike Brodu is the graphic design master for Kyoudai Games, and always the wisest man in the room when it comes down to how things look on the page. He knows exactly what kind of margins there have to be and exactly how big the logo can (and must!) be on the front. He's a dark wizard of pictures and we both love and fear him for his powerful magics.\nKim Wong Lim is the single most prolific artist working on the project and has single-handedly helped determine how this game was going to look. He is both a gentleman and a scholar whose artistic talents cannot be overstated. You can check out more of his amazing work right here! \nPlaytest character Girth Brooks (Specialist Class: Martial Artist) checks out his character sheet.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuestion: Can Kyoudai Games handle this Kickstarter?\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. We learned a lot from the first two, unfortunately most of it being what we shouldn't do. This Kickstarter has no shipped products (except maybe some add-ons that are already in hand and shippable), and limits our stretch goals to avoid over-promising. The book is written (and nothing will be added to the core book through this Kickstarter, which can cause delays), roughly half the art is already complete, and contracts are lined up for the rest as well as for layout. This project is as close to complete as we can make it with our currently available resources.\n\nQuestion: What if the text / art / layout isn't finished?\nThe text is finished. The art is 50% complete and we have arrangements for the rest. We have someone lined up for layout, and if that falls through, we have someone else who can take on the project in the event of an emergency. There is a secondary and tertiary project manager in place with copies of all the assets who can take over if something happens to Shawn. Our failsafes have failsafes. \n\nQuestion: What about printing / shipping issues?\nOur printing and shipping partners at DriveThruRPG operate worldwide and are well known for getting products into the hands of fans at extremely affordable rates and with minimal fuss.

It was critical to us that underrepresented people of the gaming community be able to see a reflection of themselves in the heroines of Charmed and Dangerous. Whether it is their race, heritage, sexual orientation or gender identity, our Princesses do not shy away from letting the world see exactly who they are and where they came from.

These Gifts, supernatural powers, allows all Romuli to rely on extraordinary capabilities and enables some of them, born under a specific moon - and thanks to the influence of the Vibrantes Lumina (the reverberation of Mars through the moon) - to shapeshift, taking on the different wolfish forms and qualities that once made Romulus and Remus the First Werewolves ever existed.\nsome of the horrible creatures of the night.\n You are the Cerberus Legion. You defend Rome from the corruption and the darkness that patiently wait outside the city walls. \nNot only the ferocious and dangerous Remos, the thirsting-for-revenge descendants of Romulus\u2019 twin brother, are to be feared. Many other terrible entities and creatures threaten the lands of the Romans: old terrible giants, murderous beasts and despicable monsters, deadly spirits from the underworld, Gods and demons of the forgotten folks.\nDangerous & Deadly is the Old Dark World.   \nHere's the story of Romulus and Remus, the story of Rome. \nBorn from the abuse thatthe God Mars perpetrated against Rea Silvia, a vestal - a virgin priestess of the Goddess Vesta \u2013 the illegitimate sons of the God of War were abandoned still in swaddling clothes in the perilous lands of the Cermalus and left to die. \nHowever, the infants were miraculously saved and weaned by a she-wolf, who was actually nothing but an ancient Divinity of Nature, known as Lupercus. \nRomulus and Remus grew up as extraordinarily capable men on one side, and as powerful beasts on the other. Their divine ancestry made them more than just men.. made them Gods among human beings. \nEndowed with the supernatural power of Mars, which had made them as powerful as dozen warriors in battle, and of the Lupercal Gifts - which had made them able to shift their human form into that of wolves or werewolves - were the First Kings of a wild world that clamored for being shaped and guided towards its own, glorious destiny. \nThe hands of the two Kings rose from the swamps of the Velabrum to seize the sky from which their godly father watched them, and laid the foundations of the largest and most great Empire that the history of man would have ever known.  \n..a rising Rome, between swamps, forests and hills.\nUnfortunately, ambition, power, and the enormous differences of opinion about their place in the world, their nature, and about and humanity itself, made them enemies and finally led to an infamous, cursed epilogue: the fratricide. \nThe progeny of the defeated Remus - the furious and savage Remos - swore bloodthirsty revenge against the First King, his entire race and Rome itself.\n\"Vindicta Comitatur Remos\"(\"revenge accompanies the sons of Remus\") was the cry with which they left the city howling, to take refuge in the darkness of the wildlands outside the city borders. Their lands, the lands their father considered the true Kingdom the Gods would have wanted him and his brother to rule upon. \nThat very sentence, shouted at every ambush, every raid, and every massacre they perpetrated against the Romans from that moment on, gave them the name \"Remos\".\nThe Romuli, however, swore to defend their father's kingdom from their blood-cousins and any other earthly, divine or infernal threat.  \nThat's how the Cerberus Legion was born: a silent army, an occult brotherhood. All the descendants of Romulus, every single man and woman endowed with part of his supernatural powers and extraordinary abilities has the sacred duty to fight the darkness, wherever it arises, to protect human kind from those dangers that from deep darkness try to seize them and devour them, and to face the Remos, as well as death, with courage and honor, in the name of Rome, in the name of Quirinus, in the name of the Moon and Mars.\nThis whole revisited legend, function as a background to the endless, exciting and terrible adventures of an original setting where REAL history and mythology merge with horror and and fantasy, to give the best of themselves, thanks to a unique, modern, fun and successfully play-tested system.\nFirst Kings is a narrative RPG with a modern system that involves numerology and moon phases during the character creation,  and that drives the players to use narration, storytelling, zodiac, and brains (along with a pool of d12 sided dice when necessary!) to approach and solve the scenes that the Game Master creates for them.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\nFirst of all, set an \"off game\" date of birth of the player/character (you can invent it, you can choose your own date of birth, your mother's, your favorite sport player's, the date of a particular event, etc.).\nNow, adding the units composing the date, one after the other, you can determine your Guide Number, a number that defines - on a specific list - your character's Lupercal Gifts (special abilities & talents).\nThe Moon under which your character is born (again, you can arbitrarily choose one, or look up the moon phase corresponding to the date of birth you previously chose) determines which kind of Romulus (singular for Romuli) is your player character.\n A character born under a Full Moon is called Lupus Rex. \n A character born under a Perfect Half Moon is called Lupus. \n A character born under a Waining or Waxing Moon is called Falx. \n A character born under a New Moon is called Obscuratum. \nThe first three types of Romuli all gain, thanks to the heritage of Mars and Lupercus, a Superior Strength, Animal Senses (human senses improvement) and the Howl (with the howl,  like wolves, Romuli can communicate with each other, in disguise); \nthen - through the conveying of the Vibrantes Lumina - a Lupus Rex is capable of changing into a Werewolf Form, a Lupus can instead turn into a Wolf Form, while a Falx can't shapeshift as the others, but possesses the Will of the First King that makes him naturally intimidating against the Remos, naturally inspiring for humans, and more versatile and better skilled than the rest (more Attitude Points* available in the Zodiac*).\nThe Obscuratum - even considered a cursed one between the Romuli - has got nothing in common with the others. Not a \"wolf\", not receiving the influence of Mars through the riverberation of the moon, receives instead the influence of Hecate, a dark Goddess which guarantees the Obscuratum powers beyond imagination: this type of Romulus can change into everything he wants, but a wolf or a werewolf. He could change into any other animal, person, vegetal, or element thanks to the spell of Hecate.\n\nSCENES & ATTITUDE TESTS\nWhen the Game Master unfold a scene that involves a challenge for the characters, players have to face it, narrating their act as protagonists of the Scene, and including an Attitude Test.\nFirst Kings is focused on role-playing and storytelling. The first thing you need is to create a dynamic Scene, which manages to convey all the sensations and the purpose you have in mind. \nIn this game there are no pre-established turns, initiative rolls and other traditional stuff, everything happens dynamically and coherently, so if you pass an Attitude Test, just let yourself go and let your imagination flow: the Scene is in your hands, and you can pick at it in the most spectacular, glorious, normal, dramatic, epic or moving way.\nA Scene is a short narrative arc without a specific duration (it can last a few minutes, like a few hours), and within it, players can perform one or more Attitude Tests: \nOnce the player has described his intentions and how to put them into practice, the Game Master declares the value of the Difficulty Class (DC) of the Scene andthe Zodiac Symbols involved and/or needed to solve it.  At this point, the player can evaluate whether to change strategy or optimize the current one, continuing the narration and counting how many Attitude Points (AP: points assigned to certain symbols during the character creation) his character would score, based on the chosen Zodiac Symbols and their related AP.\nIf the Attitude Points reach the DC, the test is passed, and the narration is totally in the hands of the player until the end of the current scene. \nthe other way around, if the Attitude Points are not enough,  then the player has to force the action using the Attitude Roll, which consists in throwing 6 twelve-sided dice (d12), where each number of the dice corresponds to a Zodiac Symbols (as indicated on the character sheets):\nIf the player rolls and obtains one or more numbers corresponding to the symbols he chose for his act, filling the missing points to reach the DC, then he passes the forced test. \nIf, on the other hand, an Attitude Roll fails the narration goes back in the hands of the Game Master who tells the consequences and dynamics of the failure. If the character's state of health gets involved in the scene, in any way (from a fight to a danger related to the environment), the player compares the difference between the Points of Failure and the DC and determine how many steps towards the Avernus (hell, or underworld) the character takes.  (The use of protective equipment and/or the temporary use of Aries Points reduces the gap) \n\nZODIAC SYMBOLS\nCharacter Sheet (Back)\nFrom the beginning, the players have 6 Attitude Points available to be assigned to various Zodiac Symbols, thus giving shape to their type of character. \nThrough Zodiac Symbols, players can approach the various Scenes and Attitude Tests that the Game Master puts on their way. Based on their AP,  players can act most appropriately and consistently, impersonating their characters.\nDepending on how the players decide to take a test, the GM stabilizes the difficulty of the scene and suggest which Zodiac Symbols make sense to be involved.\nThere are no lists of skills, talents, features, etc. All these series of information are managed in the game by the Zodiac Symbols that represent different general attitudes, and divide into three branches: \n Corporeum: Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Gemini.\n Res Militaris: Leo, Sagittarius, Cancer, Scorpio.\n Doctrina: Virgo, Libra, Aquarius, Capricorn.\nThe Corporeum branch represents the physical attributes such as strength, resistance, agility, senses, etc.\nThe Res Militaris branch represents tactical attitudes such as close or ranged combat, the use of the environment,  stealth, equipment, military knowledge, etc.\nThe Doctrina branch represents the relationship with the Gods of the archaic Capitoline Triad, with the Dark Gods, the knowledge, the political art, diplomacy, etc.\n\nRITUALS TO THE GODS    \nLupercalia Ritual\nRituals in the game can have the most different effects, but to officiate a ritual, it takes time and concentration. They have to be officiated in advance, and if well executed, they offer gifts that can to be used quickly. \nIn First Kings, rituals are fully created by the Players who have characters with at least 1 AP in Virgo or Capricorn. \nRituals require ingredients, which serve as a narrative cue to create the effects of the rite. ingredients serve to stimulate the imagination and to always put the narration at the center of the game.\n\nDISTANCE FROM THE AVERNUS\nThe distance from the Avernus can be compared to the state of health of the character. The Steps from the Avernus are 3:\n \"Far Away\" from it, \n  \"A Few Steps Away\" from it,  \n \"At the gates\" of it.\nAfter that, players fall \"into the Kingdom of Pluto\". (Taking steps towards the dark doors of the Avernus implicates malus, both narratively and mechanically, that gets heavier the more the character gets near the Avernus.)\nCharacter Sheet (Front)\n......................................................................................................................................... \nFREE SHIPPING for EU, UK & US only (more details down below, in the \"Estimated Shipping Costs\" section)\n ......................................................................................................................................... \nAUTHORS:\nThe idea for the setting and the game system of First Kings was conceived by Matteo Sanfilippo, a cook and an unpublished Italian author. He met Epic Party Games last summer (2018) while looking for game designers and/or publishers to take part in his project.  \nMatteo Sanfilippo, Max Castellani, Andrea Macchi (@ PLAY Modena Comic Con)\nAndrea Macchi and Max Castellani (Epic Party Ltd founders) studied and play-tested the game in its rough first draft, and immediately knew that, yes, they should have worked a lot to bring that draft to become a tested, bug-less, running game, but the premises were nothing but extraordinary! The depth of the setting, its extreme originality, and particularity, not to mention the winning intuition that was already palpable about the game system mechanics, although it would have required lots of late-night design sessions to make it entirely work at its full potential! \nAndrea & Max are the Authors and Designers of a previously successful campaign here on Kickstarter for the Myth Punk RPG Shattered Tower (delivering this summer).\nThey founded Epic Party Games last year, after that success, and hope First Kings RPG will be their consecration into the Role-Playing Game Industry! #FingerCrossed :P \nMAIN ILLUSTRATOR:\nFor First Kings we knew we needed the right artwork.\nThe Dark-Horror vibe of the setting suggested us to work with black and white illustrations and the need to get simple but highly evocative images, pushed us to call up an old friend (the main illustrator for Shattered Tower RPG): Daniele Solimene \nWe're really proud to have him on this project too, and we hope we'll reach those goals that will allow us to make him upgrade the current artworks and to add tons and tons of new and gorgeous ones! \n\nNOTE:\nFirst Kings content is moderate in impact and could be classified as Mature.\nThe Game contains fiction content of moderate impact. Anybody can have access to this material, however, games of fiction may include classifiable elements such as violence, nudity, slavery (in the historical epoch in which the game takes place, slavery was largely practiced.) and other themes of moderate impact that may be not recommended for people that could find themselves uncomfortable roleplaying with those tones.\n Obviously we do not personally approve, endorse or promote - in any way - any of these themes or practices, in real life. \nFees will be collected with BackerKit survey.

The page count will go between 160 and 200 pages (estimation can change due to layout and stretch goals).

I\u2019m French, living near Nantes. I\u2019m a player of all sorts: roleplaying games, board games, miniature games, videogames. And also a father and husband. I\u2019m 35 years old, and been in RPG since I\u2019ve discovered Hero Quest and the Fighting Fantasy books at the age of 12.\nOutside games, I like to watch sports, have been a soccer player for 20 years and a fan of Liverpool since almost ever. I like to read fiction and sports/explorer biographies. Also a big comic book reader. I like being outside, walking in the nature. I enjoy good beers (IPA, Stouts, Crafts\u2026).\nI always created stuff for the RPG I played (and for other games too). During the last years, I started releasing translations (in French) of story games and micro-RPGs. I also started to work on my own stuff, like Fiasco playsets, Monster of the Week mysteries, and one-page RPG (Gangs of Mutants of New York, Crime Scene Investigators, You are all Duncan!). I also joined RPG-Creation contests (Game Chef, French ThreeForged Challenge, 200-Word RPG\u2026).\nFacing the Titan is my first attempt to get a full RPG in a neat book and PDF. It\u2019s auto-edited, tested in various French conventions, and revised, and revised.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe text of the game is almost done in its primary language (French). The only things that are still left to include in the book are a big example and the elements that you, backers, will create. Companions, Reunion Sites and Company Names. They will be fast to add. The Titans will require some more time, but having all the rest ready before the campaign free that time.\n\nTranslation is already under way and each time a section of the game is said \"done\", it's going into translation.\n\nThe main illustrations are also done, and Roger Heal will work on the additional art as soon as the campaign finishes. Each additional Titan added to the game will be illustrated. Roger proved to be able to make awesome Titans in schedule by the past.\n\nThe layout of the book is already in the work. The main templates are done and already used in the promotional material. Some parts are already done, and this is a work that will be continued during the campaign.\n\nI already made a physical proof of the book to try out the DriveThruRPG process of printing. I know what I need to care for and what needs to be corrected.\n\nSome stretch goals are already planned and partially written. It will save time to have them included in the book. I have a list of Stretch Goals ready to be added to the book, and other ideas if we go very well. In this case, I will plan a later release of a second PDF/book with later stretch goals for late 2019/early 2020.

Roleplay is at the forefront of this system and thus actions that are not under duress, such as combat, and have a small penalty for failure should be treated in a roleplay manner, rather than relying on a die roll.\nNon-combat actions like competencies within the pursuit system, such as lockpicking, roll a single d10 and apply the user\u2019s knowledge (pursuit bonus) and compare it to the level of difficulty. The result is either a success, success with a bonus (allowing an additional effect), success with a minor penalty (allowing success but at a minor penalty, such as breaking the lock in the process), success with a major penalty (a more significant penalty, such as breaking your tools or making a large amount of noise) and finally failure, which like it\u2019s name means the competency check fails. \nCombat actions fall into two categories, main combat rolls and secondary combat rolls. Main combat rolls are the base actions, such as attacking and defending, and use the hit degree table. To make an attack, or to defend from one, a single d10 is rolled and the specific statistic is then added to the roll, such as offence for an attack. This result is then reduced by the enemies opposing statistic, such as defence for the same action. Finally, this result is compared against a short table which specifies any bonus damage or loss of damage from that roll and can on rare occasions even end in a missed attack, although as specified earlier, this is not often the case. All attacks have their damage further reduced by any mitigation the target has.\nCritical miss/hit. A critical hit is only applied to main combat rolls and adds a small bonus based on the roll result of a second d10 result. To get a critical hit the roll result after all bonuses and penalties must be a 15 or higher. A critical miss not only misses the target as normal, but also causes a minor penalty based on a d10 result. Getting a critical miss is caused when the full roll result is lower than a 1.\nSecondary combat rolls are the simplest of rolls. They function in the same way as a main combat roll, adding the statistic to a single die roll followed by reducing the amount by the enemy\u2019s statistic. The difference here is that the result must be a 5 or higher or simply fail entirely. This form has no critical successes or failures.\nDisclaimer: All artwork shown here is either owned by Beirdo Games LLP or licensed for use with this kickstarter and owned by Mike Corriero who will be doing the artwork for the game book. See his website. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe funding we are asking is the minimum required for the editing of the books through a professional editor and the artwork from Mike Corriero, a great artist. Kickstarter isn't just a great way for us to get funding, it's an amazing way of connecting with the people interested in our project. Our aim is to work together with you, the players, to make The ADVANCED: Pandemonium everything it can be. \nWhat you get\nPDF: The pdf is a digital version of the different books which are available in their early versions while the game is on kickstarter as well as the finalized version after Kickstarter. The pdf will be constantly updated and available for download for the owners, always containing all changes and new artwork.\nBook: The book contains everything in the pdf version, albeit changes in the form of errata's will only be in books purchased after the changes are made.\nDice: We offer as a kickstarter exclusive, 2 ten sided dice made especially for this system. One die with the numbers 0-9 and one with the numbers 00-90 to be used for percentages.\nGuideline Cards: Like the dice, we offer a kickstarter exclusive set of poker sized cards that contain the information of all ailments symptoms, conditions, stances and special attacks for easier referencing.\nPoster: A nice poster of Pandemonium's cover art.\nGame master's screen:  Like the guideline cards, this four piece cardboard screen has the most important rules and options written on it to make the life of the game master easier.\nConcept Art Book: A beautiful art book containing the art in progress, showing how the final art got to where it was.\nAstral Edition: A Collector's edition book with additional artwork and a special cover.\nDice Box: A special wooden dice box with 3 slots, 2 for the 2 dice and 1 large slot for the pack of guideline cards.\nBestiary: A book containing all of the creatures and beautiful artwork depicting the magnificent creatures.\nExtra Information\nThe Books: The full PDFs will be available shortly after the Kickstarter campaign is successfully completed, expected delivery time is 2 months. This is so that our editor can read through and refine the book, ensuring clarity, whilst our designer can prepare the book for artwork. After the initial release, we will regularly update the game PDFs as artwork is completed so that you don't have to wait to play. The finalised hardcover books are planned to be shipped in the summer of 2020, when all artwork should be completed. All the reward tiers that include a hardcover book will also have access to the game book PDFs as they are updated.\nShipping: On top of your backer tier cost, we will be charging for shipping to ensure the books can be delivered reliably and safely.

The reason we're here is to fund the artwork and the creation of the game book.\n\nThe main risks involved are those regarding delivery, which is why we plan to partner up with distribution companies that can do this for us, as opposed to trying to manage it ourselves. However, despite our efforts there is always a risk of shipping delays or lost shipments and we have set aside a small portion of our funding budget to ensure that if something does happen, we can immediately resend lost packages without a problem. in addition, we will be utilising tracking on all our deliveries to ensure backers know exactly where their package is.\n\nThe other risk we have is the potential for a delayed book release due to how long artwork can take to complete. It's impossible to predict this, we can only estimate, so please bear with us if there are delays. We can promise that we will be doing everything we can to minimize delays if they occur and will make it known as far in advance as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Beirdo Games LLP\n3 created \u00b7 1 backed\nBeirdo Games LLP is a partnership between Matthew Cochran and Henk Bouwknegt.

Players take on the role of elite mercenaries that specialize in investigation and violence. No magic or fantasy, but tons of cybernetics, genetic enhancements, nanobots, drones, hacking, androids, high tech guns and armor, and other amazing tech! \nCadre of Professionals.  You and your allies are a cadre, a lean start-up corporation that specializes in investigation, intelligence, protection, and violence. To keep their hands clean, the syndicates often outsource this kind of work to smaller outfits, like yours. Your cadre's skillset is in high demand in this intrigue filled world, being sought after by megacorporations, nation-states, organized crime, or wealthy individuals. As an autonomous entity, your cadre of elite agents takes contracts as you see fit, navigating the shadows of corporate espionage and savagery with competence and panache. Discreet. Elite. Disposable.        \nTwo cadre mercs negociate with a client regarding \"acquired\" transgenic embryos\nPlasticity of Genes, Form, and Human Nature. Large sections of the human population have had their genes chosen before birth to breed success, while others have had foreign DNA included to produce wholly different physical traits that were once thought inhuman. On top of all the innate genetic tweaking, individuals modify themselves through cyberware surgeries and biohacks, to the point where some are considered entirely \"posthuman\". \nA large cadre of bioengineered badasses!\nSupercomputer in your Bloodstream. The human condition as a whole has become something somewhat different. Somewhere along the way almost every single human has been modified to have a powerful supercomputer coded directly into their DNA and physiology, one that has merged with their consciousness. In this world the internet has become as real as the physical world and hackers have become manipulators of the very stuff of the human psyche, probing and rearranging memory and mind the way a potter molds clay.\nNu-Pets\u2122, a subsidary of Apollo Laboratories, produces many lines of transgenic critters!\nViolent, Shallow, and Unequal. Multinational corporations have gobbled each other up, producing ever larger entities until only nine remain, each of which is a superpower bigger than most of the world\u2019s countries. Corporate executives have the power to shatter entire governments in the name of their company\u2019s share value and their own ambition. Gangs and organized crime saturate every urban environment. This world, bloated from overpopulation and consumer greed, has become one of the most violent eras in human history. The rich segregate themselves from the poor, and the tension caused by this wealth gap is causing the world to burst at the seams.\nVirtual Immortality.  Recent innovations have allowed the rich to undergo a process that maps their entire nervous system, connectome, endocrine complement, DNA and gene expression, and every other feature relevant to the human mind. This digitization of consciousness allows the world's wealthy and powerful to essentially live forever, switching from one bioengineered shell to another as they see fit.  \nA cadre merc from the Asura genome persuading a suit to give up the goods!\n GeneFunk 2090 Core Rulebook \nThe full hardcover of the GeneFunk 2090 Core Rulebook will be printed on thick #80 paper in premium color, a full offset print run! Everything you need to run and play GeneFunk 2090 at a table. It will be around 224-260 pages, depending on how the layout develops! \nThe GeneFunk 2090 Core Rulebook PDF will be fully bookmarked, for easy navigation, and will work well with tablet users.\nBoth will be filled with lucious cyberpunk art, including full page spreads, with over 100 beautiful illustrations from William Liberto, Dean Spencer, Nate Artuz, Dimas Raviandra, Enmanuel Martinez Lema, and others! These artists really bring the biopunk world of GeneFunk to life!\nGeneFunk 2090 comes as color PDF, or premium color hardcover book!\nTo get a sense of what will be in the final book, you can check out our GeneFunk 2090 Setting Book, for FREE here, or here! \nThe Busan Bamboozle - A Starter Investigation\nThis 20 page starter contract is set in the bustling port city of Busan, Korea. Busan is a hotbed of criminal activity, with four different major crime syndicates (North and South Jopok, Russian Bratva, and Yakuza) perpetually vying to expand their borders in a zero-sum game with their competition. Can your cadre navigate their way through the fierce criminal ecosystem and transgenic gangs to complete their contract, and raise their Mosaic score?\nIt will also contain beautiful, thematic, biopunk art throughout! \nIt is designed for level 3 characters, that takes from 1-3 sessions to complete, and ends with the characters being level 4.  \nGeneFunk 2090 Fillable Character Sheet\nIt's always nice to have a character sheet to match the setting, and who doesn't love the option of having it as a fillable form? It is two pages, with the back side containing area for known hacks.\nThe GeneFunk 2090 Core Rulebook will include mechanics for:\n60+ CYBERNETIC UPGRADES!\n13 DIFFERENT BIOENGINEERED GENOMES!\n45 DIFFERENT GENETIC ENHANCEMENTS!\n8 NEW CLASSES WITH 21 ARCHETYPES!\n31 NEW FEATS!\n13 NEW BACKGROUNDS!\nMIND HACKING, BIOHACKING, ENGINEERING HACKING!\nROBOTS, DRONES, AND ANDROIDS!\nBIOENGINEERED BEASTS, PLANTS, AND FUNGI!\nDRUGS!\nLOTS OF GUNS AND ARMOR!\nRANDOM ENCOUNTERS!\nCHASE RULES!\nThe J\u00f6tunn Ultima cybernetic arm, doing what it's made for!\nA biker injecting some Nootro to gain an edge (left), and a Ronin Soldier happy to be wearing an Atomos\u2122 Battlesuit (right)!\nJust a tiny sample of the drones available!\n 7,500 - PREGEN CHARACTERS. ***UNLOCKED***  There will be pregenerated characters made for every class at levels 1, 3, and 7, compiled in a PDF to aid in getting right into the game!\n 10,000 - GM SCREEN (PDF). ***UNLOCKED***  A nice handy dandy GM screen, summarizing all of the regularly used rules on an 8-panel PDF with art, in both portrait and landscape orientation.\n 12,500 - OFFSET PRINT RUN. ***UNLOCKED*** The quality of the printed books will get even BETTER once we get here, as I could afford to do an offset print run through PrintNinja. This may affect the shipping costs for backers not from Canada, UK, or USA.\n 17,500 - ROLL20 TOKENS + SHEET. ***UNLOCKED*** Digital top-down graphical tokens will be created for all of the classes and some of the NPCs, at least 20 in total, possibly more! They will be in PNG format. A Roll20 character sheet will also be created!\n 25,000 - ART BOOST + CARDS. ***UNLOCKED*** At this amount, expect even mooooaarr fantastic art! Also, printable cards for hacks and gear, in PDF form!\n 35,000 - SETTING BOOK: SHADOWS OF KOREA. ***UNLOCKED*** A book describing Korea, Land of the Morning Calm, in the year 2090. It will include dozens of major NPCs, fantastic art, plot hooks, details on the crime syndicates and major chaebol corporate powers, popular Korean genomes, and more! It will be a sandbox setting used as the basis for a GeneFunk 2090 campaign. It will be released as a PDF, with print on demand options through DriveThruRPG.\nA Yakuza smuggler eyes up his illicit prize. The scientists at Thunder Lizards Inc. knew they could, and Yakuza money made the \"should\" question irrelevant.\nAll backers will receive all stretch goal rewards! If we are more successful than we anticipate, and add physical products to stretch goals for $50K+, only  backers at certain pledge levels might receive them.\nDigital goods (such as PDFs) will be delivered through DriveThruRPG. I'll use Kickstarter's survey system to gather your email addresses! The PDF will be sent out as soon as it's done, so likely October! If you are interested in playtesting before then, we will start round 4 in June, and you can message me. \nPhysical book fulfillment delivered through BackerKit. I'll use Backerkit's survey system to gather your email addresses! We will be doing a full print run, and delivery will be handled by one of the many excellent suggestions from proven Kickstarter veterans, so I'm using the wisdom of those that have walked before me. :) I'll work on getting fullfillment services in Australia, Canada, UK, and USA. My estimated date of delivery (giving myself lots of leeway) is February 2020, but it may well be done before then!\nShipping costs will be collected separately. It's the only way to have completely accurate assessment of shipping costs! To reiterate, shipping costs are separate from your pledge. After the campaign ends, and the books are printed, you will receive an email that will take you to a store front where you can put in your address, and pay the correct shipping cost.  Since we'll be shipping through DriveThruRPG, you can find an estimate of shipping costs here.  If we achieve the $12,500 strech goal, we'll be shipping through fullfillment services, which might affect shipping costs in areas outside of Canada, UK, or USA. \nI started on this project 18 years ago while in a Graphics Design program, and it may have even been an influence behind me steering my education towards molecular bio for my M.Sc, hahaha. :D   I've had a lot of help along the way! \nKiller artists like William Liberto, Dean Spencer, Nate Artuz, Dimas Raviandra, Enmanuel Martinez Lema, Trung Tin Shinji, Tony 'MrKrane' Carter, and Sonnaz are all a part of this creation.\nSpecial thanks to Retrology, for use of their track \"Time\" in the promo video, the RPG design community, and all the playtesters!\nMe in the lab, working on some insect DNA!

In the offset print run scenario, the shipping costs are certain to remain similar for USA, UK, and Canada, but other locations may be affected by higher shipping costs depending on if I can obtain a fulfillment service for smaller orders in those areas (the shipping cost may even go down if so).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 2 or more", "title": "I Don't Play RPGS, But I Support You!", "descp": "Pledge this level if you want to show me support, but have no interest in playing RPGs, and the higer levels are looking a little too hard on your budget.

Think cyberpunk goes wild west. It's an episodic game that focuses on otherism, class, and colonialism.\nSundown is a dyslexia-friendly, campaign-length rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players, one of whom is the lorekeeper, with a suggested session length of 3-4 hours.\nSundown tells political stories of a small and intimate scope. You play multiple campaigns and characters in the same world, your next one inheriting the world from your last. Your actions, though small, will ripple across history.\nYou play a drifter: a queer, punk outcast taking work wherever you can from folk that hate you.\nLotus and Sati fighting off a swarm of Crowdogs by Mayara Sampaio\nFiends, the monsters of this world, linger at the edges of civilization. There\u2019s always someone who wants some fiend dead.\nAutocrats and Lords point their fingers at each other while Syndicates and Revolutions rot their thrones beneath them. Drifters who don\u2019t slay fiends oft find themselves slaying folk instead.\nBut maybe you prefer to keep your hands clean. You\u2019re a spy, stealing secrets from one corporatist for another, or you\u2019re a thief, liberating the hoarded wealth of lords and bankers.\nMaybe you\u2019re lucky. One of the few of \u2018legitimate\u2019 employ. You work for the Merchant Protections Guild, a diplomat and ambassador to the townships of Sundown, struggling to keep the highroad from crumbling\u2026 and Sundown\u2019s delicate peace with it.\nA Map of Sundown by Tad Davis\nSundown brings body mods into the frontier with some things called changes. \nSundown is littered with things that change your body - slip into some tailtar and you'll grow a tail. Snack on some indigoji, and you'll turn blue. The science of changing takes these things from the wild and combines them in new ways to create totally different changes. The experiments are mostly consensual.\nPeek's Peak, a massive spire of rock jutting out from the sea, with buildings along the spire and boats at a small dock - by Orion\nTo get your changes, though, you'll need the coin, the reagents, a scientist that likes you, and a month of spare time. Be cautious. Most folk in Sundown don't take kindly to changelings. The march of science pushes us further and further from tradition, and the demagogues of yesteryear struggle to keep power.\nTake the long sail to Sundown and fight for the right to mold your body as you choose.\n\nHow Does the Game Work?\nSundown uses a simple roll to resolve every situation, from slaying a fiend to giving a speech. You roll a single 6-sided die and try to overcome a difficulty between 1 and 9.\nTo make your drifter, you answer six questions about their life. You\u2019ll refine each answer into a short, snappy statement about their personality or skills. These are called Traits.\nA frogbeast, sitting with its wings splayed in the floodgrass, a cat perched on its head. - By Orion\nWhen you roll against a challenge, the lorekeeper sets a difficulty, and you count the traits that could give you an edge. Each adds 1 to your roll. Sometimes you\u2019ll be in an advantageous position or have the perfect tools for the job. This can give you an edge, too. If you meet or exceed the difficulty, you succeed!\nBut if you fail, you take Stress. Stress is kind of like Sundown\u2019s hit points. There are three kinds: Anxiety, Exhaustion, and Injury. Stress is hard to get rid of, too. Healing items have severe overdose penalties, and you can only heal naturally with your precious downtime.\nStretch Goals\n$7,500 - Hardcover Upgrade\nIf we reach $7,500, we can print enough books to upgrade the hardcovers from casebound to a foil stamped faux leather binding. It'll be much nicer to touch, hold, and use, and you'll get to show off your fancy book to all your friends.\n$10,000 - Sundown Audio Book\nIf we reach $10,000, we can produce a Sundown audio book with twitch streamer and voice actor Astreigha's melodious voice. Everyone who gets a PDF will get this audio book, too!\n$15,000 - Art & Layout Upgrade\nCurrently, we do our layout in house. We're pretty good, but we're new to this, and we can do better. With $15,000, we can hire a layout artist and graphic designer and commission even more art to bring Sundown that next level up to Gorgeous.\n$20,000 - My Name is Vengeance\nWhen an Aehalan weapons master dies, his former apprentice is sent out into the dangerous world of Sundown, deeper than they've ever been, to discover the truth of their Master's death. Was it the brutality of man, the jaws of a beast, or something much worse. \nMy Name is Vengeance - Sel Bell\n'My Name is Vengeance' will be a novella set in Sundown, written by Sel, a Tsalagi author and language revival activist. It will be produced as a PDF, and everyone who gets a Sundown PDF will receive a copy.\n$25,000 - Offset Print Run\nCurrently, we're looking at digital printing simply because we don't know how many folks out there want to join us in Sundown. For low quantities, digital printing is ideal, but if we hit $25,000, we'll have enough orders to get offset printing for our books. This will be a significant bump up in print quality!\n$30,000 - Extra Module\nSundown\u2019s \u2018Heat Cheats\u2019 give you evocative but short notes to seed your creativity as you create your own adventures. With $30,000 though, we can bring on a fellow game designer to craft a full module complete with multiple heats, new wonders, and new changes for you to explore and experiment with. \nWhat Else?\nIf we fund even higher, keep an eye on our stretch goals. See what we dream up, or tell us what you\u2019d like to see. \n\nWhat We Have For Our Backers\nBackerKit & Shipping\nWe will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager for this campaign. If you'd like to increase your pledge or add things to your pledge, like extra dice, you'll be able to do that through BackerKit. If we fund, you'll even be able to pre-order well after May 10th, up until we send Sundown off to the printers!\nYou won't be prompted to pay shipping or tax up front when you back. We collect your information, like the address we'll ship to, after the end of our campaign in a survey. We will use our survey to collect the cost of shipping and taxes on all your backer rewards.\nBelow with each physical tier are estimates for shipping to the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and the rest of the world. We can't promise this is exactly what you'll pay, but this is our best guess, erring on the high side so you hopefully won't pay more than you expected.\nPlay It Forward!\nOnce we get our BackerKit rolling - it could take a day or two - there will be an add-on option in our pledge manager to pay for an additional PDF. Give it to your friend, or leave it with us and we'll make sure it goes to a fan in need.\nEmilie's Sunring - by Orion\n$1 - Thank You\nThis tier will get you your name in the book and backer-exclusive updates to help you stay up to date on Sundown\u2019s Kickstarter campaign. \n$15 - The E-Reader\nThis tier snags you illustrated and plaintext PDFs of Sundown and your name in the book! \n$30 - The Softcover\nThis tier gets you the PDFs, your name in the book, and a softcover of Sundown in your hands.

Here's a few examples of that!\n\n\u201cSundown asks an awesome question: What if Cyberpunk but Cowboy-Western But Bloodbourne But Gender-fluid But Wild But Nuanced? \nThis is a game that will excite and inspire your table. The world is bizarre, creepy, and very VERY cool. \nSundown feels like a fully realized world, but it's also waiting for you to jump in and make it your own. It's beautifully crafted and easy to pick up and play. The game has fantastic bones to it, and the character creation process is one of the most fun things I've experienced!\u201d\n-Jamila R. Nedjadi of Sword Queen Games\n\n\"The world of Sundown satiates the hungriest of players looking for a wild west/sci-fi collaborative storytelling space. It inspects cyberpunk through a lens that focuses on the characters. It's so easy to get lost in this beautiful immersive world!\" \n-Banana Chan\nSketches of four different poses of a Frogbeast in flight\n\"Sundown is a deceptively simple game, written with brevity and clarity. It centers an experience of small, personal struggles as outsiders in a world that changes you, and fast. It takes the tone and scope seriously and puts safety tools in your hands up front to help with that. The setting is fractured and beautiful and leaves so much room for stories and exploration, and it lends itself to the picaresque style of play I so enjoy.\"\n-Michael T Lombardi\n\"Sundown is an RPG That places culture, class and history at the forefront of its setting, exploring these ideas in a vibrant and exciting new world full of unique twists on old concepts and evocative mysteries. Combine this with a simple, robust system and some snappy clever writing and you have one of the most exciting little games out there.\"\n-Liam Ginty of Sandy Pug Games\nSandy Pug Award presented to Grasswatch Games For outstanding achievement in the fields of queerness and also making cool games back Sundown on KS now.\n\"Sundown has a compelling, unique setting with easy to learn rules that express the setting and your characters. I love the descriptive Traits & Aspects system and how it defines characters. The chapter on consent at the table is a vital element for most modern RPGs.\"\n-Adrian Thoen, creator of Impulse Drive\n\n\"Sundown\u2019s an honest to goodness diverse science-fiction weird-west setting. The system is simple enough to run with little prep, but is set up for long term play. The wealth, reputation, and resource mechanics are not too crunchy but also expansive enough to make character advancement rewarding and meaningful. It\u2019s the perfect set up to play a number of games in different, fascinating locales, to develop a meaningful legacy of play. I\u2019m so glad I picked up the beta, I\u2019m looking forward to the full version.\"\n-Chris Challice, author of Seith and Sword, Space Pirate Alice Black: Blood Tribute, and Vanagard\n\n\"Sundown is a new exploration on identity and our place in the world that takes elements of cyberpunk and puts them in a new environment. It approaches changing your body frankly, which appeals to me as a trans nonbinary person, and makes something fantastical instead something real, something imperfect in the fiction but still impressive. All of this while including some fascinating approaches to healing, and touching on how politics affect people.

Both of them will speak, marked by \"L A\" when L A begins speaking, and \"James\" when James begins speaking.\nL A\nHi, I\u2019m L A Wilga. I\u2019m the author of Sundown and the director of Grasswatch Games.\nJames\nAnd I\u2019m James, the primary editor of Sundown and the assistant director of Grasswatch Games.\n [The on-screen video focus shifts to a map of Sundown, zoomed in over Farmsmeet Woodsedge, and Smallmouth.]\nL A\nSundown is a low tech science-fantasy set in a transhumanist frontier. Think cyberpunk goes West Marches.  [The view of the map changes to show Seawell and Grasswatch.]\nYou play a drifter: a queer outcast taking work wherever you can from folk that hate you. [Two people sitting on the floor, filling out character sheets.]\nTo make your drifter, you answer six questions about their life. [Camera shifts to show a close of up of two sets of hands filling out character sheets on the floor] \nAt the end, you\u2019ll have six traits that define you. Sundown runs on a single d6. [View cuts between the same group of people, the group gesturing and chatting as they continue writing on their character sheets.]\nWhen you roll, you take a look at your traits and count the ones that could give you an edge.  This kind of open-ended system gives  us a lot of room to spin outrageous stories.\nJames\n[View shifts to a still image of a different group of players, posing for the camera in front of a small table with character sheets, dice, and a consent table on it.]\nLike that time my group was competing in a fishing tournament, and one of my players decided to fish with bombs.\n[Another still image of the second group of players, with different poses and a closer focus on the table, with more dice and pencils in view.]\nIt worked, but they had to convince the witnesses that the explosions were totally a lake monster trying to get them. \n[A third still image of the second group, laughing, at the same table.]\nThat went well until they tried to kill each other over a dollar.\n[View shifts to the first group of players, who are gesturing to each other while playing Sundown.]\nWe also had a drifter in another game who could hear plants. His group\u2019s job was to track a stolen giant pumpkin, and he could hear it dying. \n[View cuts to a different angle on the first group of players, who chat to each other, smiling.] \nPoor guy couldn\u2019t handle it when he found the pumpkin pie, and tried to kill everyone.\nL A\n[View cuts to a still photo of an orange tabby cat, standing on a table with character sheets, dice, and pencils]\nIf you\u2019d like to weave your own ridiculous tales, consider backing us! \nWe have PDFs and softcover prints, and kickstarter exclusives like signed hardcovers, custom Sundown dice, and personalized dice boxes.\n[The view goes quickly to a close up character sheet, a softcover copy of Sundown that reads Sundown, Grasswatch Games; yellow dice with black sunrings engraved on the 6 face, and a wooden dice box, stained grey, with a brass latch and a sunring engraved on the top, with the name Lotus in the center.]\nJames\n$5,000 is the amount we need to afford art for Sundown and ship backer rewards, \n[A still image of art of a Frogbeast in the floodgrass with a cat on its head is shown briefly, before switching to a full view of the map of Sundown.]\nIf we reach 10,000, we can produce a Sundown audio book with twitch streamer and voice actor Astreigha doing the voiceover! [Video pans out over a still photo of Astreigha]\nIf we reach 20,000, Sel, a Tsalagi author and language revival activist, will write a novella set in Sundown. [Video pans out over a book cover. The cover has art of a figure in a red cloak, extending its hands. The cover reads My Name Is Vengeance, Sel Bell]\nAnd if we fund even higher, keep an eye on our stretch goals. See what we dream up, or tell us what you\u2019d like to see.

As Kingdom fights Empire and the borderlands are caught in the middle, you are sent to rebuild the liberated city of Montara and make the surrounding lands safe for your Houses. As the years pass and this city makes its mark on you, where will your loyalties lie? With your Kingdom, with your House, with this new city, or only with yourself?  \nMysthea: Legends From the Borderlands is a tabletop roleplaying game about politics, adventure and discovery in a geomantic fantasy world based on Tabula Game's Mysthea Universe.  It fuses the grand strategy of board games like Twilight Imperium, Scythe and Mysthea itself with the tense character-driven adventures of pen-and-paper roleplaying games. With your help, we'll fund a beautiful print run of the game to end up in your hands and in shops worldwide.  \nMysthea: Legends From the Borderlands builds on our successes with Legacy: Life Among the Ruins. Adapting elements from the Apocalypse World engine, it's a game system that gets you into the heart of the action, while at the same time allowing your stories to zoom out and take in the broad sweep of geography and history. It's based on the universe developed by Tabula Games for their board games Mysthea, Volfyirion and the upcoming Icaion, and we're delighted to bring it to life at your table. Here's what makes it special: \nLegends From the Borderlands takes place on a backdrop of war. A few hundred years ago, the floating continent of Mysthea was home to dozens of independent city-states, with the world-shattering cataclysm an ancient memory. Now, only two major powers remain: the Kingdom of Ahatils and the Kitrean Empire. The Kingdom is aggressively expansionist, lead by a conqueror-king whose boredom with governance lead to him delegating rule of his conquered lands to the ancient Guilds of Ilvash. The Empire is more insidious, letting its territories rule themselves freely only as long as they cast aside their old customs and religions and follow the Empire's doctrine. And between these two monoliths lie the borderlands - a narrow strip of territory whose cities are treated as pawns in the game of empires.\nNow a great war has been sparked into flame, and its battles shake the continent. As the war front moves ever closer to Kitrean heartlands, the Ilvashan Guilds send a convoy to control, reinforce and rebuild the newly-liberated city of Montara. But as the Guilds meet with local Orders and Cabals, and contend with the perils of the too-close war front, they may find their loyalty to Ilvash and Ahatils tested. Will they stay true to their mission and make this city a vassal of their ancestor guilds, try to secure its independence, or use its resources to gain dominion over the Guilds in the Kingdom's capital?\nYour group will have strong world-building tools, letting you make this story your own. Most important is Montara: it's up to you what form this war-scarred metropolis takes, though we will present examples in the book. The wider borderlands can shift and change as you play according to your decisions, and the final state of your city will be unique. Don't worry, though: the game's procedures will give you inspiration and easy choices to make, while making sure that your world remains coherent and full of mystery.\nEach player controls a House present in Montara. They may be a Guild sent to this city from the ancient Kingdom of Ilvash, or an Order local to the borderlands. Together these factions form a venture, dedicated to putting the city back together for their own reasons. Your House is your constant as you tell a decade-spanning saga of discovery, conflict and rebuilding. Each will have a certain vocation that defines them, whether that's the Guild of Varorin's focus on commerce and production or the Order of Kyradar's quest to hunt Mysthea's strangest monsters. When they act in concert, you trigger special abilities that work through the consequences of conducting diplomacy, sabotaging your enemies, claiming vital resources or many other approaches. \nYou'll jump forward through history, visiting the different flashpoints your venture experiences. At each flashpoint, you'll focus on a particular hero from your House. The hero archetype you pick gives you a particular skillset and role within the House, but it also gives you a new perspective: a gregarious Matchmaker will present a very different side to a House of soldiers than a battle-scarred Veteran. \nOnce you're done telling the story of a particular flashpoint, you jump your story forward in time. You go as far ahead as the group likes: a few months, a year, maybe even a decade. Over the time skip your House can experience great fortunes or suffer trials, the world can change dramatically, and new threats and opportunities can emerge from the borderlands. Once you've set up your new flashpoint you can make new heroes, still able to call on the powers of those who have gone before. Or perhaps you'll show how an old hero has been changed by the passage of time?\nWith Legends From the Borderlands, we\u2019re inviting players to dive deep into a world still reeling from a meteoric impact that shrouded the world in endless storms and studded the landscape with shards of crystal. Rising above the endless storms are floating islands and continents, buoyed by shifting tides of gravity: this is the land of Mysthea.\nCrystals are vitally important to this world. The strange shards of crystal dotting the landscape \u2013 named Qoam \u2013 react strangely to gravity, energy and most importantly thought. Each resident of Mysthea has the ability to exert telekinetic control over Qoam, though individuals vary in the strength they can exert and the kinds of crystal the best resonate with. The subtle arts of Qoam manipulation are core to your society \u2013 Qoam crystals line warrior\u2019s armour, and resonators communicate across great distances. Qoam prostheses enable amputees to walk with the power of their will, and labourers build structures by exerting their collective will on blocks of crystal-studded stone. The most delicate artisans can even spark life in the crystal, creating servants made of stone and gleaming Qoam facets.\nFinally, there\u2019s the inhabitants of this world. None of them have escaped unchanged by the great crystal\u2019s impact. The humanoid folk that make up the bulk of its population have changed the least, growing grey-skinned and pale under the gloom of the endless mists. The awoken automata are rare, often labouring under cryptic ethical codes put in place by long-dead civilisations. And then there\u2019s the monsters, who cannot control Qoam and instead struggle to avoid frenzies when bombarded with its unrefined energy. These \u2018monsters\u2019 greatly value cities, where the controlled Qoam allows them coexist peacefully with others.\nWatch us play the game on Hijos Del Rol's twitch stream!\nInterviews about the game:\nLegends From the Borderlands has 9 Heroes and 8 Houses for you to try.

We're estimating it'll extend to 240 pages, and it'll be packed with Travis Anderson's gorgeous art.\nMockup of the hardback book.\n We're also making a kickstarter-exclusive deluxe edition. This will have a dark soft-touch matte cover, embossed in silver with the House's logos on the cover and the book's name on the spine. It'll come in a full-colour, durable slipcase.\nA mockup of the deluxe edition of the book.\n If you're a retailer interested in stocking the book, back at the \u00a31 level - when our BackerKit goes live we'll open special retailer tiers up to you.\n With this game delivering a year from now, it's difficult to put a definite estimate on how much shipping is going to cost. To help mitigate that uncertainty, we're not charging shipping fees now. Instead, we'll charge them using BackerKit when we're ready to ship and know exactly how much it'll cost.\nYOU DON'T NEED TO ADD ANYTHING TO YOUR PLEDGE NOW.\nFor estimates of what it's likely to cost to ship after the campaign, see this diagram:\nThese costs are estimated from the predicted size of the book. If you add more items to your order (see Add Ons), your shipping costs are likely to be higher.\nWe'll keep you updated as shipping cost estimates change, based on the scale of the eventual fulfilment effort.\nDouglas Santana Mota is the lead developer for this campaign. As one of the lead designers for Legacy: Life Among the Ruins 2nd Edition he's adept at writing rules that blend grand scope and personal drama. When he's not designing RPGs, he works as a safety officer in an offshore oil rig. If you can't find him online, don't worry! He's probably hiking somewhere with his adventurous wife and their orcish dog.\nJay Iles is the head of UFO Press, and the other lead designer on Legacy. She's also designed such games as Rhapsody of Blood, Harder They Fall and Transmission Burst. For this campaign, she's handing additional design, book layout and production assistance.\nJames Mendez Hodes (7th Sea, Scion, Thousand Arrows) is Mysthea\u2019s cultural consultant. He\u2019ll watch over the development of the Borderlands\u2019 cultures and power dynamics to ensure they reflect the best lessons we can learn from parallel situations in the real world.\nRebecca Curran is our editor; she's a veteran of multiple UFO Press books, and we have a great working relationship.\nTravis Anderson is continuing to provide the incredible aesthetics of the world of Mysthea. You can check out his portfolio here.\nLeonardo Bertinelli and Alessandro Veracchi of Tabula Games are the creators of the Mysthea Universe and its lore. \nThe Mysthea Universe comes from Tabula Games;  check out their games Mysthea, Volfyirion, and Icaion to delve deeper in this world they created. We are very happy that they'll be working with us on this project. It couldn't exist without them!\nFinally, we're getting production and distribution assistance from Modiphius Entertainment. They have a lot of experience shipping crowdfunding projects all across the world, and I'm confident their help will make this project a success.   \nAs we go over our Kickstarter goal, we'll be able to make the game better! Here's how:\n\nHit! At \u00a315,000, we'll get  even more beautiful pieces of art - one for each Hero in the book, and each of the non-Ilvashan Houses.\nHit! At \u00a317,500 we'll improve the quality of the book with full-art endpapers and a ribbon bookmark.\n\nPlaceholder art\nHit! At \u00a320,000, we'll be making map boards for use with the game. Folding out to an A3 size, this board will have a basic map of the area the game takes place in. And it'll be ready for you to customise, covered in a layer that's friendly for dry-erase markers.\nThis board will be included for free in all pledges at the \u00a370 tier and above. For those at lower tiers, it'll cost \u00a310 to grab a version for yourself.\nHit! The first Shard of Mysthea: a complete expansion for the game, opening up a new area of gameplay. The Rebel Underground is all about the resistance movements that sprung up in Montara under the Kitrean Empire's occupation, and how those movements grow and find new forms after the Empire's expulsion from the city. \nPlay as the shadowy Disavowed Order.\nTurn the city on its head with a Revolution.\nBring your protest movements to life with guidance from guest star writer Helen Gould.\n\nHit! If we hit \u00a325,000 we'll make further physical addons to the game.\nRender from Chessex Dice\nFirst, a set of ten dice in five different colours, bearing the symbols of the Five islands revered by Lusma. These colours are particularly important in the solo play mode! They'll be available for \u00a310.\nRender from Tabletop Simulator\nSecond, a pack of A4 dry-erase handout cards, one for each House and Hero type. Currently this is 23 cards, but as we unlock more houses and heroes with the Shards of Mysthea they\u2019ll get added to this set.  They'll be available for \u00a315.\nFinally, each city map board will come with four sheets of reusable stickers representing the different buildings, landmarks and factors used in this game. The stickers will be illustrated by Cecil Howe, designer of Hex Kit. These will be free to everyone getting a city map board!\nHit! At \u00a327,500 we\u2019ll unlock the next Shard of Mysthea, all about the inhuman intelligences of this land. In it you\u2019ll find:\n The Foundling, a Hero who grew up among inhuman creatures and now finds themself pulled between their House and their monstrous family.\n The Chimera, a weapon of war created by the Kitrean Empire\u2019s experiments with ambiance who has broken free from their handlers and now seeks their own path.\nEssays on inhuman sentience from Sawyer Rankin, and weird fantasy warfare from Thea Don-Siemion.\n The Crucible - a wonder your House can work towards to reshape their biology or that of another group.\n\nHit! At \u00a330k, we'll unlock The Silent Arts. In this Shard of Mysthea, we look at Qoam magic in full, glorious detail. How does society change when everyone has some measure of telekinetic power? How can ambiance warp the biology and social fabric of a community? When your bonds with others empower your strongest magic, what does it mean to be a powerful mage? Authors Kira Magrann and Erika Shepherd will be guiding us through these topics, and more. We'll also include:\nA boundary-pushing Hero in the Warlock.\nThe Crystal-claimed, a House changed and made immortal by exposure to Qoam ambiance - but who are now forever tied to their crystal keep.\nA Wonder to bring together the borderland's greatest minds in a Great Network.\n The Great Binding, a Quest your characters can embark on to seal away an arcane horror for good.\nBut that's not all! If we hit this tier we'll include every shard we unlock in the core book - both PDF and Print options. We estimate that this'll add around 30-40 pages to its page count.\nHit! If we hit \u00a333k we'll upgrade the accessories again! The handout cards will become handout boards, made of thick, glossy, beautiful cardstock. And we'll also add another card deck - a deck of Resources to help you keep track of the Surpluses and Needs your Houses are grappling with. Expect more details on these as we approach the goal!\nThat's all, folks! Everything from here out will be put into making sure we make an excellent game.\nPledging isn't the only way you can help this project grow.

November 8th - 10th, 2019.  \nAcadeCon would not exist if not for The RPG Academy podcast and they are forever intertwined.  The motto of the Podcast is \"if you're having fun, you're doing it right!' and our goal has always been to help more people play games and have more fun while doing it.\nWe're not into telling our listeners they should play the way we play, but instead - play the way that's the most fun for them at their table and with their group.  And that's the same attitude we bring to AcadeCon.  We don't go in for edition waring or gatekeeping. AcadeCon is open to gamers of all types and experiences levels. No matter which games you love, you're likely to find people at AcadeCon who also love that game and if not you'll probably find people open to learning it from you or happy to teach you the game(s) they love. We want to provide a place for people to play these games and have fun. \nAcadeCon started in Michael's basement and no matter how large it grows, the idea of playing games with your friends will always be at the heart of what we're trying to do and that's where the AcadeCon motto comes from:  Gaming with friends, old and new!\nIn addition to playing games with friends (old and new), AcadeCon offers almost unprecedented access to some amazing RPG designers, authors, and fan favorite podcasting personalities. At AcadeCon, these people are there to have fun and play games, just like you. Join into one of their events and don't be surprised if they join into one of yours!\nIf that sounds like something you\u2019d like to support then this is the place for you. If you can, support our Kickstarter by going ahead and buying your badge now. We know it's early and life can change so we do offer the option of getting a refund (minus the 10% we lose to Kickstarter fees) up until November 1st.  \nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter and we hope to see you in November!\n                                 What's AcadeCon all about?\nAcadeCon is specifically designed to be a smaller, non-traditional convention. We are not trying to (nor do we want to) compete with or replace the huge conventions that attract a national audience. At our convention, you're going to get access to some of the most amazing GMs and players, a better chance to play in the games you want, the opportunity to spend time and game with special guests, and time to hang out with some of the best gamers in the world\u2014the fans of our show and returning AcadeCon alumni.\nJoe Meade is taking some play testers through a session of Omens of Destiny.

Our primary goal is to increase the number of marginalized people in all aspects of tabletop gaming through the power of positive representation. Our volunteers run and teach roleplaying games, miniature war games, board games, LARPs, and card games. In addition, we run board game socials using our own board game library, panels on topics that span the whole range of gaming experiences, and provide our volunteers with everything they need to succeed from snacks to dry-erase game mats. Together, we move the needle on making conventions more diverse. \n\nGames on Demand is an open-gaming event put on at various conventions, sometimes under the \u201cIndie Games Exposion\u201d organizational label. It typically consists of designated area with tables, materials, and a constant supply of enthusiastic volunteers prepared to run a variety of independent and cutting edge games. \n\n                            Space Bridge Simulator \nARTEMIS Space Bridge Simulator\nOur inner sci-fi nerds are insanely happy to have this chance to pull on those costumes that we don't tell anyone about and log some time on the Artemis Space Bridge Simulator. Sponsored by Dwarven Woodworking this is going to one of the highlights of the convention. Registration information for these games will be included in the gaming schedule when it is released after the campaign ends. Unlike many conventions that host a simulator, ours does not cost extra. It's all included in your badge\u2014though we won't be upset if you give them a donation or purchase some of their wares in exchange for their presence at AcadeCon. \nSponsored by  Double Exposure, the Envoy program is unique and awesome! The Double Exposure team will provide us with about 25 brand-new games that you can try out during AcadeCon. Every time you play a demo, you are entered into a drawing to win that game! You can play the same game multiple times to get a better chance at winning something you really enjoy or play them all and see if Lady Luck is smiling on you.\nOpen Game Library:\nAll badge holders are able to check out any of our game library games free of charge (with ID) during our regular event hours. To see a current list of all the games we have CLICK HERE. Don't see your favorite?  donate a copy to us or increase your pledge level by enough to cover the price and and we'll buy a copy to add in.  At worst, shoot us a msg that you'd like to see that game added and we'll see if we can get a copy before this year's event.\nCode of Conduct & Terms of Service.\nAcadeCon is an inclusive gaming event open to gamers of all types. Every attendee will be subject to our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.\nFurther - all attendees agree to abide by our terms of service. This is to ensure every attendee feels welcome. Failure to comply with our ToS can result in expulsion from AcadeCon without a refund.  At it's heart we ask that you don't be a jerk, but for all the details follow the link - Click here to read our terms of service:\nThank you for taking a look at our campaign. We truly hope you'll consider supporting us now and grabbing a badge later to come out to play games with us in November.\nStretch goals:\nBased on last year, we may have rented out more space in the DCC than we needed and wasted space made us less profitable.  For this year we're going to step back and bit and our initial goal is to raise enough money for room 101, the larger main gaming room.  At $13,700.00 we can rent that space and pay for all the miscellaneous things that go along with it.\nAfter the initial goal we'll be using additional funds to rent out the side rooms which we used for Panels, Seminars, and Entertainment events.  Each increment of $300 will allow us to rent one of these rooms for one day.\nMore stretch goals . . .  if we manage to get enough funds to rent all the space we would want or need  we will find a way to use those funds to improve the overall experience.  \nADD ONs\nKickstarter exclusive T-shirts.  While we will have a few T-shirts for sale during the event it helps us to know what people want and what sizes they need. If you'd like to pre-order a T-shirt that is only available through the Kickstarter you can add either $18 or $20 (for sizes XXL and XXXL). We'll reach out before the order to ask your size and preferred cut.\nAcadeCon 2019 D6+1's.  Each of our guests received one of our commemorative D6's each year. If you'd like to add on 3 more to get a full set of 4 please add $2.00 to your pledge. If you'd like even more, add $1.00 per die you'd like added. Please contact us via the KS messaging system to let us know what your over pledge is for.\nAcadeCon 2019 Token chip. Currently our VIP guests get 5 of our yearly poker chip tokens and we sell them during the event. If you'd like to pre-order them we can provide them at a discount vs the for-sale price.  For each chip you'd like, please add $1.00 to your pledge. Please contact us via the KS messaging system to let us know what your over pledge is for.\nRisks and challenges\nAt this point, the biggest risk is that we don't fund, in which case the event does not happen. If we can't make it to our minimal funding we can't afford to put on the show. As long as we fund, only a catastrophe would stop the event from happening.\nBeyond that, we are having the event in southern Ohio in November.

It is inspired by games like Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy, and Breath of Fire, that were foundations of the genre. In Dragon and Warrior you and your friends create the world, filling it with characters, monsters, dungeons, and most important of all, cool weapons and armor!\nBut Dragon and Warrior isn't just about gaining levels and gear, it is first and foremost a collaborative story-telling game, meaning that over a single 2-4 hour session, a group of you and your friends will let your imaginations and the game's rules work together to weave a story. You won't be planning or discussing it ahead of time, instead playing to find out what happens as you go.\nUnlike some other tabletop games, it has no Game Master, so control over the Narrative is divided up into four roles: the Warrior, the Villain, the Ally, and Treasure. The Warrior controls the actions of the story's protagonist. The Villain creates conflicts, monsters, and characters who stand in the Warrior's way. The Ally controls the townsfolk, shopkeepers, and friends of the warrior, who aid their journey and send them on quests. Lastly, Treasure's job is to describe the world itself, breathing life into setting and scenery, as well as whatever items the Warrior finds on their journey.\nOver the course of the game, players will switch roles with each other. As a result everyone will have the opportunity to play in every role, sharing in the creation of the world, the characters, and the path of the plot. The game is designed for four players, but it includes variant rules for groups of any size from two to six or more.\nIs this a game where you draw maps of towns, dungeons, and the overworld? And make funny little sketches of the monsters you fight? Heck yeah! Is it a game with stats and powers and experience points? Heck yeah! Is this a game that uses turn based conflict resolution with playing cards instead of dice? Heck yeah! Is it a game where you can walk into random people's houses and take their stuff, and they won't even try to stop you because you're the  warrior of legend? What do you think? Of course it is!\nWhat are you getting?\nAt the PDF level you get a PDF file of the rules, along with supplemental role cards, conflict cards, and character and reference sheets,  conveniently delivered to your digital mailbox over the internet. Science!\nAt the physical copy level you get a 20 page black-and-white booklet printed on letter size paper, folded in half and saddle stitched with staples. It's a zine, basically. The booklet features beautiful layout and fantastic art by Michael Wight, in the style of Akira Toriyama (of Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball fame). The game ships safely packaged in a large envelope. You'll also get the PDF, including the files you need to print off all the reference and character sheets you need to play.\nAt the signed copy level you'll get all of the above, but the physical copy will be signed in blood or red ink and personalized by me. That's right, collectors and fanpersons, a little piece of my love for you, straight from the heart.\nWho is Jackson Tegu and what is Silver and White?\nThe rules for Dragon and Warrior are based off the rules of a game called Silver and White, a game which has been released, and then unreleased, by Jackson Tegu. In it you control four suburban teenagers who encounter a mystery that will shape their lives. When the teenagers touch, the players exchange cards. \u201c...they step into the unknown, pausing at every awkward touch, hopeful despite everything to come.\u201d \nJackson Tegu is an awesome person who makes stories that you can play and games that help you tell stories, somewhere along the west coast. His unreleased future magnum opus is the next version of Silver and White, a game that will surely rattle the foundations of society when finished. But it is not finished yet, Dragon and Warrior is merely a tribute to its eventual glory.\nWho am I?\nI'm Orion Canning. I'm a game designer and artist, having worked as a photographer, editor, and film director. Much of my work can be found on Youtube,  or on other crowdfunding projects.\nMy two main focuses are storytelling and games, so it makes sense that I'm into RPGs. Games have always been a way for me to connect with people and overcome some of my awkward or shy tendencies, and through those connections I've become entrenched in, and helped foster, the Pacific Northwest story gaming community. \nI contributed to the stretch goals for Fall of Magic (the island of Stillheart Landing), Legend of The Elements (the Shipping Moves), and Second Skins (The Firestarter). My most recent game Abnormal Things, which lets you tell stories similar to the show Stranger Things, was released for free online. I love my local gaming community, and I'm excited to finally run a Kickstarter for one of my own games, and put it out into the world! \nStretch Goals\n1,000 - If I reach 1,000 dollars I will record an actual play audio recording of me and some friends playing Dragon and Warrior, and release it to all the backers.\n2,000 - I will commission Michael Wight to draw four extra illustrations for the rule book.\n4,000 - ???", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time running a Kickstarter campaign. I've been planning on trying it for years, but honestly I shy away from risk, and the possibility of failure makes me nervous as hell. \n\nLuckily, the game is finished. It's been play-tested numerous times over the years and was already published in a small print run that I sold copies of in-person at conventions. I really want people to have access to the game, no matter where they are in the world. There is no greater joy for a game creator than to see people enjoying the game you made, and Kickstarter seems like one of the best ways for an indie designer like me to reach a wider audience.\n\n I am fortunate to have the support of a community of friends who have run successful kickstarter campaigns, a few of which I had close involvement in. As such, I understand what's involved, and if I run into any problems I know I can go to them for help. It's with their encouragement that I have the courage to try this.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PDF", "descp": "Get a digital PDF file of the game.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Physical copy + PDF", "descp": "Get a physical copy in the mail and a digital PDF file.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Signed Copy + PDF", "descp": "Get a signed physical copy in the mail and a digital PDF file.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Guess what I did today?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Printing tomorrow, shipping soon!", "update_content": "First of all, apologies for making everyone wait so long for an update!

Adventurers from throughout the Vague World have braved the many dangers of the borderlands to seek their destiny as Free Traders within its mighty walls and some have even succeeded in making a little coin in the process. \nBut the life of a Free Trader is a difficult one and many have abandoned the call to adventure or have given their lives following its siren song. But never fear, for where others have failed you shall surely succeed with the aid of these useful handbooks published by the Middenbight Midnight Mail!\n\nThe Fools Haven Adventure Pack is a set of supplements and handouts to run roleplaying adventures in the darkly comedic urban fantasy setting of Fools Haven. All materials in this pack are system and edition agnostic so you can use them for the RPG system of your preference. Or even the system that isn't your preference, but you use it because your friends do and getting them to consider anything else is an exercise in futility.\nIn Fools Haven, players take on the roles of Free Traders: adventurers, mercenaries, and entrepreneurs who have abandoned the simple life in favour of one of glory and great reward. But a Free Trader's life is a risky one filled with peril and misfortune, and not every employer cares about the well-being of their Free Trader freelancers.\nThe Fools Haven Adventure Pack consists of:\n Fools Haven Free Traders Guide: An A5 zine booklet describing the city, its layout, and its history written by its most veteran reporter, Aron Quill.\n Jewel Of The Middenbight: Another A5 zine booklet describing the people and culture of Fools Haven written by the famous socialite and gossip columnist Gilda Gladholme.\n Fools Haven Adventures #1: Yet another A5 zine booklet filled with scenarios and missions to challenge the Free Traders of your acquaintance.\n Middenbight Midnight Mail: An A3 player handout of the latest newspaper from Fools Haven, filled with potential adventure hooks and story seeds about town.\nThe Free Traders Guide is published by the Middenbight Midnight Mail offices in collaboration with several sponsors, including the Bizarre Bazaar, Coldburg Consultants, and the Henchman's Cabinet. It is primarily written by veteran reporter Aron Quill and its primary purpose is to appraise the reader of the layout of the town, the rights and responsibilities of a Free Trader, and other useful information relevant to the holder of a Free Trader's License. \nDetails within the Free Traders Guide include:\nA description of your Free Traders License and the rights it grants the bearer.\nA brief on the city of Fools Haven and its enigmatic Overseer.\nDescriptions of the six districts of Fools Haven and important places within them.\nAn introduction to the strange legal peculiarities of the Jewel of the Middenbight.\nA general guide to the Middenbight for those who have come from afar.\nA description of the currency of the Middenbight.\nAdvice on gaining an agent to help in your adventuring career (what, you expect to hang around in a bar and wait for some wizard to just walk in and offer you a job?

All adventures are system and edition neutral and can be scaled to suit both the newest and most seasoned of Free Traders.\nAdventures include:\n The Gate Job: In order to get a job, you'll need a Free Traders License. In order to get a License, you'll need money. But in order to get money, you'll need a job. It's a vicious cycle for a newcomer to town, but a local city watchman is willing to help you out...\n Hunt For A Hero: Captain Kinnen is the noblest, kindest, and most respected of all the halfling heroes in Fools Haven. And you've been offered your weight in silver to kill him before dawn.\n The Unicorn Dilemma: A group of Free Traders must act as brokers for a dragon who wishes to sell a baby unicorn. The rewards are exemplary, but can you wash the bad taste out of your mouth?\n O Elusive Muse!: The operetta Glimmerwind promises to be the most exciting stage-show to grace the Garden District this season, but a series of troubles have plagued the production and with only two weeks until opening night the show is looking to become a disaster! Can a small group of talented Free Traders save Glimmerwind?  \n Gash's Gauntlet: Gash Throatripper is the star forward rover for the Freiberg Bruisers and the greatest orc player ever to take to playing Bawll. But a lot of people want rival team the Freiberg Bloods to win and the likelihood of Gash making it to the game tomorrow are one in a hundred. You've taken those odds. \n A Pyramid Scheme: Dark magician Amet Hatehopeth has just started down the path of necromancy and hopes to become a mummy someday. He requires Free Traders to arrange for investors to help him build a mighty pyramid in his honour. Can you convince some of the most dangerous citizens of Fools Haven to become shareholders in his nefarious venture?\nAnd more... \nThough the Fools Haven Herald might be older, the Three Crown Review might have fancier words, and the Publican's Post might have more illustrations of naked people, the Middenbight Midnight Mail remains the most popular newscroll among Free Traders within the City of Adventure!

A handful of adventures in which your less scrupulous heroes can get their hands dirty. \nThe setting for Fools Haven takes place in The Middenbight, a land of magic, mayhem and adventure.  Built on the ruins of innumerable cities before it, Fools Haven is the largest free city in the Vague World and certainly the most cosmopolitan. In less than two centuries, it has forged a unique reputation as a trading hub, neutral state, and centre of learning. \nSituated amongst the terrifying Border Lands of the Middenbight and containing subterranean depths long untouched, the City of Adventure offers rich rewards to those brave souls who would seek their fortunes.\nThe Middenbight is also home to the small town of Tinderbox, the setting of Red Genie Games' tabletop game of fantasy firefighting: The Brigade. \n Red Genie Games was released on the world to bring you original, thematic games and other magical pieces of creative collaboration. Red Genie Games was formed in Melbourne in 2015 at a local board game design incubator. \nThe Brigade was our first published game as Red Genie and it was during its development that we were blessed to make the acquaintance of Ivan Nevill. A longstanding active member of Australia's RPG community, Ivan can be found writing scenarios for RPGs, hosting trivia, demoing food-based wargames, and wherever games and puns can be combined for the betterment of humanity. He also was co-creator of another zine project, Stubby Buddy, which celebrated beer and friendship.\nIt was Ivan's wit and imagination that gave life to Tinderbox: the setting for The Brigade. His creativity has influenced all the locations, stories and characters in the game, which in turn has been recognised as a key strength of The Brigade in almost every review. \nLittle did we know at the time we were creating Tinderbox, but there was a city of adventure that Ivan had been running campaigns in for many years before Red Genie Games even existed. When Ivan shared the original Fools Haven Zine and we realised what a big influence it had on the fantasy feel and humour of Tinderbox, we knew we had the foundations of a fantasy world on our hands.

Massive and sincere thanks to everyone for the massive support and enthusiasm that's been shown so far. Not only has the campaign been fully funded, but every stretch goal has been met, assuring that Grey Cells will support not only modern mysteries, but also Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian mysteries! If you'd like to learn more about the game, here are some additional places to look!\nYou can find the Google Drive folder containing the case files and all profile cards related to the case by following this link.\nIf you'd like to see Grey Cells in action, you can see me playing Death of a Survivor with backers in this video.\nI was also a guest on Professor Jimbles' Dicebag Podcast and Professional Goblins to talk about Grey Cells, including its past, its design principles and its future!\nGrey Cells is a game of unravelling mysteries. It\u2019s about stepping into a dark morass of crime and deceit, and piecing together nuggets of truth into a full picture of what really happened. Players take the roles of investigators of all stripes - policemen and detectives, reporters, scientists, socialites and criminals (reformed or otherwise).\nEvery character wields powerful tools to shake loose information from the world. When making deductions, some character abilities can build on the information you\u2019ve gathered to help you connect the pieces more clearly. This makes it much less likely that players become stuck without recourse.\nAnd once you have that information you can start making deductions yourself, or you can have your character help you. Several character abilities assist in interpreting evidence, and can help put your deductions on the right track. They\u2019ll never solve the case for you, but they allow you to utilise your character\u2019s experience in the field to aid in the deductive process, should you need it.\nThe game emulates your favourite crime fiction genres, whether that be a civil and proper Cozy mystery such as a Hercule Poirot adventure, a hard-boiled detective flick like The Big Sleep, and more! It also provides advice on how to make your game feel the way you want.\nGrey Cells is a race, and the villain is already a step ahead. They have their own agenda - the thief escapes with their prize, the hacker erases their tracks, the killer stalks their next victim. Take too long to catch them, and they could be long gone.\nCases can involve a lot of dialogue with non-player characters, be they witnesses, suspects or even friends and allies brought into the world by the players themselves. However, Grey Cells doesn\u2019t have a Charisma stat to help you convince and manipulate them. Instead, how well you can persuade or intimidate someone depends on how much you know about them. Discover what they want, what they fear, and what their dirty secrets are and you\u2019ll have them talking in no time.\nThis creates a more thematic experience - people won\u2019t cave until you have something to press them with. Also, since success is dependent on something that\u2019s not on your character sheet, each player\u2019s voice is equally powerful; you don\u2019t have to stand aside while the persuasive character does all the talking.\nWriting mysteries can be tremendously challenging, especially for a roleplaying environment. This is why the game includes tools to help gamemasters weave their own mysteries, expanding and connecting elements of the story until they have a full web of mystery. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to lay every piece of the puzzle beforehand - the same mechanics that help keep the investigation\u2019s momentum going also help the gamemaster create clues during the course of play.\nCrafting a compelling case still requires more preparation than many other types of roleplaying adventure, but it\u2019s one of Grey Cells\u2019 goals to make the process as smooth and effective as possible.\n- 83 pages of content\n- Basic rules of play\n- Guidance on how to play in different genres: Great Detective, Cozy, Hard-Boiled, Police Procedural and Thriller\n- Six unique backgrounds for player characters: The Beat Cop, The Crook, The Detective, The Reporter, The Scientist and The Socialite\n- Special actions to uncover new information, engage in combat, and more\n- Rules for adding permanent new characters to the game in the form of Contacts\n- Rules for Exploits: Special advantages representing your investigator\u2019s strengths\n- Rules for Momentum Powers: Potent abilities to make breakthroughs in the case, and other special effects\n- Extensive guidance on how to create and run a mystery adventure\n- Rules for making custom backgrounds\nThe core rules of the game are already complete. The game is playable, and in terms of rules all that remains is to tweak and perfect them. This will require more playtest sessions to find weaknesses in the design and improve the systems and verbiage used in the rules.\nThe zine will require numerous art assets. Of these, the most important will be character designs to represent the six character backgrounds available to the players. They will reflect not only the background but also an associated genre. These character concepts will be used in illustrations throughout the rest of the zine.\nSeveral stretch goals are available, including supplementary materials for the game. If the goals are met, any backers receiving PDF or printed copies of the core game will also receive PDF or printed copies of the additional materials, as matches their tier.\nIt all started with Poirot and cake. My friends and I would gather to watch Agatha Christie mysteries and enjoy unhealthy quantities of cake. Eventually, this interest overlapped with our passion for roleplaying games, and we tried our hand at creating investigative crime fiction adventures.\nAlthough the adventures were fun, it always felt like we were playing two separate games. The games we played were great for epic combat and high adventure, but the rules took a back seat when it came to investigation and deduction. I decided to make my own game that put the investigation itself in the spotlight.\nI\u2019ve studied game design and participated in multiple Game Jams. With my history of tabletop roleplaying I wanted to use that knowledge to create a game that supported and encouraged the inquisitive style of play we were after.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to the massive support received, I'm adding Discord & playtest access to the Junior Detective ($3) tier! Also, the Detective ($5) tier and upwards will gain access to weekly update emails, including development notes and artwork to be included in the final book! Unfortunately the text on the backer rewards can't be changed after launch (which makes sense!) but rest assured that you'll get them!\nUPDATE:\nI've completed the first set of playtest case notes for Grey Cells, and as promised they are going to be freely available. The following link goes to a google drive folder that contains not only the PDF of the case notes, but also JPEGs of all the Profile Cards involved in the case.\nDeath of a Survivor is a hard-boiled mystery that should take about two 4-hour play sessions to complete. Full disclosure: Most playtest cases will be a bit shorter than this one, but I will try to maintain this standard of quality. Furthermore, playtest cases will be from all of genres supported by Grey Cells, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian cases as development continues.\nI hope this gives you an idea of what Grey Cells has to offer, and that you enjoy Death of a Survivor!\nAlso, if you'd like to see an example of how this case works in action, you can find a recording of the playtest here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first game I\u2019ve designed, but it will be my first professional release. However, this is not the first iteration of Grey Cells - throughout its development it has had two major rewrites, replacing, redesigning and improving large portions of the game. Now it has reached the stage where it can stand on its own, and I\u2019m ready to share it with a wider audience.\n\nWith the core of the game nearly complete, the most risk lies with the design and illustration of the zine itself. Preparing enough illustrations to fill the zine could take longer than I\u2019ve accounted for and cause delays, but in this event I will recruit additional artists to assist in production.\n\nAs a black and white zine, printing risks are low even with a zine of this length. Distribution could face delays depending on shipping factors, but even in the event of delays backers would have the PDF available to them.\n\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, and while I\u2019m going in with eyes open there may be issues I have not anticipated, especially surrounding pricing and shipping. If issues arise, I will be as transparent as I can be and try to resolve them in a manner that is as fair as possible to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 3 or more", "title": "Junior Detective", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of the Grey Cells playtest rulebook, as well as a PDF copy of the finished rules and any supplementary materials met through stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["314 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "Detective", "descp": "Everything above, and access to the Grey Cells Discord channel, where you can participate in online playtests.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Inspector", "descp": "A printed copy of the rulebook, as well as printed copies of supplementary materials met in stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["246 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "Super Sleuth", "descp": "Gain access to PDF copies of the case notes from each playtest, so you can run them yourself.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nAccess to playtest case notes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "Ace Investigator", "descp": "Receive PDF case notes for a unique single-session murder mystery with yourself cast as the villain or the victim.

Galactic raiders from beyond our solar system launch an attack on the first human outpost on Mars. Who saves humanity from these threats? You do. It's time to team up with your fellow heroes, stick to your principles, and save the day!\nWelcome to the world of Sentinel Comics, an exciting place of super-powered heroes, dastardly villains, and the ever-changing environments where they clash! \nRulebook Cover Render\nCreators Christopher Badell and Adam Rebottaro originally envisioned the world of Sentinel Comics in 2010, and within a year, they'd joined forces with entrepreneur Paul Bender to create the company Greater Than Games, which released the cooperative card game Sentinels of the Multiverse in 2011. Inspired by great comic book storytelling, Sentinels brought thousands of gamers into the world of Sentinel Comics over the last eight years and continues to be a mainstay of comic book games in the tabletop gaming world. There was one resounding question asked by so many of those Sentinels fans: how do I tell my super-heroic stories in this world?\nNow, for just that purpose, we bring you Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game!\nFor the last few years, we've been developing a new super-powered roleplaying game with the fantastic folks at Critical-Hits Studios. Industry heroes Cam Banks, Dave Chalker, and Philippe-Antoine M\u00e9nard have all contributed their expertise and passion for comic book storytelling to this project, working alongside Sentinel Comics writer and Editor-in-Chief Christopher Badell as well as the dynamic freelance duo, editor Amanda Valentine and writer Clark Valentine. Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game is all about bringing the comic book stories of your heroes to life at the table!\nThis is a game of powerful heroes, terrifying villains, and the conflicts between them in a world of comic book storytelling. The years of Sentinel Comics storytelling that Greater Than Games has produced have all lead up to this point, and now it's time for you to take the reins of your own heroes and bring evil to justice!\nIn Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game (or SCRPG, for short), whenever you take an action, you consult your Powers, Qualities, and your Status. You choose one of your Powers and one of your Qualities as the traits you're using for the action. Then, you consult your Status: are you in the Green Zone? The Yellow Zone? The Red Zone? If you're Out, you can only use your Incapacitated ability. And thus, we get the GYRO system: Green, Yellow, Red, and Out. \nUsing the dice from your hero's Power, Quality, and Status, you make a dice pool, roll it, and use the result dictated by the action you're taking. Learn more with this Gameplay Guide PDF, part of the SCRPG Starter Kit we released in 2017. It's extremely thorough, but the Core Rulebook will have even more!\nVillains, minions, and environments are all affected by the GYRO system as well! The world of Sentinel Comics is one of risks and dangers, and when lives are threatened, heroes must respond!\nMecha-Stalin and Muse (Art by Valerio Buonfantino)\nBesides the SCRPG Starter Kit mentioned above, we've also released two one-shot adventures for the new hero team Daybreak: Stolen Legacy and Urban Infestation! Using the above-linked Gameplay Guide to learn the game, you can play through both of those adventures to get a first-hand feeling for just how Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game works!\nThe best way to get into this game is with Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. It's a hardbound, full-color, 8.5\" by 11\" book printed on well over 400 pages (we're still determining the final page count as we finish up the writing and art!) of high-quality printing-press grade paper. \nThe core rulebook teaches you everything you need to play Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game, whether playing a hero, or running the game as the GM. It has full, robust rules for hero creation (that we will be showcasing more in an update, coming soon!), as well as a vast set of tools for GMs to create their own minions, lieutenants, challenges, villains, environments, doomsday devices, action scenes, and so much more! \nExample Page Spread Renders\nFor those who want more building blocks than blank slates, there is a massive archive section, containing many heroes, villains, minions, and environments from the pages of Sentinel Comics, all with stats, backstory, and art from many different talented artists, not just Adam Rebottaro! (Don't worry - the book will also have PLENTY of Adam's art!)\nAlso, check out this video to learn how heroes are made in the SCRPG!\nYou'll note that there are many cool things in each level other than just the core rulebook! Let's talk about those things now!\nFor those of you looking for something a little more fancy, we present the Special Edition of the Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook! Bound in high quality leather with embossed foil ink on the cover, the Special Edition rulebook is a classy companion for your tabletop gaming experience. It also features exciting hero and villain art on the inside front and back cover pages, as well as four ribbons sewn into the binding, for keeping tabs on pages you frequently reference. \nMock Up of the Foil and Leather-bound special edition rulebook\nThe Special Edition of the SCRPG Core Rulebook is being produced at the same time as the standard rulebook, so it will ship simultaneously - it won't delay the creation of the game or fulfillment, and it won't be released later than the standard core rulebook.\n Part of what people love about Sentinel Comics is the rich and lengthy backstory of its (entirely made up) comic book history. When Christopher and Adam first sat down to create these heroes and villains and tell their stories, they realized that the world would feel more real and more full if it had the strong history that comic books do in the \"real world\". Thus, they built yet another layer of fiction, creating the fictional comic book company \"Sentinel Comics\" and crafting stories not just of what happened in the pages of their comics, but also what happened in that world to inspire the creators of those comics. \nReal life comic book historians Darren Watts and Professor Christopher McGlothlin approached Christopher Badell in 2016 with the idea of writing a book detailing that history, and they quickly realized they had their work cut out for them. The history that Christopher and Adam had created was evocative and thrilling, but also missing several important elements. Not dissuaded from their task, Watts and McGlothlin wrote up a storm, tenaciously bombarding Christopher and Adam with all manner of questions and conducting many joint brainstorming sessions to uncover the truth of the history of Sentinel Comics.\nNow, the fruits of their labors have been realized! The real life book The History of Sentinel Comics by Darren Watts and Professor Christopher McGlothlin is coming to life with this Kickstarter. Take a look!\n*Mock Up Book Render, Art Not Final\nAnd here's the sort of thing you can look forward to in this book:\nExcerpt From The History of Sentinel Comics\nBut what does that \"a man named xxx\" in the second paragraph mean? Who is named xxx? It could be you! Backers at the \"A Part of Sentinels History\" pledge level will get their name in The History of Sentinel Comics! There are only so many open slots in the book, so we have to limit that pledge level to only 50 people, so first-come, first-served! Be a part of Sentinel Comics!\nPlaying SCRPG involves the players working together with the GM, helping their heroes play to their principles and ultimately save the day... but at what cost?! GMs frequently need to come up with twists on the fly in action scenes, or create minions in response to hero or villain actions. To make your job as GM easier, we've created a kit of useful GM supplies: \n*All Items Are Example Renders. Art subject to change.\nThe SCRPG GM Kit comes with several helpful tools, including:\nA double-sided dry-erase scene tracker with an average scene tracker on one side and a black and white, customize-able scene tracker on the other\nA total of 16 double-sided dry-erase challenge, minion, and lieutenant cards\n6 blank dry-erase cards for you to use as needed for tracking hero turns in the action order, or whatever dastardly deeds your minions may have up their sleeves\nA tear-off pad of 100 full-color double-sided blank hero character sheets\nA tear-off pad of 100 full-color double-sided blank villain/minion/lieutenant sheets\nA 4-panel GM screen (in progress art below) with exciting, full-color art by Adam on one side and a ton of handy info on the other\nEverything a GM could want to jump start their game!\nSCRPG uses a range of dice from four-sided to twelve-sided. We've created a set with three of each of those die types for you. Our dice are customized with engraved numbers in one of our signature Sentinel Comics fonts. Each die type is a different color made to match the example images in the core rulebook as well as the colors of each section tab. All dice are made from colored, semi-translucent material with darker flecks throughout as a visual nod to the look of comic book half tone patterns. White numbers complete the aesthetic and are easily visible so the action doesn't stop because you can't read your dice! \nWhile you can use any dice with the appropriate number of sides and numbering for this system, we've received many requests for a set of custom SCRPG dice, and this is it! A vast cornucopia of dice appropriate for super-heroic encounters!\nIf you want to add any of these products to your pledge, you can do so by increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount. \nWe will be using a pledge manager post-campaign where you can update your address and manage your rewards, adding on more things at that time if you so desire.\nWe funded in the first hour, and we're incredibly grateful to all of you! We have several additional books we'd like to make, as well as a few free upgrades and more!\nAnd that's all of the stretch goals!\nUnlocked Stretch Goals\nWe funded!

Learn more about it in our third update.\nClick the quotes below to read or listen to the full reviews!\nIn addition to the core teams behind Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game and The History of Sentinel Comics, Greater Than Games has been extremely blessed to work with an amazing extended team of writers and artists. That list is continuously growing as we work on these projects, but we wanted to take a moment to highlight the talented individuals that we've been lucky enough to work with thus far.\nSentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game\nAdditional Writers: Patrick Clapp, Tim Rodriguez, Eric Simon, Tracy Barnett, Tommy Maranges, Cory O'Brien, Jerry Holkins\nCopy Editors: Chris Burton, Alex Schmidt\nArtists: Valerio Buonfantino, Jacqui Davis, Giulio Fanfoni, Grace Gonzaga, Kendall Hale, Will Jones, Angela Lichtenberg (Kassarie), Jorge Ramos, Jo\u00ebl S\u00e9guin, Kevin Shah (Colorreaper), Gene Shaw, Paolo Siega, Joseph Wei Wang, Damon Westenhofer, Ben Wilsonham\nThe History of Sentinel Comics\nArtists: Storn A. Cook, KC Lancaster, Bradley K. McDevitt, Sarah Zeiter\nShipping for this campaign is very complicated for several reasons. Here are the main points!\n1) We will be charging shipping on a per item basis. These charges are integrated into the various pledge levels, but will be per additional item that you add on. That means that, while you can combine shipping with someone else, there is generally no benefit to doing so.\n2) There are two reasons we are charging a per-item shipping fee. The first is that, on any campaign, shipping and labor charges tend to scale with the number of items a person is receiving. However, the major change with this campaign is that we are shipping each item as it arrives from the factory. This means that you will likely get one shipment per type of item you back in this campaign. The only exception is the GM Kit and Dice Set, which will ship together.\n3) The reason we opted for multiple shipping waves with this campaign is that the majority of the products are books. Books are notoriously very time consuming to write and develop, so we didn't want to hold up most of your rewards if one book overshot the release target. Conversely, books are notably easy to ship, both because they are dense, and because we can use Media Mail in the US (which is very cheap), and because the import duties and taxes in most countries are fairly low for books.\nWithout further ado, here are the *per item* shipping charges for each country / region:\nNote One: The GM Kit and the Dice Set will be shipped together. This means that if you add on or back at a pledge level that includes one or both of those items, you will only pay the appropriate shipping charge once.\nNote Two: Shipping charges will be processed through Kickstarter. However, VAT charges will be charged separately through the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nNote Three: The delivery dates on each pledge level are the estimated dates by which we believe we will ship you everything at that pledge level. You will very likely receive some items earlier. Additionally, if we unlock any add-on stretch goals and you choose to add them to your pledge, they will likely ship later than that date.\nOK! So, what does this mean in terms of shipping charges for each pledge level? Here's what they'll look like:\nNow, on to a more detailed explanation of the shipping charges for each of these regions:\nFor US backers, we are offering free shipping. This is not because we have invented a teleporter and shipping is suddenly free. We will still pay a substantial amount to ship each parcel to US backers, both in actual shipping charges and in labor & materials. However, we know that everyone likes the idea of free shipping (including us!) and has come to expect it in Kickstarter campaigns, so we are subsidizing shipping enough to make US shipping free. All US orders will ship from our US warehouse via USPS.\nFor Canadians, we are offering $9/$4 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Canada. Of course, $9 or $4 is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Canada. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Canadian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $9-$20, depending on the item and where in Canada you live. This means that US backers are subsidizing Canadian backers slightly, in the amount of anywhere from $0-$11 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Canada, and $9 and $4 is a nice, low flat rate that we can live with from a business perspective. All Canadian orders will ship from our US warehouse, but be delivered via FedEx Canada - we will cover all customs and import duties.\nFor Australians, we are offering $14/19 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Australia. $14 or even $19 is not the actual cost of shipping to Australia. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Australian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $20-$40, depending on the item and where in Australia you live. This means that US backers are subsidizing Australian backer in the amount of $6-$11 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Australia because we know how hard it can be to get US products in AUS. We have also managed to lower this cost substantially by partnering with an Australian distributor and fulfillment house. All Australian orders will be shipped by VR Distribution.\nFor backers from China (including Hong Kong and Macau), we are offering $29/$24 shipping. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter China. Note that the majority of products in this campaign actually have to be shipped to China from the US, since they are books that will be made in the US. That means that they will be subject to import tariffs in China, which we will pay. We are partnering with VFI Asia for this campaign, and if it goes well, we hope that we'll be able to get shipping costs even lower on future Kickstarter campaigns when all of the items are made in China. All Chinese orders will be shipped by VFI Asia.\nFor Russians and South Americans, shipping will cost $39/$49 per item. This does NOT include any customs duties or import taxes. Unfortunately, this is incredibly high, and reflects that fact that it is incredibly expensive and incredibly difficult to successfully ship any items to any of these countries. In addition, we are only willing to make a single delivery attempt to you in any of these countries. If any shipments are lost or returned to us, we will unfortunately not be able to re-ship them. We will refund you your pledge minus a 20% fee to cover Kickstarter and other fees. We really do not want to do this, as it will cost us an incredibly large amount of money (the actual shipping charges, and then the return charges if the item is returned, or the replacement charges if they are lost). However, it costs us even more money every campaign to ship multiple times to countries with very complex customs and import regimes. All Russian and South American orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor Europeans (including EU countries as well as Norway and Switzerland, but unfortunately not Russia or other non-EU countries), we are offering $14/$9 shipping + VAT. What does this mean? Well, it turns out that the EU has been really tightening the rules on VAT and import duties recently as a result of widespread VAT fraud on the part of foreign companies. You can read some of the details here, but the summary is that, according to EU law, any items imported into the EU are subject to VAT charges (generally 20%-25% in the case of board games and most other items) based on the actual sale price PLUS the actual shipping cost. That means that, for example, for a $59 game with $15 shipping, the 24% VAT will be assessed against the total $74 price, and will come out to approximately $17.76.\nNote that this law applies no matter how we fulfill the games. If we ship from the US, each parcel is subject to the VAT charge once it enters the EU. On the other hand, if we ship a bunch of games to a fulfillment center in the EU, the whole shipment is subject to VAT when it enters the EU, and, even though the games are arriving in bulk, the VAT is based on the actual sales price to consumers (in this case, on Kickstarter), not the lower wholesale or manufacturing cost, so this method doesn\u2019t actually save any money on VAT charges (though there can be other benefits). In this case, all European orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor this campaign, there is yet another complexity! It turns out that most of the governments in Europe (but, annoyingly, not all) have decided that books should be taxed at a substantially lower VAT rate! That means that all of the book items for this campaign (basically, everything except the GM Kit and the Dice Set) will be charged the lower VAT rate.\nBoth VAT rates vary wildly. If you want to look into it in more detail, this website has a good amount of information. For the rest of you, here is a handy chart!\nVAT Percentages Around The World\nEuropean Shipping Questions\nQ: So, why are you charging VAT separately from shipping charges for Europeans?\nA: As we mentioned above, the VAT charges are based on the sale price + shipping. If we include VAT as part of the \u201cshipping\u201d charge, EU customs is likely to consider that whole charge to be \u201cshipping\u201d and charge VAT based on the full amount, including what we already charged for VAT!\nQ: OK, so, how much am I going to pay to get this game in Europe?\nA: There is a fixed $14 or $9 fee per item for shipping, which you will pay via Kickstarter. Then, before the campaign is fulfilled, we will calculate each European backer\u2019s VAT and charge you for VAT via the pledge manager before shipping out your parcel.\nQ: Will I have to pay any customs clearance fees or anything when I receive my shipment?\nA: No, you will not! We will have Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK fulfill this Kickstarter for European backers, which means that, after we charge you for VAT through our pledge manager, we\u2019ll handle the payment processing for VAT and import duties on the games. Then, Spiral Galaxy will ship all of your parcels out from within the EU and avoid any weird delays or further charges.\nQ: Where are you getting all of this information? It seems stupid and wrong and I don\u2019t like it.\nA: We talked to a lot of shipping companies, attorneys, and other professionals about the implications of EU law and how, exactly, VAT works. For a decent summary, the government of Finland has a pretty helpful website (and the information is, for the most part, broadly applicable across the EU).\nQ: Wait, but [insert other Kickstarter here] shipped stuff to Europe for way cheaper than this. Why can\u2019t you just do what they did?\nA: They either lost a ton of money on shipping, or they committed customs fraud, and we don\u2019t want to do either of those things. \nQ: You say above that you are subsidizing shipping to Canadians and Australians. Why don\u2019t you subsidize shipping to Europeans?\nA: We do! The $14/$9 per item we are charging for shipping is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Europe. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of European shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $14-$29 (there is a lot of variance, because it depends on the size of the shipment we are importing to Europe, and to which country in Europe the shipment is heading). This means that US backers are subsidizing European backers slightly, in the amount of $5-$15 per parcel.\nQ: Why do Norway and Switzerland have to follow these rules? They aren\u2019t in the EU!\nA: That is true! However, the customs regimes in Norway and Switzerland are very similar to those of the EU, by design.\nQ: What about Brexit?\nA: Brexit could complicate a lot of things, but what, exactly, it might complicate about this depends on the final form it takes. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when we come to it, and let you know about anything we wind up doing to work through it. Unfortunately, no one knows what will happen with Brexit, including Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If you have any secret information, please let us know. :)\nQ: I hate VAT; is there anything I can do about it?\nA: Us, too! Honestly, the only thing you can do is vote and call your local politicians. We\u2019ll do the same over here to see if we can avoid a long, stupid trade war.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays, and more than one or two grimloids gumming up the works along the way. Many tabletop gaming projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nFor the last Sentinel Comics Kickstarter, Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon, we had a lot of delays. We over-promised on stretch goals, committed to an incredibly elaborate storage solution, and wildly underestimated how much time it would take to finish the game design and production. It was also our first project with over 10,000 backers, and we did not have our shipping or customer service teams set up to handle that volume. Fortunately, we now have a much better idea of what it takes to handle a project of that scale as well as what we can promise and what we can't. Additionally, we've been working on this game for a number of years, and it is much farther along than OblivAeon was when we launched it. We are very hopeful that we can stick to our stated delivery time with this campaign.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Sentinel File", "descp": "No physical rewards, just the PDF of the Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, sent out to you as soon as it's ready!\n(Note: all other pledge levels will also receive a PDF of Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook at the same time.

They are dead set on getting there.\nBlack Mass is a roleplaying game about two people leaving a community that doesn\u2019t want them, to the woods that calls for them. Those travelers, Lydia and Catherine, confront their pasts to seek their own black mass, a moment of transformation, to put the tools of change into their own hands. \nBlack Mass is a roleplaying game played in one sitting over the course of two to three hours. Black Mass is for four to eight players, including a proctor, who facilitates the game.\nBlack Mass is a pointillistic tarot-based roleplaying game where players share responsibility over two travelers, Catherine and Lydia.\nPlayers take on portions of their personalities, called personas. We join in their successes, their defeats, and we all sign their names into the devil's book together. During a game of Black Mass, players take turns inhabiting different elements of their histories, personalities, and tendencies. Personas revolve around relationships, emotional experiences, discovery, and growth. Each persona is different and sketches out a different piece of each character. Each player gets two: one for Lydia and one for Catherine. \nWe play to find out who they are, why they left Salem, and what they find in the woods. Once we know that, we\u2019ll find out what they do after their black mass. \nBlack Mass is a game about discovery: through play we learn about Catherine and Lydia, informed by the in-play personas. No two games are similar, and no two Catherine\u2019s and Lydia\u2019s are the same between playthroughs. There are eight personas for both Catherine and Lydia, resulting in many unique combinations at the table. \nThroughout the game, players draw tarot cards to overcome obstacles and to add to the spread, two rows of cards in the center of the playspace. The spread represents the lives of Catherine and Lydia, each card symbolizing a moment in their past, present, and future. \nTarot cards act as action resolution and oracles. When a persona begins inhabiting Catherine or Lydia, the player draws cards from the central pile and adds those card to their personal stack of cards, called the cairn. Players spend cards out of their cairn to move silently, shrug off spectral voices, bear the cold, and negotiate their path through the woods. Only one player may act as Lydia and Catherine at a time, and when they\u2019re out of cards, they're no longer in control. \nAt the end of these turns, players may add a card to the spread, narrating a scene from their present or past. \nThe proctor of Black Mass facilitates the game, providing challenges for the personas, and taking actions. The proctor guides the personas through the prologue, confronts them in the woods, and sets them free during the black mass. \nBlack Mass has three modes of play, October, December, and February. An October game of Black Mass has bubbling cauldrons and flying broomsticks. A December game of Black Mass focuses on eerie exploration and introspective journeys. A February game of Black Mass has cloven hooves and bloody snow.  \nZine contents\nBlack Mass is a part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest event! Black Mass is a 24-page, 5.5 x 8.5 saddle-stitched zine with card stock cover, including illustrations and photography. The zine includes the rules, tools for the proctor, and personas. Stretch goals may add to the page count of the zine. \nBlack Mass is played with a standard deck of tarot cards.\nListen to Jack Jobst's Black Mass Theme here:\nShipping notice\nYou'll be charged for shipping as part of your pledge if the campaign is successful.

Pre-ordering will get you the game at the same rates as being a kickstarter backer!\nWe stand on someone else\u2019s dirt. Every day we search, we scrape, we scavenge, and we fight for an opportunity to maintain our lives. Humans were never meant for this world, and I often wonder why we even exist. This world was designed for the Titans \u2014 the massive, mythical beasts that roam the land... their land. \nReach of Titan is a tabletop role playing game designed to emulate fantasy style battles with giant creatures. Players take on the roll of Titan Hunters, special members of their tribe who are responsible for the safety and growth of the community.  These hunters are tasked to go out and fight the giant creatures that roam the land, to feed their families, and protect what they have built. The world is dangerous, the Titans are an incomprehensible threat, but those with the will to survive, can use their talents and skills to eek out an existence.\nReach of Titan will have a familiar feel for anyone who has played Shadow of the Colossus, Monster Hunter, or watched the Attack on Titan anime. The battles are designed to be half-puzzle, half-combat, where players must use more than their die rolls to bring down these behemoths. Encounters are challenging, as you must solve the puzzle of killing the Titan, while also working with the resource management system of traditional RPG combat. This combination of systems will provide play groups with a very unique game experience.\nReach of Titan is a tabletop role playing game that has been in development for over 3 years. The original idea of the game came when Jim McClure wanted to have interesting, giant creature battles, but he could not find a system that really supported this kind of play experience. So Jim starting working on his own game!\nThe initial play tests were very promising and showed that this unique play style, combined  with the custom system designed to support it, were a hit. Over time the game expanded with each new series of play tests. Just fighting Titans, while a deeply engaging experience, was not a complete game. Jim added in game elements of settlement building, cultural creation, hunting, and world exploration to flush out the original concept into a complete RPG experience.\nReach of Titan is designed to be a modern game that incorporates the various ways people currently engage with RPGs. The game fully supports both long term campaign play and quick one-shot adventures. During this traditional style of play, the characters will increase their skills and abilities, they will establish and grow a settlement, and they will explore the world while hopefully unlocking the secrets of the Titans. The game will provide everything you would expect and more from a long term campaign experience.\nAdditionally, the game can easily be played in a more episodic fashion. If your group is looking for a quick couple of hours of fun, the game master can pick up the book, choose a Titan encounter, and within a few minutes have everything they need for a night of Titan hunting. The book and the encounters are designed to do all the heavy lifting for the GM, so for those that want a minimal prep game, Reach of Titan will perfectly satisfy this need.\nThe game book itself will be a 300-400 page (depending on stretch goals) full-size, full-color, illustrated Hardcover. The first half of the book will contain the rules of play, character classes, character advancement, settlement building, item inventories, culture growth, and Titan hunting. The second half of the book is a bestiary filled will all the known Titan's that roam the land. This bestiary includes information about the history of each Titan, all the stats needed for the GM to run an encounter, information about how they fight, and their weak spots. In addition a full illustration for each Titan is presented in the book which can be used as a battle map for the encounters. Our hope is that through the funding of stretch goals we will be able to make a considerable expansion to this Bestiary, by including new Titans from our contributing writers. \nIn addition to the hardcover book, the game will also be offered as a traditional PDF, and on the Roll20 marketplace. The Roll20 format is discussed in more detail below.\nReach of Titan has its own mechanical system designed by Jim McClure that is specifically made to emulate Colossal style fantasy combat. The interesting design challenge for this game came from the imbalance between player characters and the Titans that they will fight. Unlike many RPGs, the player characters and the Titans they are fighting are so different that the mechanical nature of both sides needed to be asymmetrical. \nMechanically, the Titans themselves consist of multiple parts. Arms, legs, body, head, tail, wings, etc. Each part of the Titan will have its own stats, health, and abilities. As the players fight a Titan they will climb the creature, attacking the various parts in an attempt to kill it. How each Titan is killed is unique to that creature, and the players will have to discover the win condition through game play. The Titan will react to the player\u2019s movements and the battle will change as sections of the Titan are damaged. \nThe core mechanic for the players is every character has a pool of 6 d6\u2019s that are used to complete their actions. These dice move between two zones on the character sheet: Available and Exhausted. Players can use any dice they have in the \u201cavailable\u201d zone to make actions, and once the dice have been used, they are then moved to the exhausted zone. Each round of combat all the players dice are moved back to the Available zone. When a player takes an action, they can spend any number of available dice on what they want to accomplish. The dice are rolled and the result is summed against a target number as determined by the Titan\u2019s stats. Players can take a number of actions each turn, based on the amount of dice they have available and how they choose to spend them.\nThe concept of this mechanic is to put all the power of success and failure in the hands of the players. If a player wants to guarantee their success in a turn they could spend all their dice on a single action. However, the more they want to try and accomplish in a turn, thus optimizing their actions, the greater risk there is for failure. While play testing Reach of Titan, this core mechanic has resulted in fantastic game play because failure in this system is not a result of swingy dice rolls or characters not having good enough stats, failure is a direct result of players choices.\nWhile fighting giant creatures is a core part of the experience of Reach of Titan, the game also incorporates settlement building and hunting as key aspects of the game. You are members of a small village that is trying to survive in the harsh world. If you are successful, you will be able to watch your village grow and prosper. Failures will result in watching your settlement dwindle. Every Titan hunt comes with risks and rewards that must be weighed, and the results of these encounters will shape your community.  \nSettlement Building\nHuman settlements are small villages scattered across the land, appearing in places where shelter could be found from the Titans. You will find villages in deep forests, caves, mountain hideaways, anyplace that will keep unwanted giants from roaming in and destroying what people have worked so hard to make. Most settlements are very small, and few ever see a population above several hundred people. To grow a settlement, it requires a tremendous amount of effort and danger on the part of the inhabitants.\nIn a game sense, settlements are the homes of the Titan Hunters. It is where the players will have most of their interaction and role play. When characters are not hunting Titans they will oversee the settlement working to improve it, expand the culture, and make connections with their tribe. \nThe settlement will start off very small and weak. However, players can actively work to build and grown the settlement into a proper village, town, or with enough work, a city. Each Titan that is killed will provide materials used to make new buildings, establish defenses, improve farming, and make the settlement a better place to live. Players will have to manage the precious resources they collect to help grow the town.\nTitan Hunting\nWhen more resources are needed, or if the settlement is in danger, the Titans Hunters will need to go out into the world. Hunting a Titan is a very risky prospect as the world is dangerous, the lands are uncharted, and the characters never know what they will find in the wild.\nWhen players go into the \"Titan Hunt phase\" they will have to risk aspects of the settlement or something personal to them. The longer the hunt takes, the more things are risked and the higher the danger grows. Ultimately, if the hunt fails the things what has been wagered  will be lost. \nTitan Killing\nWhen a Titan is finally confronted, combat will ensue. Players will use all their knowledge, skills, and resources to kill the beast. If they are successful, they will be rewarded with a number of resources they can take back with them. If they fail they must return empty handed, and face their settlement. \nThe Lore of this world, and the reason humans came to exist in the land of giants, is presented in a very specific way in Reach of Titan. There is not a lore chapter to read through with a chronological timeline about past events, instead the details about the true nature of the world, are spread throughout each Titan description. \nHumans have little to no understanding of why they are here or how the existence of Titans came to be. The game will let the players discover this for themselves by having the history and truth of their existence be wrapped up in puzzle that needs to be solved. For those that want to unlock the full mystery, which is present in the game, it will take time and research to find the truth.\nWhen running a game of Reach of Titan this scattering of the lore concept serves as a player aid. After a successful Titan hunt, the players can bring back a piece of the Titan to their settlement's Seer. The Seer will then reveal to them the lore of that Titan. As players encounter more and more Titans, they will be able to start to piece together an understanding about the world they inhabit.\nThere are secret aspects to the world's Lore that will be known by only a few people. For those that back the Kickstarter at the \"Settlement Leader\" or the \"Seer's Story\" levels, you will receive a unique piece of the worlds lore that is presented to you alone. It is up to you to unlock the history and discover how the Titans came to be. \nIf you are interested in seeing more of what Reach of Titan is about, you can check out the play-test document of the game. It includes 36 pages of rules, 4 sample characters, 3 Titan encounters, and everything you need to play the game.

Enchanted Forests, Bustling Fishing Towns, & Dark Mining Caves are some of the few places to visit.\n Meet Townsfolk and convince them to stay in your town. Perhaps meeting people will unlock your memories of the past\u2026\n Collect rare items and materials found across the world and bring them back to your town for selling and crafting!\n Harvest materials by chopping wood, mining ores, catching bugs, and fishing in rivers and ponds! \n Unlock new structures to build by meeting new Townsfolk. Want a Tavern or a Lumber Mill? How about a Fishing Hut or a Magical Library? Your town's design is all up to you!\n Fulfill your Townsfolk's requests. Some may want to live on a higher elevation, others may want to be surrounded by trees and water. Fulfilling the requests of your Townsfolk will earn you their hearts and unlock new relationship paths.\n Gathering: Whether you\u2019re picking fruit or picking weeds, your gathering skill will level up! The Gatherer\u2019s Glove is needed to unlock this ability.\n Mining: Looking for shiny ores to collect? Interested in rare materials for crafting? Then mining is for you! \n Woodcutting: Those pesky trees and debris that keep popping up all over town needs to be chopped! Wood is an essential material for building new structures and furniture.\n Bug Catching: Craft a Bug Net and catch all sorts of critters. Be sure to go bug hunting during each season and at different times of the day!\n Fishing: There's nothing quite like relaxing by a pond with a fishing rod in hand. You can sell fish for a decent price at the Shopping District, or use them as ingredients for new cooking dishes.\n Farming: Plant some seeds in tilled soil and wait a few days. Veggies are an essential ingredient to many cooking recipes! Also, they make your town look pretty.\n Cooking: Once you've built the Tavern and have become good friends with Bubsy, you'll be able to start cooking delicious meals for your Townsfolk! Maybe you can attract rare Townsfolk by serving unique dishes...\n Crafting: There are tons of structures, decorative monuments, and furniture to craft. Often times your Townsfolk will request specific objects that they would like to be placed in their home. Make sure you gather enough building materials!\n Merchanting: Selling items at the Shopping District will net you large sums of Dewdrops, which is the main currency in Solemn. As you become a better Merchant, rarer items will appear for you to buy!\n Tarott Master: Once the Dark Wizard was defeated, all of his monsters were sealed away into Tarott Cards. Many Townsfolk collect and battle with these cards, and there is even a big competition held each year in Dirboros. Get collecting!\n Willow: A cheery young girl who wants to rebuild Littlewood. She found you in the middle of the forest and took care of you for 3 days while you were unconscious. She likes working with tools and is quite proficient at building things.\n Dalton: A ditsy boy who loves going on adventures with you. Despite his forgetfulness and silly demeanor, he actually can tell some very clever jokes. He enjoys fishing, catching bugs, and shopping for cool hats.\n Lilith: A Wizard who graduated at the top of her class at Alexandria's Magical Academy. When she's not reading a book she's mixing random things together to make potions that may or may not explode. Also, she is your biggest fan.\nAnd many more!\n Animal Crossing: Anyone who has played Animal Crossing will tell you how relaxing and fun it is. I wanted to capture the satisfaction of customizing your home, hanging out with quirky townsfolk, and taking it easy by doing whatever you want day-to-day.\n Dark Cloud: This is one of my favorite PS2 RPGs . The town building mechanics were top notch which have certainly influenced Littlewood's Townsfolk request system. Your Townsfolk will often request that their houses have specific furniture, to be placed on a certain elevation, or to be near or far away from certain structures in your town. It ends up feeling like a unique puzzle mechanic, encouraging players to build their town in a way that satisfies everyone! \n Runescape (2007): Who knew that grinding up skills could be so fun? I'm approaching the 10 hobbies in Littlewood similarly to how Runescape approaches skills. I love the idea of achieving level 99 in all of your hobbies, with each milestone granting you access to prestigious hats, trophies for your home, or even access to hidden areas. There are specific Townsfolk who are masters in their craft and can help you on your journey to becoming an expert in whatever you'd like!\nLet's crush those Stretch Goals!!!\nUpdated Demo Builds - Here are the latest demo builds for Windows, Mac, & Linux.

I'm Sean Young, a game developer based in Orlando, Florida. Ever since I was a kid I wanted to make games for a living. Being an Indie game developer for the past 6 years has taught me a lot about game design, programming, art, and what I can achieve as long as I keep pushing myself. Each project comes with its own set of challenges and hardships, but with each one I learn important lessons about how to better hone my craft.\nI've been working on Littlewood for over a year and half now. This is my first large scale single player RPG and it's actually terrifying to finally share this with you! I brought Littlewood to Kickstarter to help cover game engine and music costs, while also allowing the community to have a say in the game's development. I do all of the art, design, and programming, so luckily there isn't a whole team of people to pay! There has been so much love and tears poured into this project and I really hope it can touch your life in a positive way. \nThanks for your time and I hope you consider supporting my game.\nSean\nIf you'd like more info on Littlewood's development process, feel free to follow my social media:\n https://twitter.com/SeanYoungSG \n https://www.instagram.com/seanyoungsg \n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RapUUofT5dz9DBisLAKpQ?

The game plays like a proggy metal concept album and demands a physical form to match.\nHow does Wolfspell work?\nYou gather with friends and create your adventurers, or match adventurers from another game to the archetypes provided. Who among you has tested their sword-arm against many who now wait to mete vengeance upon them in the afterlife? Who is witness to stranger worlds than most\u2014the arcane and preternatural are to them as wolves and weather are to the farmer? Who is most at home when they sleep roofless and hunt their fare far from civilization?\nThen choose your spell. Have you become wolves because the augurs dictate that only fang and claw will rend your destiny? Do relics of an ancient cult plundered from an old queen\u2019s tomb carry with them a savage curse that can only be cleansed in distant holy fires? Or is this a family thing?\nWhatever spell you choose, your immediate fate is the same. You discard your human husks and lope forth into the world as a wolves! Tell us of your coat, your size, your scent and your voice.\nYou are wolves of human blood. When asked to roll, you will always roll both a Blood Die and a Wolf Die. Note which is higher. This will tell you whether your wolf is guided by human knowledge and experience or by bestial instinct. The Blood Die represents the capabilities of human thought: from shaping the world around you as a farmer plows the field or a smithy forges a sword, to throwing yourself heedlessly into your task as an explorer sails past the sight of shore or a rover charges into the fray. The Wolf Die represents the advantages of lupine instincts, knowing where and how to hunt prey, and the safety of the pack.\nThe dice will limit your options to the side of you in ascendance, but as you behave more like a wolf, your Feral score will grow, increasing the might of your Wolf Die, turning you into a more capable wolf. But will you be able to return to human form when its all over? Will you even want to?\nWhat form will Wolfspell take?\nBack in 2013, when I was first working on issue 2 of Worlds Without Master, I wrote a short story called \u201cOne Winter\u2019s Due.\u201d It was the tale of two sisters, at the end of their adventuring career, who returned home to find their brother had been murdered as part of a blood feud. The two found themselves at oath-odds over the incident and could see no way to untangle the situation but to turn into wolves and quietly finish the feud. The premise of this tale inspired the core concept of the game. When the tale was published, it was illustrated by the glorious work of Shel Kahn, including the crow and swords illustration below.\nI knew then that when it came time to publish the game in physical form, only one artist would do.\nPlaying the game has the grand, epic feel of a concept album. With a word count around 2,000, it was tight enough to fit in the liner notes of an old gatefold LP jacket. And this is why we\u2019re here. With the funding from this Kickstarter, Wolfspell will be published on an trifold LP jacket that folds out into a single 3-foot by 1-foot panel of wolf metal art\u2014a towering spectacle of a roleplaying game.\nA preview of Shel Kahn's work in progress for the album cover!\nA Swift & Sinewy Campaign\nThe campaign will only run for two weeks and will feature no stretch goals. Our one and only goal is to bring this game back into the world in the form it was meant to be.\nFootsteps in the snow where our adventurers cast aside their swords for paws.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game itself is complete. If time and space allow, some additional material may be created for it. Shel Kahn has begun designing the LP jacket and updates on that progress will be shared as the campaign unfolds. The completion of the artwork, printing, and fulfillment are reliant on the funds received from this campaign.\n\nI have a history of publishing roleplaying games in odd forms, but this will be the first I\u2019ve published as a record album jacket. We hope to have the project completed by June of 2019, but some delays may occur as we try to get the printing just right.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Warm Thanks in the Cold Winter", "descp": "For the hungriest wolves in my pack.

Dark Rituals is an asymmetric \u201cOne vs Many\u201d game for 2 to 5 players, with a solo mode.  A small band of Heroes defends villagers from a coven of Witches. One player, the Witch Master, controls the Legion of Darkness. With two players, the second player plays the Heroes in a strictly competitive game and up to three more players may join in, each taking a Hero to help battle the Witch Master.

Click for more details. \nDark Rituals: Malleus Maleficarum is a dynamic miniatures based game, where 1-4 players control a band of fledgling Heroes defending their village from the vile Legions of Darkness, controlled by the Witch Master.   \nGame play is designed to be dynamic, keeping all players engaged in the game. Turns are short, with the active character taking just one or two actions. The Witch Master can activate any member of the Dark Legion. When it is the Heroes\u2019 turn, they can nominate any Hero to play a turn, as there is no fixed turn order. If a Hero is in a great position to affect the game, and they have the stamina, they can get in the fight.  \nAll players manage a pool of stamina that is used to pay for their character\u2019s actions. The Witch Master has a single pool that is used for all evil characters. Each Hero has less stamina that they use for themselves. Every Action has a stamina cost and actions can only be taken if the Character can exhaust the required stamina. Stamina is restored at the start of the round.\nAs well as Actions, Characters can perform many Reactions, if they have the stamina. Reactions must be triggered by something happening in the game, the simplest example being an Action to Attack triggering a Reaction to Defend, but Reactions are far more wide ranged than this. Reactions will often be triggered when a Character is inactive, another example of players being engaged all the time.   \nWithin each game, characters can advance their skills. When the Heroes defeat enemies or use Alchemy Spells, they improve their Attributes. As well as improving dice rolls, high attributes unlock better gear and stronger magic. Similarly, The Witch Master can access higher level Disciples once they rack up enough kills.\nThe Heroes are actively encouraged to cooperate. The Aid Reaction allows one Hero to help another Hero perform an Action. Heroes can use their Stamina to order NPC villagers into the fray. \nThe Witch Master can increase the ranks of their disciples by summoning Minions and unique Creatures, and by possessing the NPC villagers.\nEach game is a scripted scenario called an Encounter. As well as the board setup, the Encounter defines objectives for both sides. These encounters form a longer story for the game and the wide variety of objectives keeps the game fresh. \nSolo mode is available, where a single player plays the Witch Master and a custom deck of cards controls the Heroes. Each draw from the AI deck provides Actions for four heroes, and the first possible Action is resolved. Default actions and reactions control cases where the AI cards cannot be used. Custom solo missions are played with objectives for the Witch Master that can be interrupted by the Heroes driven by the AI deck.\nThe random grinding of the universe\u2019s machinery has brought two very different planes of existence into alignment. A rare Conjunction between Neemoss and Earth has weakened the barriers between the planes, allowing objects to slip from one world to another.\nNeemoss is a blighted world, corrupted by the magic that rules the world. All kinds of monsters, beasts and creatures prey on one another, for entertainment as much as for sustenance.\nAt first the Conjunction only allowed smaller items to transfer to Earth. You may think it was of no great import if a few new plants were found here and there but as material transfers from Neemoss, it retains its magical properties \nPractitioners of exotic arts, whether they be believers or charlatans, noticed the difference immediately. When they included these new and rare herbs and materials in their rituals, charms and snake oils, there was a huge difference! Their magic worked! At first, not well, and sometimes disastrously, but it worked. Villagers slept peacefully, with their cures for toothache and charms for love.\nThe mystical science of Alchemy was born and flourished, as more alchemical ingredients were found and their properties investigated. All was good, as the Conjunction strengthened and more ingredients were found. \nUntil the Witches arrived. Pekka was the first to step through a random portal large enough to transport her across the chasms of space and time. At first, she reveled in the luxury of having no one to whip her, poke her, bite her and otherwise make her life miserable. This was a wonderful place to live! Warm, bright, with abundant food and novelties never seen before. But a scorpion\u2019s nature is to sting and she soon got bored. Misery should be shared! Although she would not admit it, she was surprised that her first summoning incantation worked, dragging Hagatha through the Conjunction. And so it started. Some minions to bully, carry and fetch. Some creatures to manage the minions, when that was too tiresome. Ikrek to take her side when Hagatha got argumentative. The coven slowly created a little bit of Neemoss here on Earth. \nThen they stumbled across their first human, a poor farmhand journeying from one village to another looking for work. Soft and chewy, sweet on the tongue and too weak to put up any kind of fight. Once again, the Witches found a paradise. \nWe join the story soon after this first contact. In the first encounter, our heroes, each with their own reason to battle the Witches, stumble upon each other as they approach a coven. How well they fight together is up to you. \nDark Rituals: Malleus Maleficarum already features many high quality miniatures. The core box alone has 44 minis and 19 unique sculpts. All sculpts for the core box and The Cursed Fjord expansion are complete, as are most stretch goals. A first step towards physical manufacturing is to make resin prototypes and this has started too. \nWe learned so much about miniature sculpting and production during our first Kickstarter, Vampire Hunters, that we are confident that our Dark Rituals miniatures will be among the highest quality board game miniatures available. In the image above, you can see how well the details of the digital sculpt transfer to the resin prototype. \nResin miniatures of the four heroes.\nA resin miniature Demon Lord. Hardly a miniature!\nMiniatures for the board game will be manufactured from a hard PVC that holds details well, but has a little flexibility to avoid breakage. Most weapons will be cast in ABS, a stiffer plastic, to minimize bending. They will be supplied fully assembled, ready for use when the game arrives. With so many bizarre monsters, the miniatures come in a variety of sizes, but the scale is 32 mm foot to eye on a normal human. The Demon Lord from the core game is roughly 100 mm tall to the tip of its sword. Impressive! \nHere are close up images of the miniatures from the core box. \nThe four heroes, ready to defend their villages.\nThree Witches, performing the Witch Master's commands.\nUnique Creatures, summoned from Neemoss by the Witches.\nMinions, a blight flooding the land.\nThe Demon Lord, chaos incarnate.\nHere are the miniatures from Dark Rituals: The Cursed Fjord: \nClick on the button below to download the full beta rules: \nSome exciting rules were discussed in rules updates.

All products in retail-style packaging will be translated in full, including all game components and the product box. For the remaining items (some of the stretch goals) we will translate all the game components. \nThis will not affect the delivery of the English language products. All other languages will ship together, with approximately a 3 month delay. You will select the language you want in the Pledge Manager, and you may select a language that does not match your region.  \nWe are also translating the game into Italian, with digital deliverables. This will be triggered by the number of backers at the end of the project, as follows:\n\u00b7 100 Backers: We will translate the core rules only.  PDF deliverables.\n\u00b7 200 Backers: We will translate all rule books and all encounters. PDF deliverables.\nItaly is currently over the 100 backer threshold!  We will translate the core rules into Italian and deliver this as a PDF.  Other languages will be considered, if they approach these levels.\nOnce we are confident of even higher backer involvement, the digital locales may be added to the printed language editions. \nDark Gate Games is a vibrant company, determined to bring many fun and exciting games to your tables.  We are really pleased to bring our second game to Kickstarter.  And we have many more in the pipeline! \nAlthough we are based in New Castle, DE, we are the epitome of a modern distributed company with collaborators in USA, Canada, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Slovenia, Poland, China and beyond. \nIf you need help with your pledge after the project closes, please contact us:\nWith crowd funding, gamers can turn game concepts into reality. We could not create our games without your support on a platform like Kickstarter.\nIt also gives us a chance to feel your enthusiasm and hear your ideas. Interacting with our backers is one of the best experiences in this whole design process.\nBy backing on Kickstarter you will get your copy before it goes to retail, with many KS Exclusives, and at a discount. \nIn order to be fair to all our backers, we will charge actual shipping costs region by region once we are closer to shipping the game. We have already approached shipping companies and have some estimates for the Lone Defender Pledge and some Stretch Goals, but these are subject to change.     \nBear in mind that these are today\u2019s estimates. Actual shipping costs may change based on the amount of unlocked stretch goals and Add-Ons you choose.\nPlease contact us if your specific country is not listed.       \nWe have customs friendly local shipping in USA, EU, Canada and Australia. We will look into making  the same arrangement for all locations where we have a significant number of backers. We have investigated shipping options for the UK post-Brexit and we are ready for customs-friendly shipping to the UK after it leaves the EU, if there are no unforeseen changes to the situation.\nUnfortunately, due to difficulty with local shipping companies, laws and customs we are unable to ship to all locations. We do not ship to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Please contact us for details.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned so much from our first Kickstarter that we are confident that we will be able to make Dark Rituals: Malleus Maleficarum a truly great game. We have improved our initial miniature sculpts, streamlined our internal review process and forged good relations with many manufacturers. However, there are still risks. \n\nThis is a large game and our focus is a high quality result, not an estimated deadline. There may be small delays submitting the game to the manufacturer. There may be minor changes made to the game and its components during the last stages of development. \n\nAfter manufacturing begins, the timeline is less in our control but still we are certain we have learned valuable lessons. For example, we will handle replacement parts directly, to minimize the time between an issue being reported and us shipping a replacement item. Whatever happens, we will work to minimize any issues.\n\nShipping prices posted during the Kickstarter are best estimates from our partners and are subject to change.\n\nWe understand that your circumstances might change. We will offer a no-questions-asked refund of all funds, minus any charges to us, ending when we commit to a manufacturing contract, approximately 3 months after the campaign closes. \n\nWe will inform backers of all progress and changes via KS Updates, as soon as we have reliable information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Lone Defender", "descp": "This pledge is for the core game and all applicable stretch goals.\nShipping is not included, and will be charged in the Pledge Manager.

Included are an overview of the rules, five pre-generated characters and an introductory adventure to dive into the world of Vulcania!\nVulcania is a tabletop roleplaying game full of action, conspiracies and investigation, set in the smoky atmospheres of the industrial revolution of a Fantasy - Steampunk world. In Vulcania you can play as an adventurer, a soldier, a scientist or a scoundrel struggling to find their place in the world, chasing fame, power, money... or justice. Take part in sinister plots, explore dark places lost to war and live breathtaking action in wild lands and chaotic metropolis. Unleash your hero\u2019s powers and prove your worth on the battlefields, using your knowledge to reveal lost secrets. Hone your skills to create fantastic objects! All this and more await you on Vulcania!!!\nVulcania is an all-in-one rulebook containing rules needed to play, both for players and Narrators. No need to buy dozens of books to jump into the mayhem! \nIf funded, the tome is going to be a full color, fully illustrated hardcover of 450 pages, depending on the stretch goals reached.\nThe Letvian War ended ten years go but new powers are already plotting in the shadows. Explore a mysterious world, where human life is scattered among six volcanic archipelagos surrounded by a stormy sea. Take to the seas or soar in the skies aboard an Airship, face lethal enemies with the power of sword and alchemy and unearth lost secrets. Honing your skills to survive the bleak moors of chaos and harness the power of your own mind.   \nThe war might be over\u2026 but there is no shortage of reasons to fight!\nSurvive the expanses of Abrabazem, braving destroyed cities, toxic clouds and mutated creatures to unearth forgotten treasures.  \n\nExplore the arid deserts of Balastoc and its overcrowded cities, where the clergy of the Red God Isairnes rules over a nation that struggles to balance progress and backwardness, heresy and terrorism.\n  Itteghasp\nSearch Itteghasp for secret knowledge and special equipment, where the Monopolies placed their headquarters and their mercenary minions guard their secret knowledge.\nFly over the rugged peaks of Ketniv and its mountain cities and meet is disciplined and contemplative population. However, beware not to stir the Imperial beast and its generation-spanning rule.\nVenture in Mostucaal, once the most powerful isle-nation of Vulcania, and find out how the greed of man and civil war have drained both body and soul of its inhabitants.\nThe frozen lands of Nuugard\nPenetrate the frozen lands of Nuugard, a territory as wild as it is deadly, tamed only by the stubborn tenacity of a race of indomitable warriors, tempered by the ice and the fire of a thousand battles.\nSome people choose a private life free from risks and dangers. One thing is certain. You are not one of them. Whether you soul is noble or under a malicious influence, choose your past and meet your destiny! Develop your knowledge and learn new ones with the help of Art Masters. Train in a remote forest or studying in the library of a Megalopolis, for your skills will make a difference in your adventuring life.  \nWe wanted to go heavy on character customization, both when creating your alter ego and when evolving them. Initial choices are meant to act as a base for the character\u2019s in game growth, not a restriction, granting them access to options like Arts to make your character your own and incredibly powerful.\nCharacter Creation   \nChoose the Past Experience between 20+ preset backgrounds, what the character is capable of when the game starts. \nChoose the Origin, where your character was, their history and personality.   \nChoose the Personality and Vices of your character; are you a party animal, always ready to meet new people, or the darker, brooding type?  \nSet your character\u2019s Attributes and Skills  \nLearn Arts to give your character an edge in battle.  \nSpend Gold granted by your character\u2019s Past Experience to acquire equipment.  \nGO!  \nSome stories can be told by any Vulcanian, others are deeply rooted in a specific Islenation. So we decided to include in the rulebook six regional Past Experiences, one for each Isle-nation. \nAbrabazem Wasteland Merchants\nThese people have roamed the desolate lands that once where their country, enduring the toxic fumes and radiation of the Abrab volcano, living off anything that could give them \u201ca kick\u201d. They survive by trading in anything, be it objects, substances or even people.\nBalastoc Warrior Piestess  \nTo spread the word of the Red God is the goal of a warrior priestess, looked at with reverent respect and fear. A warrior priestess only bows to her superiors, taking what she wants from everybody else, as the faithful would rather walk in flames than oppose them. However, these agents of the Red God\u2019s clergy are known for having difficulties in dealing with those are not among the flock of the faithful.\nItteghasp Duelist  \nThey duel, get drunk, play Syrus and enjoy the pleasures of the flesh, all in random order. Sometimes they mock somebody for the laughs, only for it to invariably degenerate into a duel. Such is their way, dotted with the occasional blade job to gain enough money to start all over again somewhere else. Their homeland so rich in such opportunities, who can claim to be luckier than a duelist?!\nKetniv Monk\nThese practitioners of martial arts trained their body and spirit in the halls of their monastery until their masters deemed them ready for taking the mark of their order. Now, they are undertaking the second part of their training, the one that will lead them around the world wherever fate deems their presence necessary.\nMostucaal Gunslinger  \nThese individuals obey only one law: their own. It does not matter why they recognize only their own authority, they do not answer to anyone or abide to any rule. The only thing that matters is being fast with a gun and nobody can prove they are not.\nNuugard Stormtrooper\nThe elite corps of the Nuug army, they train for combat and battle since their earliest days. Only those who show unwavering courage and an insane penchant for the melee can hope to go anywhere wearing the colors of the Nuug shock troops, the Character being one of them. Their purple tattoos are the only proof anybody needs to have absolutely no doubt about what happens if they mess with them.\nVulcania is a dynamic world full of adventures. As such, everything in the system is designed to get you constantly into the action at the gaming table. Mechanics are deep, fast, and highly strategic, made intuitive thanks to cards to allow you to always have an eye on equipment and skills.\nIn Vulcania every Test is resolved using a d12. On high values, or by carefully spending Gears of Fate, you can unleash your hero's special powers! Of course, be careful; Destiny is a fickle thing and always demands something in return for its favor!\nGearPills is a video series about the rules of Vulcania, where we want to analyze the core aspects and mechanics of the d12 System used in our game. Available in English and Italian.\nEpisode 1\nENG - https://youtu.be/OB_FRoM2oqM\nITA - https://youtu.be/gHL8BN2ikvA\nEpisode 2\nENG - https://youtu.be/NCce420NaCo\nITA - https://youtu.be/qO9cIXiI2RY\nEpisode 3\nENG - https://youtu.be/ZT-LyfX71-Q\nITA - https://youtu.be/uav88ruRzAc\nEpisode 4\nITA - https://youtu.be/JqEurcD9ZtE\nIn the video series GearPills we used the character sheet to explain the main mechanics of the d12 System used by Vulcania. This accessory is designed to be folded into a sort of tent, each side holding different pieces of information.\nSide 1\n- Name, Past, Origins, Rank and Skill Points\n- Insight score and Senses score \nSide 2\n- Attribute & Skills\n- Tactical Scores (Dodge, Evade, Initiative, Movement, Wounds, Damage    Reduction) - Combat Opportunities\n Side 3\n- Arts  - Equipment - Special Trait & Personality - Knowledge - Proficiency\nYour character\u2019s training and experience are described by four Attributes \u2013 Vigor, Dexterity, Mind, and Magnetism \u2013 related to sixteen Skills to achieve your goals during the game.  \nStrength and intelligence play a key role in your path, as well as luck! Cunning, reactive thinking and aggressive negotiating are some of the qualities that will help you in gathering more knowledge and power.\nSpecialize in your abilities under Art Masters and choose your path. Follow the way of trickery, intuition or fighting to reach your goals. Catch your prey with a trap or hack it to pieces a flourish of your blade. Vulcanian Arts truly accommodate any play style!  \nHundreds of weapons and gadgets await you in Vulcania\u2019s markets. Wield powerful weapons and gather more power with biomechanical grafts. Do not fear rivals in whatever situation your Narrator wants to throw.\nAirships of all shapes and sizes fly soar through the heavens and one could be yours! The Clash in the Skies section lists different classes and of aircraft, from slow and robust cargos to fragile but deadly one-man fighters. Much like with you character, you can customize your ship with many options, be it reinforcing its armor, equipping it with powerful thrusters or setting up its mighty armaments. Perform spectacular maneuvers involving all crew members, dogfight, board your enemies or drown them in hot lead in the skies of Vulcania!\nVulcania is a dangerous world, presenting always different and deadly threats to the players.\nMost of your opponents will not be monsters or strange creatures, but the most lethal and ruthless species ever to live in the world of Vulcania: man.\nJust like in the best action movies, the characters are going to cross weapons with hordes of extras who will try to hinder them in any way, fearsome minions willing to do anything for their masters and deadly villains pulling the strings of intricate conspiracies!\nThe dangers characters face are not always caused by other human beings, however. The world of Vulcania is populated by creatures of all kinds, some tame, some fierce and bloodthirsty, some with inscrutable appetites, irreparably warped by what the war left behind.\nIf you are tired of:   \nchoosing your character once and never choose again because your growth path is completely preset \nspending your evenings adding up the results of hundreds of dices instead of playing \nwaiting for your turn for half an hour and then \u2026 start counting again or miss \nplaying an invincible character that does not require any kind of skill to be played\nIf you want to: \nplay sessions without downtime \nalways be at the center of the action \nquickly solve each test without losing the depth of the rules \nplay a challenging system \nThen you are ready for all of this.

It has simple rules, dangerous combat, flexible PC customisation, and mysterious, unpredictable magic. Designed for short, episodic adventures in sandbox worlds, LFG provides the mechanics and tables needed for easy GM improvisation. It\u2019s a heady mix of the best old school, modern, and new game design, wrapped around a familiar d20 core.\nCover mock up by Daniel Comerci\nMain Features\n9 Classes: Artificer, Barbarian, Bard, Cultist, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue & Magic User; only two of which involve magic.\n12th Level Max eliminates the most powerful spells, and keeps the mightiest monsters scary.\nUnique Features: every 3rd level design your own PC ability in conjunction with your GM. Don't want to make your own? Choose from 36 examples instead. \nRoll Equal or Under for attribute checks (inc degrees of success), making every stat point matter.\nSkills provide access to a level based Reroll Pool, smoothing the fickleness of d20 probability distribution.\nWillpower & Perception attributes replace Wisdom.\nLuck attribute replaces saving throws and powers some Martial Exploits.  \nMinor, Major & Rescue Exploits on top of damage, not in lieu, promote improvised stunts and moments of greatness.\nDangerous Combat: Dropping to zero hp requires a roll on the Injuries & Setbacks table and healing is delayed by 1d3 minutes (magical or otherwise). Players don't roll to find out if their PC is All Dead or Mostly Dead until the battle ends and someone checks the body.\nParty Retreat & Chase rules allow the GM to throw whatever makes sense at the party, unshackling them from balanced encounters and quarantined zones.\n5 minute Short Rests allow PCs to attempt Willpower checks to recover hit points and class abilities, encouraging the party to push on rather than camp.\nLong Rests take 1d6 days (or 1d4 in a safe, comfortable environment), mitigating the nova, rest, repeat problem for adventures with long periods between battles (eg: wilderness treks).\nDark & Dangerous Magic tests and Divine Rebuke tests make all spell casting inherently uncertain. No at-will, teleport, mind reading or resurrection magic. Magic Users are less reliant on spells, proficient in one handed weapons and light armour.\nEvocative Spells: Spells have been tweaked and renamed, eg: Silent Image, Invisibility, Magic Missile and Hold Monster are instead Shadows & Dust, A Wisp Unseen, Lash of Unerring Pain and Crush of the Warp.\nRare Magic Items, with obvious and discreet attunements, that unlock as their owners level up.\nGM Tables for Weather, Exploration Events, Random Encounters, Traps, Treasure, Disease, Madness, Tavern Brawls, Hirelings, Mass Battle, Naval Combat, NPC Quirks, Rival Adventurers, Blackpowder, and more.\n130+ Monsters including effective Boss Monster options (eg: Off Turn Attacks match the party's action economy, and Stronger Luck grants saves even when a save is not normally permitted), plus Custom Monsters guide.   \nOnline Play Support: an LFG character sheet is available for online play via Roll20, and we're exploring options for Fantasy Grounds.\nOpen Game Content: 99% of LFG text is \"Open Game Content\" under the Open Game Licence. Want to make your own adventures or expansions for LFG and sell them? Go right ahead!\nRules as Guidelines. The GM is the final authority on all LFG rules, which are expected to be tweaked to fit table preferences.\nCover image by Daniel Comerci\nBut don't take our word for it. Here's some quotes from reviews of original Low Fantasy Gaming:\n\"Low-Fantasy Gaming is the perfect blend of OSR gaming and 5th Edition mechanics. It's not afraid to draw from multiple sources to create something that's truly unique, infinitely playable, and easy to pick up and run.\" - James Spahn, Halfling's Luck. http://halflingsluck.blogspot.com/2017/09/low-fantasy-high-quality.html\n\"The magic system in LFG is another aspect of the game that sets its apart from the competition... The longer I read LFG the more it reminds me of something like Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay but with D&D-style rules.\"  - Michael Wolf, Stargazer's World. https://stargazersworld.com/2017/02/02/a-look-at-low-fantasy-gaming/\n\"Combat is straightforward, with some free-form \"martial exploits\" (stunts) that allow for more creative combat. There are plenty of rules for permanent injuries and some clever tricks for making combat deadlier (such as characters with 0 HP being harder to heal, which avoids one of 5e's problems)... LFG is not only amazing for a free game, it is an amazing game overall.\" - Eric Diaz, Methods & Madness. http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2016/11/review-low-fantasy-gaming.html\nPrefer video reviews? \n\u201cFor those of you that really love low fantasy games, I highly suggest that you take a look at Low Fantasy Gaming. I guarantee you won't be disappointed...\u201d - Niklas Skinner, 5 Minute Reviews, Skinner Games. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjLKINBSEo\n\u201cLow Fantasy Gaming in my opinion does what it sets out to do, and does it rather well at that\u2026 It\u2019s a little bit more complex than a lot of the light stuff I\u2019ve seen before, but it uses that slight bump up in detail to very good effect.\u201d - RPG Crawler, RPG Crawler Reviews. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBdO-xyHU-o\nCurious for more? Download original LFG right now for free: https://lowfantasygaming.com/comments/\nWhy a Deluxe Edition?\nA lot has happened since LFG's release in 2016. Four new classes. GM Toolkits for Traps, Hirelings, Blackpowder, Naval Combat, and Mass Battle. Two years of play experience and invaluable community feedback. Low Fantasy Gaming Deluxe Edition consolidates all this and more into one mighty tome, in Full Colour or B&W Line Art (your choice). As you might expect, we've taken the opportunity to tweak or clarify a handful of rules, yet remain fully compatible with original LFG material (excluding page number references).\nPartial Contents\nRewards\nDeluxe Edition will be delivered via DriveThruRPG in PDF (Full Colour and B&W Line Art versions) and Hardcover (11 inches tall x 8.5 inches wide, approx 280 pages).\nBackers at Pledge AUD 20 and above automatically receive both PDF versions, including draft files (complete text, incomplete art) as soon as the Kickstarter ends and the funds clear (approx 2-3 weeks). In addition, Backers may choose to add Hardcover \"print at cost\" codes, the Midlands PDF, and/or a bundle of 26 PDF Adventures (Midlands and Adventure PDFs will be sent out with the draft Deluxe PDF).\n** Halfway Update! All Backers at pledge level AUD 20+ will be receiving a free Midlands Colour Hex Map Image File by RPG veteran cartographer John Stevenson! (delivered via DTRPG - see Update #8 for more!) **\n** 72 Hours Left Update: All Backers at pledge level AUD 20+ will be receiving free Deluxe Ed GM Screen files & Character Sheet files by Daniel Comerci! (delivered via DTRPG - see Update #11 for more!) **\nLegendary Artists\nWho are the illustrators this kickstarter is paying for? None other than RPG luminaries Daniel Comerci, Dean Spencer and Matt Forsyth! Feast your eyes on some examples of their work below:\nPLAY\n\nAdventures & Resources\nLow Fantasy Gaming has a growing range of GM resources available via the LFG site, Patreon, DTRPG and Lulu, including fifty adventures (a new scenario released each month) and the highly acclaimed Midlands Low Magic Sandbox Setting. For 2019, plans are afoot with respect to a new GM screen, Downtime Toolkit, Midlands Hex Map and Expanded Bestiary, plus Rituals of Low Fantasy http://www.kjd-imc.org/blog/rituals-of-low-fantasy/ and Patrons of Low Fantasy http://www.kjd-imc.org/blog/patrons-of-low-fantasy/ by Keith Davies of Echelon Game Design.\nAnd to celebrate this launch, we've released three starter adventures for free: (a) #13 Gift of the Silent God, (b) #25 Revelry in Northgate, and (c) #40 Call of the Colossus (the latter being a \"Zero Level Ordeal\") https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10564/Pickpocket-Press\nBut we're just getting started. Slap your peepers on LFG's excellent community content, plus illustrated character sheets, 1st level pregens, GM screen inserts, high res colour Midlands map, and six B&W city maps - all free at the LFG site: https://lowfantasygaming.com/comments/\nPLAY\n\nEasy Compatibility\nWant to use other system's adventures or settings with LFG? It couldn't be easier: swap out monsters and traps for LFG equivalents and you're good to go. For level based games, adventures of 12th level or below work best. For high magic worlds with predictable spell casting, remove or tone down Dark & Dangerous Magic checks.\nNo Stretch Goals?\nAs this is our first Kickstarter, to avoid overextending and ensure all books are produced on time, we are not offering any stretch goals. Rest assured however that any excess funding will go straight into our pock... towaaards additional custom art to make Deluxe Edition the shiniest, most fancy pants RPG book you've ever owned! Or maybe give us a leg up on a new GM screen (** Update #11 - GM Screen is coming!), or swish Midlands hex map (** Update #8 - Midlands Hex Map is coming!)

As you uncover the mystery and piece together the prophecy, you'll progress Freja's character and unlock powerful abilities to break the chains that bind you to the gods.  \nAlong the way, you'll meet a variety of interesting and diverse characters which will either help, hinder or provide some well earned comic relief.\nA traveler and wanderer with a large ego and even larger sword, Stigandr comes from a land that was ravaged by a great famine many moons ago.

Both are composition graduates of the South African College of Music at UCT, and have been composing together for the last few years. They have collaborated on several short film scores, music for television commercials, as well as the feature films Adventures of Zambezia and Khumba. They are also both active performers in the South African music industry and composed the score and sound effects for the games Flash Point:Fire Rescue and Polygod.\n\"It is said that there is one original thought with infinite variations\" - Some Wise Person.\nHere at Unsigned Double we're inspired by the giants of gaming that came before us. We're hoping to take some incredible mechanics and ideas from great games such as Ori and the Blind Forest, Salt and Sanctuary, Hollow Knight, Cuphead and Dark Souls and amalgamate them into a cohesive experience incorporating our vision of the Norse myths and the worlds and characters that embody them.\nIf you enjoyed any of these games, we're sure you'll enjoy our game too!\nA4 sticker sheet of Freja and other things.\nBadges!\nThe game handbook will be filled with art & information on the characters, enemies and worlds of Freja and the False Prophecy.\nPostcards to send across the seas.\nWooden USB flash laser engraved with Freja herself.\nAn A3 satin finish poster of Freja in all her glory.\nWe promise to choose a T-shirt that's soft and comfortable, the way t-shirts should be.\nPut all your other Freja rewards inside this Snarling Vargr Tote Bag.\nBecome an NPC!\nProvide us with your favourite photograph and we'll turn you into an NPC. We'll work together to create your character's: story-line, dialog, where you appear in the game and how you fit into the global story-line & narrative. We'll have a character that looks like you in our game! Awesome!\nThe team at Unsigned Double is a collection of game enthusiasts and dedicated individuals that are united by their love for creation and, above all, gaming.  \n\nWe understand that creating a game requires commitment, passion and hard work. We promise to put in the effort, time and energy to make Freja and the False Prophecy a game worthy of the gods.\n\u201cGame development is hard.\u201d - Everyone, ever.\nFreja and the False Prophecy has been developed by a small group of dedicated individuals working on it part-time and entirely self funded out of our own pockets. While our day jobs keep the rent paid and food in our fridges, countless hours during evenings and weekends have been dedicating to crafting and realising Freja\u2019s journey and the Realms of Yggdrasil. That development includes crafting assets, animations, scripting game mechanics, abilities, enemy AI and behaviour, visual effects, sound design, music, level design, narrative, marketing and the other hundred and one things that go into making a game. Nobody ever said game development is easy.  \nThis is where Kickstarter comes in. We\u2019re in the early stages of development with a long road ahead. The Kickstarter target won\u2019t fund us to the point that we can quit our full time jobs and only work on Freja for the next two years.  We are actively pursuing other means of funding.  What it will do is cover some of our costs (music, animation, sound effects, and some of the writing and development), but more importantly, it\u2019s a way for us to reach an audience! Through this campaign we hope to introduce you to our game, our team, and to prove that there are others like us who want to see this project realised.  We\u2019re inviting you to not only back us, but come with for the ride of making this game and putting something beautiful into the world. Kickstarter is the platform that we\u2019re using to present our game to the world, show that it is something that excites, and invite you to take the next steps with us.  \nEvery contribution, small, large, or even just sharing the campaign, brings us closer to the dream of making this a reality and closer to us delivering a unique and beautiful gaming experience to you.\nHow we'll put your contributions to use\nWhatever contribution you make, we'll endeavor to use it wisely, responsibly and with due diligence. We'll be using the majority of the funds we receive to finance the following areas:\nIf you're unable to pledge \nYou can also support us by:\nPutting in a good word for us.\nSharing our campaign page!! \nFollowing us on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. \nSigning up to our mailing list.\n                                                                                         Press kit: www.thefrejagame.com/presskit", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're a small team working on our first title. It's scary and we don't expect the road to be easy. Like Freja's journey, the challenges ahead are fraught with danger and adversity. However, like our heroine, we believe we have the necessary determination and conviction to conquer them. Everybody starts somewhere and we're inviting you to join us on our journey, and help us achieve our dreams.\n\nAlthough our team lacks experience developing and shipping games, we do have fierce tenacity, work ethic and many years of experience in the related fields of software and web development, animation, film and visual effects to draw from. We're also not afraid of outsourcing and asking for advice and assistance from professionals who've been in the business when we get stuck or need help.\n\nWe know that there is a risk involved in backing a game (or any project on Kickstarter) but we're committed to be transparent with our progress, hard-working, and to put in the many many many hours required to make something truly awesome and memorable. This is just the beginning for Unsigned Double and we'd love for you to be a part of our greater journey, not only for Freja and The False Prophecy, but also to empower us to make even more incredible games in the future.\n\nWith love and commitment from the studio.

We're turning to Kickstarter to launch the EMBERWIND Core, an engine that offers the base for fast, fun, intense, customizable gaming. In the future, we'll release additional modules and content packages to help you further customize and deepen your play experience.\nThe Core engine combines the best elements of our favourite RPGs and video games from the past 20 years, plus some new innovations of our own, all streamlined to make it easy for new players to pick up and for experienced players to dive deeper into strategy and storytelling.\nWe think there's a lot to be excited about here. That's why we're releasing our beta live during the campaign and letting backers judge for themselves.\nTake a look yourself with our first standalone campaign The Skies of Axia, our free monthly DLC packages on Drive-Thru RPG, or our new playable lore Vignette \"Sunlight and Sky.\"\nYou can also preview new content on our Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and see some of our most definitive mechanics lower down on the page (see \"A Look Under the Hood\") or in the FAQ.\nThe EMBERWIND Core rules are intuitive enough to learn in minutes, but offer untold depths of strategy through co-op tactics and modular plugins.\nWe believe that a modular RPG has more to offer players, because players have more to offer each other than a static rules system will allow. That's why we're turning to Kickstarter not just a fundraising platform, but a community of tabletop-lovers.\nWe're looking for your input as we build a community and decide which rules modules to build onto the Core, and release new campaigns, storylines, and settings.\nThis starts with the EMBERWIND Hero Manual: Core Edition, a resource book that gives players everything they need to create fully fleshed, customized Heroes using the game's nine main Classes and drop them into new conflicts, storylines and challenges to test their mettle.\nWe think you're going to love our system. So much so that we're already releasing the beta of our Hero Manual to all reward tier levels during the campaign. We send new invitations to all backers every Monday and Thursday, but you can get yours sooner if you create an account on emberwindgame.com and message us your username or registration email via the Kickstarter messaging system.\n*Cover artwork not final.\nTo get your Heroes into the game, you'll either need one of our two campaign book releases, or our free DLC, which includes Foe Cards (monsters you can fight) and Vignettes (playable scenarios), both of which are accompanied by lore stories.\nSample Foe Card DLC, available for free right now on www.emberwindgame.com\nAll books come with complimentary PDFs tied to your emberwindgame.com account and offer lifetime access to future versions of that same book. That means if we go back to fix errors, update rules or add new sections, you will be able to visit our website and download the updated version from your account.\nOur campaigns teach players the rules as they play, so no one needs to spend hours learning the manual. Even better, we've made GMs optional, with a branching Crossroads system run by rotating narrators and dynamic party voting. Our combats are driven by a hex-based AI system for Foes so everyone can get in on the action.\nYou can show up to the gaming table and begin playing in minutes with pre-gen Heroes and a few print-outs. \nSasmple pre-gen Hero Card. Click to download the Skies of Axia campaign's Support Package and see Hero Cards, Foe Cards, and the quick guide to turn rules.\n\nFor those who love deep dives, the Hero Manual helps you create your own characters. Plus, you can also have one player take on the full-time role of Storyteller and use our campaign books' enhanced Storyteller content for a more immersive role-playing experience with deeper ties to lore.\n\nScroll further down the page for a complete live playthrough of The Skies of Axia on Arvan Eleron's YouTube channel.\nThe Skies of Axia is our first campaign, released in March 2018. Take to the skies on a life-or-death mission to save Gelspar, the dangling slum district of the great airship city of Adriel. Deadly foes and hidden threats lie in wait around every corner, and it will take every bit of skill and knowledge your Heroes possess to uncover the secret of the hearth crystals and return before Gelspar falls from the sky\u2014forever.\n*Cover artwork not final\nThe Songweave Tapestry takes place on the eve of the Festival of Sparks. The mountaintop city of Summit teeters on the brink of chaos. The scions, a once-extinct order of heretic mages, are on the rise. Rumours say the cult plans to unveil a dangerous invention restored from the age of the Unravelling. As the festival approaches and the city becomes a madhouse of controversy, you find yourself at the heart of a conflict that threatens to tear the city apart.\nEMBERWIND's game system, which we call the RISE Engine, has been in the works for a decade. Here are some of the features we're damn proud of.\nYou always know your target number. Rather than bogging down gameplay with complex calculations on both your roll modifier and target number, EMBERWIND uses a streamlined d20 system with simple math on one side of the roll so you always know the odds of pulling off a masterstroke.\nCAP checks make attack rolls simple and fast. In EMBERWIND, it only takes a single die roll against a pre-calculated set of values to instantly determine if you hit your target, if you penetrate their defences, and if you score a critical hit.\nWe made our Classes as flavourful and adaptable as possible. They draw on elements of real-world history and culture, from Taoist philosophy to African war tactics to 12th-century Persian assassin training, re-imagined through mechanics and abilities that let you push past fantasy tropes.\nTell stories without a GM. EMBERWIND campaigns are told through a series of linked encounters read by a rotating narrator, so nobody needs to sit out as GM. At the end of every encounter is a Crossroad, where your party faces a set of branching narrative choices that you navigate together through dynamic voting systems. It's choose-your-path adventure book with epic combats and cascading consequences that culminate in epic finales.\nCombats run themselves with Foe AI. Every EMBERWIND Foe has an AI Hex Grid that lets you roll a die and randomly execute a preset attack sequence. Default Characteristics determine how they move and attack, Optional Modifiers grant additional depth to combat, and learning mechanisms keep Heroes on their toes. Switch between Skirmish and War modes for AI to keep larger battles moving smoothly.\nYou can learn more about these specific mechanics in our FAQ section, including how GM-less storytelling works, how Foe AI Hex Grids, how to make a CAP Check, and what a Round of Combat looks like in EMBERWIND.\nYou can also review the quickplay combat turn rules from our Skies of Axia campaign for a simple walkthrough.\nClick to download.\nOr see the mechanics in action in Arvan Eleron's YouTube-streamed playthrough of The Skies of Axia!\nEnter the EMBERWIND battlefield with nine powerful Hero Classes that let you reinvent your role in the party and your path to victory. We decided to build our Classes not around fulfilling a single role in the party, but by achieving any number of roles using a particular flavour or play style.\nCommander Classes\nThe Atlanta is the lion of war, always found where the fray is thickest. She relies on her mastery of arms and supernatural charisma to carry her allies to victory. With an Atlanta in their ranks, a small unit can fight with the ferocity of an entire army.\nSpell Schools and Exploit Expertises: Restoration Magic, Skirmishing Expertise, Inspiration Expertise, Shielding Expertise\nThe Spiritualist moves like water. He is a sea of calm on the surface, hiding powerful currents of energy in his depths. He uses his mystic arts to raise fallen allies, drain the vigour of his enemies, or deliver blows that turn bone to dust.\nSpell Schools: Healing Magic, Harrow Magic, Involution Magic\nThe Tactician is the most adaptable frontline leader. A good Tactician knows how to read his opponents, stack the deck in his allies\u2019 favour, and play the odds to come out on top in the mud, blood, and chaos of the battlefield.\nExploit Expertises: Motivation Expertise, Bravery Expertise, Warfare Expertise\nSoldier Classes\nWhile the Archer is peerless in ranged combat, she can fluidly shift between combat styles to dispense with enemies near and far with and respond to the rhythms of combat to make sure every shot and slash lands true.\nExploit Expertises: Preparation Expertise, Wind Dancing Expertise, Sharpshooting Expertise\nThe Rogue uses a trickster\u2019s cunning, a gambler\u2019s courage, and an assassin\u2019s unflinching instincts to claim victory. Relying on expert positioning, lightning reflexes and deadly poisons, the Rogue always ensures a swift kill and safe retreat.\nExploit Expertises: Trickster Expertise, Serpent Expertise, Slayer Expertise\nTo the Warrior, the battlefield is a canvas that can be painted with a hundred different kinds of bloodshed. A cunning fighter, the Warrior overpowers foes and defends fellow heroes with a constantly evolving arsenal of battle maneuvers.\nExploit Expertises: Armsman Expertise, Brutality Expertise, Defender Expertise\nHarbinger Classes\nThe Ardent weaves arcane power into complex chains of magic that can lay waste to a battlefield or strike down single targets with merciless efficiency. As dangerous as the magic she parleys with, the Ardent is driven by a burning obsession with power.\nSpell Schools: Needling Magic, Destruction Magic, Manipulation Magic\nThe Druid is a keeper of the wilderness and an enforcer of its harsh laws. Like the natural world they draw their magic from, Druids are extremely adaptable, capable of unleashing a full spectrum of regenerative and destructive forces.\nSpell Schools: Regeneration Magic, Degeneration Magic, Growth Magic\nThe Invoker is the unmatched master of control magic, capable of reshaping the battlefield and bending the minds and abilities of enemies. She specializes in adapting her strategies and directing combat with a well-placed curse or boon\nSpell Schools: Alteration Magic, Curse Magic, Geomancy Magic\nNote: Shipping costs will be calculated and charged in BackerKit after the campaign.

Now, with the introduction of our new parts, well over 8000 painters in more than 50 countries are using the Hobby Holder as part of their painting arsenal!\nWe have talked to hundreds of painters across the globe at conventions, online and in person, and we have listened to your wants and needs. Now we are back to add two new pieces to the Hobby Holder system: the Ergonomic Grip for even greater control and comfort and the XL Stability Bar for more support with a wider range of miniature sizes. We are also adding more color to your desks with New Colors of the original Hobby Holder parts with a second production run!\nAll 11 Colors are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nThe Hobby Holder is the World's Most Versatile, Comfortable and Precise Miniature Holder and the ONLY All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip. \nThe translucent blue parts are resin printed prototypes.\nAttach Miniatures to the Hobby Holder with Standard 28mm Bottle Caps or Even Wine Corks for Pinning.   \nAccepts 28mm plastic caps; Citadel \u2122 Paint Caps; Formula P3 paint caps; and 20mm wine cork.\nWith the innovative bottle cap attachment method, just stick your miniatures, based or unbased, to a standard soda/water bottle cap with your favorite sticky stuff (we use Loctite Fun-tak, the best blue-tak on the market!) and you can quickly and easily screw them on and off without ever touching the miniature! Perfect for batch painting because you can switch even wet miniatures without smudging. \nBatch paint with ease and never touch a wet miniature again!\nPin your miniatures? No problem! The center hole of the Hobby Holder is perfectly sized to press fit standard wine corks or any 20mm cork. Just push them in, place in the pinned miniature and get painting! Done with the cork? Insert a paintbrush through the middle hole in the bottom of your Hobby Holder.\n360 Degree Rotation in Any Position for Ultimate Precision\n360 Degree Rotation Overhead Stability Bar Mode with the New XL Stability Bar\n360 Degree Rotation Stability Bar Grip Mode\n360 Degree Rotation in Ergonomic Grip Mode\nWith our unique patent pending design, the Hobby Holder threaded base can easily rotate 360 degrees in the Overhead Stability Bar mode, with the Stability Bar functioning as the grip in Grip Mode and now when clicked into the Ergonomic Grip Mod, with or without the Stability Bar attached, in Ultimate Support mode. This affords more control and the ability to get all around your miniature without letting go!\n New Ergonomic Grip Provides Even More Control and Comfort Tailored to How You Paint. \nClicked into the Ergonomic Grip rotate your mini 360 degrees easily with one hand!\nThe new Ergonomic Grip gives even more support when attached to the bottom of the Hobby Holder Base and allows the use of the Stability Bar and Grip at the same time. Simply click in your Hobby Holder Threaded Base and start painting. The QuickClick design allows for Full 360 Degree Rotation of the Threaded Base with one hand while attached to the Ergonomic Grip.\nThe Ergonomic Grip is two pieces and can be taken apart and weighted if desired. It also has the option to add two standard nuts to screw in the original #6-32 bolt to lock down the Hobby Holder Threaded Base and now a 1/4\" bolt to attach larger platforms if desired.\nNEW XL Stability Bar Offers More Room For Larger Miniatures With the Same Superior Support.\nThe New XL Stability Bar uses the same QuickClick design as the Standard Size Stability Bar and attaches right onto the Hobby Holder Threaded base in Upright or Grip modes.\nThe XL Stability Bar accommodates miniatures with up to 70mm bases with ease and the offset finger support design allows you to attach miniatures that are even taller than the bar itself. The angle of the XL Stability Bar has been adjusted slightly so that even with the taller profile it is comfortable and easy to use with large or small hands.\nUltimate Support, Brush Control and Comfort with the Original Stability Bar and NEW XL Stability Bar  \nThe stability bar rotates 360 degrees so you never have to let go of your miniatures.\nPaint with ease with unparalled acces all the way around your miniatures, even the top!\nThe original offset Stability Bar allows you to paint miniatures with up to 50mm bases in Overhead Stability Bar. Now with the XL Stability Bar you will be able to paint miniatures with up to 70mm bases. \nWith the offset design of the Stability bar you can even paint taller miniatures. And with the multiple pinch and finger rests built into the Stability Bar there is always a comfortable way to hold your Hobby Holder while getting even the trickiest areas painted.\nWant to paint even larger miniatures? Simply flip either Stability Bar over into Grip Mode or click on the new Ergonomic Grip and the Hobby Holder will accept any size miniature.\nEasily Switch Between Base Only, Holder, Grip and Ultimate Support Modes with the QuickClick Connection.\nHigh-strength ABS plastic means durable, longlasting QuickClick connections\nThe Ultimate All-in-one Painting Handle and Grip Now Has Even More Customization with Hundreds of Holding Positions\nAs the Hobby Holder can be customized so can your support and comfort!\nMore Great Features\nMade from strong, yet lightweight ABS plastic\n4mm center hole for removing corks. Just push a brush, file or cork popper through and out pops the cork.\nErgonomically designed and tested for maximum comfort while painting or sculpting\nDishwasher and Simple Green safe for quick cleaning\nReduced mess! Keeps your hands and work space cleaner\nMade in the USA\nGreat for everyone \u2013 from those just getting into a hobby to seasoned professionals! \nCheck out some amazing painters who use the Hobby Holder!\n\"As essential as a brush and pallet, the Hobby Holder is a must.\" - Sam Lenz\n\"I have been painting for over 20 years  and one of the things I advise everyone on is how to hold your miniature while painting. The Hobby Holder is the best on the market for this. You customize the grip to how you paint and it has endless options to personalize your painting experience. Hands down the best holder I have used.\" - Neil Hollis\n\"You can't paint miniatures without a brush, shouldn't paint without a lamp and you won't want to paint without the Hobby Holder once you have tried it.\" - Watch It Paint It\n\"Well, in short, it's really dope... I'm doing all sorts of flips with this beast and got mad angles sniped with the brush with fluid ease. Highly recommended y'all!\" - Malev Minis\n\"I've been painting for about a decade now, and one thing I've always struggled with was holding the miniature well; to help stabilize it, I always pinched down on the top of the model, which often lead to rubbing away some paint. The Hobby Holder has been a game-changer here - the vertical stability bar takes the place of that pinch, without needing to touch the model at all. The handle is comfortable and easy to use, and you can modify it to suit your needs - I've filled mine with a bit of wine cork for holding pinned models.\" - Mike Cousins, Epic Duck Studios\n\"From the first use, I fell in love with Hobby Holder, and MANY of my viewers in my stream have also fallen in love with theirs as well. Now with all of these great accessories available, how could you not use and love these products? Hobby Holder is the perfect tool for commission painters like myself, who need to quickly switch from model to model while batch painting, or get in tight on a competition piece. Hobby Holder is for literally anyone and everyone, and I feel it will help elevate any skill level!  Thank you Kit, for such a great set of products!  They really have changed my painting in a great way!\" - Impending Duff\n\"The Hobby Holder has truly been a game changer for me! Not only for improved comfort while painting, but an overall improvement in the quality of my work. The handle is just amazing! I no longer have to touch my minis messing up the paint, and the handle has an area wide enough for me to stabilize my pinky on while I paint the tiniest of details. If that isn't amazing enough,  the addition of the large hand grip is just icing on this already amazing cake. I highly recommend the Hobby Holder and the super comfortable grip for every mini painter!\" - Super Sarah\n\"The Hobby Hobby is hands down my favorite way to hold miniatures.  It gives me a consistent, adaptable way to hold just about anything.  I've used it for everything from mouselings to large terrain pieces due to its flexibility of use. With the large grip mod attached to the bottom I always have a perfect hold on my piece, no matter the size.  It's the tool I reach for with every mini.\" - Spotted Painter\n\"The Hobby Holder is seriously the best holder I have used; for my shaky hands, the Hobby Holder miniature holder, gives me the stability, control, and comfort I needed.\" - Brushforhire\nThe Hobby Holder does exactly what it says on the tin with its grip, handle and bottle cap base! It is easy to use and quick to swap bottle caps over while batch painting troops and even holding bigger models. - Garry's Workshop\nThe Hobby Holder is the perfect addition to any hobbyist's table. Whether you're clumsy of a good ol' perfectionist, it allows for comfort and precision for massive painting sessions as well as a handy way to switch between projects. I am so glad I discovered them!\" - Samriel Painting Studio\nCheck out #hobbyholder and be sure to follow us Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to see all the amazing painting happening on the Hobby Holder!\nAll pledges will let you select the exact parts you want in the pledge manager based on the number of parts you pledged for.\nMix, match and personalize your choices so you get the exact painting support you need and want from the Hobby Holder, All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip! \n*All pledges now include the \"Hit The Ground Running\" Pack that contains 5 bottle caps, sticky-tak and a custom button!* \n_____\nAvailable Parts\nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, New XL Stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip \nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, XL Stability Bar, Ergonomic Grip Mod\nAvailable Colors\nAll four parts (Threaded Base, Ergonomic Grip Mod, Standard Stability Bar and XL Stability Bar) are now available in Sky Blue, Fresh Green, Black, Purple, Orange, Red, Silver, Midnight Blue, Copper, White and Yellow!\nAll 11 Colors Are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nNumber of Parts Choices Per Pledge Level\n Just A Taste: Choice of ANY 1 PART \n The Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 2 PARTS \n The Discerning Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 3 PARTS \n The All-in Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 4 PARTS \n The Wargamer: Choice of ANY 6 PARTS \n The Professional: Choice of ANY 8 PARTS \n The Ultimate Painter: Choice of ANY 12 PARTS \nYou can choose any combination of parts (Threaded Base, Standard Stability bar, New XL stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip Mod)\nReward Selection Example:\nIf you pledge at the The All-in Hobbyist level, you get your choice of any four Hobby Holder parts in any configuration and color you choose.

With the creation of the original Hobby Holder, we put a lot of research into finding a US-based manufacturing partner who could produce exceptional quality parts. We have been thrilled with the results and our painters can attest to the quality of the parts. With this new campaign, we plan to have the molds made by the same company to get that same superior quality.\nWhen the funding goal is reached with your help, we will be able to produce a family mold for the Ergonomic Grip Mod, a 3-part mold for the new XL Stability Bar, and machine time to get parts made from our existing molds. \nPackaging proofs for various parts\nWorking closely with our US-based manufacturer we have the injection mold files approved and waiting for the thumbs up to move forward. Once the go-ahead is given, we will see injection molded samples in about 15 days.\nPressure testing and quality review\nDuring this time, we will be sending out surveys through BackerKit for you to select the various painting handle and grip parts and add-ons you would like. Once the surveys are completed, we will place the order with the manufacturer and anticipate receiving the new parts at the first half of February, with pledge fulfillment starting the beginning of March.\nAfter fulfillment is complete, the entire Hobby Holder system will be available on the Game Envy website at www.gameenvy.net\nMy wonderful, supportive family <3\nAs many of you now know, my name is Kit, I am the founder of Game Envy Creations and creator of the Hobby Holder and many unique hobby accessories. I am a husband to a wonderful wife, father to two sweet boys and one cute kitty. I am self employed and dedicated to bringing amazing hobby products to life through Game Envy Creations and creating beautiful design through my freelance graphic design business. Making makes me happy and being able to share it with the world makes me even happier!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn our first Kickstarter campaign we learned a lot about the manufacturing process and acknowledge there is always the risk of delays. Working with a US-based manufacturer means we have better communication, only being one timezone apart. It also means we can get changes and parts done in several days, rather than months.\n\nWe are using our same trusted vendors who we are in close communication with to make sure everything is on track and have backup plans available if there are any hiccups. This combined with open and quality communication with our backers we were able to start delivering rewards within three months (two weeks early) in the original Hobby Holder campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Cool Project!", "descp": "Show some support, follow along with updates and access the add-ons.\nINCLUDES:\nA Nice Feeling in Your Heart", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Just A Taste", "descp": "Choice of ANY 1 PIECE of the Hobby Holder system.

And I want you to giggle some while we do it. -Dr. Faith G. Harper\nFeaturing illustrations by Trista Vercher of sex-positive, science-informed brains!\nThis book is about building intimacy, with or without a partner, through personal and sexual expression. Especially through shit like consent, boundaries, and communication\u2014which we don\u2019t talk about on the regular, although we really fucking should. \nAnd this book is also about sex.\nFor most of us, sex is a big part of our lives and romantic relationships. It\u2019s not the foundation of a long term partnership, but it is that super-important spray insulation foam that fills in all the cracks and gaps, keeping the foundation airtight. \nWe can\u2019t separate the relationship stuff from the sex stuff, because they are not separate issues. Sex is an instrumental part of connection and communication between partners. So information on building, or rebuilding, that connection is here as well.\nDr. Faith's mission in her newest book is to help you make your intimate relationships more awesomely satisfying\u2014whatever that means to you. \nIn Unf*ck Your Intimacy, you'll learn practical knowledge and advice around:\nThree major factors that hold us back from satisfying intimate relationships: Trauma, conflicts with our religious beliefs or upbringing, and our uncooperative, constantly changing bodies\nSelf-compassion, boundaries, and consent\u2014the basic foundations of a healthy intimate life\nFiguring out your own sexual identity, wants, and needs\nCore skills for finding a date, dating, and relationshipping\nRockstar communication skills for any kind of relationship\nSensual and sexual touch, by yourself and with partners\nSteps for recovery from cheating\nGood boundaries and communication for open relationships, kinky stuff, and any time partners have differential desires\nThis book is for everyone who is open to exploring their intimate life and who wants some permission, perspective, skills, and science to help get them there.\nThe author is kind, wickedly knowledgable, swears a lot, and is mindful of potential trauma histories and other vulnerabilities. If you're single, partnered, polyam, queer, trans, hetero, pan, ace, demi, figuring it out, or have no idea what any of that means, you're welcome in these pages. \nAbout the book\nUnf*ck Your Intimacy is divided into three parts. Here's how the author describes them:\nPart One: How Our Intimacy Gets Fucked\nHuman beings are epically skilled at fucking up a good thing. How many bizarre messages have you received about sex and love over the years that really crimped your game? We\u2019ve got shame issues, abuse issues, religious messages. That\u2019s a lot of shit to navigate.\nPart Two: Unfucking Our Relationship with Ourselves \nHave you never had a handle on what you want and who you are? Or did you once, and then everything changed because you changed? We certainly can\u2019t have the deep, interpersonal connections we want if we don\u2019t know what we actually, really want. That doesn\u2019t make us shitty human beings. It makes us products of a society that tells us how to be, what to be, and who to be. Which means many of us have work to do. What\u2019s our identity? How do we communicate with others? How can we interact with our own selves in order to be authentic, connected human beings? \nPart Three: Unfucking Our Relationships with Others\nOnce we get a better handle on who we are, then we have to figure out who we are in connection with other people. And we need to learn to express that honestly, vulnerably, and all that horribly difficult shit. Remember, intimacy is interpersonal. Very few people are an island unto themselves. So how do we do this well in a world that is designed for us to fuck it up?\nAbout the author\nDr. Faith G. Harper (aka The Intimacy Dr.) is the author of the bestselling Unf*ck Your Brain and a growing number of useful, hilarious, and down-to-earth books and zines that use science to teach you essential humaning skills. She\u2019s a licensed professional counselor, board supervisor, certified sexologist, and applied clinical nutritionist with a private practice and consulting business in San Antonio, TX. She has been an adjunct professor and a TEDx presenter, and proudly identifies as a woman of color and uppity intersectional feminist. \nAbout the publisher\nSince 1996, Portland-based independent Microcosm Publishing has been creating and distributing books and zines for the purpose of reader self-empowerment, on topics ranging from punk to bicycling, healthy eating to healthy relationships, social skills to social justice. \nAbout the rewards\nThe book itself\nUnfuck Your Intimacy: Using Science for Better Relationships, Sex, & Dating by Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN is a 192 page paperback book, 5.25x6.75 inches, with illustrations throughout by Trista Vercher. It comes out in June, 2019, but Kickstarter backers will get their copies in February. \nIntimacy & Coping\nWe're releasing two books at once by Dr. Faith: Intimacy and Coping Skills. We ran the Kickstarter campaign for Coping last month, and as promised, you can save a bit on shipping by backing both at once here. Also, these coping skills are gonna come in handy as you face your stuff about sex and relationships. Trust us.\nIntimacy Outtakes\nAt this level, you'll get the Intimacy book, plus these Dr. Faith & friends zines that didn't make the final cut:\n Sex Toys - this is a full chapter that we had to cut out of Intimacy for space reasons. \n STI FAQ - co-written with Dr. Aaron Sapp and Bonnie Scott, this guide to sexually transmitted infection demystifies the medical side like whoa and offers valuable emotional advice for living with an STI.\n BDSM FAQ - Dr. Faith's first-ever zine! Parts appear in the Intimacy chapter on kink, but the whole thing is super helpful if you're at all interested in exploring this sort of play\n Woke Parenting #4 - co-written with fellow sex therapist Bonnie Scott, this issue of the popular Woke Parenting zine is all about how to teach your kids good interpersonal relationship skills, including in sex and dating\nHeal Yourself\nSo this book (and all of Faith's work) is very trauma-informed. If you're struggling with past trauma of any kind, it probably affects your intimate life. These books can help. Along with Intimacy, you'll get:\n Unf*ck Your Brain - this is the classic! Learn exactly what past shit you've gone through is doing in your brain and how to recover fully, because yes that is something you can do\n Support - Cindy Crabb's small resource on healing from sexual abuse, and helping others heal\n Self-Compassion - another one by Faith. There's a short chapter on this in Intimacy but the whole, uncompressed thing, including more exercises, is really nice to have\n Coping Skills - because this is powerful stuff and you need as many resources as you can get\nDating & Relationshipping Toolkit\nWant a level-up with your partnering or partner-seeking? Along with Unf*ck Your Intimacy, we'll send you this practical and entertaining list:\n Sex From Scratch - Sarah Mirk's guide to the range of healthy relationships provides excellent perspective and food for thought on what you want your intimate life to look like, and with who\n Consensuality - Helen Wildfell and friends' meditations and exercises are all honed for developing better skills around boundaries and consent, even if you've never learned that stuff before\n Learning Good Consent - Cindy Crabb's classic guide to this much-misunderstood term and practice\nSexitimes Superpack\nSex is something you can always learn more about and get more inspired about. This extremely sexed up zine collection starts with Unf*ck Your Intimacy and goes on to include\n Sex Toys - yup, the chapter that got cut, you can now have in your back pocket!\n Sexing Yourself - the masturbation chapter did not get cut, just edited down a bit, but we figured you might need it anyway. The perfect gift for your friend who's recovering from a fundamentalist upbringing\n Go F*ck Yourself - a handy guide to crafting your own sex toys!\n Dick Ain't Sh*t - because there is so much more to sex than putting dicks in places\n Sex Without Roles - while Eli Sachse's excellent zine is written specifically for people in transition, it's a good read for anyone seeing to know and communicate what they want sexually\n Adult Themes - Chantel G's sexy stories and poems are a nice break from all the instructional stuff we're laying on you here\n Chocolatology isn't intentionally a sexy book, but the chocolate truffles / hot chocolate / savory chocolate meals you produce from it may or may not significantly improve your chances of successful intimacying. Let us know how it goes!\nLove Stories (Kind of)\nWhether or not you care about sex, maybe you're a romantic, or maybe the romantic part of your life is what needs more work and inspiration. Pay good heed to the many communication and boundaries skills contained within Unf*ck Your Intimacy, and also enjoy these tales, fictional and non:\n Aftermath of Forever - Natalye Childress dishes the dirt on her many dates after a young divorce, from the humorous to the poignant\n White Elephants - Katie Haegele's touching true story about finding love in the midst of grief\n Portland Queer - many contributors write about pursuing love, sex, and getting to live their own lives in the Rose City, edited by Ariel Gore\n The Velocipede Races - Emily June Street's exciting novel of bicycle racing and coming-of-age\nDr. Faith Book & Zine Superpack\nOur own doc Faith is a prolific creator. We're not above turning one of her zines into a chapter of a book or vice versa. So this is her full complement of stuff we've published. Some of this content has some overlap (eg, the Anxiety and Depression books started as chapters of Unf*ck Your Brain and were greatly expanded so that they're pretty much new works) but we've left out the stuff that is basically just a copyedited version of a chapter in something else. So along with Unf*ck Your Intimacy, you'll enjoy this still-vast collection including five other books:\n Unf*ck Your Brain- the Dr. Faith classic, it's a bestseller for a reason!\n Unf*ck Your Adulting - how to act grown. Spoiler: it's not about making your bed, it's about how you treat yourself and others\n This is Your Brain on Depression - the science of how depression happens and how we get better\n This is Your Brain on Anxiety - another sciencey take, with lots of practical measures to get free again\n Coping Skills - from everyday stressors to major impacts, these skills will get you through\nAnd a whole stack of zines:\n Unf*ck Your Sleep - the most basic, necessary, and overlooked thing of all\n Self-Compassion - another extremely basic need, expanded from the chapter in Intimacy \n Woke Parenting #1-4 - co-written with Bonnie Scott, these parenting zines teach you to raise intersectional feminists who can fend for themselves in this messed up world\n Getting Over It - how to move on from whatever's holding you back\n Emotional Freedom Technique - aka \"tapping,\" this helps with the getting-over-stuff\n Achieve Your Goals - a miniature workbook for actualizing your dreams\n Working - how to get by, get ahead, and achieve more goals, via working for money\n Defriending - because all this intimacy stuff aside, friendship breakups are the worst\n Sex Toys - maybe we should have cut the chapter on resolving fights and just put this one in anyway? \n BDSM - it's really all about consent, communication, and boundaries, not that 50 Shades crap\n Unf*ck Your Brain Workbook - exercises to help you human better\n STI FAQ - co-authored with Dr. Aaron Sapp and Bonnie Scott, all the medical and emotional issue you need to survive getting a sexually transmitted infection\n Detox Your Masculinity - another Dr. Aaron collabo, this one is all about body image issues, specifically for men and masc folx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we let you get close enough to read this book, there's a very good chance we might be rejected or hurt. What if we share a beautiful moment and then you abandon us for some Penguin Random House relationship guide?

This works well for some games but sometimes the nuances of a scene can get lost in a big room with background noise. This is why we have structured New MexiCon to have each game run in its own private room. We want you to have an environment for your game that will be as distraction-free as possible.  \nMustering is a fun way to pitch your game or find a game to play on the fly! To kick things off, all people running games will pitch their game to the con. Next, players choose the games they want to be in. A symbol on your badge will help determine priority and resolve ties. The result? We get a large number of people playing really awesome games!\nIf you want to sign up to run a game or play a game before the convention, we have you covered! After the close of the Kickstarter, there will be a selection of games available for pre-registration online for backers only! More information will follow in Backer Updates.\nAs much as we like to game we also want to make sure folks have time to eat! Community is important to us, and what better way to get to know someone than to share a meal. This is why we schedule a lunch and dinner break so everyone has time to grab some noms, socialize with their fellow attendees, and still make the next gaming slot.\nMustering at New MexiCon encourages people to bring a wide variety of tabletop roleplaying games. Our convention is shaped by what games people are excited to run! There's only one thing better than playing and running games that you love - finding new games to love! At New MexiCon we encourage people to gravitate not only to those things that you know and love but to try new things as well. Just to give you an idea of the scope of games pitched, here are some of the games people brought to New MexiCon 2018:\nBlades in the Dark, Pasi\u00f3n de las Pasiones, Lady Blackbird, Dialect, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Swords Without Master, Cartel, Inspectres, Velvet Glove, Sagas of the Icelanders, Bluebeard\u2019s Bride, Tales from the Loop, Burning Wheel, Primetime Adventures, Golden Sky Stories, Monsterhearts, Annalise, Epyllion, Mouse Guard, Masks, The Sprawl, Slayer Cake, Blue Rose and so much more!\nEvery pledge helps us bring you the best convention possible. Every guest helps us brings new and interesting characters to the table. And every game master helps us tell the moving and adventurous stories of our dreams. We love our spotlight GMs and want to give everyone a chance to play with these masters of the craft. So, when you buy a badge you will get a chance at a seat in a spotlight game! Or you can back at THE WHOLE ENCHILADA level to get a guaranteed spot in a GM spotlight game.\nWith an increase in hotel costs and growing numbers of attendees, we're looking to raise $1,500. We need your help to bring together this weekend of great gaming and awesome people against the beautiful southwestern backdrop of the Land of Enchantment.\nBacking this Kickstarter will allow us to: \nProvide private gaming rooms \nStock our Lobo Room with snacks and water \nHave an on-site printer \nPut on a post-con BBQ \nSpotlight talented GMs \nEvery little bit helps, so please spread the word and bring your friends out to New MexiCon 2019!  \nThis year we are returning to the site of New MexiCon 2018, the MCM Elegante, under a new name: the Ramada Hotel Midtown! Here are some awesome features of this venue: \n On-site bar - Great for hanging out with people after games. Chat and have a drink! \n Free airport shuttle - Up to 5 miles around the hotel and airport pickup/dropoff. \n Breakfast - Free breakfast available for hotel guests. $5.95 for everyone else! \n Security - Gated parking with security 24 hours a day.  \n Swimming pool - Take a break from games and go for a swim! \n Convention suite/break room - Hang out, talk games, and relax in the Lobo Room. \n Private rooms for gaming - Beds will be removed, making room for tables and chairs\n Event oriented staff - Friendly hotel staff is accustomed to hosting events of all sizes.\nWe have a number of GMs here at New MexiCon whose mastery we want to celebrate.

Each badge purchase will grant the attendee a chance at seat at the table!\nSPOTLIGHT GM: Justin Suzuki\nJustin Suzuki is a human being who loves to game. He was first introduced to RPGs over 30 years ago. Since then he has gone on to turn his love of gaming into hosting such gaming podcasts as RolePlayDNA and Smiling Jack's Bar and Grill. He also helped found Gamers Giving, a 501c3 charity based out of Colorado that raises money through gaming. Justin also helped by working on the Reality Blurs game tremulus.  \nSPOTLIGHT GAME:  Voodoo Tilt (The Zombies of Rock) \n Voodoo Tilt was one of the greatest hair bands of their time, but now a days they play smaller clubs and venues. On this day they are playing an island concert and even the dead are ready to rock! Play this FATE game as a member of the band or one of the roadies who are along for the ride. Bring your best roleplaying skills and get ready to live out all your hairband fantasies!    \nSPOTLIGHT GM: Alexsondra \"Faye\" Oas-Thorn\nAlex is a wound care specialist nurse with gaming dreams of grandeur. She is often found enthusiastically inspiring non-gamers to come and try something new. Experienced in LARP, first timers, SCA, End of Days and indie table tops of all kinds. Having dipped her toes into many games she has also tried table top war games, board game from BGG and netrunner LCG. Often found a little bit of everywhere, Alex is ready for adventures and snacks any time\nSPOTLIGHT GAME: Ten Candles ( When the lights go out)  \n\"Ten Candles\u201d is described as a \"tragic horror\" game rather than survival horror for one main reason: in Ten Candles there are no survivors. In the final scene of the game, when only one candle remains, all of the characters will die. In this, Ten Candles is not a game about \"winning\" or beating the monsters. Instead, it is a game about what happens in the dark, and about those who try to survive within it. It is a game about being pushed to the brink of madness and despair, searching for hope in a hopeless world, and trying to do something meaningful with your final few hours left\".  \nSPOTLIGHT GM: Yoshi Creelman\nYoshi Creelman is a member of the Gauntlet gaming community. You may have heard his voice on the occasional podcast, in particular the Mercy Falls Monsterhearts AP or the recent Big Bad Con roundup. His latest effort has been Gauntlet Games Now, an on demand gaming event for the online community. You can catch him playing or running the latest indie story game, most of the time with the hair up... but occasionally his fabulous hair will be down! \nSPOTLIGHT GAME: Good Society\nGood Society is a game of regency romance and drama. There will be dances and manors, sly glances and whispered rumors, smooches and social backstabbing. All the characters will be entangled in a web of desires and obligations, rife for both disaster and celebration. Which will it be?

Each session should take about 3-4 hours. Play is open-ended, and can continue as long as players find new elements to explore in their town and in themselves. While this RPG is designed for long-form play, with the Kickstarter we're releasing a convention play packet to help you create memorable one-shot play experiences. \nTurn includes interlocking character sheets to represent your human roles and beast archetypes. You will also create your town map together at the table on the template we provide. The Town Manager will have their own checklists, references, and records sheets to make facilitating the game easier. \nThis Kickstarter will fund a print run of the already-completed game as a 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover book with visual art by Rhis Harris and John W. Sheldon, and poetry by A.J. Odasso. The game is a creation of Brie Beau Sheldon, with developmental editing by John W. Sheldon and Tracy Barnett. The Kickstarter is being guided by Tracy as a consultant, combining Brie\u2019s experience with Tracy\u2019s to help guarantee success.\nA bear retrieves the Good Stuff from their stash - illustration by Rhis Harris\nTurn has completed its first editing pass with Tracy and John. The text has been available online as a beta (here) and playtested at conventions in the US and Italy, online, and face to face with Brie, John, and other GMs. The game has been in development since 2013, and we\u2019re excited to finally get it into the hands of players and GMs.\nIn Turn, players will play out slice-of-life stories. This means that while they will encounter crises and drama, it is not often life-or-death outside the normal experiences of a human or beast. The overarching plot of a season of Turn may be something like a local town election with heated debates and threats to the land where the beasts roam, or maybe a family member of one or more shifters is struggling financially or with their health and the shifter players have to try to help them through it. There can be complicated relationships in these small towns, and players will have the opportunity to explore the skeletons in the closets of even the most secretive non-player characters. They even have to deal with the problems animals do, like finding food and mates, or keeping their homes safe.\nEach session, players will encounter real-life stressors like aggravating phone calls and territorial threats while they struggle to balance their beast and human identities. They\u2019ll also find opportunities to seek community with their fellow shifters and with mundane animals and people, and to enjoy the comforts of human life or the freedom of beast life. Their towns will provide opportunity to delve into their own shifter culture while finding connections to the roots of the mundanes around them.\nTurn uses three regular six-sided dice (d6s) to determine consequences for player actions. Characters have low absolute value stats, special powers and abilities, stress tracks that represent how stressed out the character is in each of their forms, and exposure tracks that represent how well their identity is hidden. Two of the dice are the \u201cbase\u201d dice, and the third is the turn die, which can be added to most rolls when players can refer to their beast powers or human abilities to activate it. When they do this, it interacts with the stress mechanic - two stress tracks that players can mark as consequences of actions or use of the turn die. When a stress track reaches the limit, players are forced to change form by the end of the scene. They never lose control or agency beyond the changing of their form, and there are multiple methods to reduce stress and return to their other form. \nPlayers use struggles when they take action and the action they take conflicts with one of their forms. A cougar shifter in beast form might find resistance from their human identity when they try to hunt down a rabbit, but while in human form at a church social, they might struggle not to eat the entire ham! They\u2019ll succeed at it, because you always succeed in Turn - it just takes time, and has consequences. When players roll struggles, they have scaling success that allows them to choose which consequences result from their actions. They roll, and add or subtract the appropriate Nature - a beast Instinct or Human Habit. If they fail the roll, they simply accomplish their task, but the Town Manager can bring more consequences to bear. This includes exposure, Turn\u2019s relationship mechanic.\nA wolf pack investigates evidence of humans - illustration by Rhis Harris\nExposure is tracked for each player\u2019s connected non-player characters, for the town, and for any animal groups. Each instance can be positive or negative, depending on whether the player is positively perceived and whether what they do is hurtful or helpful...and sometimes, just on how the affected mundane is feeling that day! Exposure adds up, and will eventually lead to being reviled, revealed, or known - the reality of which is dependent on play. \nThroughout all of this, players pursue their goals - human goals that happen once and, once accomplished, get replaced with new goals, and beast goals that respond to nature\u2019s pressures and cycle with the seasons. Accomplishing these goals gives players new powers and abilities, and spurs narrative adventure. \n \"Turn neatly subverts the tropes of the shapeshifter genre and offers insight into community and the meaning of difference. The rules are tight and lead straight to interesting and satisfying drama. We had so much fun playing Turn!\" - Jason Morningstar, Bully Pulpit Games\n\"If you grew up in a small town, and ever felt like a bit of a weirdo or an outsider there, you know this game already. It's brings both the love and the trouble that comes with that experience.\" - Kit La Touche, Transneptune Games\n\"Few games so beautifully synthesize the conflicting desires within each individual. Brie\u2019s game creates a world filled with the multifaceted character of small town life from its tenderness to the pressures that threaten to fragment it. Turn gives you the tools to dig deeply for the hidden moments of roleplaying that give it such beauty. Playing Turn left me longing for a community that had never been.\" - Vivian Paul, Riverbed Games\n\"Turn is both introspective and pushes hard on the relationships between characters. Everyone must juggle between their human and their beast sides, making the hard choice of which part of their identity to value over the other in any given moment. I loved the simplicity of the mechanics and the detailed world-building that ties everyone together. Definitely the game to play when you want to explore tough emotional dynamics between characters and within oneself.\" - Karen Twelves, Improv for Gamers\n\"There was so much to love about the game, but I was most impressed by how well it captured the slice-of-life feel that was part of the game pitch. [...] it was so super rewarding to still take it slow without worrying about finding a plot or piece of action. Even with characters we'd never played before and a group who hadn't played together before, we immediately found our groove with some good-natured bickering and mischief.\nNot only is there some really smart physical design to the character sheets, the marriage of these two identities [human and beast] within one character provides more depth and variation than any other system I've played where characters are made from a playbook-style sheet. [...] This layered personhood also speaks so strongly to my experiences as a queer and disabled person who has played and designed games for years, and I can't wait to dive deep into it.\"- Alex McConnaughey, Behind the Masc\n\"Rules-wise it's elegant. You weave the town, place the PCs in it, entangle them in a web of secrets, obligations, expectations, loves, trust and distrust that is very compelling. I love the apparent whimsiness of the beast halves. I live in a small town, and as a queer man, I'm very familiar with what it means to have different identities in different circumstances, to be careful about my exposure, to calculate who to trust and with how much of my life. So I love that the game gives you this big strange secret, and leaves you to navigate your life around it. \nCan you keep it all together? And if not, what can you let go? The people closest to you are going to help you? In the end, there is nothing more wonderful in life than finding someone with whom you can truly be yourself, wholly yourself. Turn is about the search for that holy grail. Isn't it a grand adventure?\"- Mario Bolzoni\n\"There's a harmony between the thematic and mechanic that I absolutely adore, particularly how it models the struggle between man and beast in a way that you feel in the dice. Even the character sheet(s) are designed with that friction in mind, putting your human and your animal identities at odds.\nOf particular note is the small town where the game is set. This town will be your home, your friend, your foe -- and the set dressing you figuratively and literally chew. As much a part of character creation as the characters themselves, the town is everything I love about leaving a mark on a setting before play even begins.\" - Jeremy Kostiew, con-cryptid\nThere are eight backer levels in Turn, so here is a brief description of each. For clarity:\nAll backer levels get access to Kickstarter updates and our dearest thanks!\nEvery level Raccoon and up includes the PDF of Turn plus PDFs for any stretch goals achieved.\nEvery level Raven and up includes a Print copy of Turn, a PDF copy of Turn, and PDFs of any stretch goals achieved.\nThe friendly Bear is our Thank You level, where backers get access to any updates. We truly appreciate any support for the game, and understand that many people have financial limitations. You\u2019ll get access to any bonus materials released with the Kickstarter, and that\u2019s the good stuff. \nThe tech-savvy Raccoon includes the PDF of the final game and PDFs for any stretch goals, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials.\nThe clever Raven includes the print and PDF versions of the final game and PDFs for any stretch goals, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials.\nThe community-focused Bison includes Print & PDF copies of the final game for the backer AND for a marginalized individual identified by the backer or Brie. It includes any stretch goals in PDF format, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials.\nThe territorial Cougar includes the Print & PDF versions of the final game and PDFs for any stretch goals, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials. It also includes a custom town map that Brie will collaborate with you to create, as well as a 300-word essay about the town to help guide play. They\u2019ll also create two custom NPCs for your town! A great way to get a kick-start on play.\nThe Wolf level is a pack... of print copies of the final game for retailers. It includes four copies!\nThe changing Snake includes the Print & PDF versions of the final game and PDFs of any stretch goals, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials. It also includes a custom Beast Archetype or Human Role designed by Brie. You define the Beast or type of Human, one appropriate to a rural small town, and Brie will create it with powers/abilities, stats, goals, and a description. These will be released to all backers as a PDF, as part of the Kickstarter, and made available publicly when Turn is released. \nThe playful Otter level includes the Print & PDF versions of the final game and PDFs of any stretch goals, plus any Kickstarter bonus materials. It also includes an up-to-4-hour Discord one-shot session of Turn run by either Brie Sheldon or John W. Sheldon for you and up to three friends, scheduled to accommodate all parties fairly.\nFUNDED! $12,000 - In Zion's Outstretched Stakes FUNDED!\nby Anders Smith\nAnders Smith\nAnders Smith (he/him) is a long-time RPG fan who believes that love is love is love. He was raised as a fifth-generation member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, serving in the China Hong Kong Mission from 2002 to 2004, before leaving the church over a conflict of conscience. His stretch goal for Turn will explore the distinct culture of small Mormon towns and their place in the world, and what it means to turn.\nWe're so excited to have Anders on the team to explore this type of community!\nFUNDED! $14,000 \u2013 Giro d'Italia FUNDED!\nby Ezio Melega and Lavinia Fantini\nEzio Melega\nEzio Melega (he/him) is a humanities college dropout. He collaborated with several authors, writing historical essays for Montsegur 1244 and Sagas of the Icelanders. He collaborated with the Italian editor Narrattiva as a consultant, revisor, translator, demonstrator and booth baby, helping in translating and localizing, among others, Apocalypse World, Bacchanal and Monsterhearts. He has a long held and cultivated interest for history and stories, international, national and local and would talk forever about his town history, folklore and people if you don't stop him. He can cook a mean carbonara.\nLavinia Fantini\nLavinia Fantini (they/she) is a tabletop rpg enthusiast. They worked with publishing house Narrattiva as a translator, copy editor and proofreader, contributing to the Italian editions of Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Shahida, and Emily Care Boss\u2019 Romance Trilogy. They also helped spread the love for many other games by holding demos, offering advice on Italian forums and giving a hand with convention organizing. When it comes to game design they\u2019re not much of an \u201cidea guy\u201d, preferring instead to aid others in understanding what the heart of their design is, bouncing ideas off and refining them. It's a less glamorous work, but someone has to do it! They\u2019re very excited about getting the chance to work on this project and help make the game more accessible to an Italian audience.\nEzio and Lavinia will be developing a collection of Italian small towns, along with updating and/or creating new archetypes and roles! These will explore how Italian towns and people work, and how they can cause shifters unique stressors and risks for exposure, while providing a window into what community means in Italy. Both of the above stretch goals will include essays on the cultural experiences.\nFUNDED! $16,000 \u2013 Smeed Hill FUNDED!\nBy Meguey Baker  \nMeguey Baker\nMeguey Baker (she/her) grew up in a town of 600 people, and after living in a city of 72,000 in high school, now lives in a smallish city of 18,000 in rural New England, where she writes games, raises kids, works in museums, and feeds birds. Meg co-designed the award-winning game Apocalypse World, as well as wrote the 8-game cycle Playing Nature's Year, which is full of animals being animals and people being people. \nSmeed Hill will explore a town cut in half by closing mills, then closing schools, and now empty storefronts on Main Street and overgrown houses in the hills. There are still opportunities, but also needs that have yet to be met. Meguey has proposed adding a squirrel and a skunk to the available beast archetypes, wonderful new additions to a small town! \nLike the other stretch goals, Smeed Hill will introduce some local NPCs to help your story along, a new town type, new beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role.\nFUNDED! $18,000 \u2013 Halver, Germany FUNDED!\nBy Gerrit Reininghaus \nGerrit Reininghaus\nGerrit Reininghaus (he/him)will invite us to his home town Halver, in rural West Germany. Halver has rain, lots of rain. Surrounded by the hilly forests of the Sauerland, with an aging population, it seems like a safe place to grow up and live. Well, at least if you are \"normal\" enough to fit into one of the 100 associations, from skiing, soccer, rabbit breeding or the fire brigade. Maybe it\u2019ll be good, too, if you don\u2019t belong to the kids sent to the lowest level of the highly segregated German school system since Germany is separating the \"good\" from the \"bad\" kids already at the age of 10. \nGerrit grew up in Halver. He has since lived all around the globe and is now living with his family in Guatemala. For all this traveling, he still considers the first twenty years of his life in a small West German town as formative. \nHalver will include NPCs, a new or altered town type, new or altered beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role. \n$20, 000 \u2013 Harmouth, South Devon\nby Jaye Foster\nJaye Foster\nJaye Foster (Him/He) is an exceedingly overeducated native of East Devon. He currently works as a research engineer in Hong Kong. His previous published works include Age of Legends and Poor Amongst the Stars. He enjoys writing sad things on index cards but is better at GMing adventure RPGs. Most of his creative writing can be found at the 6d6 RPG Blog. He would like you to know that the cream goes on the scone before the jam. \nHarmouth is a town of two thousand on the South Devon coast. It's once busy harbour is shelter to now only a few fishing boats. The town instead survives as a home for office workers who commute to the city. During the summer the town is almost overwhelmed by working class tourists on holiday to the long thin beach. The locals dislike that their town's economy is dependant on the uncouth and noisy northerners. To the south is the Atlantic Ocean and from it come rain-clouds and seagulls. Upriver is the city, an ever growing conurbation that is seeping downstream, consuming the farmland homes of the badgers. \nHarmouth will include NPCs, a new or altered town type, new or altered beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role.\nThank you so much for all of the support! Keep sharing and backing to help us reach all of these AMAZING stretch goals!\nBONUS: Reaching 400 backers met one of Brie's secret stretch goals - releasing the American Opossum! Brie will post the laid out character sheet for An Opossum soon.\nLeft to right: Brie Beau Sheldon, John W. Sheldon, & Tracy Barnett\nBrie Beau Sheldon (they/he) is a queer game designer, journalist, and editor and is a genderfluid nonbinary-masculine person. They are the creator of Script Change, Let Me Take a Selfie, and a number of other small products, and have worked on larger professional projects like Firefly Smuggler\u2019s Guide to the Rim and Bubblegumshoe. They have managed the Thoughty Blog for over 5 years to include game theory, interviews, and free games released through their Patreon. They have also created Leading with Class, a leadership show teaching through games. Their passions are asking questions, selfies, and exploring identity and community through games. Brie is the designer of Turn.\nJohn W. Sheldon (he/him) is a multi-disciplinary visual designer and game designer. He's worked on Kickstarter videos for Bully Pulpit, done logo design for Purple Aether Games, and created a gallery of Creative Commons illustrations through Patreon. He's also Brie's producer and videographer for Leading with Class, and a working design professional. John is doing layout, visual art, video production, and art direction for Turn, and he helped with early stages of editing.\nTracy Barnett (they/them) is a genderqueer game designer (School Daze, Iron Edda Accelerated) and podcast producer (TheOtherCast). By working with other publishers and producing their own content, they hope to make game design and podcasting their full-time work. They are the developmental editor and consultant for Turn.\nLeft to right: Rhis V. Harris, A.J. Odasso, and Alicia Foster-Scales\nRhis Harris (they/them), otherwise known as DeerintheMoon, is a 20-year old Studio  Arts major with a passion for art rooted in animal life and mythology.\n\u201cI've basically been creating art since the moment I could hold a  pencil, and that's never really changed. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I even referred to myself as an artist and believed it. I was always \"that kid who draws\" and I was proud of that, but I never had real  confidence in myself to even consider myself an actual artist with a capital \u2018A\u2019,\u201d says Harris.\nHarris transforms ordinary creatures to holy figures with use of celestial imagery and paints imaginary beasts with such precision that they appear ready to leap off the canvas. \u201cI use my art to understand how and why things in life do what they do, and why I feel or think the things I do. It\u2019s a way for me to analyze and explore things in a way that makes most sense to me,\u2019\u201d says Harris.\nHarris\u2019 work\u2014no matter the style\u2014is steeped in magical realism, grounded equally in geometry as it is in full-blown fantasy.\nA.J. Odasso (Poetry \u201916) (they/them) is the author of two poetry collections from UK-based Flipped Eye Publishing: Lost Books (2010), which was a finalist for the 2010 London New Poetry Award and for the 2011 People\u2019s Book Prize; and The Dishonesty of Dreams (2014), which had the honor of launching at the Grolier Poetry Book Store and Porter Square Books.  A.J.\u2019s third collection, an expanded version of their BU MFA thesis, was shortlisted for the 2017 Sexton Prize under the title Things Being What They Are and will be published in Summer 2019 under a new title, The Sting of It, by Tolsun Books.  A.J. continues to serve as Senior Poetry Editor at Strange Horizons magazine, where they have been part of the editorial staff since 2012.  A.J.\u2019s recent prose publications include a short story, \u201cWe Come Back Different\u201d (in the Winter 2018 & Spring 2018 issues of Pulp Literature) and a personal essay, \u201cBeing the Dictionary\u201d (in Knowing Why: Adult-Diagnosed Autistic People on Life and Autism, an anthology from the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network launched this October). A.J. is the poet for Turn. \nAlicia Foster-Scales (she/her), also known as The Writ Witch, is a passionate feminist and a PoC - for her, the acronym stands not only for \"person of color\", but also \"Pagan of color\", placing her solidly at multiple intersections of oft-misunderstood and societally-mistreated minorities. As a student of the Reclaiming tradition of witchcraft (a modern path specifically about the importance of fighting against social injustices upon the marginalized) and practitioner of hoodoo/rootwork (ancestral African-American folk magyck practices), Alicia's omnist and pantheist perspective on spirituality and life itself is grounded in the importance of Story and Myth in understanding not only who we are and who we've been, but also who we have the potential to be.\nAn avid writer, belly dance performer, doula, and activist for comprehensive sex education and reproductive rights, Alicia strives every day to embody the importance of being unapologetically yourself in a world so often built to sell us ways to fix what isn't broken. She is the essayist for the race essay and the sensitivity reader on race issues for the game.\nThank you to Brennan Taylor for helping us get set up for our Kickstarter!\n The money will go to pay for editing ($~1,200), visual art (~$1200), poetry (~$400), layout (~$1000), consulting fees (5%), Kickstarter fees (5%) and printing (minimum ~$10/book). It will also pay Brie for game design and testing (minimum $300 plus any overages), and includes a minimum 10% buffer for emergencies and unforeseen costs. Any stretch goals will include the funds to pay any contributors and for additional printing expenses, plus a small buffer.  \nBreakdown of costs as factored for the campaign goal\nWe also plan to get an ISBN for Turn, so it can eventually go into libraries!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween the members of the team, we have a number of successful projects that fulfilled in a timely manner under our belt. Brie recently fulfilled the Behind the Masc project on their own, and Tracy has significant Kickstarter experience. Our artists and poet are all skilled and experienced with good track records. \n\nThe game is complete, just pending final edits and layout. The visual art and poems are reliant on the Kickstarter\u2019s success, but we are confident they\u2019ll be completed on schedule. The schedule does have buffer to accommodate any crises. The budget also has buffer to account for any major issues.\nShipping and printing both have their own risks with timeliness that we\u2019re trying to address by choosing a good printer and by sticking to reliable, simple shipping and currently only pursuing US shipping. Brie is disabled, so there can be delays, but they\u2019ve ensured they have a team to support them in getting this work done and meeting the goals we set. \n\nOne thing to note is that Brie prioritizes the wellbeing of the team above all else, which means if there is a health crisis, the project will come second to the people. This is a caring-focused ethics model and we hope that anyone backing a project for a game like Turn will understand and respect that. We promise to put forth our best effort, but there can\u2019t be a best effort if the people aren\u2019t in a good state.

Volcanoes erupted, spewing fire and ash across the lands, and earthquakes ravaged the countryside. Entire regions were devastated, villages swallowed whole by the raging earth, forests and pastures incinerated by the volcanoes\u2019 fires, and civilizations propelled to the brink of collapse. Kings and queens struggled to uphold law and order in their realms as panic swept through the populace. Thousands fell victim to the Cataclysm\u2019s wrath, and the world drowned in chaos.\nNow, almost fifty years later, the world has regained a semblance of order \u2013 but it has become a different world. In the wake of the Cataclysm, maps were re-drawn as oppressed populations took advantage of the turmoil and declared their independence from their former overlords. Large swathes of land still lie barren, and the areas around the Cataclysm\u2019s epicenters are burned hellscapes ruled by grotesque creatures that crawled out from the underworld as the earth cracked. Outlaws and monsters roam the countryside and make travel a dangerous affair.\nIt is a world ripe with adventure \u2013 old ruins offer undiscovered treasures, and rulers eager to return law and order to their realms offer rich rewards to those who are willing to brave the dangers of the wilderness. And it is a world of opportunity for those who wish to leave their mark on it.\nThese are the central realms of Argea, and the forsaken badlands left behind by the Cataclysm's raging fury. In this world of squabbling kings and queens, whom will you offer your sword to?\nThe 3.5e System Reference Document (SRD), as covered by the Open Game License v1.0a (OGL) provided by Wizards of the Coast, Inc., allows us to forge a game with a classic character system based on the most popular pen-and-paper role-playing system of all times. It is a familiar and easy to learn system that provides many opportunities for character building, offering different races and classes, dozens of feats and skills, as well as over a hundred magic spells for the player to train his characters in.\nOur world is inhabited by many classic fantasy races, seven of which are playable characters in the game: the prolific humans, the sturdy dwarves, the graceful elves, the inventive gnomes, the savage half-orcs, the crafty halflings and the talented half-elves. Each race comes with its own distinct characteristics, ensuring that the choices you make during character creation matter throughout the game!\nAlong with the 7 different races, the player can choose from 8 different classes for their characters, each offering a unique set of abilities and a distinct gameplay style: \nClick for high-res version\n With plenty of feats and skills to invest in and several special actions performable in combat and outside of it, Realms Beyond opens many avenues for character development. Whether you are a powergamer who wants to optimize his characters or a roleplayer who wants to give his party a personal touch, you can create any type of character you want. In addition to the regular classes, high level characters will be able to pick a prestige class, giving them additional flavor and specializing their role in the party even more.\nRealms Beyond made one significant change to the established SRD 3.5e combat system. We decided to use a hexagonal grid instead of the traditional square grid. \nThis material is published under the OGL\nIf you would like to know more about our combat system, please read our past blog entries. Furthermore, some months ago, we released the video of an early version of the combat system here:\nRealms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen offers a large world for the player to explore. Cities, villages, camps, dungeons \u2013 many places both populated and abandoned await the intrepid adventurer. Our custom-built engine allows for enormous dungeon maps filled with enemy encounters, devious traps and tricky puzzles that require all of the party\u2019s abilities to overcome \u2013 and despite the large size of our maps, loading times are so fast you won\u2019t even notice them!\nDue to our fully interactive environments, almost all objects in the game world can be picked up or manipulated, and even have spells cast on them. Maybe you can open that gate by casting a telekinesis spell on the lever on the other side? Experimentation is key, and an inventive player will unearth many secrets in the depths of our dungeons.\nYou can interact with almost every item in the world\n\n\nIn towns and villages, you will meet hundreds of NPCs to talk to and do quests for. Our dialogue scripting system allows NPCs to respond to your character\u2019s race, class, and even appearance \u2013 and, of course, to your past deeds!\nClick for full-size version\n   Our design philosophy highly values the player\u2019s agency, and so the player is always free to choose whom to work for. The city guard or the criminal underworld? The loyalists or the rebels? The innocent townspeople or the sinister sorceress who wants to turn them into her slaves? Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen never forces the player into a set path. The choice is always yours!\nA part of the mini map of Vedwyd, a harbor town in northern Cormac.You can place your own markers on the map and annotate them!\nOur NPCs aren\u2019t just static quest dispensers, either. They have their own lives, setting off to work in the morning, having a beer at the tavern in the evening, and locking their doors to sleep safely at night. Different NPCs have different schedules, reflecting their personality and position in society. And not every NPC does the same things every day \u2013 most workers will stay at home during the night, and a tavern enthusiast may drink at a different venue every night. The alchemist goes out to gather new ingredients once a week. Our complex and diverse NPC schedules ensure that the world feels alive, and that every character has a purpose in the world.\nSome examples of the many characters that populate the world of Argea\nPlayers who want to go for a more unsavory type of adventuring party have plenty of opportunities to follow their urges, too. With a rogue in your party, you can pick the lock of any home or shop and rob the owner while he sleeps. You can sneak up on NPCs and pick their pockets. But a rogue\u2019s skills can not only be used against innocents: use your rogue to disarm traps in dungeons, sneak past enemies to get into an advantageous position, or even stealthily pour a vial of poison into the bandits\u2019 cooking pot to get rid of them without having to draw your swords.\nThe world of Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen is massive, spanning multiple kingdoms and empires across two continents, and it is completely open for exploration, with no artificial limits to rein the player in. Just like in games such as Fallout and Arcanum, the player\u2019s party can freely travel across the world map and discover new locations through exploration. But when it comes to exploration, not all areas are equal \u2013 your party moves much faster on roads than on open terrain, forests and mountains block your line of sight and hostile environments such as deserts and volcanic ashlands will be a drain on your resources.\nClick on image to open full-sized version\nA successful explorer is a prepared explorer. If your characters go without food and drink for too long, they will suffer from hunger and thirst. If your characters explore icy, snow-covered mountains or the hot, dry desert without proper equipment, the cold and the heat will drain their stamina and make them delirious. And after a long journey, your characters will grow tired and need to rest their feet: that\u2019s where our camping system comes in.\nAt any place in the wilderness, the player can set up camp to grant his characters some rest. But camp time can also be used to replenish supplies: the party\u2019s ranger can be sent out to hunt and supplement the rations, or he can gather herbs to brew potions from. Of course, a deep forest will yield better results than a barren desert \u2013 the environment you\u2019re in always matters, whether you\u2019re traveling or camping. And some of your characters should stand guard at night to avoid nasty surprises\u2026\nClick on image to open full-sized version\nJust as you can travel freely across the world map, so do other characters in our game world. Guard patrols and merchants travel along the major trade routes, peasants travel from their farms to the nearest town \u2013 but not all faces you meet on the road are friendly. There are no random encounters in Realms Beyond. Bandits, monsters, and even other adventurer parties travel across the map the same way the player does, and if you spot a dangerous enemy party in the distance, you can run away from them\u2026 or they can run away from you, if they deem you too strong to engage. This creates a dynamic world map experience where encounters make sense and don\u2019t just hit you out of the blue: trade routes and the immediate surroundings of major cities will be safe due to the presence of friendly guards, while enemy groups are especially numerous around bandit camps and monster lairs.\nOur world map is a persistent and dynamic place in many ways. If the player destroys a monster lair, or drives bandits out of a fortress, no more wandering enemy groups will spawn from these places. Some quests might even change the function a location has on the world map: an impoverished noble has tasked you to drive out the band of outlaws that has occupied his castle, and if you succeed at his quest, the area around the castle will be patrolled by troops loyal to this nobleman and merchants will now travel to the castle and sell their goods there. The player\u2019s actions will have noticeable and lasting consequences that shape the face of the world \u2013 the results of which can be seen directly on the world map.\nTo get from place to place more quickly, the player can buy horses and camels to ride on, and beasts of burden or a horse-drawn cart to carry additional loot. But the most valuable investment is a ship that allows the player to take the shorter and more direct sea routes from harbor city to harbor city! But the waters are not without danger, either \u2013 pirates roam the seas and sea-monsters lurk in the depths, and if such an enemy is encountered, the player will have to defend his ship in tactical turn-based naval battles. To gain an edge in these battles, the player can install cannons and ballistae on his ship to increase its firepower, or reinforce its hull with copper plating to make it more resistant to damage.\nOn our world map, every single tile can be explored \u2013 even the seas aren\u2019t off limits.\nAlong with the game, we will also release our editing tools (the UrWelt Engine) to the players so they can create their own worlds and campaigns. Modders will be able to use the very same level editor and dialogue editor that we are using to create the game, allowing them to forge new campaigns and even new worlds with the same level of complexity as our own.\nIt is also possible to import your own character models, objects, textures and sounds \u2013 so a dedicated team of modders could create a completely different game scenario. We want our modding tools to be as flexible as possible, comparable to the legendary toolsets of Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures and Neverwinter Nights. The core of the UrWelt framework is the level editor, which allows you to create your own maps \u2013 from small ones with 48x48 tiles (about 5,000 m\u00b2) to gigantic ones with 512x512 tiles (about 600,000 m\u00b2). The ground can be raised or lowered to create a flat or hilly landscape, and textured and decorated with decals. Buildings can be constructed from modular walls and objects can be placed freely on the map. To create an encounter, just place a group of enemies on the map and set them to hostile. You can also place sources of light with adjustable intensity and shadows, impressive visual effects, flocks of birds, shoals of fish, lively critters, and ambient sounds to spice up the atmosphere of your map. The editor is easy to get into, and extremely powerful once you master it.\nClick for full-size version\nWith our dialogue editor, you can write complex branching dialogues and create NPCs who react to everything the player is doing and saying. Want an NPC to laugh at the player for wearing a funny hat? You can script that. Want a dialogue option that only appears if the player has a score of 18 in charisma? You can script that. Want an NPC who refuses to talk to you unless you gift her a bouquet of flowers? You can script that.\nClick for full-size version\nWith our modding tools at your disposal, the only limit is your imagination. You can convert your long-running pen and paper campaign to the PC, or come up with something completely new. Share your works with other users through platforms such as Steam Workshop. If you ever wanted to create your own RPG campaign, Realms Beyond will give you the chance to turn your dreams into reality!\nSound FX\nIt\u2019s an obvious thing: Atmosphere is not only a visual thing, and it\u2019s not only created by gameplay. Atmosphere is what you get when you put all the components of a game together and everything fits. Often overlooked, but without a doubt, one of the key elements to create an engaging sense of atmosphere is the sound design. Imagine, if you will, an RPG without driving combat themes, or an epic main theme. It would feel like a movie with the TV muted. Distant, remote\u2026 But not only the music is of importance, sound effects and atmospheric sounds are every bit as important. It\u2019s all in the details.\n\nBut what are those sonic details? Let\u2019s pick one and discuss. If you look back at games like the original Realms of Arkania trilogy (German title: Das Schwarze Auge: Die Nordland-Trilogie) you\u2019ll find that a great deal of detail went into those games. Just take the inventory, for example. There\u2019s even special, unique sound effect playing when you put some new leather gloves on one of your characters. It is details like those, things that don\u2019t make a huge difference in the game as a whole, but add a little special attention to things that we want to achieve in Realms Beyond. \nNaturally, not every item in the game will have its own sound effect (with over a thousand items in the game, that would be an exorbitant number of sounds), but there will be a great many small sounds for several item classes. If you change from a dagger to a heavy sword, you\u2019ll hear the Shing! of steel. Putting on leather gloves will play a different sound than putting on brass gauntlets. \nMusic\nEspecially in computer games music can affect the mood in many different ways. And that\u2019s the reason why we care not only about adequate graphics but also about precisely-tailored music. To achieve this goal, we pay a lot of attention to the creation of the music for Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.\n\nFor example, to create a tense atmosphere during combat, we decided that we needed not only a few generic pieces, but also several matching themes. The driving force behind this decision was that we felt it was important to underscore different types of combat situations with different types of music. A small skirmish has a very different feel than an epic battle, and the music needs to appropriately reflect that. But it goes beyond that. Skeletons, for example, are very different from human knights. Not only do they look and move differently, they also require a different auditory set.\nExample: Undead Encounter \nExample: Battle versus Orcs\n  Outside of combat, the music in Realms Beyond is intended to evoke the mood of the location and the time of day. Every region in our world has its very own musical style, which can be heard in the variations of each locale's theme. From the resonant horns of the north to the playful flutes of Pyrrhenian shores, Argea's different realms not only look but also sound different.\nExample: A human town in the evening hours\nExample: A haunted dungeon deep below the surface\nExample: Ruins in the forest\n\n (Music by Bastian Kieslinger)\nWhile the engine and systems are mostly finished and implemented by now, we still need to fill the game with more content. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to hire additional writers and level designers, produce more assets and animations, and create a memorable world that will be a joy to explore.\nThe majority of the funds will be allocated to writing and level design, the core elements of a good RPG. All of our content will be hand-crafted and the player will be presented with non-linear quests and dungeons that require a lot of work to design, implement, and playtest.\n\nTo support the narrative nature of our game, we also want to create more NPC animations for dialogues and events.\n\nBeside content and visuals, the funds will be used for additional sound effects to enrich the immersive atmosphere of our world. To attain the best quality, we will be working with the fantastic people over at Only Sound. \n\nAnd finally, we would love to hire the amazing composer Edwin Pickett to create additional combat and background themes for the game. Here, you can listen to some of his previous works:\nPhysical Rewards\nThe mass production of goods is definitely not our business and we don't want to spend money and time on frivolous consumer rewards. Promotional items such as miniatures, t-shirts, hoodies, USB sticks, etc. often come cheaply produced and are of questionable quality. Since we personally don't like that stuff, it would be wrong to offer it to our backers.\nTherefore we will completely focus our efforts on the production of the game box and its contents. Here, we want to deliver the Ultimate Goldbox standard: Solid cardboard packaging, a coin made of bronze, a map applied on high-quality cotton paper, and a printed manual and spell book. Beside this game box, there will be only one other physical reward: A handmade amulet that refers to a significant item from our game world.\nMore than two years ago, we established Ceres Games for the sole purpose of developing a complex party-based RPG that would resurrect those qualities found in the classics of the 80s and 90s. Led by industry veterans Peter Ohlmann and Timothy Drude, among whose numerous titles include The Settlers II, Knights and Merchants, and the SpellForce series, we found other RPG enthusiasts to join our project early on.\nCeres Games is fully independent and not affilitated with any publisher or investor. A successful crowdfunding campaign will allow us to stay on this path.\nOur team is currently comprised of international developers who love the computer role-playing games of the past. This passion is the guiding force behind Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur lead team members have been successfully developing and releasing video games for more than 20 years, and we have no intention of stopping now. Of course, every production can hit rough water, and it would be naive and unprofessional of us to deny this.\n\nWe have achieved quite a bit in the last two years: The rendering engine, the game systems, and all the required content tools are working. Most of the art assets have been created and implemented. We already have more than 800 items and 2,100 environment objects in the game, but we want to include much more.\n\nOur intention is to include robust content that will greatly satisfy each of our backers. However, the production of a computer game is always challenging, and there can be circumstances that may affect the development process. One challenge could be the number features and amount of content we have planned. Some of these features might be modified or delayed.\n\nWhen talking about game development in general, another production challenge is the release date. We want to release the game in early 2020, but there are always unforeseen factors that can delay the planned release date of any game. This is especially true of role-playing games with massive amounts of content and many gameplay features.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Traveller", "descp": "Thank you for your pledge!\nWe here at Ceres Games are truly grateful and will honor your early support with a special forum badge, an invitation to our Discord and a mention in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nSpecial forum badge and Discord role (Traveller)\nYour name in the credits (Supporter)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "The basic digital edition of Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.

Then we implemented an enemy spell AI for intelligent placing of area spells (trying to maximize hits on enemies and minimize hits on allies). Finally we included rather specific routines (like fleeing) for characters that suffered from spells like fear.

In Nahual you  play as shapeshifting nahuales that hunt angels to make a living. You  run a changarro\u2014a business\u2014together and sell the angels you hunt as different types of products. Caught in the middle of an ancient feud, you struggle to find your place in a world of fantastical and overwhelming forces. \nNahual builds upon the Powered by the Apocalypse system used in Apocalypse World, Urban Shadows, Dungeon World and more. When your character\u2019s actions trigger a move, the move tells you what happens in the fiction or you roll two six-sided dice to find out. Moves are designed to push the fiction forward, building tension and taking the story in unknown and exciting directions.\nNahual is set in the universe created by Mexican comic book artist Edgar Cl\u00e9ment, first presented in the graphic novel Operaci\u00f3n Bolivar\u2014which you can find here in Spanish\u2014and expanded in titles like Kerubim, Los Perros Salvajes (I & II) and other short stories. Nahual is yet another addition to that ever-growing universe, using elements from the comics and creating new ideas that add to this amazing setting. \n\"When our Spanish ancestors first arrived to this continent they were not alone, with them came their gods and their armies of angels. For our indigenous ancestors, these angels were not the incense vendors of the present day; they were emissaries of destruction. Between the sword of Cort\u00e9s and the sword of St. Michael, the Archangel, there was no difference, and neither made a clean cut to the roots. The brujos resisted. Nahuales, the most powerful shamans, took on the task of fighting the invading angels.\"\n\u2014Edgar Cl\u00e9ment. Operaci\u00f3n Bolivar.\nIn Nahual, players are angel hunters, descended from the powerful brujos nahuales. They have special gifts that enable them to contend with gods and angels, but their cultural memory has been taken from them\u2014they no longer possess the shamanic traditions to unleash these wonders to their full potential. Many struggle for survival, others look for answers, but all agree on one thing: a nahual lives to hunt down angels.\nThe game setting is a Mexico filled with fantasy and sci-fi elements, mixed with a maelstrom of violence, inequality, corruption, folklore and fiesta. In this mess, angels prowl the cities, looking for souls to feed upon. Restless humans pray to God and his angels; where there are people hungry for hope and faith, angels thrive.\nAnd yet...there are angeleros\u2014angel hunters. They have the power to fight back, to get rid of the celestial parasites, to free the people. But these are not times for idealism. What is it to be gained by revolution? It is kill or be killed in the concrete jungle. All you can do is look out for yourself and your closest allies, to try to make a living in the face of poverty, decay, and death. And so they hunt.\nOf course, everyone wants a piece of heaven, a fragment of the magical flesh of celestial beings. The drug dealers are interested in the \"angel dust\" made by grinding their bones into an addictive and potent drug. The Church uses the angels as circus animals to lure in worshipers. The corporations are finally beginning to realize the business potential of these creatures, for experimentation and synthetic replication. The politicians\u2026 well, they like to get their hands in everything, as long as there is a profit to be made. Con dinero baila el perro.\nThe nahuales are caught in the middle of all this. They are the drivers of the angel trade. The laborers. And the cheaper the labor the better the profits. The only thing they can do is fill their role and struggle to survive these shark-infested waters in which everyone wants a bite. Freedom? Revolution? There is no time for such nonsense, is there? \nNahual is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-5 players that takes about 3-4 hours to play. The game is Powered by the Apocalypse, revolving around moves and their triggers. As you play and follow the fiction of the story, you look for when your character\u2019s actions hit the trigger of a move\u2014like when you assail someone, sneak around, or make a fuss. Sometimes these moves ask you to roll two six-sided dice (2d6) and add the corresponding stat:\nIf your result is 10 or more, that means it\u2019s a full hit. You succeed at what you were trying to do, no strings attached\u2014most of the time at least.\nIf you get a result between 7 and 9, it's a partial hit. You succeed at what you intended to do but with a cost, complication or ugly choice. \nIf you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s a miss. A miss doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you failed at what you were doing, but instead the game master (the Marakame) says what happens. And yeah, you probably won\u2019t like it. \nIn Nahual, each angel hunter character has their own playbook\u2014a sort of character sheet and template that contains all the necessary rules for creating and playing your character. Each playbook is defined by a different totem animal, a manifestation of the character\u2019s inner nahual power and a metaphor for the character\u2019s personality.\nThere are 5 playbooks in the base game of Nahual, but we might be able to add more through stretch goals. The basic set includes:\nThe angel hunters are known as angeleros. In present day, the people that inherited the gift to see and touch the angels don\u2019t know what to do of it. Some don\u2019t even have an awakened nahual. All the shamanic traditions and philosophies they need were brutally snatched away by the angels and their allies centuries ago. \nNow all the angeleros can think of is survival. And what they see in their old enemies, the angels, is a rare commodity that fetches a decent price. So they hunt them, butcher them, and sell them to the highest bidder. It's ugly, brutal, dangerous work, but most angeleros are in the business because they know nothing else. It\u2019s a trade passed through family or friendship, the kind of work that keeps you alive while it kills you by the day. \nThis trade has three main pillars: La Cacer\u00eda, the hunting and killing of the angels; La Tablajer\u00eda, the skinning and butchering of the angel; and El Expendio, the retail sales, which varies considerably depending on the type of the changarro you run.\nIn Nahual, player characters work together through a business they own\u2014an establishment known as El Changarro, the place where they sell the angels they hunt, in different ways, depending on the type of business:\n Taquer\u00eda: Your changarro operates as a taco joint; you mainly sell angel meat cooked and served as tacos.\n Carnicer\u00eda: Your changarro operates as a butcher shop; you mainly sell the angel meat raw for others to cook.\n Cantina: Your changarro is a traditional Mexican bar where you mainly sell ch\u00ednguere\u2014a spirit drink distilled from angel blood\u2014and maybe also polvo de \u00e1ngel, a drug made of ground angel bones.\nChangarros are usually simple and humble establishments, a taco joint or a local cantina. Most of the clientele are ordinary people looking for food and drink with invigorating properties. For those who live in the harsh conditions of the barrios, eating angel meat and drinking angel blood is a blessing that keeps them afloat, to fight another day. \nWe all have our nahual: it is the innermost part of the unconscious mind, the wildest part in each of us. But your nahual is also part of something bigger, something infinite. The Nahual is the energy that permeates and connects the Cosmos. It is everything that surpasses our comprehension.\nTrying to fully understand and control the power of the Nahual is practically impossible. To ease this endeavor, you must use a totemic animal that serves as an anchor to channel and shape the energy of the Nahual. Your animal is a learning tool that allows you to condense and focus that power which otherwise would consume you. Think of it as a dam holding back a torrent of energy that lets you access that flood little by little, depending on how confidently you can open the gates.\nTo be able to use the power of the Nahual, you first need to transform into your totemic animal. There are six different levels of transformation, known as the Stages of Nahuality.\n Novato: at this stage the change is barely visible, but you\u2019re able to do things like see perfectly in the dark, climb with uncanny skill, or expand your olfactory sense or hearing.\n Aprendiz: your body starts to show some change; your back is hunched over and you move more like an animal. You can now take on a group of soldiers on your own, make an impossible jump, or make yourself invisible to normal eyes.\n Brujo: you are now in a hybrid stage, with prominent animal features showing. Your power level lets you take on a small army, leap a tall building in a single bound, or phase through a solid wall.\n Nahual: you are now a fully transformed animal. You can rip a car apart with your bare paws, cover a few miles of distance with a single jump, or take on an elite angel or powerful demon.\n Kibal: you can now transform into multiple animals or even mix different ones into a chimeric form. You are now the stuff of legends and can face powerful archangels or ignore the laws of physics.\n Postome: you\u2019re beyond mortal comprehension. You have now acquired godlike power. Upon reaching this stage, you retire your character.\nNahual shines in  long-term play, as players engage in the day-to-day hardships of their changarro: managing the business, hunting for angels to restock their shelves, and dealing with competitors or other factions that try to get the best of the pack. In addition to that, each character\u2019s advancement is centered around the power of their nahual and their transformation, expanding and growing over time.\nKilling angels and dabbling with the Nahual is ugly business. It takes its toll, represented in play as traumas. At the beginning of play, characters choose one trauma; as the game progresses and they make use of the power of the Nahual, their humanity will erode, and they will take more and more traumas.\nTraumas are presented as triggers that give XP to the character if they take certain dangerous and self-destructive actions. Therefore, as characters accumulate XP, they\u2019ll be able to advance their control of the stages of transformation, which in turn may result in more traumas unlocked. This system traps characters in a dangerous spiral: as their power grows, their very humanity is eroded.\nThe Nahual Corebook will be a 6\u201d x 9\u201d book (approx. 200+ pages), with black and white interiors, featuring the amazing art of Edgar Clement, and a full color cover. The book will come in both soft- and hardcover editions.\nThe game will be available both in ENGLISH and SPANISH. From the get-go I have been working on Nahual in both languages. At first writing in Spanish, then translating to English, but later I sometimes did it the other way around. In the end, it has been a very organic process in relation to language. For some of the things I\u2019ve written directly in English, Ileana will help me translate into Spanish, and sometimes Mark will proof my English when I translate things from Spanish to English.\nAt the end of the campaign, if we are funded, you\u2019ll be able to pick which edition you want through your Backerkit survey. If you want both, you can choose one language on the survey and then ask for the other language as an add-on. \nNahual is a Mexican project and will be developed both in ENGLISH and SPANISH: if funded, you will be able to choose your version through your Backerkit survey.\nWe will be shipping Nahual anywhere in the world! Thanks to our international fulfillment partners, backers in the EU, CA, and AU won't pay any customs or VAT on any of their shipments.\nThe costs for shipping each tier are included in the pledge levels. When you select your pledge, Kickstarter will tell you how much additional funding you'll need to add based on your location.\nInterview with Richard Rogers on +1 FORWARD, a podcast Powered by the Apocalypse.

If you want to know more about the Gauntlet community visit www.gauntlet-rpg.com \nAdam Koebel (@SkinnyGhost) getting excited about Nahual in Office Hours, Episode 58: \"The idea of a game set in modern Mexico, with fantasy, sci-fi, angel hunting, and brujos... it gets me in a place where I'm excited to see more.\" Check here the video:\n\"Nahual is the most exciting take on the Apocalypse Engine in a while. It\u2019s intense, evocative, and efficient: every move in the game needs to be there. The characters feel vivid and unique; I couldn\u2019t have made my Nahual character in any other game system. Its setting and mythology are darts aimed at colonialism\u2019s heart. Playing Nahual made me feel proud to be Hispanic, and both excited and terrified to tear some angels apart.\"\n\u2014James Mendez Hodes\n\"This game is not only well-designed and compelling but incredibly necessary, and I cannot recommend it more highly. I had an opportunity to playtest Nahual at Metatopia 2017. Miguel's multiple, interlocking PbtA economies immediately immersed me and my fellow players in the  world of the nahuales, and as we played it revealed its brilliant and subversive anti-colonial themes.\"\n\u2014Eric Mersmann (@presenteric)\n\"Miguel\u2019s many talents collide to bring us this beautiful game of passion, violence, and fun! Nahual is a rare opportunity for players to put on their own mask and step into the world of Edgar Clement, to protect their community from the invasion of soul-eating angels, and feast on the spoils. Moreover, I am excited to run a game that is so accessible to my English and Spanish speaking friends alike!\"\n\u2014Marissa Kelly\n\"Miguel\u2019s game is a heady mixture of mysticism, mystery, blood, history, violence, and community that fully presents the meat and heart of Edgar\u2019s amazing graphic novels and lets you shape them as your own. It\u2019s been a pleasure having late night discussions about it with Mike and an even greater one to play the game with him at Metatopia last year. Nahual isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve tried before; drink deeply, but, be warned, it will change you.\"\n\u2014Kevin Petker, creator of The Ward \n\"Nahual  is an exciting action RPG that mixes monster hunting with the aftermath  of colonialism in fascinating ways. At first, the idea of a game about  hunting and killing angels for a living had me a bit worried, but when I  found out those angels are the remnants of the oppressive Spanish  conquistadores, the whole game went next level. That, combined with a  living and breathing barrio where those angels\u2019 body parts are part of a  black market economy; along with mechanics for keeping your pack  together; and the choice of animal playbooks and powers\u2014it\u2019s a  rollicking good time where your angelerros are characters you care  about, not just when you tear an angel apart, but when they deal with  their pack, their changarro, and their barrio.\"\n\u2014Richard Rogers\n\"One  of the most fun and interesting concept games I have ever played! It  was completely transportive. From the moment we built the characters I  was hooked! Can't wait to play that game again.\"\n\u2014Tara Newman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter, we have the experience from working with important companies in the industry, like Magpie Games, John Wick Presents, Nocturnal Media, among others.

We\u2019ve been getting feedback from great designers, and that\u2019s given us a good grasp on how to do game design and a clear path ahead of us.

Text reads \"Stretch Goals\"\nWE ARE FULLY FUNDED!!!!!\nNow comes the fun part! I've got some great ideas for Stretch Goals to share with you all, extra things that we can fund that will make Thirteen Demon Princes the most fun it could possibly be.\n$2300 - Snazzy Layout - UNLOCKED\nOur first Stretch Goal is to get some sweet layout for the book. I do all my games' layout in a free online software that is good enough for the Quickstart Promo Edition that backers should find in their inbox, but I'd love to get this in the hands of someone who has real graphic design chops & the resources to use them. Enter VJ Brown.\nVJ is the host of the Hedged In actual play podcast, a close friend, and someone whose layout work has been featured in games like Empty Orchestra and the upcoming Descent into Midnight. She's got a great eye for RPG book design and I can't wait to bring her into the project. We'll unlock this Stretch Goal at $2,300.\n$2600 - Extra Art - UNLOCKED\nThe art we've used for the Quickstart is all sourced from Unsplash, a Creative Commons photography community. The photos we're including in the game are striking & beautiful but we know that there are some things hellish and foul that can't be captured by the camera lens. If we can hit $2600 we'll include interior art from one of my favorite RPG visual artists, Aaron King.\nAaron runs shared campaign worlds in the Twin Cities and has products up on the DM's Guild. His visual style is a striking array of collages that are equal parts Hieronymus Bosch and 19th century science textbook. He's got a phenomenal eye for the alien and the human alike and I can't wait to get his art in Thirteen Demon Princes.\n$2900 - Next Level Editing - UNLOCKED\nI had planned on running Thirteen Demon Princes through basic editing, but had thought that professional editing was going to be a luxury I could not afford on my first project. Now that we're knocking on Stretch Goal's doors, however, I have an opportunity to move this goal to reality. If we hit $2900, I'll be able to hire a professional RPG editor, and good friend of mine, Jessa Michalek! \nJessa works as a convention helper and RPG editor for projects like CONvergence and Flames Rising Press. Her RPG credits include anthologies like Rites of Renown and The Poison Tree, and adventures like There Was A Dark, Dark House. She has experience with broody monsters and knows my loving takes on demons from our local game group. I can't wait until we can bring her into the #13DP fold!\n$3300 - Show Soundtrack - UNLOCKED\nFolks, this is it, the big one. This is my creme de la creme, ultimate wish list Stretch Goal. If we hit $3300 before the campaign ends I will be able to commission a soundtrack for Thirteen Demon Princes from two of my favorite RPG musicians in the game right now: Corv Leary and Aaron Catano-Saez!!! (UN)HOLY HECK I'm so excited for this. If we hit this level I will work with these artists to produce a digital album for Thirteen Demon Princes available for everyone who backed for the full rules, digital or physical. This music will be loopable and themed for each segment of the game, meaning you can have it on in the background while you play, to help set the mood for each scene!\nCorv Leary is one of our guest authors (having written There Is No Way Out Of This Arena, which may be one of my favorite RPGs ever), but they're also a talented composer. They composed all of the music for their podcast, Blue Dawn, and take music commissions for other projects as well! I have them currently working on a new theme for my Queer/LGBT+ tabletop podcast, Game Closet, and you can listen to their other work on their Bandcamp. Their tunes range from peppy to brooding, electric to crunchy, and I can't wait to bring them on board.\nAaron Catano-Saez is one of the hosts on my actual favorite podcast, All My Fantasy Children. Every week, Aaron and Jeff Stormer (who just launched a spectacular Kickstarter of his own that you should check out) take listener prompts and form them lovingly into fully fleshed out characters. Aaron does all the music for that show, creating emotional connections that drive the characters into your heart. Aaron also composed music for certain characters in From The Jackals To The Shepherds, a The Quiet Year podcast I produced last year. Aaron is a bombastic creator, with an ambitious drive to constantly be making the best while ensuring that there's always a human connection. \nI am extremely excited to unlock this last Stretch Goal, it would be the icing on the cake (did I mention that this campaign ends on my birthday?) and be the ultimate close to the project. Please tell your friends about this Kickstarter and spread the word across your networks so that we can take this final push and finish strong!\nan image of harsh flames, caption reads \"What is this game?\"\nThirteen Demon Princes is a larp, a Live Action Role Play, that is set on the stage of Hell\u2019s most popular dating show, Thirteen Demon Princes. The game is based on Singularity, the transhuman dating show larp by Josh Jordan and Aura Belle. Every time you play this game, you\u2019ll be acting out an episode of the show. One person will play your Host who guides everyone through the game, stirring up drama. One person will play the Morning Star, the object of our affections and the one who gets to choose who wins or looses. Everyone else will play Contestants, various Demonic Royalty who are competing for the Morning Star's love.\nThirteen Demon Princes is a dating sim game, a genre that simulates dates or romantic outings between two or more people. The focus on the game is matching people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs with others to see how they match up. The most interesting play in this genre is seeing how our characters are alike, how they\u2019re different, what and who they care about, and ultimately, how they fall in love. We will use the pre-generated characters, who all represent something demonic, to poke into our expectations of \u201cnormal\u201d love and attraction and put these questions to the test in a melodramatic way.\nDating shows are a special type of dating sim. On a dating show, the Host serves as a mediator for these stories, your Virgil through Hell if you will. The Host guides our characters through an episode of Thirteen Demon Princes, giving everyone an opportunity to get to know one another before putting them to the test and finding out who falls in love. Thirteen Demon Princes borrows structure from Singularity with permission from its authors in order to provide the most entertaining dating game experience!\nThe characters you will be playing all are fantastic, over the top, sexy pieces of hellish delight. Even though they\u2019re vastly different from one another, they all have needs that must be met, desires that must be acted upon, and feelings that cannot be ignored. Think of Hell less in the traditional sense of a place to send people who do evil deeds. Hell, and the host of demons who reside within, is a reflection of our values, and interrogating things we paint as \u201cevil\u201d can be valuable to us as an audience to our own culture. Thirteen Demon Princes is about the Fall, and is an exercise in identifying the humanity within the demonic, and vice versa. \nBut what are the mechanics this game uses? Well, there aren't really that many. Aside from the dating show script skeleton that the Host uses to help facilitate the pacing of the game, most play is freeform. Players act out their characters' actions and dialogue and The Host asks leading questions to stir the pot. Each unique Demon Prince also has a resource mechanic called Demonic Blood that they can give out to other players when they want to reward specific behavior. As you play through the script skeleton, you will be creating the beginning, middle, and final conclusion of an episode of Thirteen Demonic Princes!\nan image of wilted roses, caption reads \"What's in it?\"\nIn Thirteen Demon Princes is a core rulebook that contains all of the play information and advice you will need to run the game. It contains an outline of play, a \"script\" to follow to keep your episode on track, and even additional rules for turning your game into a season long affair! \nIt also comes with the eponymous Thirteen Demon Princes, a sordid company of demons of various genders, forms, and dispositions. Each Demon Prince comes with a Character Kit so you know who they are and exactly the best way to play them.\nThat's it! The game is pretty low-overhead. Aside from the stunning character art and writing, the game is pretty much written. This crowdfunding campaign exists to get funds to pull more people into this project and help make this project as cool as possible.\nEach Demon Prince is written by a guest author. Our stunning cast of suitors is as follows:\nThe Demon Of Light And Darkness, Who Watches Over Searing Brightness And Impenetrable Shadows - by Frankie Garza\nThe Demon Of Lies And Deceit, Whose Illusions Tapestry The Whole of Creation - by Aser Tolentino\nThe Demon Of Bargains And Deals, Who Always Brokers Equal Exchanges In Both The Physical World And In Our Souls - by Tobie Abad\nThe Demon Of Knowledge, Whose Hoarded Libraries Span The Existence Of All Thought - by Aura Belle (One of the authors from our parent game, Singularity!)\nThe Demon Of Upheaval, Whose Destruction Levels Cities And Unmakes Kings  - by Corv Leary\nThe Demon Of Nature\u2019s Unbridled Power, Whose Storms Sink Continents And Who Lives Inside A Single Acorn - by Nora Blake\nThe Demon Of The Exchange And Portioning Out Of Power, Who Delights In Both Controlling And Being Controlled - by Rob Abrazado\nThe Demon Of Pestilence, Who Gathers Illnesses, Parasites, And Plagues Like Fine Pieces Of Art - by Megan Tolentino\nThe Demon Of Excess, Who Delights In Decadent Indulgences And Who Abhors Guilt Of All Forms - by Melody Watson\nThe Demon Of Dreams, Whose Nightmares Rock The Mountains And Whose Visions Put The Mistiest Rainforests To Shame - by Shannon Dapper\nIn addition to being lovingly crafted by each guest author, each Demon Prince will be adorably illustrated by Meghan Dornbrock!\nan image of a bone antler on a black background with a red scarf draped over it. Caption reads \"How do I back it?\"\nThere are four main tiers to back Thirteen Demon Princes. \nThe first tier is our QUICKSTART rules. This will give you the basic text so you can start playing as soon as you back the game. It also comes with four set Demon Princes (minus character art) that have been written already by yours truly. This is a great backer level if you want to check out the game and see what's up, or if you might not play often but still want to help out.\nThe second tier is our DIGITAL RULES. This gets you the full PDF and EPUB document of the rules and will come with all Thirteen Demon Princes. This will give you an electronic copy of the entire game. This tier will also give you the QUICKSTART rules so you can start playing now while we produce the finished product.\nThe third tier is our PHYSICAL RULES. This is a nice softcover book that you can put on your shelf, carry with you to your game, or wrap up as a gift to a friend. It has the entirety of the rules in the same way that the DIGITAL RULES do, the Thirteen Demon Princes, and the QUICKSTART RULES. The softcover will be produced through DrivethruRPG's Print-On-Demand service. Once the book is ready you will receive a coupon to get the book at no charge, so all you will need to pay for after this is the shipping costs.\nEDIT: There are now two extra backing levels thanks to Josh Jordan of Ginger Goat Press! Backers who want a PDF copy of Singularity in addition to their Thirteen Demon Princes can now add on to both the DIGITAL RULES and PHYSICAL RULES for an additional price! You can get the original Dating Sim RPG, our parent game and inspiration, in addition to Hell's Favorite Dating Show!\nWe have other tiers as well, including backing as a retailer or producing a full page ad as a commercial for the show. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarted project! I've been designing games at RiverhouseGames.com since 2015 and producing and selling these games at an amateur level since then. However, this will be my first \"large\" scale project.\n\nThe core of this game is already written. All that is left to create are the Character Kit writing and the character art.\n\nI will be using these funds to secure art and character writing from various folks. There is an inherent risk involved in this as I have no sway over the lives of my artists or writers. While we all respect deadlines, life is inevitable. I will keep you appraised of any delays involved in the production of this game. \n\nIf the delay is with a writer, I will do my best to work with them within the confines of this project. If it looks like we will not make our release schedule, I will take on writing that Character Kit (the writer will still be paid, I'm not trying to swindle free work out of folks) in order to meet deadlines. \n\nIf the delay is with an artist, it will be a larger challenge as I do not have any visual art skills to bridge the gap. It will be important to set expectations early and make them clear up front. Hopefully this will not be an issue.\n\nPrinting will be taken care of through DriveThruRPG's Print-On-Demand service. Part of the project timeline will be ensuring that the book prints perfectly so that when you get your at-cost copy coupon you can just hit Go, pay shipping, and everything else is taken care of.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "I Helped!", "descp": "Sign up to add your support to the project and receive project updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Quickstart Thank You", "descp": "Get in & out of Hell with the quickstart rules to Thirteen Demon Princes.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing.

Simon St\u00e5lenhag is best known for his highly imaginative images and stories portraying illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes (expanded into America in his latest book The Electric State). Tales from the Loop was ranked by The Guardian as one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias,\u201d in the company of works such as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nNot only have St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s unique and cinematic images earned him a worldwide fan base, but have also made him a go-to storyteller, concept artist and illustrator for both the film and computer gaming industry. This year it was announced that The Electric State will be turned into a major motion picture and Amazon Prime ordered a full season of a TV show based on Tales from the Loop.\nDuring his twelve years as a game writer, Nils Hintze has written a great number of scenarios, articles and reviews, as well as being the main author of critically praised and award winning Tales from the Loop roleplaying game. Previously he has written plays for theatre groups.\nNils is known for his ability to create scenarios which allow the players to explore their characters and their relationships while facing dangers and solving mysteries. The conflicts in his games are often built on personal dilemmas, where thrill and mystery is not seldom mixed with humor.\nNils is educated in creative writing, but he normally works as a psychologist. Nils is also one of the three creators of the Swedish role-playing podcast Podcon.\nFree League Publishing is the international name of Swedish game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB.

After successful campaigns for The Bird Told Me To Do It (Carl Chudyk game) and Impulse 2nd edition with two expansions we decided to give you something a bit different this time. Not so much brain-burning like previous titles - just light, awesome card game: \"Gremlins, Inc.\"\nLast year, quite accidentally, we had the opportunity to play \"Gremlins, Inc.\" board game on PC. It was an electronic version of a board game setin the world of steampunk, which unexpectedly won over our hearts. We contacted the Charlie Oscar team - the publisher of the computer game and talked about the possibility of transferring it to the table. It turned out that they had prepared a card game, based on similar rules as the board game and setin the same world. The computer version available on the Steam platform was bought by almost 200.000 players, which only confirms its amazing theme. The card game has never been released for sale, which is why we became more interested in this title. After about a dozen of plays, we already knew that we wanted to publish it.\nWe obtained a license from them for several language versions. Less than two months ago we published the Polish edition of \"Gremlins, Inc.\", which Polish players immediately loved. That's why we decided to go out into the world and we've prepared an English edition that we would like to publish with your help. We have showed the game at many conventions and among reviewers worldwide, and the feedback we've got only confirms, what we already knew: Gremlins are a exceptionally fun. And we believe that You will enjoy them as well!\n\"Gremlins, Inc.\" is a card game with a big dose of negative interaction, in which players become mean gremlins and try to dog lives of their opponents and by the by pursue their projects. One of the main themes of the game is money: if gremlins had mothers, they would sell them in the blink of an eye. Gremlin would cut out last rainforrests if only it brought profits: for them birds and trees cannot equate to a glitter of coins stored in a private treasury. The second theme is corruption in institutions: courts should serve rich in exploitation of poor while factories herd workers voting happily for those who they were told to vote for\n(a least as long as salary is paid). Ironically, a straightforward devil seems to be more honest than a marketing specialist who buys and sells votes those who pay more. So what is left? Love! Pure love given by Gremlins only to their mechanisms \u2013 even stronger than love of money. Money is just means, corruption is a tool and both are aimed at reaching a superior goal: possessing the biggest, the most impressive mechanism in a mechanical city. The prestige of such a holder is incomparable to any other gremlin\u2019s joy. Me, me, me \u2013 a gremlin who possesses some goods smiles happily. Mine, mine, mine \u2013 murmurs a gremlin who observes the city from an Astral Lift. Some people may appreciate the world they have recreated in their heads, but gremlins love only themselves and the prestige they won thanks to cleverness and severity.\n\"Gremlins, Inc.\" is a game about strategy and nastiness set in a mechanical world of immortal and immoral villains. The project has been developed and implemented by people who come from different regions where the election is falsified by corrupted courts; where fat bankers generate profits while starving employers vote for populists; where people earn when they spend; where bribes play a crucial role in economy of a country and where the beginning and the end of governors\u2019 career as often as not take place in prison. Although the whole game is a fiction, everything inside it stems from truly real stories. If you look around thoroughly, corrupted capitalistic gremlins are almost everywhere...Damn! One of them may even become a president!\nThis card game offers mechanics and rules on cards, which will take you into gremlins\u2019 world making you one of those nasty and vicious pointy-eared creatures. But it\u2019s not all! Due to wonderful and atmospheric ilustrations presented on cards you will forget about everything happening around you and the place where you start playing the game will change into a world full of steam puffing machines, glittering gold, precious stones, maze of pipes and heard from far and near ironical \u2018Hahahiiihiihihahaa..\u2019. It\u2019s not just a game, but a passage into the space where at last you may show your nasty face.\nEach player has a hand size of 6 cards from a draw pile.  Each card has one of three resource types: Gold, industry or malice. Cards are divided into 2 main categories: action and project cards. \nA player, during his turn, may perform up to 2 actions: \n1. Starting a project: A player takes a project card and places it face down in front of him. Up to 3 projects may be started by each player. \n2. Assign a resource: A player may take a card from hand and places it face up under a project, leaving only the resource indicator at the top visible. \n3. Play an action: A player places a card from her hand on the table face up, paying its resource cost from projects being constructed (unless it is free,) following the text on the card before discarding it. \n4. Complete a project: Once a project has the necessary resources it may be turned face up to complete it for prestige points and for special effects as indicated on the card. Some projects have permanent in-game effects. \n5. Cancel a project: discard an unfinished project and any resources under it. \n6. Pass the turn The first player to reach an agreed upon amount of prestige points via completed projects and action cards is the winner.\nThe first player to reach an agreed upon amount of prestige points via completed projects and action cards is the winner.\n            Shipping is Worldwide-Friendly.

Gaming with people has been my hobby for almost 25 years. I started by playing old, pen\u2019n\u2019paper, RPG games and later I evolved and started playing board games and card games. In 2014/2015 I co-created a company named Ogry Games along with Polish editions of board games Metro 2033 and Bright Future. Working with games (and of course playing them!) gives me a lot of satisfaction. That is why I decided to go my own way (remember the awesome song \u201cMy Way\u201d by Frank Sinatra? I love it!). Now I am looking for games worth printing in Polish and vice versa - I want to deliver to you, in your language, games that so far have been only in Polish.

Without the humans, they would starve in the wasteland--or forget themselves as they regress into feral states.\nAt the same time, the village depends on the vampires. The twilight they travel through is not safe. It is filled with strange ruins, desperate raiders, feral vampires, other villages, and creatures from the Dark ahead.\nOnly the vampires can protect the village, and only the village can shelter the vampires.\nIf their alliance comes apart, there will be nothing left of either of them but ash on the Dawnline.\nWhat Is Gameplay Like?\nArtwork by Miguel Santos\nThe Dawnline is crunchy, tactical, and easy to pick up. Decisions play a bigger role than dice, and the core rules are straightforward, but there's also a lot of room for players to get deep into the mechanics and build strategies that fit their playstyle.\nGameplay in The Dawnline is broken into two phases. In the first, the players discover an opportunity or a threat to their nomadic community (such as a swarm of predatory Sirens from the Dark or a hypertech Ruin blocking their route) and journey out to face it. In the second, the players come home and manage their village.\nFor dice, The Dawnline uses d6s. Outside of combat, you roll them, add them up, and compare them against a target number. If you succeed, you achieve your aim. If you fail, the GM escalates the situation and your life gets interesting. If you don't like your roll, you can spend quick-to-recover Will Points to boost it, turning a failure into a success.\nIn combat, you can do all of the above, but you can also activate Powers, inflict debilitating Conditions, forgo some of your damage to regain Willpower, and decide how much of your Initiative you're going to convert into Actions and how much you're going to spend on going first.\nAs vampires, the players are hard to kill, and they can survive attacks that would obliterate mortals, but the village is also a character in the story, and growing, upgrading, and protecting it is the point around which gameplay orbits. If the vampires die, the village searches for new protectors. If the village dies, the vampires are left on their own in the wastes, without blood and companionship to preserve their humanity.\nWhat's The Setting Like?\nArtwork by Miguel Santos\nThe Dawnline takes place in a land of deserts, steppes, and badlands, where water is scarce and food is hard to come by. Worse, every living creature must constantly migrate west to flee the obliterating Light, which lies on the other side of the Dawnline. \nPushing too far west takes a community into the Dark, where the alien Sirens dwell, but staying in the twilight is fraught with its own perils. Predatory fauna, spatial anomalies, bandits, raiders, feral vampires, and unfamiliar communities all dot the Twilight, making the same constant westward migration.\nIf that weren't enough, strange, arcano-science Ruins periodically come out of the Dark, crossing the twilight until they are ultimately lost to the Light. These Ruins can be explored for the unguessable treasures that they sometimes hold, but they are often death-traps, with still-functional defense systems and other, worse surprises for those who dare to set foot inside.\nOh, That Sounds Like...\nArtwork by Enmanuel Abarca\nYes it does. The Dawnline is the result of a lot of different influences.\nThe setting is inspired by Vampire Hunter D and Pitch Black. The gameplay is inspired by Banner Saga, Oregon Trail, and Darkest Dungeon.\nThere's also some cross-pollination from the Japanese tabletop roleplaying scene. Games like Ryuutama and Dracurouge played roles in inspiring the Dawnline.\nSo It's Finished?\nArtwork by Enmanuel Abarca\n  The text of the core book is in a stable alpha state, but there's always room for improvement. Playtesting will be ongoing throughout the kickstarter, but---barring a catastrophic meltdown of the entire internet---the game already exists and is playable.\nThe purpose of the kick is not only to distribute the book, but also to raise funding for art, layout, and to generate more content.\nSpecifically, in addition to our print run of The Dawnline, we are planning to release a fiction PDF called Tales From the Dawnline, as well as Feral States, a PDF of monsters and scenarios. Both of these will be free to all backers.\nI Did Notice There Were A Lot Of Backer Levels\nThis is a game about community, and Kickstarting is a big process where an ad-hoc community pulls together to make a something they heard about on the internet become real.\nIt felt right to create opportunities for people to make their own mark on the game. The core rules will not be affected by this, and all stretch goals and backer-commissioned content will be made available to everyone.\nSpecifically, new Roles, Lineages, Powers, Example Characters, Snippets, Example Text, Artifacts, and Faces will all go into the core book.\nNew Stories will go into the Tales of the Dawnline PDF.\nNew Scenarios and Monsters will go into the Feral States PDF, as will any content produced by the Tweetstiary.\nThe Lineages\nIntroducing: The Tweetstiary\nArtwork by Miguel Santos\nThe night is more interesting when it's full of terrors, so in order to help people find out about The Dawnline, we've created a social media campaign called The Tweetstiary.\nThe way it works is this. If you're on social media, tweet a link to The Dawnline and use the hashtag #Tweetstiary\nWe'll track the tweets and add new monsters whenever we hit certain goals. All monsters from the Tweetstiary will go into the Feral States PDF, and on top of that the extra exposure will help us hit stretch goals, resulting in what will hopefully be an avalanche of free content to all backers.\nFurthermore, at the end of the campaign, whoever tweets the most will receive an in-book credit as The Harbinger Of Tweets. We won't be in the running for this, so the winner will either be a backer or for some reason a highly-motivated non-backer.\nTweets will be tallied daily, so you can follow the campaign's progress in (semi) real time.\n\u2714 1 Tweet: New Monster (Chullah Outrider)\n\u2714 5 Tweets: New Monster (Coronae Kiln-Haunt)\n\u2714 10 Tweets: New Monster (Ambassador Wasp)\n\u2714 20 Tweets: New Monster (Coronae Candessa)\n\u2714 40 Tweets: New Monster (Emburrowed Strongarm)\n\u2714 80 Tweets: New Monster (Tyrant Chullah)\n\u2714 160 Tweets: New Monster (Vespidary Falconer)\n320 Tweets: New Monster (Blightfly Meatswarm)\nPrint Flyers and Spread the Word\nStretch Goals\nArtwork by Enmanuel Abarca\n\u2714 $2000 - Basic Funding Level\n\u2714 $2300 - New Monster (Wayfarer Dreadcluster)\n\u2714 $2700 - New Role (Bulletknack)\n\u2714 $3200 - New Lineage + Power (Seraph, Dreadlight)\n\u2714 $3500 - New Monster (Simulacral Insidiant)\n\u2714 $4000 - New Scenario (Chaos At The Grand Bazaar)\n\u2714 $4300 - New Monster (Child of the Glass Coffin)\n\u2714 $4700 - New Role (Echo Dowser)\n\u2714 $5200 - New Lineage + Power (Primarial, Vice)\n\u2714 $5500 - New Monster (Deepnight Dunereaver)\n\u2714 $6000 - New Scenario (Upon Steeds Of Iron)\n\u2714 $7000 - Village Complexity Upgrade (deep upgrade trees and unlocks)\n\u2714 $7300 - 3 New Supply Items and 1 New Quality\n\u2714 $7600 - 3 New Gear Upgrades and 1 New Quality\n\u2714 $7900 - 3 New Gear Upgrades and 1 New Quality\n\u2714 $9000 - Core Rules Upgrade (Ruin-generation system)\n$11,500 - The Shattered Steppe PDF: An Oregon-Trail-style campaign with Fate Checks for travelling from point to point, an adventure/encounter/randomgen Ruin at each point, a branching campaign map, and an overarching plot.\n$14,000 - The Duskline PDF: A full game conversion that takes place on the other side of Janus, where the more moons the PCs can see in the darkness that chases them, the more they transform into their aberrant selves.\nOur Team\nJoe Bush (Publisher, Artist, and Layout) is a game designer and artist known for Heroines of the First Age, Oubliette, Summoner's Grimiore, and Wasuremonogatari. He works almost exclusively in digital art, favoring stylized work with a distinct anime and manga feel. Joe's projects range through fantasy, science fiction, horror, and Japanese themes. He is the owner of Voidspiral Entertainment where he works full time on game development and commissions.\nRichard Kelly (Designer and Writer) is a writer and designer whose interests run towards weird and gothic fiction. The game lines he has written for include Oubliette Second Edition, Heroines of the First Age, Pathogen: Unclassified, Wicked Pacts, Splinter, and Golden Sky Stories. He has been interested in Japanese-style tabletop ever since discovering that it exists, and his writing is occasionally infested with owls.\nEnmanuel Abarca (Artist) is an artist from Venezuela living in Colombia. He has been a freelance artist for about 7 years and a full time artist for about 3 years now. He has been drawing since he can remember, and it has always been his passion and his hobby, but it never came across his mind that he would been doing it for a living. He studies graphic design and, although it\u2019s not directly related to illustration, he did learn a lot of color, composition and how to use most of the programs that he uses today. Illustration has been mostly a self taught process, and he has worked mostly on small independent publisher projects, book covers, and a lot of stockart. Here you can find his online portfolio.\nMiguel Santos (Artist) is a freelance illustrator for RPGs, tabletop/card games, and magazines. He is also an indie comic book author. His favorite themes are Sci Fi, Horror, Fantasy, History, and Politics. His dystopian webcomic is here, and his online portfolio can be found here.\nZachary Card (Artist) is a fantasy enthusiast that spends his days writing software and his nights playing games and practicing art. He tries to understand what makes things unique and uses that to inform his art. As a gamer, he enjoys fiction with big worlds that are larger than the characters they contain, and games with mechanics in a tight, interactive meta. He finds inspiration in the works of HP Lovecraft, hidden secretly in lines of code, and in spaces between leaves. He hopes one day to figure out how to be a real boy, and NOT a wooden puppet or a donkey.\nIntended Timeline\nFulfilled by DriveThruRPG\n\nFAQ\nArtwork by Enmanuel Abarca\nQ: In the backer levels I see 'design a Role', 'design a Lineage', etc. What do these things mean?\nA: Being featured in a snippet means that you (or a character you choose) stars in either a piece of example text that shows off how the rules work, or in a piece of lore text that gives a little bit of insight into the setting. \nDesigning an example Artifact means you commission one of the \"treasures\" that vampires and villages sometimes pull from Ruins. Artifacts can be unlocked through tinkering to provide a village with powerful bonuses, but they impose a penalty instead if the tinkering fails.\nDesigning an example Face means you commission one of the mortals who represents a village to its vampires. Faces aren't just socially important people. They're anyone the vampires empathize with and relate to.\nDesigning a monster means you get to commission a specific nasty and set it loose into the twilight to terrorize other villages.\nDesigning a Role means you commission one of the out-of-combat roles that PCs can play. Each Role comes with a small set of persistent bonuses for niche situations.\nDesigning an example character means you get to commission the canonical vampire that represents one of the book's existing Lineages.\nCommissioning a short story means that Richard writes a Dawnline story for you, based on whatever prompts or instructions you give him.\nDesigning a Lineage means you commission one of the broad types of vampires that inhabit the twilight. Each Lineage also comes with a new Power, which is a set of four in-combat abilities that all vampires can learn.\nCommissioning a Scenario means that Richard writes a Dawnline Scenario for you, based on whatever prompts or instructions you give him.\nI AM THE BLOODLORD is self-explanatory. You become the Bloodlord.\nAll of these commissions are subject to some limitations. The scope of the commission must be within reason, and the content mustn't torpedo the setting. Short stories and Scenarios will generally be in the 3,000 to 10,000 word range. As for content, Richard will work with you to make what you're commissioning fit in the setting.\nIf you've got an idea that you think might be too outlandish, or that you think would need more than 10,000 words to do it justice, just message Richard and he'll be happy to greenlight it.\nQ: In detail, how do the dice work?\n\nA: When you're confronted by meaningful opposition, the GM gives you a Target Number and you roll 3d6 and add your relevant Skill. If you at least tie the Target Number, you succeed. If you beat the TN by at least one point, you also generate temporary Success Points, which you can use to power different Effects. If you fall short of the TN, you fail, and the GM escalates the situation.\nTo keep you from being at the mercy of the dice, you have a pool of Willpower points that you can spend whenever you choose. By spending Willpower, you can turn a failure into a success.\nIn combat, or in any situation where you're opposing another character, the dice are a little more complicated, but not by much. When you oppose another character, you both roll 3d6 + Skill. Then, in secret, you each decide how much Willpower you're going to spend. Finally, you reveal your bid, and the person with the highest Roll + Willpower spent wins.\nThings can get a little bit more complex than this, especially when Powers and other game elements get involved, but this is the core of it: roll some dice, read your opponent, risk your resources, and make a decision.\nQ: How about the Villages? How do they work mechanically?\nA: Villages in The Dawnline are made of three things: Resources, Qualities, and Faces.\n\nResources are a Village's Hit Points, and there are three kinds: Morale, Sustenance, and Distance. If one of those Resources drops below zero, the Village breaks apart, starves, or is lost to the Light.\nQualities are like special abilities for Villages, and they include things like Supply Wagons (which let a Village store more Resources) and Tinker's Lab (which lets the vampires take better Gear out on missions).\nFinally, Faces are the people that represent the Village. Each player (and the GM) designs a Face, and then the group adds details to each Face. When the vampires interact with the Village, they do so through the Faces.\nOver time, Villages' Resources dwindle. However, at the end of every scenario, the vampires have an option to either go scavenging, improve themselves, or tinker with an Artifact. If they scavenge, they can help keep the Village alive a little longer---at the cost of missing an opportunity to grow a little stronger, or to unleash powerful temporary bonuses.\nArtwork by Enmanuel Abarca", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe core game is written, a portion of the art is complete, and testing is in progress. The bulk of the work to finish The Dawnline will consist of creating more art and writing game material that is generated during this campaign. This will be followed by editing, layout, and distribution.\n\nVoidspiral has had seven successful Kickstarter campaigns before this, four of which were games, and we have delivered what is now a very small library of books to our backers.\n\nFor any level that involves a backer commission, we will be in touch and starting fulfillment on those as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. The categorical exception to this rule is THE BLOODLORD, where we will be in touch right away to make sure that a) you're serious, and b) the game that you want is something we are able to deliver.\n\nVoidspiral Entertainment's previous Kickstarters have tended to slightly over-deliver on content, and this has slowed fulfillment, but we have neatly sidestepped this being an issue for The Dawnline's core book. Since the core game for The Dawnline is already feature-complete, our development process will be much quicker, and we will be able to get it into your hands faster.\n\nThe supplemental material will take longer to deliver, but, because we won't have to write the entire core book first, the entire production schedule will move that much more swiftly.\n\nLike any other game with a small design team, The Dawnline *is* vulnerable to disruptions such as the catastrophic and final collapse of all known human civilization. However, even in a scenario like this, protocols are in place to ensure that the feature-complete beta still gets released to whatever post-man creatures inhabit the ruins. Also the pledges would get refunded, briefly enlivening whatever remains of the global economy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge

Our protagonist, formerly a veteran police detective but now retired following years of frustration and disillusionment, spends his days intoxicated while accepting random jobs as a private investigator to make ends meet. He exists within the neon sea of an immense city, its blinding artificial lights unable to hide the shadow of greed and lust that threatens to engulf it at any moment.\nThis drunken cycle is broken when our hero becomes entangled in a missing person's case, one which holds the key to tracking down a monstrous killer who long ago escaped justice. Unlock your memories, decode the truth, and resist drowning in the wave of conspiracy that grips the city!\nStunningly detailed retro-styled pixel-art coupled with modern atmospheric lighting and visual effects bring this unique cyberpunk world to life, while evocative music and sound design build suspense and mystery every step of the way.\n As an adventure game built on mystery and intrigue, the player will encounter various puzzles interspersed throughout the story. These have been designed to test observation and reasoning skills, while also being logical and fun. The puzzles appear organically and help to flesh out the world while also keeping gameplay fresh and interesting.\nThe story itself has been written and designed to ensure that players care about the characters and the world they exist in. Through this cinematic storytelling comes the motivation to move forward and the constant desire to reach the next twist or plot point.\nSimilar to other side-scrollers, players can use a control pad or mouse & keyboard to determine movement, dialogue, and interaction between characters in each scene.\nGameplay  \nOur protagonist is a very talented detective. He uses powers of observation, reasoning, and deduction to solve puzzles and reveal the mysteries of cases one after another by exploring the scene, analyzing objects, and interrogating witnesses.\nIn addition, at various points in the game you can take control of his special \u201cassistant\u201d - William the black cat. William can travel deeper into areas our detective can\u2019t reach, often proving decisive in identifying and retrieving key evidence!\nMaster Detective  \nThe player needs to search for hidden clues and physical evidence from the perspective of a detective, obtain secrets from the mouths of key individuals, make inferences, and draw conclusions about who is the criminal, their motives and techniques.\nInvestigation\nItem\nMaze Explorer  \nMany scenes within the game are constructed like a maze, requiring the player to make use of everything around them to escape and move on to the next section.\nThe goal is to create interesting and logical side-scrolling labyrinths.\nBelow is an early design example (we don\u2019t want to spoil sections of the finished game!)\n There will also be some independent puzzles in the game interspersed with each stage, so in this way the puzzles can be more diverse.\nThe game is now more than 50% complete. Several test versions already exist and have been trialed by a small sample group of players for feedback.\nThe overall framework and flow of the game stages has been finalized.\nThe main game systems have been completed.  \nThe artistic style of the game has been fine-tuned, and the main scene assets have also been completed.  \nThe second offline test has been completed.\nWe have already exhibited our game at PAX East and have received coverage from Rock Paper Shotgun, and VentureBeat.

Six gods in coalition made the world habitable. Five of the six gods each took an island for their own and molded it into the home they wanted to leave behind, for the life they had created and for the generations to come. The Blue Realm was created beneath the waves, built atop sand where merfolk could thrive. They lived there as mortals until their deaths, returning to their godly forms to observe from afar.\"\nPrism is a roleplaying game about relationships (both platonic and romantic) and conflict resolution set in an aquatic world. There are six realms in the game with their own culture, code of ethics, and deity. The setting of the game promotes a sex positive environment and a safe space to explore intimate character interactions.\nPrism is also a world of elemental magic, but the mechanics are light and conversational. The rest of the rules rely less on crunch, and more on negotiations between players and the GM. There are three core mechanics in the game. The first is each character starts out with at least one relationship with another character in the game. Depending how they feel about the other person, they'll receive a unique bonus. The second is instead of using dice, characters rely on predetermined levels of expertise in skills such as swimming, dancing, and following protocol to solve narrative conflicts, and interact with the world around them. The third mechanic is each character is loyal to a realm, and depending on their behavior, they can be punished or rewarded by the god that watches over the realm they are loyal to.\n\"Prism offers players a chance to think about their characters emotional lives in a way that is really fresh. I love the way in Prism what your character feels, and how they relate to the world - and the world, to them - actually matters.\" - Jason Morningstar\n\"This is a delightful work. I am reminded again at how calm it makes me feel to read it. That is also a testament to her choices of words and phrasing.\" - Cam Banks\n\"Character creation was a delight. Character creation is my least favorite thing about RPGs, so this is the highest compliment to pay.\" - Elizabeth Stong\nSince the core of the game is relationships between player and non-player characters, it's intended for a maximum of four players. For a really intimate experience, Prism can even be played one-on-one with the GM!\n\"I love Prism's attention to the dynamic nature of our relationships, and there is no better way to explore that theme than in a game where it's just you and the GM. Experiencing love and loss through such a highly-focused lens was powerful and inspiring. I have never felt so affected by a single session of any game.\" - Andrea Gaulke\n\"Prism was rich with opportunities, fun to explore, and intimate without being overwhelming. I felt like my character could stand alone during the adventure, but I also had the sense that if the game expanded to include more players, it could be just as fun.\" - Kimberley Lam\nAll the writing, and most of the art was done by yours truly. The rulebook has over 50 full color illustrations. I collaborated with one of my best friends, Maria Smith, to complete the artwork for the Almanac.\nThe physical copy of the book is 6x9 softcover, full color, and 48 pages in length. The great thing about this campaign is the digital version has already been finalized. Which means once it has ended, printing and fulfillment can begin soon after.\nFunding will go towards printing the book, crowdfunding fees, unforeseen expenses, and reimbursing the designer (me) for the costs of additional art, editing, etc. Now, you might be wondering, Whitney, what about shipping?\nPrism can be shipped anywhere, but please be aware that your pledge does not include the cost of shipping. Shipping will instead be charged during the fulfillment process on BackerKit. During the time of this campaign, US shipping is estimated at $6, and everywhere else is $9. The cost of shipping the Retail Pack Tier is estimated to be $9 for US, and $14 for everywhere else.\nOnce the campaign is over, I will get in contact with those that backed at the King & Queen Tier. You'll be emailed a sketch for your approval before I begin the coloring process.

Capture the hearts of weapons to level them up in this \u201cshack-and-slash\u201d dungeon crawling adventure. Forge relationships and save Love itself!\nWe've decided $200k USD is our final stretch goal. Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier. Includes: the game, soundtrack, rose USB key, enamel pin, and sticker sheet, all in a beautiful box for your shelf.\nTemperature changing Boyfriend Dungeonmaster mugs of infinite thirst. Included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nTransform Talwar OR Dagger at will from their human form (front) to weapon form (back).

Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

Gradually pay back his investments to expand your operation and rise to the top!\nRebuild with the help of your loyal Business Maid and stalwart Battle Butler.\nReal-time character management.\nHire sexy executives from multiple industries to help grow your business empire.\nAssign them to buildings to increase their skills, earn money, hire employees, fight rivals and much more!\nFight rivals in the streets to absorb their assets and increase your market share.\nDeal with crises as they arise. Machinery caught fire? Throw more workers on top of it. Employees revolting? Hire new ones!\nBalance your employee morale and company reputation against your wallet and your ethics.\nUnlock advanced buildings like the Train Station to send executives on expeditions across the globe to find rare items.\nEarn upgrades to streamline your operations and allow you to better multi-task.\nBuy Money. Get Rich.\nInteract with your executives to grow closer to them. As you spend more time with them, they might ask you on a date.\nEach character has their own unique and ridiculous story arc.\nDates feature your Gentsona. Make choices to try and seduce your date (or just embarrass yourself.)\nDate who you want and as many characters as you want. Characters in \"Sexy Business!\" are very open-minded for the Victorian Era.\nOr seduce no one; that's cool too! You can make awesome friends!\nDates are inspired by games like the Persona series. So what I'm saying is that we are basically better than Persona.\nSee unlocked smut, fanart and cosplay we've recieved so far at maxgentlemen.tumblr.com (NSFW duh)\nHere is our TWITTER associated with these goals. Tweet submissions with #SexyBusiness. You can also submit more privately through a twitter message or maxgent.submissions@gmail.com (especially if you want to send us a butt)\n                                                                        Create your own Gentleman or Lady with hundreds of customization possibilities.\nDate anyone! You are so rich, who cares who you date?!\nAdvance relationships to unlock outfits and powerups.\nCollect a variety of art for your private gallery.\nMonopolize 12 burgeoning industries.\nSend executives to the far reaches of the globe to gather rare resources and collect powerful loot.\nLevel up and personalize your executives to crush the competition.\nTake revenge for your family name by getting really really rich.\nAlso, everyone who backs us can get their name in the credits and input on any future stretch goal costume designs that may happen - because we love you!\nWE'VE REACH ALL OUR GOALS!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANYTHING MORE WE RECEIVE WILL HELP US MAKE THE GAME BETTER OVERALL SO DON'T STOP!\nNice.\nThank you!  \n$10k - Business Maid and Battle Butler deserve fun and sexy outfits too.\n$12k - We will work with backers to transport 2018 fashion sensibilities into the Victorian era. Did you know hot-pants weren't invented yet? Each character will get a new in-game outfit.     \n$15k - What happens when you beat the game? Can you keep playing? New Game+? Well we would love to add more content to the game.     \n$18k - More faces, outfits, moustaches, hats, etc. to make the Gentsona of your dreams!     \n$20k - \"Sexy Business!\" is already pretty tantalizing but we're currently teetering on the edge of an adult game. If we reach this goal, we will make sure there is a version of the game with all the potential ass, penis, boobs and vagina available. We're not sure what the Steam nudity policy will be like when we launch but we'll make sure we figure something out. (I really want to pay more artists to draw these beautiful gents and ladies naked.) \nBONUS: We'll make a NSFW version of the art book available to anyone who backs at $30+  \n$25k - Twelve characters plus all the supporting cast calls for a ton of different voices but we would love to get as much VO as possible in there to really bring the characters to life.  \n$30k - We will work on adding at least two more characters to the game. Probably to be released as DLC (for time reasons) but all backers will get these characters FOR FREE. Honestly, we easily have 12 more character ideas so the further we go past our goal the better chance of our roster filling out with cuties.\nThe Men Who Wear Many Hats is a video game studio based in Chicago, IL. We started as a small company making games in our free time and then Organ Trail kept making us a lot of money so I guess this is a real studio now. I hope so because I quit my job like 5 years ago. Organ Trail has been updated with two additional expansion packs over the years and is available on 8 different platforms including PS4 and Vita! Now, I'm trying to burn through my coffers as fast as possible because I believe it is cursed and the church won't return my calls.\nRyan Wiemeyer is the Lead Developer, is handsome, and wears too many hats. Benn Marion has been an Artist with the Hats since Organ Trail. Our core character style was developed by Colo with assistance from Xiaomeng Zhang.\nHere are some other great people that have helped us make this game so far:\nPixiepowderpuff (Artist)\nDon (Artist)\nFat Bard (Audio)\nAndrea Phillips (Writer)\nNK Animation (Artist)\nvanilla-coffeee (Artist) NSFW\nEvul (Artist) NSFW\nKairu (Artist) NSFW", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is this campaign making too much money and having to work on the game for all of eternity (which would be cool with me.)\n\nBut for real. We've been funding this game for the last 8 months and will find a way to release no matter what. This campaign is primarily to see how much polish and content we can afford to add to the game before launch and to help get the word out. Obviously, if we reach certain goals and have to add more content we might end up taking a bit longer to fit it all in. \n\nWe hope we can find an audience who wants to see this project grow.

Detroit Vampires first took shape on the pages of a spiral bound notebook in 2008. Several drafts later the story went to major overhauls and introspection. The main character, Sobeske Ban was terrified of Vampires, and I wasn't sure if it mattered to him weather they were real. It took a lot to create a high concept original story like this but the final draft was completed in 2017. It is even copyrighted in the USA. We put out a 5 a page preview of Detroit Vampires in 2017 that launched at an Independent Media Expo called STAPLE. The book was very well received because of the high contrast art and campy theme. To us the characters came to life and lived a little. This showed us their nature and style. The last few months we churned out drawings like butter. Detroit Vampires is a 22 page comic, that begins the story arc for ten more issues. We really enjoy working together and are going to bring this issue to market with a deserved amount of enthusiasm. The characters that surround the story support our lead, Sobeske Ban, as he wanders through the hilariously dangerous environment of Detroit Vampires.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital PDF Copy", "descp": "A digital PDF copy of Detroit Vampires #1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "A print copy of Detroit Vampires #1", "descp": "A 22 page color glossy print of Detroit Vampires #1.
