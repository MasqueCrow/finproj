Yes, that means chibi Ambrogio. Doesn't that sound like a great idea, Ambrogio?\nOkay, fine. Actually, I'm not asking you. I'm asking the backers. :-D\n***\n\"an awesome, sassy vampire webcomic...with unique and fresh ideas\"\n-- Meg Markey, ReadComicBooks.net\n\"shows surprising depth quickly\"\n-- Chuck Wendig, author of the Miriam Black books and the Heartland series\nIt\u2019s that time! After Daylight, your one-stop shop for satirical vampire comedy/drama with a splash of socially-aware snark (okay, maybe more than a splash) has been updating faithfully as a weekly webcomic since August of 2012. Now 100 hand-shaded pages are in the can, the grand plot arc of the first \u201cseason\u201d is all wrapped up, and it\u2019s time for it to sail out into the world in gorgeous print.\nGreat. So what\u2019s After Daylight?\nWell, you gotta understand. I\u2019ve been writing vampire fiction on a professional basis since the late 90\u2019s, and I still love the bloodthirsty little dears to death, but I can only take them so seriously anymore. As an author, I love the juiciness of a setting where humans must share the planet (or not) with other sentient, powerful beings. Who drink blood. But as a fan, I\u2019ve gotten so tired of books and shows that drop all these intriguing hints about how that setting would work\u2026aaaand then end up way too busy destroying the protagonists\u2019 romance for the fourth time to really follow up on it. Not naming any names.\nSo I\u2019ve taken that premise of \"humans discover vampires! En masse!\" and put my own tongue-mostly-in-cheek twist on it. And I\u2019ve written in all those bloodsuckers I knew had to exist if there really were bloodsuckers, but for some reason we never see them. You know: the ones too busy working a crappy night job to stand around with perfect hair, moping existentially. The ones who think blood bank discards taste like rusty nails. The ones who listen to a little too much talk radio. The ones who actually reflect the incredible variety of a modern urban population. The ones who\u2019re more scared of mortals than the mortals are of them.\nWe see much of this through the eyes of one \"Cat\" Bernstein, ex-folk-rocker turned undead retail drudge, but this series is all about strong ensemble cast. No matter what kind of vamps you like, I've probably got one for you! Volume 1 takes us through the ominous creeping dawn of Daylight -- that's the vampires' unhappy nickname for this revelation -- from its first deniable Internet leaks (and the inevitable LOLmacros) to the full monty of the inescapable spotlight.\nLet\u2019s just say, hijinks ensue. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Feel free to browse over to the webcomic at http://www.afterdaylight.com and take a look!\nOkay, but why should I back this if the webcomic is free?\nGlad you asked.\nReason #1: The book is way cooler. It\u2019s bigger and much higher-resolution, so even if you\u2019re reading the PDF, you\u2019ll enjoy a nicer view of the lovingly-detailed art and all the jokey little Easter eggs. The print edition will be even lovelier, what with its hip, graphic, UV-spot-coated cover design and all. Both print and PDF versions will have some material not available on the website \u2013 with possibly even more bonus goodies, if we can hit stretch goals! Finally, while After Daylight works fine as a page-a-week fix because of the comedy, it also has a continuing dramatic plot that's more satisfying to read in extended bursts. The book/e-book format makes those leisurely reading sessions much more convenient and pleasurable.\nReason #2: Creators gotta eat. We live in exciting times. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter are opening up whole new possibilities for indie comics. Webcomics in particular have eagerly added it to the business model that\u2019s been emerging over the last decade or so \u2013 a model in which you can make it even if your stories are too wild and weird, too niche, too unconventional in art style, or too \u201chard to market\u201d to sell to risk-averse major publishers. I\u2019ve spent the last two years basically doing my \u201cante up\u201d \u2013 proving to myself that I can meet a regular deadline while creating a story and characters that make people laugh, think, and care. I believe the reader response so far has borne this out. But a comic like this is time- and labor-intensive to produce, and rent still comes annoyingly due every month. So now I have to verify that I can make at least enough money at this to be able to continue with the series. Your pledge money is funding an honest-to-goodness professional offset print run, but this is an all-or-nothing deal. If the funding goal isn't met by the deadline, no money changes hands and that means I can't buy the run, so I need the help of each and every one of you with pledging and spreading the word.\nBut if we succeed, I can print enough premium-quality books not only to reward my backers, but also to sell on an ongoing basis at conventions, through small retailers, and on the Internet. In other words, your Kickstarter support can help make my indie creative career viable in a way that simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible twenty years ago. As a child of the pre-Web era, I find this change amazing! I hope you do too.\nAll right, you've sold me. Now tell me what goodies I get!\nGlad you asked that, too!\nI have many pledge levels for you -- take a look on the right. In all likelihood, there's one that suits your desires and budget.

They've done absolutely beautiful work on several of my colleagues' books and I'm eager to see what they can do with AD!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n+ The 100 full comic pages and 5 minicomics that make up Volume 1 are already completed, so apart from layout -- which is currently in progress -- the book is finished. This has already been a multi-year labor, which I'm very proud and happy to have invested in.\n\n+ There can be no collaboration problems because After Daylight is a one-woman shop. My boss may be a taskmaster, but she can't fire me! Yes, if I get run over by a truck or something, then no further volumes will be created -- and while the first big plot arc is finished in Vol. 1, I plan many more wicked plot arcs that do need me to keep making them. So I hope you'll join me in my fervent desire that no trucks engage me in any right-of-way disputes.\n\n+ This is a first Kickstarter. I've crunched oh, so many spreadsheet numbers and lined up multiple potential vendors for this, but it's still always possible that something will happen to cause a production delay beyond those already anticipated (for instance, my most likely print vendor ships from overseas, so that multi-week delay is all but certain). I'll be very clear about what I expect for turnaround times on each reward category once the funding goal is reached and fulfillment begins. If it looks like there'll be a hiccup, delay, or need to switch vendors, I'll keep everyone apprised of those developments as they happen and listen carefully to backer feedback.\n\n+ In planning this campaign, I'm lucky to follow a path already trodden by similar bound-volume projects that have funded successfully, and whose fulfillment phases were much like what I'm planning. Their triumphs and agonies have been my teachers. I've been soliciting advice from multiple colleagues for many months now, and as a result, I believe I've built in reasonable cushions and contingencies for the known problems of crowdfunding a graphic novel. (For instance, NOT forgetting shipping expenses and fees!) Again, however, if something unanticipated comes up that has the potential to affect my backers, frequent and informative updates will be my response.\n\n+ If I have my way, After Daylight will be around for many years to come -- so my long-term relationship with my readers is one of the most important things in the world to me. In all I do with this campaign, the desire to keep that relationship going strong is my guide.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Comedy in an age of self-parody?", "update_content": "So yeah, that all happened.\n\nI mean, in a way, my conscience is clear?

This story is about their fight for freedom and the right to exist.\nFounded by the mysterious Man In White, the goal of this strange project is to replace human soldiers with something more \"disposable\". Through a combination of limb replacement, genetic manipulation, psychoactive drugs, and hormone treatments, this project has created some very bizarre results. The few surviving primates lack any mental conditioning, which drives some to be little more than psychotic weapons...\nMarlowe is one of the oldest surviving Monkeys in the project. He's had a portion of his body removed, and replaced with several cybernetic equivalents and \"upgrades\". He is fighting to free his fellow specimens and ensure their survival.\n\nPunk is another specimen of the project. He's been put through experiments to give him a better \"combat response.\" He has drug dependency problems, and his altered states vary wildly between a comatose stupor to homicidal rage. Punk and Marlowe share leadership of the troop, and don't always see eye to eye.\nThe Man in White is the founder of the project, and he's going to do everything in his power to stay in control of his specimens. He's going to make sure his project ends on his terms, and any monkeys will die a horrible death before he loses control.\nJeremy had a successful Kickstarter with his Zombie Robots project. He was very happy with its success, and it was evident that the means to make his ambitious comic series Munkie Revolution are now a reality.\nThe Kickstarter campaign is running from November tent to December fifteenth. Munkie Revolution needs $6,000 in order to pay for publishing of the almost completed book. Our ultimate goal is to continue the Mini-series until completion, and tell a story that Jeremy has been involved with for over a decade.\nMunkie Revolution is created by:\nJEREMY RATHBONE -- Some say he's a madman in communion with the elder gods. Others say he's a wise old soul, who can use his wisdom to come up with unusual concepts. Still others say he's a silly person with silly ideas.Jeremy Rathbone is a strange individual who spends little time sleeping, and works in acrylic, and digital. He's best known for his Zombot series of paintings, and amassing evidence that one of his closest friends is in fact a robot. He has also co-created the comic story Munkie Revolution. Jeremy has the artistic philosophy of \u201cIf it doesn't make you think It's not art.\u201d\nBRYAN RICHMOND \u2013 Writes the Munkie Revolution comic with Jeremy Rathbone. He also co-writes the webcomic Space Corps.\nWith your help we will be able to finish production and publish Munkie Revolution number one, a twenty-four page ad-free premium full color comic.\nBelow is a preview of what you will find inside your comic. These pages are nearly finished, but some touching-up is still needed. Lettering will be added when all the pages are completed. \nPage 11\npage 12\npage 13\npage 14\nJeremy had a successful kickstarter with his Zombie Robots.  He was so happy with its success the means were now evident to make his ambitious series Munkie Revolution a reality.    \nWe want this project to be a platform to conduct greater stories. We are hoping that Munkie Revolution will be the first of many in the next decade. We have a lot of wonderful stories to tell!\nWhen this comic was first envisioned, back in 2002 the original idea was called Monkie Squad. At the time, the story was sillier and upbeat, more akin to TMNT.  It had soviet gorillas! Here is an early rendition of one of our Monkies.\nMonkie!!!!\nJeremy went to many conventions in those early days, but Monkie Squad was too ambitious for a new artist and the project was scrapped.\nIn early 2006 Jeremy co-created his first comic \"Dust\".  After issue 1 Jeremy focused on stand alone illustration and art pieces. He continued his artistic education growing as an artist and taking the criticism received to improve his craft and art portfolio. \nEvolution of a punk.\nHowever, this time Jeremy isn't doing everything.Jeremy brought the amazingly talented Bryan Richmond, writer of Space Corps in to write Munkie Revolution.  With Jeremy's improved artistic abilities the writer/artist team can finally tell the story ten years in the making.  \nThis is just a small tidbit of the Munkie Revolution story. When this kickstarter is successfully funded more of the story will be told. It has been a very long road to get to these words that I am typing now. So please, join us in an event that will be part of our lives for the rest of our days. This will be a true revolution in every sense of the word.  \nTo show our thanks, everyone who supports the Revolution here on kickstarter will receive a special invitation to the upcoming release party in Sacramento where mad Munkie mayhem shall be unleashed upon the world!  \nFor those that pledge 5 bucks:\nPDF copy of Munkie Revolution!\n 8 bucks:\nA physical copy of the comic for 8 bucks!

This project has been in the works for well over a decade. We've been getting better at handling these projects through many years of experience. \n\nOur first challenge is to get this comic-book out in time! Our plan is to have our book in your hands within a month after the kickstarter has been completed. As on now, the comic is already 3/4 complete. By the time kickstarter ends, the comic will be completed. We are not dealing with a printer in China, we are printing domestically to avoid a 2 month shipping delay. That means our comic is going to be more expensive. We hope that paying a few extra bucks to insure quality and timeliness is worth it. \n\nThat brings me to challenge number two; finances. This is by far our hardest one yet. We spent a lot of time crunching numbers and trying to figure out what is the best price for our comic, and the goal for the kickstarter campaign. One of the difficulties is trying to make sure that our rewards don't dive too deep in the amount of money we need to publish the comic. We want to give you awesome stuff, but we need to balance that with achieving a printable book!\n\nAlso...I shouldn't even talk about this (I am being watched), but these Munkies are very dangerous! If I say something wrong, they will eat (or shoot) me! I know Jeremy says they prefer fast food, but I don't think so. Oh-gawd!

It's about an Aztec god trapped in the body of a salamander for 500 years and then forced to do good deeds against his will. He's a superhero who hates people, and he fights crazy villains like Hitlersaurus and the Invisible Deafmute.\nIf you like comics like Scud: the Disposable Assassin, Sam & Max or The Tick then you'll probably like this. It's weird, nerdy and fun! Up to this point, we've done a (very) small print run of the first 3 stories collected together. We've managed to sell out of them, but would like to finance a higher quality printing, and an additional volume with the next three stories, plus bonus art that you can't actually see for free on the website. If that sounds like it's in your wheelhouse, then read on!\nBackground:\nI created the character of the Black Mudpuppy in 6th grade. I don't really remember what exactly prompted his creation, but he's been with me for quite awhile in some form or another. At the time I had a pet melanistic axolotl, so that helped. My biggest influences as an artist are Doug TenNapel (Of such amazing works as Creature Tech and The Neverhood), and Steve Purcell (Sam & Max).  In college I utterly failed to adequately bring Mudpuppy to life, but in April of 2012, with a 30th birthday and the threat of utter mediocrity staring me in the face, I registered blackmudpuppy.com and began (with some regularity) drawing full pages of comics. Some people read them.\nI also enlisted the help of my good friend Adam Wickert, who keeps insisting that the comic is good and has value. He assists with the website, story ideas, marketing ideas and to date has not actually ever been paid. \nGoals:\nSo far, we've done a few small appearances and sold some books, and we think we've learned what will make the next version better. We would like to promote and market the books to a wider audience. The comic itself is meant to be read as a book, and most of our regular readers prefer to read it this way, as opposed to single pages presented semi-bi-weekly.\nStretch Goals:\nUNLOCKED -- $1600 - An exclusive Backer only Mudpuppy digital comic. \nUNLOCKED -- $1650 - Everyone at the $10 level or higher gets a Mudpuppy bookmark. \nUNLOCKED -- $1750 - Everyone at the $10 level or above gets an additional sticker design \nUNLOCKED -- $2000 - Everyone at the $40 level or above gets an additional poster design \nLOCKED -- $2250 - Backer exclusive Artist's Commentary audio file detailing the creation of the entire series up till now. \nLOCKED --$2501 -- Change name of Volume 2: The Dead Trees Edition to Volume 2: Electric Boogaloo. \nLOCKED -- $2502 -- Change name back to Dead Trees Edition.\nLOCKED --$3000 -- Everyone at the $50 level or above gets a Black Mudpuppy t-shirt.\nRewards:\nThis is a short encapsulation of our rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks and challenges are already pretty much out of the way; namely the creation of the content and the laying out of the book.

Over the years you've flattered us by telling us these comics remind you of some of your favorite comedians like Monty Python, the Far Side, Saturday Night Live and Mad Magazine. The road hasn't always been smooth, we've had our share of hiccups and you've stuck with us and we've overcome them. Now we're bringing you the next incarnation of your favorite Woohooligan gags in three new PDF ebooks. (We know you also want physical books and you'll get those very soon!)\nWe're starting with these three ebook titles:\nWoohooligan Volume 1: Into Dorkness\nWoohooligan Presents: Nerdgasm\nWoohooligan Presents: The Secret Life of Kliingons\nHere's a little more detail on these cool new books you'll get when you back Woohooligan Digital Funnies!\nThe Books\nWoohooligan Volume 1: Into Dorkness is a compilation of your most loved comics since 2006. Woohooligan is a weekly gag comic with no specific overall theme and very few repeat characters. It's akin to some of your favorite gag comics like Cyanide & Happiness, Chanellate, Buttersafe, the Far Side or Amazing Superpowers. In most cases the art in the Woohooligan strips is a little more detailed.\nMany of you hooligans have flattered me by saying Woohooligan reminds you of many of your favorite comedians like Monty Python, Saturday Night Live and Mad Magazine. To really understand what you're getting, you'll have to visit the official site and see for yourself. The book will also feature additional artist commentary and many alternate endings that are no longer available online.\nWoohooligan Presents: Nerdgasm is a fun PG story about what happens when you get a bunch of anime/comic fans together to talk about sex. In 2012 I attended a real sexual fetish panel at the AnimeFest convention here in Dallas and this story is loosely based on that experience. Despite the subject matter, there is no actual sex (or porn) in the story (sorry). Hey, I said it was PG! Plus there was never any actual sex at the panel, dangit!\nThe book will contain many alternate endings no longer available online. You can see more of this story on the official Woohooligan website.\nWoohooligan Presents: The Secret Lives of Kliingons is a short story about the every day lives of your average Klingon. It starts with high-school and then follows a young Klingon through college, working life, dating, marriage and having children of his own. There's purple blood and batleths a-plenty!\nYou can see more of the Secret Lives of Kliingons (not including alternate endings and deleted scenes that will be included in the book), on the official Woohooligan website.\nNOTE: Yes, Kliingons is misspelled because this is a fair-use parody and we need to differentiate it from official Star Trek products.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhile researching book options we discovered the ISBN system is kind of ridiculous. You can get a single ISBN, but the cost of just two is the same as a block of ten. Every version of a book (eBook, print, 2nd edition, etc.) must have a separate ISBN, so why would anyone buy just one?! Create-Space offers some deals, but you can only sell books with their $10 ISBN through their approved channels and their ISBN for sales elsewhere isn't discounted enough to matter.\nWe're publishing 3 eBooks now and more print books later, so ten ISBNs is the most cost-effective solution. We also hope you'll enjoy this early opportunity to be a part of the Woohoolisphere with our first Kickstarter. More Kickstarter projects for print books will follow soon, using ISBNs out of this block. For now we're focused on the eBooks to get our feet wet and get to know you wonderful hooligans and backers.\nThe $300 target for this campaign covers the $250 for the block of ten ISBNs, plus a little for shipping hand-drawn original art to backers at the $20 level, and a few dollars for the Kickstarter fees.\nThe Rewards\nMUG SHOT: (NEW) We've added a new reward level at $8 called the MUG SHOT where I'll draw a carricature of you or a friend in an upcoming Woohooligan comic. Obviously they will be in my typical comic style, with rubbery arms, knobby elbows, large, usually somewhat rounded heads, etc.\nWOOHOOLIGAN: At the $50 WOOHOOLIGAN reward level you'll get a whole page of your own art and text in the book, so you'll get to decide what that will look like... within reason. We're not going to allow outright porn, religious, political or drug manifestos or something that promotes violence against children or women... man, this list could get long... Work with us, we're reasonable people. :)\nOne of those rewards has already been taken, so there's only 2 left right now! The first was taken by Alejandro Lee who's been working diligently for the past 4 years on an awesome webcomic called the Ballad of Sally Sproket and Piston Pete! Here's an example of his work and what you can expect his page will look like.\nIsn't that some kick-ass art?! So you'll be in good company when you back the project! :)\nCREDIT: For most of you awesome hooligans we think you want to have a URL to your own comic or project in our books. If you just want your name, that's fine too, but for those of you who want a link, this is what we plan for those to look like.\nThis is essentially what the credits will look like. As you can see, your name won't be buried in a generic list, it will stand out and give you a chance to grab the reader and let them know what your comic or project is about. These blurbs are taken from the sites of several awesome hooligans who've already backed the project. Once it's funded, we'll ask everyone to provide their own teasers for the credits, so you'll get to decide how your project is represented.\nStretch Goal!\nAt $370 we'll print some 12x13 glossy posters of this single-panel satire:\nWhen we meet this goal, all the backers at the $20 level will get a signed copy of this poster mailed in addition to their hand-drawn original illustration.\nThanks for your awesome support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the art for the books is ready, in fact we've already laid out most of Woohooligan Presents: The Secret Lives of Klingons. That was done in a day and it only needs a couple of quick sketches of \"deleted scenes\" and the ISBN and then it will go out to all you amazing backers before we put it up in our store. The other two books are similar, although they're a little longer and will take a little longer to lay out. \n\nThe only real challenges I foresee would be potential clerical errors in getting the ISBNs (which I really don't expect) or potential formatting problems in putting the other two books together or potentially the same in printing the posters if we reach that stretch goal. Either of these would be minor hiccups that I'm sure would be easily overcome.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "New Project: Laugh It Forward! - March 6th", "update_content": "It's been a long ride and it's not quite over, but it's wrapping up soon! :D \nI've started on those original illustrations for the four of you who backed at the higher level and the original goal of having three new ebooks online is now a success!

Barrie as a play in 1904 and then as a novel in 1911, Peter Pan is a timeless tale that is widely known and loved. Despite this, much of the original book has been left out of many of the more modern adaptations. This is the reason, as well as the book being my all-time favorite ever, that I decided to make my adaptation.\nWhile I hope this rendition will be enjoyable for anyone who would read the book, I've drawn the manga for teens and young adults, as well as for those of us in adulthood who enjoyed the story as children, and would like to relive the story again.\nThe novel is in public domain, which allows me to publish this comic. However, as J.M. Barrie gifted the rights originally to Great Ormond Street Hospital, I will be including a short history on the hospital and Barrie\u2019s gift written by Christine De Poortere, the Peter Pan Director at GOSH.\nVolume one will contain chapters 1-3 of the webcomic (Chapters 1-4 of the novel). The total page count is not precise, as stretch goals and so on may add extra content to the book, but there will be at LEAST 170 pages in the book!\nI updated the art and the paneling of the first two chapters, as I have greatly improved since I first drew them. The book will also contain 11 entirely new pages that will have more information on the Darlings. These pages will not be posted online, so the only way to read them will be by getting the book. Depending on if the kickstarter does well, more may be added to the book... ^_-\nI have been asked if I will continue to adapt the comic past this first volume of the manga, and the answer is: of course! I intend to adapt the entire original novel as loyally as possible, as well as expanding on a few adventures that Barrie talks about in the book, but doesn't go into great detail about. So, never fear, this project will be continued and, if this kickstarter is successful, more books will be released!\nIf you'd like a little insight into the comic, please check out LOOM's review of the comic.\nElaine Tipping is located in Nishio, Japan, with her husband and two cats. In addition to her Peter Pan adaptation, she and writer Ben Hsu formed Tiny Blue Dragon Studio where she also is the artist for Dubious Company and Licensed Heroes. She is finishing up her last year studying manga with Kodansha, drawing full time, and teaching English part time. In her spare time (of which there is little) she reads manga, plays video games, and does whatever new hobby she\u2019s discovered. (no, seriously, she needs to stop getting new hobbies). Last year, she ran a successful kickstarter for her slice-of-life comic about living in Japan. The finished book can be found on Amazon.\nFirstly, if you pledge within the first 24 hours of the kickstarter, you will receive a Special Early Bird Print!! ^_^ This is the only chance to get this image, it will not be posted anywhere online, and only the people in the first 24 hours will receive it ^_^ *NOTE: as the first 24 hours of the kickstarter is over now, this offer is no longer available. Congrats to those Early Birds who pledged in time to get the reward! ^_^*\n**New Limited reward! When we reach the goal, anyone who is currently a backer will get a special \"goal met\" gift added to their final rewards: a Peter Pan wallpaper for their computer and/or mobile device!. Anyone who backs after the pledge that helps us reach our goal will sadly miss out on this limited gift. **\nThere are a number of rewards to choose from, as you can see over on the right! All rewards are cumulative, unless stated otherwise. This means, if you get the $25 level reward, you not only get the book, but you also get your name in the book, a special Kickstarter-limited digital image and 5 bookmarks.\nIf you are located outside of Japan (ie. International to where I am) please include $10 for shipping for levels $25-$250. If you get level $550, that will need considerably more because of the doll's weight, so I would ask for $20 for shipping. This will assure that you get your package in a timely manner!\nMore details on the $40, $80 and $550 reward levels: \nAnyone who pledges the $40 level and up will have their version of the book upgraded to the special edition, which includes a character of your choice from Peter Pan drawn on a special sketch card, traditionally inked and colored with copic markers. To be clear, this is just an upgrade, so it will not net you two books. Though if you are interested in ordering more than one book, please contact me.\nAt $80, you will have the choice of three characters. Each character comes with their own unique items and art. At this level, you have a choice between 3 character sets:\nPeter\u2019s set includes: A key chain and a cell phone charm with Peter themed art, as well as a Peter themed friendship bracelet/anklet that can either be made to fit your wrist or ankle (I will ask for measurements), or it can be used as anything else you choose (if you don\u2019t give a measurement, I will make them all a standard length of 22 centimeters). \nWendy\u2019s set includes: A key chain and a cell phone charm with Wendy themed art, as well as a Wendy themed friendship bracelet/anklet. As stated above, I will ask for measurements, or use a standard length if you do not choose to give one. \nTink\u2019s set includes: A key chain and cell phone charm, as well as a Tinker Bell mini wind chime. All will contain Tinker Bell themed art.\nAt $550 I will make you a custom doll! Custom dolls are very popular in Japan and, while, many of them are kinda creepy, I\u2019ve found a brand that is very sweet. A custom doll will include: a doll whose hair has been cut and styled by me, a hand painted face, as well as hand sewn clothes and accessories. If you'd like to see an example of my doll work, here is my first doll!\n If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me!\nWe have quite a few cool stretch goals!\nStretch Goal 1: At $3,500, everyone who pledges for the special edition of the book will receive a special edition bookmark! This bookmark will have entirely NEW art on it, it will have a colored ribbon, and it will only be available through the kickstarter.\nStretch Goal 2: At 4,000, everyone will receive a high quality print of the cover art, which you can see below in the updates section. Anyone who pledges for items that require no shipping will receive this reward digitally.\nStretch Goal 3: At 4,500, everyone will receive a Map of Neverland! Have you ever wondered where the pirate ship lays at rest? Or where Mermaid Lagoon is? Here is your chance to have the whole island at your finger tips! Good for following along with the book too!\nStretch Goal 4: At 5,000, those of you who are getting any levels of the character sets will get an extra reward added into your character set choice(s)! This is the bookshelf buddies add-on! These will be chibi versions of the characters printed on thick paper with a thick paper stand that will allow them to perch on your bookshelf and decorate the area, keeping your books company!\nStretch Goal 5: At 5,500 This goal will add more pages to the book! I will do what are called \"omake\" comics, which will be 4 panel gag strips. I will take scenes from the first 4 chapters from the novel (3 chapters in the comic) and give them a silly, or fun, alternate ending! Nana unable to pull Peter's shadow away, sewing on the shadow working how it would in REAL life, Peter leaving too many leaves behind when he comes to visit so the whole nursery is filled with leaves, the flight to Neverland not QUITE going as expected... and so much more!\nStretch Goal 6: At 6,000 This level is a unique reward. It will be a recording of me reading aloud the first four chapters of the book! You will receive a digital version of this recording, as well as (for anyone receiving a package) a CD copy. Not many people know that I spent many years in the theatre (operettas and operas), and was actually accepted into the voice program at my University, but my love of Japan and art pulled me away from my other love of theatre. However, the skills still remain, and I hope you will all enjoy this goal! ^_^\nAnd if we fund all the stretch goals, don't worry, that's not the end, there is the possibility for even more stretch goals!\nThe first comic was posted in September of 2011 and has been running since then. The comic updates twice a week, on Sundays and Wednesdays.\nYou can read the comic online at the following places:\nSmackjeeves\nManga Magazine \nDeviant art\nCrunchyroll\nYou can also follow the comic\u2019s facebook page where I post new pages, quotes from the book, and other peter pan related things.\nThe music in the video is \"Darkest Child\" and \"Five Armies\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nCheck out the \"Kicking it Forward\" movement here to find other great projects! http://kickingitforward.org\nThis is where art for rewards, and other kickstarter related things, will be posted! If you are a backer, I will inform you when art is posted here with an update ^_^ Enjoy!\nFirst up, some of the bookmarks! This is the front of these bookmarks, they are double sided and will have something pretty on the back as well ^_^. The coloring style is a little different than some of my other art, since I've been trying out a technique that makes my digital art look like copic markers, so I hope you enjoy!\nAnd the next set of bookmarks! Tiger Lily and Hook will the the front an back of a bookmark, so a total of five bookmarks.\nNext up, the cover art for volume 1! This is not the whole cover, it is just the picture that will be featured on the cover. Hope you like it! ^_^\nWondering what the art will look like for the character sets? Well, here are the images that will be on the keychains! The backgrounds will vary depending on character (this is just an internet display background), but the super cute characters will definitely be there ^_^ Remember, this is just the art for the keychains! The cell phone charms, and the windchime, will all have totally new and sweet art on them!\nIf you'd like to see a larger version, check my Deviant Art account!\nAs you know, there will be new pages in chapter 1, and they will only be available in the book! Here is a little preview of one of the pages, so you can see a little of what I want to bring you ^_^\nYet another part of a reward revealed! This is for the colored manga page reward, and this is one of the two pages that will be colored! The other's is Hook's, and his is a two page spread. Enjoy! A larger version can be seen on my DA account.\nPosting a few of the pieces that will be in the art book. These, plus all the art in my colored character art gallery (as well as never before seen character designs, artists notes and an insight into my comic process) will all be in the art book! Hope you like these previews! ^_^\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe last kickstarter I ran, I hit a bump with my printer.

The idea behind the comic is simple: he's a super hero with a super beard. That's right, a super beard! The idea started when I wanted to dress up as a super hero for Halloween, but I realized there weren't a lot, if any, super heroes with beards. So I took upon myself to not only create one, but to make his beard the source of his powers. As you can probably tell, this isn't the typical super hero comic we're trying to make here. It's a more humorous take on the genre.\nA sample page from the comic (work in progress)\nI've been working on the characters and the story for over a year, and Kate has been doing the artwork along with me. We've completed one issue of the comic so far, which has been self published and sold at local conventions. This Kickstarter will help us fund a small print run of the second issue in the series.\nSo you may ask, \"What kinds of things can Facebeast do with his beard?\" Well, he can control his beard in any way imaginable. Think of it as a shape shifter. It can grow on command and be used to grab, punch, whip, tie, smack, cover, spank and so on in that fashion. In addition to the beard, Facebeast also possesses great strength for when the beard fails him. As for our hero's mission, he vows to protect his native city of Tampa, FL by fighting crime, defending justice, and helping citizens in need with his mighty beard.\nA sample page from the comic (work in progress)\nA page from Facebeast #1!\nIssue 2 of Facebeast will tell his origin story: who he is, where he came from, and how he got his powers. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but I can say that we've come up with some really cool ideas for the series as a whole. Right now we have 5 additional issues planned out, with the script and artwork already started. These issues will introduce a trio of super villains to the Facebeast Universe. These villains include the Sci-Czar (an ex-Russian terrorist turned renegade hair stylist), the Grammar Hammer (an evil English professor who punishes those with poor grammar), and The Librarian (a dedicated enforcer of Library Law who seeks to punish delinquents of the public library system). Once these issues are complete we are interested in expanding the series with even more issues if we can get a big enough following.\nSome samples of Kate's artwork! You can get a commission done through select rewards!\nA painting Kate made of Dexter. You can get a painting commissioned in the $325 reward!\nIn the longrun I would like this to be an ongoing comic series with three or four issues released a year, but it all starts with issue 2. That's where our backers come in. The money made from this Kickstarter will help us fund the printing  of the first run of the second issue. After issue 2 is printed we plan on promoting it hard in 2013 in a convention tour. Any money we make over our initial goal will go towards more conventions this year and printing more\nissues of the comic.\nA Facebeast t-shirt goes to every backer who pledges $30 or more!\nStretch goal #1 - $2,000 - If we hit this stretch goal, everyone who pledges $15 or more gets a physical copy of the out-of-print Facebeast #1. Everyone is already getting a PDF of our beloved first issue, but if we hit $2,000 I will pay for another print run and send a copy to everyone who pledges $15 or more!\nStretch goal #2 - $3,000 - If we hit this stretch goal, everyone who pledges $15 or more gets both the first issue and the THIRD issue when it is completed. This is the issue where we will introduce our first super villain, the Sci-Czar! As of right now the release date is unknown, but we are shooting for a fall/winter 2013 release.\nStretch goal #3 - $4,000 - If we hit this stretch goal, everyone who pledges $15 or more gets the first, third and FOURTH issue when it is completed.
