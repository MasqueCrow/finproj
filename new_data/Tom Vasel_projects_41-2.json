With enough funding, we will be able to secure land to grow our habanero crop. Controlling the process allows us to bring you the best habanero peppers in Vietnam!\n\nWe are currently working diligently with NON-GMO and bodies in order to expedite the process of obtaining our certifications. One of our risks is not being able to meet the deadline for certification prior to our first delivery.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, our product is manufactured in Vietnam - so one of our largest challenges would be meeting our deadline for delivery. Many factors can affect this process - a long lead time, overseas shipping and general delays from the importing process. We are more than qualified to tackle these issues should they arise, as we deal with them regularly.\n\nWe are up for this spicy challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Habanero Ginger Sriracha", "descp": "Receive One (1) Bottle of Fix Habanero Ginger and Twenty-Five (25) Habanero Ginger- To go Packets", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["34 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce", "descp": "Receive One (1) Bottle of Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["9 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce", "descp": "Receive One (1) Bottle of Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["3 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Fix Habanero Ginger Sriracha (x2)", "descp": "Receive Two (2) Bottles of Fix Habanero Ginger Sriracha, Fifty (50) Fix Habanero Ginger Sriracha To-Go Packets", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["21 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce (x2)", "descp": "Receive Two (2) Bottles of Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["5 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce (x2)", "descp": "Receive Two (2) Bottles of Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 27 or more", "title": "The Fix 3 Pack (Most Popular)", "descp": "Receive One (1) Bottle of Fix Habanero Ginger, One (1) Bottle of the Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce, One (1) Bottle of Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce, Twenty-Five (25) Habanero Ginger Sriracha To-Go packets", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["206 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 27 or more", "title": "The Fix 3 Pack (Most Popular) - Canada", "descp": "Receive One (1) Bottle of Fix Habanero Ginger, One (1) Bottle of the Fix Hot Chili Pepper Sauce, One (1) Bottle of the Fix Hot Hoisin Sauce, Twenty-Five (25) Habanero Ginger Sriracha To-Go packets", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only Canada"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (96 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Build Your Own 3 Pack", "descp": "Build your own 3 Pack.\nChosen, Customized and selected by you.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Since 2013 we have been crafting our Bourbon Barrel Aged Maple Syrup in collaboration with Central Waters Brewing Company. The rich flavors imparted by the bourbon barrels brought B&E\u2019s syrup beyond the breakfast table into culinary and cocktail spaces.\nEmbark Adventure Packs: Salted Maple; Salted Coffee Maple; Elderberry Maple\n We are once again moving maple into new spaces with the launch of Embark. Eric\u2019s lifelong love of endurance athletics and multi-sport adventures has lead him to try a variety of commercially available energy gels. He found the flavors synthetic, textures awkward, and he never wanted to use them unless he absolutely had to- he just didn\u2019t feel good about what he was putting in his body.\nZion Adventures; Photo credit Ethan Brodsky\nBeing the curious type, he began researching what his body really needed for sustained energy and performance, and found that maple syrup had superior performance nutrition and longer-lasting energy than what was available, plus the flavor was amazing!  The idea for Embark was formed.\nEmbark at the Westby Ski Jump; Photo credit Justin VerMeer\nEmbark Adventure Packs are pouched maple syrup combined with a few simple, organic ingredients to provide clean nutrition and outstanding flavor for ultra-athletes, everyday adventurers and culinary explorers. The flavors were developed with the help of a panel of professional chefs, foodies and brewers; a parallel panel of endurance athletes tested the performance. After a year of development, Embark is nearly ready to get out of the kitchen and onto the trail.\nWe will be launching with three flavors:\n Salted Maple- \nIngredients: Organic Wisconsin Maple Syrup, Sea Salt\nSalted Coffee Maple- \nIngredients: Organic Wisconsin Maple Syrup, Organic Wonderstate Coffee, Sea Salt, Organic Green Tea Derived Caffeine (24 mg Caffeine per fl-oz, 72 mg total per Adventure Pack)\nElderberry Maple- \nIngredients: Organic Maple Syrup, Organic Elderberry Juice (concentrated), Sea Salt\nTo make it to the finish line - and to shelves and online retail - B&E need a little help from you. This Kickstarter campaign will pitch in with some of the upfront expenses involved in making a new product - packaging, equipment upgrades, and those organic ingredients like coffee that we can\u2019t grow on our Wisconsin farm.  Kickstarter backers will get the first pouches off the line, and have a myriad of Driftless adventures as available rewards.\n\nBut this project is bigger than the product itself.  It's about using the good energy of our forest to build a better future.  Our farm is situated at the headwaters of the nation's first Watershed Project, and we're carrying forward the tradition of learning from and caring for the land through our sustainable business practices and community involvement. \n\nAs a 1% for the Planet member, we're also able to have an impact beyond our farm.  By supporting the environmental efforts of others, we're empowering communities to create inclusive outdoor spaces so we can all explore and connect with the remarkable world in which we live.  Embark is re-envisioning what is possible, not just for maple syrup, but for our communities, and for the world.\n\nLet's EMBARK together!\nThank you from B&E!\nThanks to Jennifer Rodriguez Moran of Acorn Hill Studio for the cover photo!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTrying something new always involves risks. \nSince we started our farm we have faced- and overcome- many obstacles. Our first syrup season was the worst maple production year in recorded history, so we began developing ways to sell & market our products directly that increased awareness & opportunities for maple syrup. We focused on innovation & experience instead of competing against friends & neighbors on price. A catastrophic flood wiped out our roads and washed away our sap collection equipment- we built bridges, improved infrastructure, and rebuilt our trails in a sustainable manner to better weather the next storm. COVID cancelled in-person events, our largest source of revenue; we spent almost a year developing Embark so we could bring the good energy of our forest directly to you. Resilience is built into the very fabric of who we are as people and as a company.\n\n\nPotential Risks & Challenges:\n-Supply Chain Disruptions causing delays:\nOne of the biggest challenges we have faced are supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic, which may result in production delays. All of our ingredients we have either produced directly on our farm or have built relationships with other producers to secure the quality & quantities needed for our launch. There are some factors, such as packaging timelines, that are beyond our control. If any delays do occur, we will stay in constant contact with our backers, and will have your adventure packs to you as soon as they are available. Above all, we will stand behind delivering a quality experience.\n\n- Reward Fulfillment Delays:\nOver the years we have developed efficient order fulfillment systems for our current line of maple syrup, and we are well prepared to meet the shipping demands we anticipate with this project. There is the potential that this project is successful beyond our wildest dreams and we need an extra few days to get everything shipped. If this happens we will redirect our crew to making sure everything is shipped as soon as possible.\n\n- Scheduling Conflicts & Weather Variables\nWe are extremely excited to share our beautiful forest with everyone who chooses an Embark Experience reward. We will have a schedule of available times for you and your group to visit the farm, and will do everything we can to accommodate your scheduling preferences, but it is possible that you may not get your first choice weekend, or that the weather is not what you hope for. In the event of weather cancellations we will do our best to reschedule a time that works for you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "First Taste!

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

We have limited resources to deal with shipping issues and do not wish to make commitments we are unable to keep. \nWe are also unable to ship to PO Boxes. \nThe countries we can not ship to are:\nSouth America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela, Falkland Islands, French Guiana, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Trinidad & Tobago\nAsia: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uzbekistan, Yemen\nEurope: Russia, Ukraine \nNorth America: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nNorth American Islands: Anguilla, Aruba, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Clipperton Island, Curacao, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, Navassa Island, Saba, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands\nAfrica: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe\nOceania: Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu.

Leroy is Chef Brandon's grandfather and cooking inspiration.  Leroy modestly listed his occupation as chef, but he was much more than that.  He grew up in Aiken, South Carolina and began his career in the food business at the Commercial Hotel in 1943.  He later worked at the Henderson Hotel, helping to establish its buffet that became famous throughout the Aiken area and beyond.  In 1957, with the closing of the Henderson - it became the home of Palmetto Federal - he went to work at the Augusta National Golf Club.  There he had the honor of serving such delicacies as quail and homemade biscuits to President Dwight Eisenhower.\nLeroy had an incredible impact on his family and those is in his path.  Later in his career, he would return to Aiken to work for Joan Tower as a manager of her estate.  \"He worked hand in glove,\" Ms. Tower said. \"He was extremely capable - he could do anything. He was a gentleman - kind and generous in every way.\" His son commented on the impact Leroy had by challenging him to \"be somebody, to be the best at what you do.\" He went on, \"He cooked and catered for many local celebrations including weddings, golf outings, polo matches, family reunions, luncheons and dinners. Dad had the enviable privilege of earning his living by doing what he enjoyed doing.\"\nWe aim to honor Leroy James Wright through the spirit of kindness, compassion, and a relentless pursuit of quality.\nThe BnB story began in the year 2000, when we (Brandon Wright and Brian Hinkey) met on the soccer fields in Nashville, TN. We were teammates that year for the professional soccer team Nashville Metros.  We were making about $800 bucks a month and we thought we had made it.  It was a wonderful time to make new friends and we had an amazing season and year.  Unfortunately, as it so happens, I would not return to Nashville after that season.  However, Brandon and I would not completely lose touch over the next twenty years.  We would randomly bump into one another through soccer events where we were coaching and staying active in the game.  \nEventually, Brandon moved to Richmond, VA and Brian to Suffolk, VA - about a 2 hour drive.  As we reconnected and were able to visit more easily, we discovered we both shared a love for grilling and preparing food.  Our cooking was yielding great results, but there was something missing.  We were using cheaper sauces and trying to doctor them up.  Finally, we agreed that we had to develop our own sauce.  We loved the ketchup based sauces and the sweetness in them, but we also loved the vinegar styles.  We agreed to create something that would be a perfect blend. As Brandon was in charge of the sauces in our backyard grill sessions, I challenged him to create something new from scratch.  Chef B created the sauce.  I tasted.  I loved it.  It was like nothing I had before and it had all of the elements of our favorite style sauces.  A new sauce was born.  It needed a new category.  We decided to call it - SAUS.  \nI just so happened to be getting married in August 2016 a short time after the Saus was created.  I am not one for a lot of formality so I decided I wanted to to do a big backyard cookout for my wedding party and any guest who could attend. This would serve as the \"rehearsal dinner.\"  I ran this by my now wife, Danielle. She being the angel she is, agreed to have a rehearsal dinner backyard barbecue.  I promised we would dress it up and it would be really nice.  All I needed was the right person to create the culinary delights I wanted.  There was only one person in my mind that could make this night special.  My teammate, friend, and brother - Chef B Wright.  Brandon agreed.  He was excited to debut the new Saus creation and to see the reaction from our guests.  Needless to say, the night was an incredible success.  Everyone loved the food and the Saus.  It was a wedding gift I will never forget and that day our business was born.  \nBnB Gourmet and Grill is a tale of friendship, respect, and love.  A true brotherhood. Food brings people together and we are a testament to that.  We are so proud to share our creation for all to enjoy.\nWe believe the Holy Spirit moves in all things.  When we live in the Spirit, that positive energy can transfer and flow through us.  It's with this belief that we hold ourselves to the highest standard possible when creating our products.  This is not just a business. This is our passion.  Our Saus experience will connect you with the past, connect you to your fellow man, and connect you to a new flavor. We are so grateful to share that with you.  \n\nRewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is an opportunity for you to give our Saus a try.

It\u2019s one that communicates clearly and efficiently, that plays to its strengths and knows when to step things up to grow bigger and better, and whose every action benefits other living things. What if your society was in danger? What if outside forces were chipping away at your little community faster than you could adapt to resist?\nNo, I\u2019m not asking you to imagine a human Utopia under siege. I\u2019m asking you to put yourself in the position of the humble, hardworking honeybee.\nMy name is George,  and I began keeping bees in the late 1990\u2019s when a  honey shortage impacted the home brew operations of a buddy and me. We started with a few hives to see if we could have some luck in producing our own honey, and that was apparently a fork in the road of my life.\nI learned all I could about bees and how to keep them healthy and protected. With our small-scale honey production in full swing thanks to those happy and healthy hives, we decided to think like bees and take a step up in 2015 to grow bigger and better.\nI was officially hooked on honey.\nYou could say I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with bees since then. They\u2019re fascinating and tireless little creatures who are driven to fulfill their life\u2019s purpose. Unlike dogs, bees aren\u2019t happy to see you at the end of the day; they\u2019re usually too busy with their tasks to even pay you much attention. Still, working with them so closely for so long almost makes you feel like part of their hives. I might have even picked up a few of their habits over the years.\nDay in and day out, we work to ensure that the bees have access to abundant food sources, water, sturdy frame boxes in safe areas, and everything else they need for good health and survival. Just like bees are determined to protect their hives from larger dangers, we work to protect them from the tiny or even invisible ones they may not be aware of like chemical threats and mites.\nThis care and keeping helps the bee population flourish, which is something absolutely essential in our modern ecosystem. We\u2019re working hard to try and rebuild the declining numbers of bees by providing their fundamental needs and guarding their health, but they pay us for our time and effort in heavenly honey.\nCommercial beekeeping is a labor of love, but it is still costly. Honey sales help to cover those costs and also allow us to maintain more hives. More hives means that more local agriculture can thrive, more garden vegetables and flowers are pollinated, more plant species have a higher chance of survival because of seed production made possible by that pollination, and the local economy benefits as a bonus.\nWhen most people think of uses for honey, they normally go straight to stirring it in tea or drizzling it on a biscuit. Those are definitely delicious options, but what if we could step it up a notch or two on the epicurean scale? It\u2019s hard to find a culinary partner that\u2019s comparable to the finest local honey, but gourmet chocolate filled the role elegantly. With batch after batch of chocolate-and-honey test treats disappearing faster than we could produce them, we knew we had something that we needed to share with the world. However, we also knew that there was big speed bump, so earlier this year we ran a successful Kickstarter with our chocolate covered honey.  We had to pause shipping due to the summer heat, but the orders will be completed by the end of September.\nDuring this pause, we played more in the kitchen, brought out old recipes,  and worked on bringing them to market.\nOne of the resulting products is Spicy Honey, or some call it Hot Honey.  Combining the heat from a mix of American grown peppers with the sweetness of our bees\u2019 honey, Spicy Honey is a condiment that energizes any meal.\nMarinades, glazes, and dipping sauces will come alive.  We offer mild, hot, and super hot sauces, all  Plus non-GMO, gluten free, and paleo friendly. Our sauces are a beautiful blend of pure honey and peppers, with nothing else added.\n\nFollowing  the amazing response to our chocolate covered honey, we expect customers to fall in love with our delicious Spicy Honey. However, there are costs associated with launching a new product. This is where you come in and help to work some magic.\nThis campaign is essential in raising the seed funds we need to cover the costs of branding and packaging design, marketing,  and to expand the number of beehives. Furthermore, any additional funds would be applied to purchasing a farm to provide ample space for our honeybee business to thrive. Your support will allow us to expand without having to dip into emergency funds set aside to protect the bees from weather anomalies, predator damage, and mite and illness prevention.\nWe\u2019re not just asking for your help; we also want you to be a part of something great. The benefits really do span the full feel-good spectrum!\nYou\u2019ll get to:\n\u00b7  Boost the bee population\n\u00b7  Nurture a growing small business\n\u00b7  Celebrate a natural resource\n\u00b7  Stimulate local agriculture\n\u00b7  Create something amazing\n\u00b7  Treat yourself to a pairing of two of the most delicious things on the planet.\nI sincerely thank you for your support and can\u2019t wait for you to taste your pledge rewards and become one of the Love of Honey (& Chocolate) tribe!\nWishing you the best,  George", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo risk, we have already developed the packaging design and product.

We have been blown away by the tremendous amount of support for our project! We are making tons (literally) of our seasoning and offering all flavors at a discounted rate through Kickstarter ahead of our e-commerce website launch. If you are on the fence, now is the time to order! \nZack & Lauren at Co-Packer\n OUR LABELS ARE IN! \ud83d\ude0d\nAbout\nHi my name is Zack! Thank you for taking a few moments to check out my project and (hopefully!) supporting me. I am on a mission to bring seasonings made with the Datil Pepper to market. \nWhat is a Datil Pepper? A Datil Pepper is a very hot, but fruity pepper from Saint Augustine, Florida with an amazing flavor profile. There are countless hot sauces made from the Datil Pepper, but very few seasonings.\nDatil Peppers\nHow it all started\nSeveral years ago, I decided to start growing Datil Peppers in my backyard to experiment more with the peppers. Through the growing, harvesting, processing and dehydrating, I created dry datil pepper powder that was fantastic for mixing in with other spices.\nThe second part to this story came from my dad. My dad has been making this amazing Cajun shrimp dish for the past 20 years. I have taken his recipe and tweaked it over the years to make my own delicious version. One of the main ingredients in that dish is Cayenne Pepper which is there to add heat. One night while cooking, I decided to swap out the Cayenne Pepper with Datil Pepper. I was blown away by the flavor, it was so good! I kept working on the recipe, making small adjustments and working towards perfection.\nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning in pan cooking, ready to add shrimp.\nOnce I had a desirable recipe down, I realized it was quite time consuming pulling all of the ingredients together to make it every time. What started out as batches, turned into giving small bags of it to friends and family who were blown away with the excellent flavor but tempered and enjoyable heat. \nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning in a bottle for the first time.\nIt's a hit!\nUnder Florida's Cottage Food Law, I was able to make a small, but large enough batch to bottle and sell, using my home kitchen and extremely limited resources. IT WAS A HIT, we sold out before we delivered the first one, and people were already asking for more and sending us photos of all the things they love it on. It was a watershed moment for us, giving us the confirmation and confidence to move forward with the ultimate goal of bringing Datilgator to grocery stores, restaurants, and consumers.\nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning packaged and sold for the first time, December 2019.\nMoving Forward\nWith the success of Datilgator Cajun Seasoning, and the amount of work required to bring it to market, we decided to add additional flavors that have been in the works. The road taking Datilgator from a literal hobby and turning it into a business has been quite the challenge. There are many, many steps to become a food manufacturer. From signing a lease at a commercial kitchen, to getting a Food Safe Serv Certifcate, and all the additional permitting and licensing. Some of the requirements aren't required until you cross a certain threshold in sales, however, many retailers and restaurants require all of these steps to be completed before you can sell, so we are doing it all the right way, first. \nWe have completed many of the steps already, but we need YOUR help to seal the deal for us and put us over the top. We have some really amazing rewards for our backers and at a discount from our suggested retail as a thank you for supporting us.  \n\nRewards\nOur Kickstarter closes right before Thanksgiving (finishes 11/19/20) and our goal is to have all rewards delivered for the holiday season.\nSeasonings\nWe are offering all 6 of our seasonings, plus a seventh that is just Datil Pepper Powder. All of our seasonings come in a nice, large (8oz by volume), square, glass bottle. You can read more about them in the rewards section.\nDatilgator Seasoning Line Up + Datil Pepper Powder\nDatilgator VS. The Competition\nProducts\nTo make things interesting, we have added three additional, non-food products that we feel are a great fit with the Datilgator Seasoning line. See photos below and find more details in the reward section.\nHand made cutting board made from reclaimed standing Red Oak.\nTri-Blend soft fabric Datilgator T-Shirt\nDatilgator Kitchen Apron\nExtras\nAs an extra twist for local backers (Jacksonville/St. Augustine Florida) I am offering, as a reward, me coming to your home to cook some fantastic Datilgator recipes for your friends and family. I have happy hour and full dinner options available. More details in the rewards section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStarting a food manufacturing company is hard, like really hard. As the saying goes, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. The biggest risk is failing to meet our goal, and all of the legwork we have put in mapping out our plan comes to a screeching halt.\n \nOther risks include:\nOur suppliers not having all the ingredients we need.\nOur bottle, label, and cap suppliers being out of stock with those parts.\nAdditional costs that weren't accounted for or accurately accounted for.\nBringing the seasonings to scale, and manufacturing on a larger level than we ever have before.\n\nThe great news is I have created, launched, and successfully grown businesses before and I am well aware of how to functionally run a business.

However, it would not have been possible without the support of 13 of your favorite publishers who partnered with me to see their logo, as well as their most popular games turned into handmade component mosaics. Whether you want to brighten up your kitchen, geek up your office so you can have your co-workers ask you about board games, or spruce up your game room - this is the perfect calendar for you. \nEvery image I create takes between 3 to 8 hours to assemble. Sometimes I use a reference image to help me with proportions, but I also like to go with the flow for some creations. I begin the process by choosing the colors I need from the game boxes I know contain the right pieces. Once I have the correct components, I plan out where each part will go. As I carefully lay the pieces I am constantly moving them into just the right place! I use a pencil to move pieces in tight areas because it helps with precision. Photographing each image takes almost an hour. Depending on which pieces I have used for the mosaic, the angle of the lighting needs to be adjusted. There is a lot of trial and error when taking the shots, and climbing up a chair over top of my gaming table is time consuming! \nPLAY\n\n\nEvery month has a component mosaic of a well-known board game as the main image, as well as a mosaic of that publisher's logo.\nThere is a write up about the publisher, including their website so you can check out their games.\nThe calendar includes a section to write the games you played during the month.\nAt the end of the calendar, you will find a 10x10 challenge page!\n\n\nPLAY\n\nYou asked for prints, coasters and magnets; so here is your chance! When you manage your pledge in Crowd Ox, you will have the opportunity to add the following: \n set of 4 Wingspan-inspired coasters (*Not an official Stonemaier Games product) These coasters are 3 mm thick, made of hardboard with a glossy finish, and have a cork underlay so they do not scratch your furniture.\n$US17 / $C23 for the set \n Alternate set of 4 coasters \n\n 8\"x 8\" and 12\"x 12\" photo quality prints for your game room! (frame not included)\n$US10 / $C14 for the small print and $US15 / $C20 for the large \n 10 assorted magnets (2.5\" x 2.5\" approximately) \n $US15 / $C20 for the set \nThe shipping will be added in the pledge manager when you finalize your transaction.\nFirst of all, I want to thank the gaming community and all its members who have supported me since the beginning. Thomas Covert (BGR), I am so grateful for your friendship, your advice and support. I would not be where I'm at in the gaming industry without you. Blake Howatson, thank you for putting up with a messy game room for me to do my art and thank you for your support in this project and for tolerating my grumpy days. Marc Specter (Grand Gamers Guild), thank you for being such a good friend and for all your advice on the campaign. Daryl Andrews, Rob Byers and Steve Robertson, thank you for lending me games for components I needed but did not have. Helaina Cappel(Burnt Island Games), thank you for you help with the campaign. Thank you to all the Instagram friends I have made over the past few months who have shared my work on their social media. To those who created content to help spread the word about my work: Angelica Lazary (Married Meeples), Katia Dupras (Meeple QC), Jonathan Flike(Atomic Automaton), The Lonestar Meeple podcast, Board Game Halv, Bjorn Ottevaere, Chris Goodlet (The Charity Board Gamer), Conor McGoey (Inside Up Games), David Abadie (Patate des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres), Adam Singer (Shelf Clutter Games) and I'm sure I forgot some, I am forever grateful.  Last but not least, thank you to the 13 publishers who joined in on this project, and for also sending games to make sure I would have pieces to represent you in my work. Without you, this calendar would not have been possible. \nI will send a survey within the next 2 weeks, using the CrowdOx pledge manager system, to the email address associated with your Kickstarter account.

The Founders and Lords will continue to bring you weekly, high quality, irreverent nonsense about tabletop gaming and more.\nThe goal of this campaign is to ensure that The Secret Cabal continue producing weekly audio and video tabletop gaming media. To do this to full capacity we need to raise enough funds to keep Jamie in the full-time position of producer and editor of our content.  Below are just a few of the audio productions and videos that we plan to produce in 2020 - and the list doesn't end there! Check out my video talking about our plan for 2020. \nPLAY\n\n\n\nShipping Costs\nShipping is the most difficult part of running any Kickstarter. We are running this project to facilitate making as much content as we can and too many campaigns have been sunk by botched shipping. Each pledge level including physical rewards (Except the all-in pledge) will have a shipping and handling cost added to it. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING FOR ADD-ON ITEMS. All add-on items will have individual shipping added based on size, weight and destination.\nUS Shipping: $6 ($5 for just promos)\nCanadian Shipping: $13 ($10 for just promos)\nEverywhere Else: $16 ($15 for just promos)\nIMPORTANT: Double Secret Grand Master: ALL-IN shipping will not be charged during the Kickstarter but will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager based on it's destination. This pledge will require multiple shipments from different points of origin and will be determined in the same manner as if each item was add-on in the pledge manager. For international backers of this pledge level, please see note below regarding Game Topper Mats.\nIMPORTANT: Game Topper Mats and International Shipping. All pledges and add-ons including Game Topper Mats being shipped outside of the United States and Canada will be VERY expensive due to the size, shape and weight of the item. We're talking $60+. Please be aware of this when deciding to pledge for a Game Topper Mat.\nShipping For Add-Ons\n   In the post-campaign pledge manager, shipping costs will be added per add-on item based on size and destination.\nWe very much appreciate your understanding as we are attempting to minimize our risk and make sure you get all your goodies!\nWhy No Backer Dinners This Year?\nAs you know, convention season is up in the air, and it looks like most of the summer conventions and likely all of the fall conventions will be canceled. Because of this uncertainty, we have decided not to offer the backer dinners at this time. If an opportunity arises for us to host a backer dinner later in the year, we will consider how to handle it at that time.

All cards have abilities that can trigger powerful synergies, starting from Sanctuaries. \nSanctuary cards have two tracks. Aegis counter decreases when they get damage, while Splendor counter increases at every turn. \nWhen a Sanctuary has reached the maximum Splendor, it unleashes all of its power. \nWith your Essence Crystals, you can deploy your Acolytes to attack the opponent's Sanctuaries and defend your own. \nDuring the attack phase, Acolytes in attack position will face the opponent's in the defense position of each Sanctuary. When confronting each other, they count the Damage they can deal, and if it's higher than the opponent's Health, they successfully destroy it. \nGet familiar with the attributes of your Acolytes. Some abilities trigger only in certain conditions and can make the battle more and more challenging! \nWhen the world of Elnerth was young, an ancient race of exiles landed there, in search for a new home. All the knowledge they brought with them has been lost over time, except for the discovery of the Fulcrum, which was fated to shape the ages to come.\nThe Fulcrum was a powerful source of energy, which kept flowing for years to nourish their prosperous civilization. This precious resource seemed to be nonperishable, until it became dangerously unstable. \nThe energy had been exploited for too long, without a deep understanding of its very nature. Its power to alter reality started to manifest, warping the surroundings of the Fulcrum in unpredictable ways. When the alteration became unsustainable, the world of Elnerth was cracked by a tremendous cataclysm, which shook the lands and changed irreversibly its fate.\nThe few survivors of the cataclysm needed to find a way to rebuild their world and prevent such events from happening ever again. One last glimpse of hope was to try and control the Fulcrum, if they couldn't put a permanent end to its activity. That's how the Disjunction took place. \nWith a great effort, the energy generated by the Fulcrum was split into six distinct parts, called the Essences. By doing so, it was possible to constrain the effects of all that power, while still being able to use it.\nEvery Essence was a shard of power, which could shape reality in its own way while giving back pure energy. Those who stepped forward to protect these dangerous treasures became known as the Keepers. \nThe Keepers brought the Essences far away from each other, in the devastated environment of a world on its knees. Isolated and eager to learn all the secrets of the energy they swore to preserve, they developed a deep bond with the Essences, leaving part of their humanity behind. \nTheir life was unnaturally prolonged, and the fears which were rooting in them from a desperate past poisoned their protective aims. They felt the need to safeguard the Essences in places they could defend from any possible threat, and that's how they built their Sanctuaries all over Elnerth. \nWhen the Keepers started their journey, the world of Elnerth was all new, with the bizarre natural environments formed after the cataclysms. \nEvery Sanctuary that appeared for the will of the Keepers was a way point for the Essences to spread their influence all over the surrounding lands. In the ages to come, new civilizations arose from the ashes of the Decay and they were all bound to their Sanctuaries. \nPeople of each region evolved with different physical and cultural traits, and they learned their own ways to exploit the resonance of each Essence. Some of those abilities were useful for the progress of their society, some others were weapons they would not hesitate to use to keep the Sanctuaries from any danger. \nThe Keepers Era is an era of war. Once the Keepers have established their dominion in every region of Elnerth, they started to see each other as a potential menace. \nThe truth was plain to see: only a Keeper can destroy another, and what would happen if there is only one Essence left? The answer is all in your hands.\nThe world of Elnerth is coming to life thanks to the work of our team of artists, picked after a very challenging selection. We wanted every card to represent a strong uniqueness, which is one of the most remarkable features of the game. It all starts with a story and every character, landscape or scenery has its own. \nThe brief goes to the illustrator with a detailed description of what's on our mind, which is a shard of the wide new world we imagined together. Then, the sketch comes through and when it's finally approved, the card is ready to come in play!\nIf interested, please feel free to contact us at retailers@tabula.games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter campaign, during these years we\u2019ve gained the expertise and know-how to confidently produce high quality games the way we envision them.\n\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases that can bring unexpected issues that may take some time to solve. For this reason the delivery date, March 2021, is an estimate. While we will do everything in our power to meet this date or even anticipate it, we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. Also, exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live.\n\nIf you have any question, concern or issue write to support@tabula.games and we will be happy to assist you.\n\nBy pledging for this project you accept the following terms:\n\nGeneral Terms:\n\n-This is not a pre-order and the final product may be subject to changes and improvements from what is presented here to ensure smoother production and logistics. This includes every aspect of the game, from miniature design to artworks and layouts.\n\n-We will only answer to support requests from our backers. If you got the game somewhere else (reseller, friend, group pledge, etc.) you will have to contact us through them.\n\n-After 30 days from the delivery date to your door, we will not accept complaints related to the game box contents of this campaign (missing components, damaged components, etc.).\n\n-After 6 months from the shipment date, we will not accept complaints related to the shipment of items of this campaign (damaged package, lost or missing contents, etc.).\n\n-After 12 months from the shipment date, we will not accept any complaints related to this campaign.\n\nRefunds:\n\n-An order can be canceled and fully refunded before the end of the campaign by clicking on the applicable button on Kickstarter.\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be canceled within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. Please note that in this case the refund will not include the processing costs and Kickstarter fees, which will be deducted from your total. Apart from the cases specified here, the order is considered valid and is not refundable.\n\nShipping:\n\n-It\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to respond to our post-campaign survey to claim your rewards and to give us information about your shipping address and add-on choices. If you ignore our Last Call notification for more than 4 weeks we will consider your pledge a donation and we won\u2019t be able to ship you a reward.\n\n-One week after our Address Lockdown notification we will lock all your address and forward all delivery information to our fulfillment partners and this mean we will be unable to make any kind of change to your address. If you think your address might change during the delivery period we advise you to have the game shipped at another address you trust (friend, relative, workplace, etc.).\n\n-If the game fails to arrive because of your mistake (wrong address, recipient absent, failure to pick up at courier/postal warehouse, etc.), any additional shipping/warehousing cost for us to re-send/re-deliver your game will be your responsibility. This also includes the costs associated with returning the game. If after investigation it becomes clear that the error was on our part, we will resend your package at our expense.\n\n-If the package is lost, destroyed or damaged, the carrier will be held solely responsible. Any customer claim to the carrier needs to be made at the time of delivery, not later. If the package seems damaged, please ask the postal carrier to make you a receipt \"accepted with reserve\".\n\n-Please note that we will not reship any game without first investigating what happened to the first shipment.\n\n-If your game arrives with missing or damaged components, provide us with proof and we will substitute them once we have verified the damage.\n\n-We currently have agreements with our fulfillment partners to ensure that no custom taxes will be charged for shipments in USA, EU, CA, AU. However if between the end of our campaign and the start of fulfillment governments decide to impose new tariffs or taxes about imports we might be forced to adjust to the new policies.\n\n-If you live outside of the USA, EU, CA, AU customs taxes may be added.

Romero\u2019s 1968 horror film with the electrifying gameplay of CMON\u2019s major board game hit Zombicide, to create this modern classic. \nTake on the role of the original survivors and try to make it through the NIGHT!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all and also possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. \nWe also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                  Night of the Living Dead \u2122 & \u00a9 Image Ten, Inc.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Tentacle Town still needs saving! Make a Late Pledge.\nAlready a backer?  Click the banner below to go to the pledge manager.\nWe will send a survey to the e-mail associated with your Kickstarter account after the campaign ends using the CrowdOx pledge manager. You will verify your pledge, choose any add-ons you\u2019d like to include with your reward, and provide your shipping information at that time. We\u2019ll also be collecting the balance of your pledge at time, including add-ons and shipping costs. If you change your shipping address before your rewards ship, you will be able to access your survey and update your information. If you need to retrieve your survey and access the Pledge Manager, just click the Receive Your Rewards banner!\nIn Tentacle Town, you're building a new town and competing to become mayor \u2013 all while the town is attacked by giant tentacles!  Gamers of all ages will enjoy Tentacle Town. Games usually take 45-60 minutes, so it's easy to fit in a game. \nTentacle Town introduces new gamers (of any age!) to a variety of board game mechanics: action selection, resource management, engine building, and area control - all with plenty of strategy for veteran gamers!  Different Task cards can be combined in over 1,000 ways to make sure each game brings a new strategic challenge (or leave 'em in the box for an even easier to teach intro game).  \nTentacle Town re-imagines worker placement: instead of claiming an action on, you\u2019re putting a new resident to work completing tasks or building a new building - but that new resident doesn\u2019t belong to you! Many of the tasks depend on how many residents are in the district or how many buildings you\u2019ve built. Plus, the more residents a district has, the more fame the district is worth at the end of the game.\nThere isn\u2019t a break in the action until the game ends. Your choices aren\u2019t blocked by new residents, so the turns can keep going quickly with a minimum of frustration. Plus, you can spend gold to complete additional tasks, adding a layer of strategy to gameplay.    \nAttacking tentacles may kill residents, destroy buildings, spawn more tentacles, or cause residents to flee. But fear not! You can defend your new home with harpoons, or hunt tentacle from the docks! When you kill a tentacle, you both reduce the threat to the town and score yourself some sweet fame and (sweeter) calamari!\nThe end of the game is also exciting: Whenever the Tentacles kill someone, the next player gets one more turn \u2013 so you never know exactly when the game is going to end.\nWant a video rundown of how to play?

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible.

That means we've built this campaign with one thing in mind; you, the backer! Your pledge will help us run those huge communities and bring you more awesome opportunities like this one!\nWe're offering what we believe is a great package of promos for some of your favorite games and at great prices too! Throughout the campaign, we will hold community polls, livestreams, and various updates to keep everyone involved and informed.\nCreating content for these groups has become a full-time job (which we love!), and we feel lucky to be in a position where we can offer promo cards from various publishers that support us in part due to the relationships and business partnerships we have built over the course of a few years. We'd like to thank all the amazing publishers who have come alongside us to support Promo Paradise!\nWe spend a lot of time cultivating our groups. This helps us provide fun, engaging content such as livestream playthroughs and interviews with designers, publishers, and content creators. We often travel to various conventions in order to foster new networks in the industry to bring you even more content to The Spotlight and Board Game Exposure.\nWith the money raised through Kickstarter, we hope to accomplish the following goals:\nBy pledging for this campaign, you're not only investing in upgrading the games you own but you're also investing in the lives of Martyn, Derek and Lizzy. Your support will allow them to achieve bigger dreams in the industry! If you're asking yourself, \"Why should I pledge?\" don't think about this campaign only in terms of promo cards, but rather, think about the communities the groups have formed and how much support they are to our ever growing hobby and industry. Both of these groups combine for nearly 20,000 board gamers around the world and they're still growing!\nIf you're not a member, why not join today and see what the fuss is about?

In the summer of 2017, they felt called to share their passion and love for the board game community. 2 years later, here they are, making this their full-time careers.\nLizzy and Derek wish to take The Board Game Spotlight to greater heights. They want to show the world the love they've developed and nurtured in their Facebook Group and to do that, they need your help!\nIn order to continue to share new, engaging, and fun content with the community, they're asking for you to join them in bringing positive, respectful, fun, and loving attitudes to tabletops worldwide.  #youarewelcomeatmytable\nMartyn started Board Game Exposure roughly 2 years ago - it's a group unlike any other where there is a solid mix of gaming industry professionals and board gamers. This gives people the chance to interact with the designers, publishers, and artists they know and love. With twice-weekly live interviews, competitions and news, this group is a great place to keep up to date on what's new and current in the board game world. \nMartyn wouldn't be where he is today without the help of the team of admins that assist him, as well as, reviewing the latest games and sharing their thoughts in the Board Game Exposure group. They do this for free and they have helped many first time publishers get noticed in the busy world of Kickstarter.\nMartyn is also co-designer of Robin Hood and the Merry Men which was a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018. He learned a lot about game design during the development and hopes to bring more ideas to life in the near future. \nWe understand as backers of campaigns that getting shipping right is important for a campaign.

Lang and with art by Adrian Smith is being turned into a full-fledged digital game by Exozet!\nFor $15 the base Digital Viking pledge gets you a copy of the Blood Rage Digital game. This is a special price for backers, as the game will eventually retail for almost twice as much. The Digital game is expected to launch in December 2019, though backers will be able to get access to a Closed Beta much earlier than that. Find out more about the digital game further down the page. \nIf your focus is the analog Blood Rage board game, however, you may be interested in the special $60 Physical Viking Pledge, which gets you not only a free copy of the Blood Rage Digital game, just as explained above, but also a slew of Kickstarter Exclusive promos to use with the Blood Rage board game! This includes new versions of the 4 Monsters only available in the original Kickstarter campaign, the brand-new Stag Clan (including their Mystics and Sculpted Clan Tokens), and also 24 Cards to add a 5th Player into the board game! \nThrough Stretch Goals this pledge level has been further enhanced with the addition of 3 brand new Monsters, 3 Sculpted Tokens, and 7 Golden Gods of Asgard, including the new Hel.\nWhile the Blood Rage Digital game is set to launch in December 2019, the physical promo items are expected to be delivered to backers beforehand, around August 2019.  \nFind out more about these Optional Purchases in the following links: Blood Rage Core Box, Playmat Board, Mystics of Midgard, Deluxe Gods of Asgard, Art Book, Cardboard Clan Dashboards, Sculpted Tokens, and Cardboard Age Track & Valhalla Tiles.\nBlood Rage Digital is set to faithfully recreate the amazing experience of the tabletop game inside your computer, available for both Windows and Mac OS in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. The universe of the board game has been recreated and adapted to the digital realm, taking full advantage of this new medium.\nPlease note all screenshots of the digital game are Work In Progress.\nMidgard comes to life.\nThe game will feature stunning visuals set to enhance your viking experience. The Midgard play area is brought to life, with waves crashing against the fjords as the gargantuan World Serpent endlessly circles the blue vastness. Each region has its own climate, topography, trees and villages. And at the center of it all stands a beautiful representation of the great Yggdrasil tree!  \nEach region has its own unique look.\nSome of the game's 3D assets.\nNetwork play will allow up to 4 people to play together, choosing their clans and battling for glory. Alternatively, the single-player mode will pit your wits against cunning AI opponents, with several different personalities/strategies you can choose from to experience different challenges. You can even mix things up, with both virtual and real opponents joining the fray.\nChoose your cards and join the battle!\nThe interface is slick an intuitive, so veterans and newcomers alike will be pillaging in no time, with the aid of tutorials and easily-accessible rules references. \nA region destroyed by Ragnar\u00f6k.\nSince Blood Rage first launched on Kickstarter back in 2015, it has solidified its place in the pantheon of must-have modern board games. However, since the vast majority of Blood Rage fans didn't discover the game until well after that initial campaign was over, they never had a chance to get the exclusive promos it contained. With this campaign for the Digital version of the game, we thought it would be a great opportunity to right that wrong. While the original promos will remain exclusive to that campaign, we've created alternate versions of them exclusively for the Physical Viking Pledge, with new names, art, and sculpts, but retaining the same gameplay characteristics.\nPlease note that to play with these promos, you will require a Blood Rage core box (for sale in retail).\nThe proud Stag Clan shows that viking women are every bit as fierce as the men. This set not only adds more diversity to your games, complete with sculpted Clan Tokens and Mystic figures (requires the Mystics of Midgard expansion to use), but it also comes with 8 extra cards for each Age, so that the board game can be played with 5 players! \nThe Stag Clan comes with everything you need to add it to your board game, expanding it to 5 players:\n1 Leader Figure\n8 Warrior Figures (featuring 2 different sculpts)\n2 Mystic Figures\n1 Ship Figure\n4 Sculpted Clan Tokens\n1 Glory Marker\n13 Small Colored Bases\n2 Large Colored Bases\n1 Clan Dashboard\n1 Mystic Reference Card\n24 5-Players Cards (8 for each Age)\nThe Golden Gods of Asgard is an exclusive deluxe version of the classic expansion, where the gods occupy different provinces, affecting the basic rules of the game and creating unique dynamics to each session of the game. The deluxe version includes resculpted, oversized, golden figures for each of the original gods, as well as Hel, a brand-new God of Asgard to carry on the original game effect of Hili, a previously released exclusive promo.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive  item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nPlease Take Note!\nThe Blood Rage Digital game will be distributed via Steam, by supplying backers with an access code, so there is no shipping cost involved for the Digital Viking pledge. However, note that any Optional Purchase added to the Digital Viking pledge will be shipped from our hubs normally, so shipping costs will be charged. Regardless of what is added to the pledge (if anything) the confirmation of the pledge will still be handled via the Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.\nFor the Physical Viking pledge, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a Physical Viking Pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates of the average cost per destination and actual costs may change in the pledge manager, specially if anything is added to your pledge.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $30-$40 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $25 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$35 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $40 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $40 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia\n\u2022 $40 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs and import taxes. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 35th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

As alien monsters react to the heroes' actions, no one is stuck playing the role of game master. But don't kid yourselves: the Crews are not working together at all! Only one intrepid Crew will be ultimately victorious, so players must battle each other as well as against monstrous enemies.\nSet in the same colorful universe as the highly-acclaimed Arcadia Quest game series, Starcadia Quest is an all-new standalone entry that draws from the electrifying gameplay from its fantasy counterpart, optimizes the experience, and takes it to a universe where no Hero has gone before!\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Build-a-Robot, Showdown, Zenith Invasion, Thornetroopers, Companion Pack, Crew Dice Bundle, Scenery Pack, Patty & Sherry,  Nayomi & Tanaka, Brandalyn & Jakob, Cury & Yuri, Plastic Token Pack, Wound Token Pack, Crew Dice, and Extra Dice.\nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nHeroes come from all quadrants of the Galaxy, each bringing unique abilities (not to mention their charming personality!) to their Crews. But it's not all fun and adventures in Space. Supreme Commander Thorne, a cold-hearted mastermind has assembled an army of some of the most nefarious creatures to do his bidding and the Alliance is the only thing standing in his way to bring \"order\" to the Galaxy.\nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nSpeaking of order, the introduction of a modular Monster dashboard allows players to deploy a variety of different monsters from Thorne's preposterous army, making each play session unique!\nIn Starcadia Quest, pre-game time is fast and simple. While the ancestral Arcadians resorted to books and scrolls, in Starcadia many elements of the board are conveniently displayed on the Game Tiles, and all information needed to prepare a scenario comes in a single Setup card, ensuring players are ready to roll in an instant! Plus, the latest Intergalactic Census shows a roaring approval for the added personality that each area of the space station now has, with their own tasteful decorations that provide neat game effects.\nWhile on their galactic exploits, players attempt to defeat enemies and collect shiny new gear while accomplishing Quests across a variety of scenarios that span a branching campaign that narrates the Crew's epic endeavor against Thorne. Quests have to be completed in Order, unfolding the story being played. Each scenario won takes the Crew one step closer to becoming the most notable, the most courageous - and of course - the most gallant Crew in the entire universe!\nThe final frontier can be a scary, unpredictable place at times. Like, at every turn. Literally. At the end of every turn, players draw and play Event cards, which not only activate or spawn monsters on the board (I did say it could be a scary place, didn't I?) but also introduce unexpected and wacky effects! The whole station may bump into an asteroid sending people flying all over the place and, occasionally, there may be an electrical failure that zaps those unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time!\nEver since the first fancy blades and armored vests were crafted in Arcadia, the Guilds have enjoyed the finest weaponry around. Fast-forward a few millenia and, well, that still holds true! The Crews have at their disposal the latest cutting-edge technology, from laser pistols to holo-swords. There's always new loot to seek that will appeal to everyone's tastes!\nThe Starcadia Quest core box comes with:\n30 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n10 Game Tiles\n10 Custom Dice\n8 Counter Bases\n4 Crew Dashboards\n4 Crew Shuttles\n1 Monster Dashboard\n220 Tokens\n77 Cards\n1 Campaign Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook \nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nWe invited Mark Streed, from The Dice Tower, to try out Starcadia Quest and give you all a brief overview of its rules:\nSpace can be a wild place, however,  and a pirate raid is always just around the corner!\nCaptain Wet Willy has an eye for a prize: YOUR prize! At last, all pirates are united under his black flag, and they really don\u2019t care much who they\u2019re looting today. The Starcadian battle against Thorne is exactly the distraction they needed to loot ALL THE THINGS!\nStarcadia Quest: ARRRmada is a plug-and-play expansion box that adds a whole new set of perils to the game. A gang of Pirate enemies have reached the Starcadian Alliance, and if left alone they will board the station, fire their turbo lasers, and loot all precious things!\nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nLuckily for the Alliance, two new intrepid Heroes have followed Captain Wet Willy and are ready to join the Crews!  \nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nThe most striking new feature of the ARRRmada expansion, however, is its brand new Pirate Corvette, a dashboard designed not only to hold cards and miniatures of enemies but also to track and activate the Pirate Assault cards, a special deck that governs the Pirates' dastardly actions against the space station!\nARRRmada is a modular expansion that can be plugged into and played with any other Starcadia scenario - but players must be extra careful when facing Pirates: for each Pirate Assault card that is activated while any Pirates are on the board, they will steal away some of the Upgrade tokens that would have otherwise been available loot for players!\nFeaturing a brand new Campaign with 6 new Scenarios against Captain Wet Willy and his mates, new Upgrade tokens and 3 new Game Tiles, ARRRmada offers a ton of new content to your Starcadia experience!\nARRRmada comes with:\n12 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n3 Game Tiles\n41 Cards\n22 Upgrade Tokens\n1 Pirate Corvette Dashboard\n1 Campaign Sheet Pad\nSpace Oddities Pledge - $80\nBackers with a Space Oddities Pledge will receive a copy of the Starcadia Quest core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Major Tomm, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nHaving floated around the galaxy in his \"tin can\" for many years of intense space action, fighting off monsters comes naturally to an ace pilot like Major Tomm. He's developed an extraordinary aim, which allows him to fire multiple shots if he gets lucky enough!\nMajor Tomm's resin figure.\nSpace Marauders Pledge - $120\nBackers with a Space Marauders Pledge will receive a copy of Starcadia Quest core box, the ARRRmada Expansion,  the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Major Tomm, the Kickstarter Exclusive Officer Crackin' Jim, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSiding with Wet Willy for decades, Crackin' Jim was once Willy's first mate, but upon taking their first prize, Jim got the step up and went on pirating merrily on his own. A trusted ally and friend of Willy's, Jim is known for his signature 'Grab n' sock' em' tentacly attack, which not only pulls Heroes in his line of sight close to him but also deals them some wounds for good measure. Oh, did I mention that he also triggers a Pirate Assault card if he kills a Hero? I did? Ok, good.\nCrackin' Jim's resin figure.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive  item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 33rd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is August 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde. A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game and Arcadia Quest: Riders are currently shipping to backers.\n\nWe have four ongoing projects currently: HATE, Zombicide: Invader, Arcadia Quest: Riders (Second Print), and Cthulhu: Death May Die, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Starcadia Quest.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Our creative team spent nearly a year developing this ultimate Cavern collection. We started with research, foam mock-ups and advice from our tooling experts, and designed organic forms and enveloping curves that go far beyond the shapes you could build with any previous terrain. \nSCULPTING AND PAINTING. A key part of making Caverns Deep! special was deepening the cave-like overhangs and textures to build astonishingly dramatic and perfectly colored formations. Our artists painstakingly sculpted every single crevice, stalagmite, ledge, swell and pool by hand \u2013 and our painters meticulously applied just the right mix of color to capture all the depth and detail. In our opinion, it\u2019s the best sculpting and painting we\u2019ve ever done. \n THEMES AND FEATURES\nCaverns Deep! includes an extensive variety of terrain, features and enhancements. We have crumbling Ruins, a pestilent Mushroom Grotto, perilous Ice Catacombs, reptilian infested Water, illuminated Crystal Caverns, the treacherous Underdoom, and Dreadhollow Forest, a brand new Wilderness terrain system. \nMany pieces come with working (even some multicolor) LEDs.  Most Caverns Deep! pieces also come with standard Anchor Magnets inset underneath, so your builds stay firmly in place on our colorful (metal embedded) Terrain Trays.  \nThere\u2019s dramatic elevation, traps, minis, bridges, even a modular dock and boat. And, at long last, a \u201cDwarven Forge\u201d!\nOur Trifecta Pieces Offer Unparalleled Modularity\nAll the sets you see come fully hand painted, right out of the box.  Or, if you prefer, order your sets unpainted (and try our custom designed Pokorny paints, available on our website).\nAt the heart of Caverns Deep are its 15 exciting Encounters. Every Encounter is a self-contained adventure with its own unique theme and pieces \u2013 and it's ready to play right out of the box!\nThese 15 Walkthrough Videos do a great job of showing you what makes each encounter special.\nThe Module.  Also included in your pledge is a full Caverns Deep! Module that journeys through every single Encounter \u2013 with photos, illustrations and complete stats, via PDF download. Since the domain of Caverns Deep! is the actual setting for its storyline, the pieces and builds are depicted within and integral to the narrative. So the module and terrain work symbiotically to immerse your group in your game like never before! \nMODULARITY \nOne of the essential features of all Dwarven Forge terrain is its modularity. Caverns Deep! is no exception. You can build the Encounters we\u2019ve pictured -- or you can build something completely new every time. You can also combine your Caverns Deep! pieces with any of our other terrain. The only limit is your imagination! \nHOW TO PLEDGE\nYou\u2019ll see photos of the Encounters followed by photos of the pledge levels further below. But first, let's just lay out the basics of making a pledge:  \n1) To pledge, the first thing you'll want to do is select a Main Pledge level. These are the pledges shown down the right-hand column of the page.  \n2) Once you select your Main Pledge, you can add any other set(s) you see on this Kickstarter, as long as it has a price listed on our Google Sheet or our Pledge Calculator (that means it's unlocked). These include anything from small add-on sets, to full Encounters -- or even another Main Pledge level.  \n3) To pledge, click on the pledge level you want, then enter the total cost (including shipping/taxes) of your Main Pledge + any additional set(s) you want, and press \"continue,\" then \"pledge\".  You can modify your pledge as many times as you want until the campaign ends at 9PM US Eastern Time on August 14th.\nHow do we know which sets you've chosen?\nI.  When the campaign is over, Kickstarter will charge you for your pledge.  Kickstarter takes their commission, and then they send the remaining funds to us.  They give us: your e-mail (the one you use with KS); your main pledge level; and your pledge total.  It's then up to us to collect all remaining information.  We do that with our online Pledge Manager.\nII. About 4-6 weeks after the campaign closes, you will receive an e-mail invitation to this online Pledge Manager.  It will be pre-loaded with your main pledge and your total pledge amount.  You'll then enter your name and shipping details, and reconfirm your set choices from our online menu, which will be a much enhanced version of the pledge calculator.  Once you're done, you can download a copy of your order, or even upgrade your selections (subject to availability).  (If you didn't include shipping/import fees with your pledge, the pledge manager will also collect them.)\nIII. This will be our 6th Pledge Manager, so please don't worry -- this part is easy and fun.  Any questions at that time, we are absolutely available to help!\nCHOOSING YOUR PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe offer 4 different types of Main Pledges:  \nI. Starter Pledges \nThese will give you a great start on building your cavern. These include Cavern Starter and Cavern Entrance.  \nII. Build Your Own\nSelect Build Your Own Cavern to order your own set choices \u00e0 la carte.  You can use our Pledge Calculator or our Google Spreadsheet to add up the total of the sets you want.  \nIII. Adventure Essentials\nThe Caverns Deep pieces are detailed, feature-filled and more costly to produce than most of our previous pieces.  \nWith that in mind, Nate assembled Adventure Essentials 1-3, 1-6, 1-9 and 1-11 from subsets of the first 11 Encounters to provide a maximum variety and utility for the least cost.  Nate's goal was to cherry pick all the key Adventure pieces that define each Encounter, and provide a Universal set of Core pieces so you can build each Encounter you pledge for -- just not all of them at the same time. \nThese pledge levels reflect our recommendation for maximizing the versatility and efficiency of your pledge.\nAdventure Essentials 1-3 contains:\n3 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-3. \nUniversal Core Set 1-3.\n4 Add-on packs that are part of Encounters 1-3\nYou can build Encounters 1-3, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-6 contains:\n6 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-6.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3 and 4-6.\n8 Add-on packs that are part of Encounters 1-6. \nYou can build Encounters 1-6, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-9 contains:\n9 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-9.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3; 4-6; 7-9.\n18 Add-on packs (this includes 2X of 2 sets) that are part of Encounters 1-9. \nYou can build Encounters 1-9, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-11 contains:\n11 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-11.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3; 4-6; 7-9; 10-11.\n25 Add-on packs (this includes 2X of 3 sets) that are part of Encounters 1-11. \nYou can build Encounters 1-11, but not all at the same time. \nCaverns Deep! For those of you who want to go all-in, this pledge includes: Everything from the Adventure Essentials 1-11 (please see that pledge level for details); and complete Encounters 12/Ice Cavern, 13/Crystal Cavern; 14/The Underdoom; and 15/Dreadhollow Forest.\nYou\u2019ll be able to build every single encounter (just not all at the same time). It\u2019s a big pledge, and reflects a savings of more than $500 over the cost of all components ordered separately.\nIV. WHOLE ENCOUNTER PLEDGES\nThese are bundles that include every single piece shown from various Encounters. \nUncharted Underground. It includes all the pieces included in Encounter 12/Ice Cavern, Encounter 13/Crystal Cavern and Encounter 14/The Underdoom. (This pledge does not include Encounters 1-11.) \nDeluxe Caverns Deep! This absolutely mind-blowing assortment includes the complete version of all 15 Encounters -- you can display them all at the same time. This enormous pledge covers a 4'x12' table, and includes a savings of more than $750 over the cost of all the Encounters ordered separately.\nOne final note on the main pledges: Except for Build Your Own Cavern, each Main Pledge offers a discount off the \u00e0 la carte price for its components. (The percentage of the discount actually goes up as the pledges get larger.) \nClick on the photo for more detail.\nAnd here are all 15 full Encounters.

If you have a Build Your Own Cavern or higher pledge, you may add any Add-on Set to your order.  Please use our online spreadsheet or our Pledge Calculator to view the prices for all available sets.\nAs the funding level of this Kickstarter grows, our production run gets larger and more efficient. This enables us to add in free stretch goal pieces that \"unlock\" -- and are automatically added to your pledge -- at specified funding milestones. These milestones are eligible to unlock until the Kickstarter ends on August 14, at 9PM US Eastern time.\nEach stretch goal fits into a specific set within one of the Encounters. If your pledge includes that set, you receive that stretch goal when it unlocks; if your pledge does not include that set, you do not receive that stretch goal.\nYou can keep track of the stretch goals using our stretch goal map.\nWHY YOUR SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO US\nEven though -- with your help -- we've run 5 successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are still a small company in a niche business.  Kickstarter -- primarily through our amazing backers -- provides a platform uniquely able to support the rich assortment of products you see.  This wouldn't be possible doing \"business as usual.\"\nBefore Kickstarter, we typically launched 1-2 new sets per year. Caverns Deep! will tool nearly 200 pieces and produce well over 100 different set configurations.  With that contrast in mind, here are the main hurdles that your backing surmounts:\nFirst, the product development:  The support and enthusiasm you've already demonstrated gave us the confidence and inspiration we needed to devote our resources to designing, sculpting and prototyping this colossal line.  All this work is already done!\nSecond, the tooling:  We could never risk the cost of nearly 150+ massive steel molds (almost one for most every part) without your backing.  \nThird, the inventory: Producing the variety of products you'll see in Caverns Deep isn't possible without the backing we receive.  Imagine a small company having to order over 100 different sets (painted and unpainted encounters and add-ons) for inventory without knowing customer demand.  We might get by producing the wrong quantities for a few sets, but never something of this magnitude.  This is perhaps the most overlooked reason why crowdfunding helps us make this offer so much better.\nThis is also why we offer backers:\nKickstarter-exclusive prices that will never be as low again.\nGuaranteed availability of backers' set selections (which, although we try, is nearly impossible to offer on our website).\nSHIPPING\nThis year, shipping (US and Worldwide) is not included in the pledge and set prices. You can see exactly how much your shipping will cost on our online spreadsheet or our Pledge Calculator. (Kickstarter cannot provide you with these amounts because it does not capture any shipping associated with shipping add-on sets.)\nPlease include the shipping in your total pledge. If you choose not to include the shipping, our post-campaign Pledge Manager will collect your shipping charges.\nThe listed shipping charges on the spreadsheet and ultimately, the pledge calculator, will also include all taxes and fees for shipments to the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. Duties, taxes and fees for shipments to other countries are not included and will be collected by the courier upon delivery. \nWe deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these extra charges.\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY\nWhile production of our last campaign, Dungeon of Doom, is complete, actual backer shipments are still in progress, and production time took 2-3 months longer than we anticipated. We are very grateful for everyone\u2019s patience during this time, and it since we\u2019re now promoting Caverns Deep!, it seems appropriate that we address the topic of delays. \nWe hate being late; delays are disappointing to our backers. And since you are the core of our business, your opinions matter to us very much. Yet, even after 20 years of producing terrain with great production partners, our ETA is still really an estimate\u2014albeit a sincere one. \nWith more 200 pieces (some of which are always \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d) to tool, cast and paint, we always have unforeseen obstacles that create delays \u2013 and we actually pad the production schedule to anticipate them. We also work double time to fix problems \u2013 and so does the factory. Sometimes we still don\u2019t anticipate enough. \nWhat will happen with Caverns Deep!? \nFirst, we should note that we launched the Kickstarter now (instead of waiting until August when Dungeon of Doom shipments will be finished) because it\u2019s important to complete the tooling needed to start casting at full speed before the Chinese New Year. This wouldn\u2019t happen if we waited, and we hope you understand. \nSecond, we \u2013 and our factory \u2013 promise as always to run a disciplined process, to work hard and smart to produce your sets, and to keep you informed. Most importantly, we will remain dedicated to making the best product we can, and \u2013 only if unavoidable \u2013 taking a little more time to ensure it\u2019s worth waiting for. June, 2019 is our best projection for when your sets will start shipping.  \nPlease help spread the word -- and  join the conversation in the Comments section.

But they don\u2019t have to do it alone! Fighting alongside them in this all-new campaign, the Heroes will have the aid of the Mounts, enormous beasts of burden!\nThis is an expansion for Arcadia Quest and/or Arcadia Quest: Inferno and requires either to play.\nThis expansion introduces a major new element to Arcadia Quest as these magnificent Mounts can carry Heroes across the map, pushing back against their foes and using their unique abilities to help their Riders!\nRiding in Style\nWith the introduction of Mounts, a few things are now different for the Heroes in Arcadia. For one, each Guild can choose one beastly friend for a Hero to ride upon. Mount and Rider move along the map together, endure attacks together and Shove enemies out of their way together! <3\nEach Mount has its own unique Natural Ability that can be triggered when its Rider is activated for some wild effects! Mounts can also absorb damage for Heroes, and likewise, when a Rider wants to drink a Healing or Refreshing Potion they can drink it themselves or give it to their Mounts - aw!\nMalkhor and his Jacklols\nYes, now hold that pose for a second!\nLegend holds that Malkhor fell to earth on a chariot of blazing fire. The Eternal Hunter has stalked large prey in the Wilds since time immemorial, and now that the Mounts have found refuge in the city of Arcadia, he's upped his game and encroaches the area. Whether he\u2019s truly a fallen god or merely some visitor from a very distant land, Malkhor\u2019s intentions are clear: Stalk. Hunt. Kill.\n\"Hehehheh hahahaha heee heeeee hahahahaaa!!!\u201d\nThe unnerving and insane laughter heralds the approach of the Jacklols and drive many Arcadians mad. These cunning monsters serve Malkhor with spears and jokes alike!\nMeet the New Heroes: Colette & Gaston\nColette is the elder of the Wildling Twins and, as tradition dictates, has led her brother to Arcadia in pursuit of Malkhor. She\u2019s always loved exotic new lands and loves exotic new weapons even more. Not many would employ a battle-axe as a throwing weapon, nor a flail as a whip to entangle legs and arms. Regardless, the Guilds have much to learn from such an unorthodox warrior and are lucky to have her.\nGaston is the younger of the Wildling Twins: impetuous, fearless, and somewhat lacking in common sense. This is not to say he\u2019s overly foolish, but his sister must restrain his more exuberant excesses from time to time. He rarely considers the odds when charging headlong into battle. That said, he often succeeds where others would not. His lightning reflexes and sharp eyes (and no small number of pain medications) make Gaston a fearsome combatant.\nShiny New Toys In Town!\nWith the arrival of new residents in Arcadia, the market street is bustling with shiny new exotic gear! You'll find not only an assortment of Upgrade cards like Saddles, Stirrups and such for your new riding companions...\n...but also new Upgrades for Heroes in the form of new Weapons, Armor, and Spells!\nA Whole New Campaign!\nArcadia Quest: Riders features a brand-new campaign that tells the story of the Guilds attempting to push Malkhor back from the city. In this campaign, 3 alternative scenarios plug into the previously released Beyond the Grave and Pets expansions, bringing a fun mix of Mounts, Pets and Undead together. There's even a scenario that mixes Riders with the other 2 expansions!\nThe Arcadia Quest: Riders campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. As a flash Kickstarter campaign (running for 5 days only!) all pledges already include Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals or Optional Buys will be available during the campaign.\nIn order to expedite access to this product, we've broken down the pledges by hub. If you would like to receive this pledge by July 2018, make sure to select one of the First Print pledges. Select the Hub of your area/country. If you don't see your country listed in any of the Pledges, please select the United States Hub. Please note that First Print copies are limited to 1 copy per backer. You will be able to get more copies through the Geekfunder Pledge Manager after the campaign ends, but extra copies will be delivered at a later date. If your country's First Pledges are gone, you can choose to receive the Second Print, which will be delivered at a later date.\nPlease take note that if you choose to back with $1 only you will be able to update your pledge for a full reward on the Geekfunder Pledge Manager, but your pledge will ship at a later date - with the Second Print copies.\nRULES & CAMPAIGN BOOK\nCLICK HERE to check out the Campaign Book for Arcadia Quest: Riders. The Scenarios themselves are omitted in this Web version.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a single Arcadia Quest: Riders pledge - Inclusive of $5 shipping credit.\nUSA: $5-$10 to most states. $35 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$25 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $55 to most countries.\nASIA: $5 to China and Hong Kong. $15-$20 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $10-$25 to Australia. $15 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10-$25 to most countries.\n\u2022 $30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $30-$40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $55 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 31st Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for the First Print Pledges is July 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, HATE, and Zombicide: Invader, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Arcadia quest: Riders.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "First Print - EU Hub", "descp": "EXPANSION AND EXCLUSIVE ITEMS ONLY.

Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster. Each hero is represented on the game board by a blue miniature.\nFrom left to right: Nightwing, The Huntress and Robin\nFrom left to right: Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Batman and Catwoman\nBatman sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nThe Huntress sculpted by Edgar Skomorovski\nEach hero has their own hero board detailing their characteristics, skills, and traits.\nBatman, Jim Gordon, and Nightwing's hero screens\nThe hero board is made of 2 parts: a hero screen that slides into a bat-tablet.\nA hero screen and a bat-tablet forming a hero board\nThis hero board allows the player to control their hero to perform actions such as fighting or jumping from a walkway, by spending energy cubes from their reserve zone.\nThese energy cubes represent both a hero's life points and their capacity to act. The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

The villain places the tiles in their command post in the order indicated by the scenario.\nThe plastic dashboard and how its punchboards fit in\nThe villain command board with the tiles and energy cubes\nA close-up view of the plastic command board\nA close-up view of the plastic command board\nThe villain controls their characters by activating the corresponding tile. They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count.\nPlastic sample of the command board\nClose-up of the plastic sample of the command board\nTo better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment:\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language of your game during the Pledge Manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Some of you have come to know our brand and flavors and we thank every one of you for the support. We are back!!\nOk, we loved our sticks. Made changes, ran more campaigns. And we went back and made more changes. That is why we are here. We decided to change the meat blend that went into our sticks. We wanted to cut some of the fat while leaving the flavor intact. Why you ask? Because we wanted to make them a little more health conscience.\nWhat we decided to do was use a leaner blend when mixing the meat and other ingredients. But we had to find the right blend of lean meat with a fattier meat while trying to leave the stick soft. Boy was that an adventure!!\n What this gave us was a new beef stick. We still were able to get all the flavors to come through as we did in the past. So in a round about way we went back to the beginning and designed a \"better\" beef stick. Now we offer it to you!!\nNot only did we make a change in the meat but we also changed the labels and we finally got all of the nutritional facts finished. Here they are:\n     Those are the 15 flavors we currently offer with the nutritional facts. The Garlic N Parmesan stick nutritional fact information had to be completed, which it was just before Christmas. The pic here was made just for simulation of what the label would look like pending the completion of the nutritional testing. When the campaign is complete and we are ready to send out rewards we will have the correct information label on the stick for you.\nThe one flavor we are not offering in this campaign is the Cran-B-Cue flavor since we are still working on improving that flavor stick. And as usual we don't add in the sodium nitrates.\nThanks for taking the time to check out our campaign and we hope to see your name on a reward package soon!\n If we hit $4,200 we will: Add in the new flavor not mentioned on this campaign. Each reward level will get the number that corresponds with the pledge.\n$10 Pledge gets 1 additional stick of the new flavor\n$18 Pledge gets 2 additional sticks of the new flavor\n$25 Pledge gets 3 additional sticks of the new flavor\n$45 Pledge gets 4 additional sticks of the new flavor\n$65 Pledge gets 5 additional sticks of the new flavor\n$100 Pledge gets 8 additional sticks of the new flavor", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo risk...we made some changes to our products but nothing we can't handle\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Muncher", "descp": "This level gets you 5 beef sticks, all the same flavor.

You find yourself searching through old newspapers, reading old letters, examining toys and games, and scouring the internet for uploads of the antique films to pick apart, as you get sucked in to the most immersive mystery game you will ever play.\n              In your package you will receive a small white envelope, containing a short letter outlining some bare-bones rules. As far as instruction\u2026 that\u2019s it. Everything else appears to be an authentic 1930\u2019s artefact from the early days of cartoon cinema. You\u2019ll start to read the letters, memos, and notes, and realise that the bulk of the objects in front of you belonged to a studio animator, who collected them together because he suspected that cryptic messages were being hidden among the toys games and films that the studio produced.\nYou\u2019ll start to read his diary. Through his entries he tells a gradual story of landing his dream job, starting work, noticing a bit of odd behaviour among some of his colleagues, beginning to see strange patterns in the cartoons the studio is putting out, starting to ask questions, and then his slow decline into conspiratorial madness.\nEach diary entry roughly corresponds to one main object in the package \u2013 and through reading the entry and examining the relevant objects you\u2019ll see that there is a puzzle that needs to be solved. Upon finding the solution (perhaps a name, a date, an address, a lead), a little bit more of the story will be revealed to you. In this way, the game can be broken down into small stand-alone puzzles which can be tackled alone or by a group. And each puzzle solved will help you unravel the story, and solve the large overarching meta-puzzle; finding out exactly what happened.\nA HOME PUZZLE HUNT WITH 'MAGIC TRICK LIKE' SOLUTIONS \nIn our game you make progress by:\nreading letters and diaries\npiecing stories together\nmaking deductions\nfact checking\nbreaking codes\nsolving puzzles\n finding messages hidden in plain sight\nplaying games\nchasing clues online\ncracking riddles\ndiscovering unique interactions between objects\nand looking at what\u2019s in front of you in a different light\nEverything is of movie prop quality, and being forced to interact with the objects in totally new ways makes the game immersive as hell. After the first time you find a link, or a clue, or a hidden compartment, you forget you are playing a game; you just become Sherlock Holmes.\nFIND ANSWERS AS YOU'VE NEVER FOUND THEM BEFORE \nWe've designed puzzles that involve real world physical objects instead of just being limited to pen and paper or computer screens, so we can design solutions which are way outside the box from anything you have ever seen before.\nIt might just look like a cool old jigsaw puzzle \u2013 until you find a code hidden in its imagery\nThey might just be random slides of vintage cartoons \u2013 until you find out more about them online.\nIt\u2019s just an old toy, just a newspaper, just an envelope \u2013 until its rotated, or folded, or held up to the light \u2013 when it becomes so much more\u2026\nWe custom design everything you receive, so every object has its unexpected hidden mysteries, and everything links to everything else in a tangled web of conspiracy.\nCRACK CODES AND SOLVE PUZZLES \nThe game roughly follows a \u2018puzzle hunt\u2019 style \u2013 you solve many smaller puzzles, and then combine the solutions in order to solve larger and larger \u2018meta puzzles\u2019.\nThe length of the game is hard to say \u2013 it can be played alone or in groups of any size \u2013 and the amount of content is colossal. The main narrative push takes the form of a diary, with roughly each entry corresponding to one puzzle that needs to be solved. Each of these stand-alone cases has its own conclusion, reveals a little more of the mystery, and is very satisfying in its own right.\nThe Silver package contains roughly 20 such cases, the Gold roughly 35, and the Platinum around 50.\nThat's not to mention the time spent unravelling the riddle of the narrative; comparing letters and articles and newspapers to piece together a timeline like a detective. Nor the challenge of solving the large overarching meta-puzzle of the main storyline.We have given rough estimates of the playtime, but really you can discover the story as slowly as you'd like.\nWe wanted something that could be slowly unravelled over weeks or months, like a good mystery novel. But we designed the game to be broken down into smaller chunks that could be tackled in one sitting, perfect for board game nights and gaming groups.\nFIND MORE CLUES ONLINE \nAs the mystery unravels, you will find yourself researching online. You\u2019ll find weird websites and old cartoons that help expand the case, each, of course, full of their own little riddles.\nWe tried to walk a line between board game, puzzle game, escape room, and alternate reality game. The result is something that is so immersive it doesn\u2019t feel much like a game at all. As you thumb through the old letters and track down the old films and piece together what happened, you\u2019ll swear you were in a mystery novel.\nUSE OLD FASHIONED DETECTIVE WORK \nAn interwoven thread of diaries and letters forms the narrative of the game, which revolves around a shadowy cult-like organisation entrenched in the film industry of the 1930s.\nSome characters are trustworthy, some are up to terrible business, some are going crazy, and some are just caught up in the middle. Part of the mystery is to look at the letters and memos and photographs and work out who knows what, who is telling the truth, and who is lying.\nYou will also need to back-up stories and check facts \u2013 \u201chey, look up if 8th of June 1936 was a Monday, because if so, that means this letter arrived before the paper was even published\u2026\u201d\nWe have packed the game full of high quality, well designed, interesting objects. The idea is that the pieces are so cool that you will want to keep them on display on the shelf in your office or framed on your wall after you complete the game, as a sort of collectable. With that in mind, and our teams' background in graphic and product design, we made every artefact as intriguing and good-looking as possible.\n We split the game into three tiers - SILVER, GOLD, and PLATINUM. Each tier includes everything in the lower tiers, plus a lot more; each tier is around twice the size of the previous in terms of content and gameplay, and adds another perspective to the main narrative.\nFor a full list of exactly what is included in each tier level, see further down the page.\n       A full breakdown of included components in each package. Get ready to scroll for a while, because it's a long long list.\n    NOTE: Poster shown framed for illustrative purposes only; frame not included.\n   While scouring through the letters and articles, you will come across discussion of specific characters or movies that the studio is working on, and you\u2019ll be able to go online, search for the name, and find them. Watching the old cartoons for extra clues adds a whole new dimension to the game.\nThe movies below are part of an ARG puzzle hunt we are currently running in parallel to the kickstarter campaign. The puzzles in these videos are far, far more challenging than what would be included in the delivered game (because they have to stand up to the hivemind; thousands of people putting thousands of man-hours of thought into them, as opposed to just one person or a small group), so don\u2019t be intimidated if they seem hard. The final game has been carefully designed to cater to all backgrounds and skill-sets. But theses short films should give you a brief idea of the kind of style the final movies take.\nSome the favourite moments of our playtesters were reading about details of the cartoons from the letters and memos of the animators, and then scouring the footage online picking out the parts they had read about, finding the hidden patterns or subliminal messages. This extra dimension really moves the game from the table-top to something that seems to live and breathe in the real world.\n     Because of the scope and size of the game, we don't envision ever being able to bring 'The Wilson Wolfe Affair' to game stores. Our plan is simply to run this kickstarter campaign, and then fulfil the orders to those that have pledged. So if you really want to play the game, the only chance you may ever have is to back the kickstarter now and help us fulfil our goal.\nCreative projects that take a bit of a risk and attempt to seek out new experiences for new markets only succeed because of people like you - people who are willing to give their backing when they see something good. So if you like the look of what we have produced, and want to see more of this type of game in the future, give us your backing, and we won't let you down - we will deliver you the greatest game you have ever played.\n  We realised while making the game that marketing might be a problem - we wanted to show you all the cool unusual solutions our game entails, but by showing those we would also be spoiling the game for you. What's the point in buying a big elaborate puzzle game if you have already seen half of what you need to do from the teaser video? So, we decided to make some dummy solutions just for the preview. Any puzzles you can make out, or any solutions shown here, like the flame being held to the poster, the game board being folded to spell a word, etc. do not feature in the final game in the way shown. \nHowever, the final game does include posters and board games (along with everything else shown in the 'what's included' images on this page), and also has solutions involving special inks and odd interactions... just not the solutions we have shown here. That way we can give you a taste of what to expect, but you can also 'go in blind' from when you first open the box. So don't worry about having anything spoilt.\n  Stretch goals are extra funding targets, which when hit, will allow us to add new things to the game. The new objects will be added to every level of the game, and so make the final product better for everyone.\nAs each goal is reached, more information will be revealed about the next goal, and the titles give a little clue as to what to expect. All the goals above $70k involve adding a cool new component to the game, which will feature as the key to a new puzzle within the story. We have tried to rank them in order of how interesting they are, with the final $210k goal being something we think is particularly cool.\nYou can help raise the total by sharing the kickstarter page around. You would be surprised how far a little sharing can go. A single post on a facebook group or a forum, a submission to a gaming news site, tweeting the link to someone with a lot of followers who may like it \u2013 they are all little actions that can have huge consequences in terms of raising the total, which will allow us to make the game better for everyone. So please share the project around, help us reach our stretch goals, and we will be able to make the game even more intriguing!\n Want to buy additional games?\nDetails on how to change your pledge amount are here.\nIf you want an additional Silver Package on top of what you\u2019ve already pledged for, simply add another \u00a379 onto your pledge amount. If you want three more Platinum Packages and two more Golds, just total it up and add it on.\nBefore the games ship, you will be contacted by our pledge manager, BackerKit, and the extra money you have pledged will show up as credit in your account. You can then simply click on the extra packages you ordered and you will receive them.\nAlso, for those who want to change pledge levels later, this too will be much simpler. If you pledge at the Gold level now, but want to upgrade to Platinum later on, you can just select the higher level when you are contacted by backerkit and pay the difference.\nYou won\u2019t be paying a roughly 10% higher price, as mentioned in previous updates. You will just pay the current kickstarter pledge level prices.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNEW TO KICKSTARTER?: Select one of the \u2018Pledge\u2019 levels on this page to help support our game. If we reach our funding goal of \u00a325,000, we will be able to make our game, and you will receive the game at the level you have chosen. The money you pledge will only be collected if we reach our goal. If we fail to reach our goal, your account won't be charged at all.\n\nThe team at Simulacra Games have years of experience as graphic designers, mainly working in print advertising and product design. This means we are very experienced in dealing with manufacturers and print shops, and very at home with the process of taking a design from concept to completion. The game is already designed (both in gameplay and graphics), and upon successful funding of the kickstarter will require only manufacturing/printing and delivery. \n\n95% of components in the game will be produced by printers/manufacturers we have worked with before, and whom have always produced good work for us.\n\nThe other few pieces, by their nature, require specialist manufacturers, which we have already found and are in dialogue with regarding the project, so we have no reason to believe there will be any problems there. \n\nWhen dealing with manufacturing and shipping part of the project is inevitably out of your hands, and so there is always the possibility of delays to delivery \u2013 however, having designs produced and printed and delivered to a deadline has been our bread-and-butter for many years as designers, so we are confident we can overcome any problems in the supply chain. \n\nCertain parts of the design of the final game have been altered for the prototype in order to obscure the answers to puzzles, so as not to spoil the game. Thus the final product will vary in design from the prototypes pictured in this kickstarter. You will receive all components listed in the tier level you decide to back (see images titled \u2018Silver Package\u2019, \u2018Gold Package\u2019, \u2018Platinum Package\u2019) but the design of the components may be different. i.e. if your pledge level includes a poster, you will receive a poster, but the graphic design of the poster may be slightly different. \n\nIf for some unforeseen reason pledges need to be refunded, we will be unable to refund the charge incurred by kickstarter, amazon, etc. \u2013 representing roughly 10% of the total payment. We will be unable to offer refunds once we have begun packaging and shipping. \n\n\nPOSTAGE\n\n\u00a320 / $26 / \u20ac23\n\nFlat rate worldwide\n\n(conversions from GBP approximate and rounded to nearest dollar/euro amount)\n\nProject is EU friendly, US friendly, and UK friendly \u2013 items will be shipped from warehouse locations within those countries, ensuring relatively similar delivery times/costs worldwide.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games.

We're a completely volunteer-run non-profit and wouldn\u2019t exist without our passionate volunteers, players, talented game-masters and game designers.\nLast year we added a teens track and speaker panels to our roster, and moved into a larger space at the Marriott in Walnut Creek. We also created Big Bad World, a \u201cPowered by the Apocalypse\u201d meta-game running all con long, which gamified and promoted our goals of every attendee being awesome to each other!\nThis year, there is so much more we want to do!\nBig Bad Outreach\nPart of the support we receive for the con this year will go towards our new outreach program. We're working with local schools and youth organizations to run tabletop games for teens in the Bay Area.\nWe're going to share our love of gaming with our community and give teens a chance to play some great games with our great GMs!\nBoard Game Room\nFor years we've been relegating board and card games to our open gaming spaces, but this year they are getting their own track and dedicated space!\nWe'll have games on the event schedule, a library of games for attendees to check out and play, and the play-to-win program that raffles off games played during the con!\nScholarship\nLast year, with the help of the scholarship fund we were able to bring seven gamers out to the con who wouldn't have made it out otherwise. Several of our attendees want to contribute more! By adding the Wolf Rider Plus One, you can now buy a badge for yourself and one that goes into the scholarship fund to help financially challenged women, people of color, disabled and lgbtqia+ individuals attend the con!\nPrivate Game Rooms for RPGs\nPrivate rooms are the best. You can play music, decorate the room, change the lighting, turn the television into a giant monitor, enjoy your game undisturbed by noise from other tables, and order room service. You can divide the space up, run two games that are connected, even LARP in them. Private rooms are the dream, and we\u2019ve got plenty at Big Bad Con! \nLast year, thanks to the generosity of our backers we had 30 private rooms, which housed almost all our scheduled RPGs. This year we are shooting for even more!\nAll digital, All the time\nOne of the biggest pain points in past was transitioning from online signups before the con to manual signups at the con. There was confusion about where and how to sign up, and often when games were opened, slots were left unfilled because nobody knew that spaces were available.\nThis year our development team is working on mobile solutions that will include your schedule, let you know about open games, and link directly to the site to sign up for games. We'll also have computer kiosks at the registration desk to do the same.\nBased on increased hotel costs and our expanding size, we're looking to raise $3000. Doing so means we can: \nKeep our teens track, and extend the games available to teen players.\nContinue hosting Big Bad Con at the Walnut Creek Marriott, where we have over 15,000 square feet of gaming space and plenty of spaces to eat, relax, and hang out.\nOffer 35 private gaming rooms (with comfy chairs!).\n Add a board game room.\nIncrease and improve our Games on Demand space.\nOffer free badges to GMs and volunteers. \nBig Bad Scholarship ($20 and up)\nAll funds collected from this pledge will go towards providing free badges and rooms for attendees who would otherwise not be able to attend.\nAdditionally your name, organization, or cause will appear on the Big Bad Con Hall of Heroes as one of our supporters.\nAdding a Scholarship to another pledge: You can add a scholarship to any other pledge level by increasing your pledge by $20 (or more).

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. \nThe honorable CMON crew gathered to play a session of Rising Sun.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We\u2019re here to please you with the most logistical solution in the board game universe for your dearest children, yes, the board games. Whether it be to a casual one game night at a friend\u2019s or to a hoarding trip at GenCon. You can transport them in the most comfortable, protective, and classy way possible. We know the games can be heavy, especially in bundles, so we built this keeping carrying comfort a top priority. Our solution comes in 3 types, crafted with the intent use in mind. \n The Products \n1. The Flatbed\n The Flatbed was designed to save your time from unpacking after you get home from a night of conquering your friends in a brain-burning games like Agricola or Terra Mystica. Fused with transparent plastic sides, you can shelf the game along with the bag and still showoff your rows of games in a way a hardcore gamer's shelf should look like. The zipper features scratch-proof padding to prevent the zipper from eating the box when you take the game in and out. Furthermore, the extra padding will provide enhanced protection against pressure when you stack your games. And yes, it is dust-proof and water-resistant so worry not about nurturing the games you plan to resell or those that rarely hit the tables, the Flatbed will cradle it like a newborn baby. \nHow does it carry? It carries like a briefcase. The thick yet soft padding on the handle will make you feel like you\u2019re carrying a cushion. The initial launch comes in dark grey shade, but we have other colors in store, check out the stretch goals! \n  2. The Bulwark \nThe Bulwark features a carrying capacity of 2 heavy duty games like Caverna or 3 narrower games like Dixit. The Bulwark comes with a diagonal strap-on that you can wrap it flat on your back while you carry. So the bag won\u2019t be doing rope jumping while you walk, run, bike, climb, dance...yes you get the point. This also means your games won\u2019t be taking hits from bumping, after all, no games deserve a punch (maybe except for those you allowed to be webbed in the attic). It is padded with extra protection, scratch-proof padding on the zipper and reinforced handled much like the Flatbed. \nThe Bulwark was created with mobility as the key intent use and is perfect for gamers who like to walk, bike, or use public transportation to a friend's place for a 3-5 hours game session. Or even carry it to office! (play after office hours that is)\n  3. The Tank \nAs the name suggests, the Tank has enhanced shell damage and traverse speed, oh wait thats the wrong tank. Our Tank assists you in plowing through game conferences and hoarding as many games as you can without ever realizing that you are carrying games on your back. The bag features 4-5 games carrying capacity in the main compartment and adjustable compartment in the top section of the bag to carrying those small family and party games so that it doesn\u2019t get crushed by the big guys in the main compartment. We understand that hand-carrying a bag with 4-5 games in it requires some advancement in Biceps and Deltoid. Even shoulder straps can put displeasing pressure on your collar bones, unless you are a big fan of perpetual shoulder shrugging dance routine that is. Hence, we believe backpacking is the way to go. \nThe Tank has reinforced backpack straps and soft padding on the back to sooth the weight. To redistribute weight pressure, a chest and waist strap is provided so the weight is partially transferred to the chest and lower the pressure on the shoulder (a good way to shave off some reps off the bench press from your lifting routine we must say). It also comes with a removable leather handle to convert the strap into a handle for hand carry. The Tank is perfect for a weekend getaway where you can stock 5-7 games, put the bag in your car, and drive off to play 'til you drop.  PS: The Tank can fit 4 Flatbeds and or 2 Bulwarks in it for an extra overprotection, perfect for Helicopter parents. \n   Feature Summary \nThe Flatbed has one specialty in that it comes in 2 different depths 1) A 4\u201d depth to accommodate games such as Caverna, Agricola and 2) A 2.8\u201d depth for all other thinner games. But even if the bag still has space in depth after you put in the game, you can be worry-free of box spilling out when carry as both Flatbed and Bulwark comes with built-in fastening belt All bags were designed based on standard square and rectangle size games, but other variations can be accommodated no problem. \nAll bags have built-in fastening belts to hold smaller games in place so the box cover would not spill and the boxes won\u2019t smash each other in bag while you carry. For non-standard larger size games or big box games the Tank can house them with ease. \n   Color Variations\nThe dark grey hue is certainly classic and everlasting, but we know there are many of you out there who's looking for more pigmentations and guess what, we've got that covered! Here are some of the color variation prototypes for the Flatbed and Bulwark that we can make available if you help us cross our stretch goals so we can meet the minimum requirements to create these sexy beasts. \n    Early Bird and Custom Initials\nThis is where things get fast & furious. We have early bird specials for each bag and limited custom zipper head initials for the Flatbed and Bulwark where you can engrave a few characters word or initials on it! All you have to do is click on the pledge and we will send you the survey after the project deadline to confirm what you want to engrave and which font you use. There are two variations that you can choose from 1) Chubby - limit to 1 character on each meeple, and 2) Slim - limit to 2 characters on each meeple. So what are you waiting for? First come first serve gamers! \n1. The Chubby\n 2. The Slim\nSelecting Colors, Size, and Initials Post-project\nAfter the project ends, we will be sending out a short survey to confirm three things with you:\n1) Size of the Flatbed you want\n2) Colors of the Flatbed and/or Bulwark you want\n3) The characters/words you want to engrave on the zipperhead\nSo when you pledge, worry not about these things we will get confirmation from you. Since we are not using pledge manager it is easier for us to confirm via this method.\nStretch Goals \nFellow gamers, no words here really, look what we have in store for you below. Help us keep the pledge counter rolling!  \n Timber color for Bulwark unlocked\n                            Words from Prominent Gamers\nRahdo Runthrough\nThe Gameboy Geek\n Undead Viking\n Shipping Policy \nWe are partnering with Shipnaked to fulfull the products.

All other things are within our hands should anything happen.\n\nIn tackling risks, what we see as important as reducing it is managing it.

We call it \"All-Purpose\" because it can used on so many foods, with mouth watering results - not just traditional barbecue. Mike \"Ogre\" Weeks found his grandmother's recipe, made it his own, and before long he was selling it in 5 gallon buckets out of the trunk of his car.  With the recipe perfected, we bottled it, and now want the whole world to taste it. \nWe are making a name for ourselves in the Charlotte area, but we have hit a wall. In order to continue innovating and growing WE NEED YOUR HELP. \nOur vision is to continue to be different than other sauce companies. We will use the money raised towards Ogre Sauce product innovations.\nYour support will help us bring new and innovative products to the sauce market, such as\nYearly sauce subscription plans \n Craft 6-packs \nWork towards becoming Certified Organic and Certified Gluten Free \nCreate new varieties such as Vegan and Spicy\n The funding will help with\nResearch and Development \nTesting for Certification \nIngredient sourcing \n Packaging\nOgre Sauce is in a few stores and restaurants in the southern U.S., but if we raise $6,000 or more:\nWe will be able to place a minimum size order that is big enough to bring our manufacturing costs way down. \n Big savings for us means big saving for our backers. \n More resources for marketing, so we can tell the world what our fans already know, Ogre Sauce is amazing! More food and beer festivals, more food trucks, more restaurants, more stores. We love being in Whole Foods, but we love meeting fans directly more!\nFrom our bottle, to our name, to Ogre's remarkable story, to our one-of-a-kind recipe, Ogre Sauce is unlike any sauce you've tasted.\nYou wouldn't call Prince \"just a musician\".\nYou wouldn't call bacon \"just food\".\nYou wouldn't call Sriracha \"just hot sauce\".\nOgre Sauce is not \"just BBQ sauce\".\nWhen grilled, Ogre Sauce caramelizes. Your food will have an amazing crispy bark on the outside, and a bold juicy flavor inside.\nAs a dip or condiment, Ogre Sauce packs more flavor than Ketchup, Mustard, and Hot Sauce. You wouldn't believe how good Ogre Sauce is on a Cuban sandwich instead of mustard, or on a hotdog instead of ketchup, or on a pretzel or veggie instead of ranch. Try it with Tater Tots...your head will explode.\nAll-Purpose Craft BBQ Sauce \n\"All-Purpose\"\nOgre Sauce can be used perfectly on traditional BBQ foods like ribs, chicken, wings, brisket, tips, chops, porkbelly, sausage, burgers, and hotdogs...but also can be eaten on pizza, sandwiches, steak, tots, fries, and in a Bloody Marys (see Ogre Mary recipe below).\n\"Craft\"\nThis is a homemade recipe made with only the highest quality, all-natural ingredients in small batches. Like craft beer-brewers, we are small, independent, and dedicated to quality.\n\"BBQ Sauce\"\nMake no mistake...we love barbecue. Ogre's grandmother didn't set out to make a condiment that can be used on pizza, she had pork in mind. Those of you who love barbecue know how smoke, heat, meat, and sauce combine to make something irresistible. Ogre Sauce combines elements of traditional Eastern North Carolina BBQ (vinegar) with traditional Western North Carolina BBQ (tomato) elements of traditional South Carolina BBQ (mustard, honey) to create an award winning flavor.\nSince Ogre Sauce is sold at Whole Foods Markets, we meet their strict standards...\"We feature foods that are free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.\"\nWe use all-natural ingredients. That means:\nPreservative Free \nNo high fructose corn-syrup\nDye Free \nVegetarian Friendly \nWe are in 6 Whole Foods now, but lets go for all of them!\n Our All-Natural, Preservative and Dye Free Ingredients:\nKetchup \nMustard\nGarlic Powder\nSugar\nWorcestershire Sauce \nApple Cider Vinegar\nWater\nVegetable Oil\nSalt\nHoney\nNatural Vanilla Extract\nBlack Pepper\nCrushed Red Pepper\nGarlic Salt Silicon Dioxide - sounds scary, but it's a totally natural compound to absorb moisture so the garlic salt isn't all clumpy\nXanthan Gum (Natural plant based thickener)\nDextrose (a fancy word for a natural sweetener)\nBeer festivals, food trucks, bourbon tastings, chill cook-offs and hotdog eating contests are way more fun than store shelves. Even though being in Whole Foods, Southern Seasons, and other boutique shops is great for Ogre Sauce, we want to engage directly with our customers. We would love to meet our customers at events like the Alpine Village Oktoberfest in Torrance CA, or the Bacon and Bourbon Festival in Delray Beach FL, or the Waikiki Spam Jam in Hawaii, or the Zoo Brew at the Toledo Zoo in Toledo OH, or the Roadkill Cook Off in Marlinton, W. VA, or the Vegetarian Food Truck & Craft Beer Festival in Watertown, MA.\n\nHow cool would it be to have our sauce on every foodtruck around the world, the same way ketchup and hotsauce are?\nWith your help, WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. \nWe are different than the big companies like Sweet Baby Rays, KC Masterpeice, and Kraft Original. Those corporations make a fine sauce, but they make it in bulk to sell in bulk via big box stores. We make craft sauce that we sell to our friends, new and old, who often find us online after tasting our sauce at backyard bbq's with friends, beach parties, beerfests, and kickball tournaments.\n  Big props to Ogre's grandmother for the base of our recipe!\nWe love the support from our home town establishments who proudly carry Ogre Sauce. Thank you Charlotte, NC!\n ------------------\nMichael \"Ogre\" Weeks\nOgre is the chef, heart, and soul of this sauce. He makes it taste like we are always grilling at his house. He is also a proud husband and father who lives in Charlotte. Ogre's daughter might be the best spokesperson Ogre Sauce will ever have.\nPLAY\n\n\n------------------------\nMike Vagianos\nMike is Ogre Sauce's accountant, graphic designer, web developer, janitor, and taster for Ogre Sauce. If he isn't running to the post office to ship orders, he's designing new labels for the 6-pack. Mike is the steam and the wheels of this locomotive. He also lives in Charlotte NC with his family. Mike's two boys can eat more Ogre Sauce than he can.\n------------------------- \nChris Lawson\nChris is the digital voice that helps to engage with customers, spread the word, and get people's mouths watering. Mostly, Chris get's to try, photograph, taste, then publish new recipes and talk about it with Ogre Sauce's extended family online. His wife and son enjoy the Cuban Ogre in Orlando FL year-round.\n\n    All proceeds from this Kickstarter will be used directly on the operations of Ogre Sauce.\nWe have an amazing manufacturing partner in Bobbee's Bottling of Louisburg, North Carolina. They are experts at making and shipping Ogre Sauce on time. We have full confidence they can meet our order without delay.\n If we reach our Goal of raising $6000 we will be able to place an order of 1000 gallons, dropping our price-per-bottle so we can offer to our backers for less and make a profit on the remaining sauce we sell. If we earn more than our goal we will be able to invest in marketing, which for us is spending more time meeting new people and having them taste our sauce at food and beer festivals. If we meet our stretch goal we will be able to fund new flavors - like \"Spicy\" or \"Vegan\"\nWhat people are saying about Ogre Sauce\nCUBAN OGRE \n1 baguette or use ciabatta bread \nThinly sliced cooked ham \nPulled pork \n1 bottle Ogre Sauce \nThinly sliced Swiss cheese \nWhole dill pickles, thinly sliced lengthwise 2 tablespoons \nunsalted butter (1/4 stick), melted \nHeat the oven to 200\u00b0F and arrange a rack in the middle. Cut the loaf of bread in half horizontally and open it up like a book. Spread the Ogre Sauce on the bottom piece of bread. \nEvenly place the ham and roasted pork on top of the Ogre Sauce. Evenly arrange the cheese and pickles on the meat. \nPour Ogre Sauce liberally over meat and pickles and top piece of bread and close the sandwich. Press gently on the top to compact the sandwich slightly. Cut it in half crosswise; set both halves aside.\nLay 2 (20-inch-long) sheets of aluminum foil on a work surface. Brush half of the melted butter on the tops of the sandwiches. Place each sandwich butter-side down on the sheets of foil. Brush the bottoms of the sandwiches with the remaining butter. Fold the foil around the sandwiches to cover. \nHeat a large frying pan on low heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Place 1 wrapped sandwich in the pan. Place a cast-iron skillet, Dutch oven, or heavy pot on the sandwich, push down on the skillet or pot to further compact the cubano, and cook undisturbed for 10 minutes. \nRemove the skillet or pot (careful: It may be hot). Flip the sandwich and place the skillet or pot back on top of it. Cook undisturbed until the cheese has melted and the sandwich is warmed through, about 10 minutes more. Remove to the oven and repeat with the second sandwich. When both are ready, remove the foil, cut into pieces, and serve.\nOGRE CHICKEN THIGHS\n4 pounds of thighs (wings are great too), skin-on \nKosher Salt \nVegetable oil \n1 cup Ogre Sauce\nSalt and oil chicken pieces: Coat the chicken pieces with Ogre Saucel and sprinkle salt over them on all sides. \nPrepare the grill grill: Brush grill grates with vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals. \nSear chicken on hot side of grill, move to cool side: Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill for 5-10 minutes,. Once you have good dark color from the Ogre Sauce on one side, move the chicken pieces to the cooler side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20-30 minutes. \nTurn over and baste with Ogre Sauce: Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15-20 minutes. Repeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks \"low and slow\". \nFinish with a sear on the 2nd side: The chicken is done when you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices should run clear. \nPaint with more barbecue sauce and serve.\nBLOODY OGRE\n8 shots vodka \n5 pieces of bacon (1 piece of bacon for crumbling into drinks, 4 for garnish) \n2 cups tomato juice \n1 cup Ogre Sauce\n2 teaspoons prepared horseradish \n1/2 teaspoon celery salt \n2 teaspoons hot sauce  \n1 teaspoon Worcestershire \nCracks of black pepper \n2 cups ice \nPickled stuff like olives, green beans, pickles, etc.\nPrepare bacon* for drink and garnish by heating a frying pan on medium heat. Fry the bacon until extremely crispy.\nRemove to a plate with a paper towel to absorb the excess fat. Crumble one of the pieces of bacon into very small pieces.\nPour all ingredients and the crumbled pieces from one slice of bacon into a blender and blend on high for 1-2 minutes.I love using the blender because it breaks down the bacon into very fine bits.\nPour over four glasses full of ice.\nThanks to everythingbutthe.com for the original recipe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an amazing manufacturing partner in Bobbee's Bottling of Louisburg, North Carolina.

Those are 5 of the regular spoon sizes pictured against 8 of ours :)\nWith Polygons, you are able to find the size you need in seconds, without searching through all of your drawers. Plus, the spoon lays completely flat until you need to use it.\nWhen designing Polygons, we wanted to focus on making our product not only durable but also better for the environment than traditional measuring spoons.  \nThe hinges of Polygons are made of TPR, which have the property of being able to flex a 100,000 cycles without failure.\n(Edit: Many of you have messaged us asking for a 10 year warranty card... The life of such a composite plastic product depends on a variety of factors such as usage patterns, abrasion, temperature, humidity, product abuse, etc, other than just the number of times it\u2019s hinges can flex\nThe product may not live till 10 years, or it might even probably far surpass it\nIt would be like determining the lifespan of a person based on how well his/her joints function)\nAdditionally, with the 4-in-1 design, Polygons eliminates the need for excess plastic and metals that traditional measuring spoons use.\nThe materials we use to create Polygons ensure all ingredients fall off the spoon with little effort. They ensure that the ingredients you use do not stain or stink up your Polygons measuring spoons.\n\n(The images showing the folded spoon resting in place without being held by a hand, are staged photographs... But we see that people want some facility to be able to hold the shape in place without having to hold it, and we're working on it! - covered in the November 17th update)\n A sneak peek of our early prototyping processes \nNumerous configurations & geometries were tested using paper during the ideation stage, then manually tested with a variety of materials\n3D volumetric determination & construction \nWe tested several manufacturing methods to see which one would be optimal for a product of this nature\nShown in this video is one of these early methods, with very basic tooling without any fineness\nPictured in the campaign video is a prototype with similar functioning to the production version -\n (thickness & features exaggerated for explanation)\nThe production version has a similar appearance from the top, and the hinges slightly wider at the bottom, for the softer, flexible TPR to have surface area for a robust bonding\nThis is what gives the product an almost flat, easy-to clean surface both at the top and bottom\n\nWe haven\u2019t pictured the nitty-gritties and manufacturing technique of the production version in more excruciating detail to protect our IP, exactly due to instances like these, which we\u2019ve been citing as a concern early on:\nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/new-design-cheap-Polygons-The-Flat_60551273844.html\n\nApparently, what you\u2019ve pledge $10+ for, is available for 1/100th the price \nOr is it? The particular seller has listed other popular products on Kickstarter as well, stealing the same images \nYou place a bulk advance order, and then never receive anything (we tried it out with this guy)\n\nPolygons was created in 2014 by Rahul Agarwal. An India native, Agarwal is an inventor, designer and teacher.\nHe's worked on products ranging from the simplest of stationery to complex, head-up display systems.\nA few years ago, as a design student at a renowned Indian university, he was given this advice by a senior \u2013 \u201cDo not tackle designs that have reached the final stage of their evolution. For example, a spoon.\u201d From that point on, Agarwal dedicated his efforts to reinventing the wheel when it came to this object, and the idea for Polygons was born. After extensively testing with various shapes and materials, he arrived at an optimal geometry.\nOver the past couple years, Polygons has won various design awards and thousands have expressed interest in the invention. For the inventor in Agarwal, there could be no greater satisfaction than to see people using what he had created, so he got to task.\nPlease help us spread the word :)\nThe larger the Polygons community, the better it'll help us make the best kitchen gadget ever!\n A big BIG shoutout to Tali, for the delicious photographs\nhttp://www.talidovrat.com\n\nAnd the friends, family, loved ones and kind strangers who've helped us make this happen :)\n\nAnd also...\n...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you like the product, the only risk you're bearing is that of missing out on a true piece of delight by not backing it!\nNo but seriously, as with any new project, there are always some risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.

I was skiing with friends in Purgatory, CO, which is near Durango. I took a tumble late one afternoon and tore up my knee. That evening, hobbling to dinner at what was in summer a golf resort, I saw and bought this hat. So between the torn ACL and Purgatory I love to say, \u201cI went through hell to get this hat.\u201d (The next winter I fixed the ACL I had torn and the year after that I was skiing again.)\nThe hat immediately became something of a phenomenon for me. I\u2019d get a smile from the stewardess coming onto the plane. On the way to the back (I always get seated in the back) I\u2019d get smiles and \u201cHey, love your hat.\u201d I\u2019m a kind of friendly guy so I ate it up.\nThe hat quickly became the vacation and day off hat. I make various jokes about it saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t be pompous with a turtle on your head.\u201d It helps me switch gears and be more laid back. If I left home for a trip without it, my daughters would make me go back and get it; my wife did too! Other jokes? \u201cCome out of your shell, wear a turtle.\u201d Or: \u201cYou can not be rude when wearing a turtle, not only would it be impolite, you will also look stupid.\u201d\nI have found as I walk, people look at the hat and it seems like they are looking me in the eye; so I am always about to say hello to someone I do not recognize. That\u2019s kind of fun. And I can give them a wink or a tilt of the hat in a friendly way and almost always get a smile. But I found in England it did not work. People never looked at it and I was perplexed. I was traveling with a friend and he began laughing in the railway station when he was walking behind me. It turns out the people were so polite and reserved they would not look at me as they approached but would turn to look after they passed me, chuckling to themselves. My buddy Jeff was seeing the effect of the hat while I was not.\nI had enjoyed the hat for about 5 years and it was getting a bit worn and stained. So I began to look for another. The tag was long gone from my hat. Every year I would spend several hours scouring the internet for another. I am not exaggerating, I really wanted another clean and new hat. In 11 years I only saw one picture of the same hat. It was the floating trophy for the volunteer of the year in a sea turtle rescue group in Costa Rico!\nBy and by my old hat was so worn I had replaced the lining, but it was still so stained and frayed I dreaded taking it off to show people.\nFinally, after I had owned the hat about 16 years, I found another hat in a vintage second hand clothing store online! I was over the moon.\nAfter 3 years the new hat began to get salt stains, too, and I still could not find another. I had found the maker because the new hat had the tag in it but they were long out of business. I was working in the clothing business and thought to ask a contact what it would take to have more made.  A cap maker said \"No problem. The minimum order is $5000.\"  So I shelved that idea! Nobody has $5000 even for so fabulous a hat!\nAbout a year later I realized that if I could sell the hats, I could do it. And to be certain there was interest and to help with the initial investment, I could use Kickstarter. So here we are! I am putting in the front money to get the project going. This is about $3500. (There's a video giving the details of expenses for the numbers people down below.) I am hoping you will want to share this fun, get a hat, or get one for a friend, brother or father, or just share the idea on your Facebook page.\nYou will find my website at www.theturtlehat.com. Please consider putting it and this Kickstarter page on Facebook or Pinterest or telling friends. \nMy daughters, now grown and married, hardly remember a time I did not have the turtle hat. For them it is rich with memories of relaxed days when Dad let his hair down. I hope you can have some fun with it too. I promise you new and personal humor will grow up in your family as you wear it.\nDisclaimer: You cannot take yourself too seriously with a turtle on your head. If you are easily offended or do not have a good sense of humor, please do not get a hat for yourself, get it for someone you want to give a hard time and have a good laugh with!\nI am including shipping in all pledges except international 100 hats. So there will be no add-on for shipping in USA.\nWhere is my original turtle hat? \nI deconstructed it with a seam ripper so we could make a pattern to construct more. I have sacrificed the relic so you too can have a turtle on your head.\nThe original hat, deconstructed for production.\n Below is the sample of the hat:\nPLAY\n\n  Updated expenses for the project\n    Rewards for this project\nRoyalty Free Music from Bensound\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks are past: Tearing apart a hat I love and sending that and the replacement hat to China for them to make a sample. That risk worked out the first time and I received samples. When I sent it to another factory for samples the hats were both lost and I had to send one of the new samples as examples to the second factory for them to make samples. It is all working out.\n\nThere may be production delays but I think it unlikely. The first sample was made in July. This will make the production schedule clear and near guaranteed. The factory knows what they are getting into because they made the sample and have the patterns.\nI may face the challenge of over subscription. This would be wonderful, I will just have to work hard to get all the rewards shipped to be received in December. I have already contacted a local fulfillment firm I can use if it looks like too large a challenge to get rewards shipped for Christmas by myself. \n200 T-shirts of each design are already printed and more can be printed if needed.\nThe luggage tags for rewards are being set up and will be ready to order when we know the number needed.\n\nOn further reflection and experience I am aware there may be challenges with US customs but I do not think they will be insurmountable or greatly derange our schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Ghost Turtle, a fond spirit", "descp": "I would like to send turtle post cards to everyone no matter how small their contribution.

The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5* players lasting 60-90 minutes. Each player is a deadly disease competing against other players in a battle to be first to infect and wipe out the world! \nBased on the bestselling video game \u2018Plague Inc.\u2019 with over 70 million players worldwide, Plague Inc: The Board Game combines the best bits of the original game with a unique tabletop design. The result is a game with a realistic theme and engaging gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone who likes the idea of infecting people with the plague!\nPlague Inc: The Board Game has been in development for almost 2 years and is fun, polished and has been extensively tested. Now we need your help to get the game manufactured.\n(* Base game is 1-4 players with 5th Player expansion available)\n  In return for your support, you will get a first edition copy of Plague Inc: The Board Game at a discounted price as well as a Kickstarter Exclusive - the Patient Zero Pack with extra cards which add new strategic options alongside some mildly humorous crowdfunding themed content. Other pledge levels are also available which expand the player count to 5 and add extra Plague Inc. content for enthusiasts.\n  As more people back the project - stretch goals will be unlocked which will add additional content and features to the game for free. (For all pledge levels)\n    In Plague Inc: The Board Game, players spread their infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points if they are dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but they must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before it can be infected. \nEach player is a unique disease. They start off infecting one country on the World Board - but soon they will spread.\nDiseases start weak and unspecialised but as players develop symptoms - they will become stronger and spread exponentially.\nPlayers choose which genetic traits they want from their hand of Trait Cards. More powerful traits cost more DNA points.\nPlayers can upgrade their unique pathogen by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points).\nThe symptoms a player evolves on their Evolution Slide significantly changes how their disease behaves.\nOnce countries become fully infected - the controlling player tries to kill them with the Death Dice! The more lethal the disease, the more likely the country is to be wiped out.\nWhen a country dies, players may receive Event Cards which can be played to gain an advantage - or hinder an opponent.\nEvent cards have unique and powerful effects. Experienced players may save them for use in devastating combos.\n  So - now you probably want to know how the game actually works!\nYou may be lucky enough to know someone who has playtested Plague Inc: The Board Game but for everyone else, here is a video to explain things a bit more. Warning - this hasn't been edited into a flashy promotional clip - it is simply me (James - the creator of the game) explaining the rules, playing a few turns and infecting a billion people or so to help you get a feel for the game.\nYou can also read the rules for Plague Inc: The Board Game here. (If you have any feedback - please share it in the comments section) \n  \u201cI can see it becoming a favorite at the various evil masterminds' tabletop nights.

Shipping fees are automatically added to your pledge at checkout. Shipping is US, UK, EU, Canada and Australia friendly to avoid any VAT / import fees (we believe in spreading plagues everywhere!)

See the 'Extra Copies' section below for more information. \nUPDATE 20th May - extra copies now possible!\nEach pledge level comes with a copy of the game - but sometimes people might want to add an extra copy to their pledge to save on shipping. \nTo add a second game to your pledge, you must increase your pledge by the correct amount for the game version that you want (so $30 for the standard game, $36 for the Plague Plus game etc.) To do this, manually increase the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nPlague Inc: The Board Game has been created in house by Ndemic Creations - the company behind the original Plague Inc. which has been played by over 70 million players worldwide.\nJames Vaughan (Lead Designer), Collette Tarbuck (Artist), Peter Choate (Designer), Rosanna Vaughan (Designer), Lynx (Cat)\nIn addition to the core team - a big thanks is in order to everyone else at Ndemic Creations as well as the hundreds of people who have playtested the game. We couldn't have done it without you :)\nThe game has been designed and extensively tested already. Now, your input and support will help make sure that the game is as good as it possibly can be!

Which graphic do you prefer? What would you want to see in a new expansion pack etc) We are also keen to get your thoughts on the rulebook which you can read here. \nYou can find the current Community Survey here.

We are passionate about making high quality, polished games that people want to play - and treating our community with respect.\n\nThis is the first time that we are making a board game (normally we make video games) which means that there are new risks and challenges for us to consider.\n\nChallenge: Is the game good enough?\n\nResponse: Yes! We waited to do the Kickstarter until the game was fully designed and it had been successfully playtested hundreds of times. For almost 2 years, the game\u2019s designer, James Vaughan and the rest of the Plague Inc. team have been carefully creating the board game so that it captures the spirit of the original video game whilst completely adapting the mechanics and simulations to provide a unique, high quality tabletop experience. \n\nChallenge: Will rewards be delivered on time?\n\nResponse: Yes! We have spent months planning how to manufacture and deliver the game and have spoken with over 20 manufacturing / fulfilment partners. We have a fully scheduled and costed plan with contingency time built in and will communicate regularly with backers to let them know how things are going.\n\nTo manufacture the game, we are working with Panda Game Manufacturing. Panda has made over 500 high quality Kickstarter projects and are known for producing many of the highest quality games in the industry.\n\nTo fulfil rewards - we will work with several different partners in different geographies, all of whom have significant experience shipping Kickstarter rewards.

Maybe the Vanguard is the option for you! The Vanguard is offered in all 5 colors of the Game Canopy trim and makes a great companion or stand alone option for the gamer on-the-go.\nThe Game Canopy Saddlebag:   $20 Retail\nThis zippered accessory bag is approximately 6.5\" x 10.5\" inches (only the bag dimensions ~ not including the hooks) created with mesh and matching Cordura\u00ae (you can choose what color you want for your \"saddle bag\" for this campaign, and it could be a different color than what you have chosen for your bag!)

This option is especially helpful for cyclists, and those times that take you on longer walks in the rain. The rain fly can only be used if you have a shoulder strap to attach to the D-rings.\nNOTE:   The following pledge rewards are not limited to the colors shown. The complete listing for all 5 color options, for both the Game Canopy and the Vanguard, are shown in the feature sections above [Pacific Blue, Hipster Yellow, Peacock Teal, Neutral Grey, Mandarin.]   You will choose your color(s) via a survey after the Kickstarter ends.

A clear vinyl layer will securely hold any custom name cards that fit within the Canopy Crest (approximately the size of a standard business card: we will update you with the final dimensions when the prototype phase is complete.)\nOnce the campaign is complete, you will be able to select any of the available/unlocked colors, through the survey, for the edging and the snap-fastened clasp for the Canopy Crest.\nThe Game Canopy Saddlebag $10\nThis zippered accessory bag is approximately 6.5\" x 10.5\" inches (only the bag dimensions ~ not including the hooks) created with mesh and  matching Cordura\u00ae (you can choose what color you want for your \"saddle bag\" for this campaign, and it could be a different color than what you have chosen for your bag!)

This was to be an event filled with Star Wars in the background and an array of awesome snacks befitting an unexpected party of dwarves. It was the day an epiphany would hit him that would change our board gaming paradigm, forever. It started as simple as this, \u201cI need a real board game bag!\u201d Picture ripped plastic, wet corners, jumbled contents and, most of all, the ruined gaming experience.\nWhile this particular quest, we were about to embark on, was not to save Camelot, we did manage to save the rest of our games from uncertain doom. Our desire was for a better way to get from one destination to another without the wizards of board game destruction ruining our game (k)nights. \u201cNi!\u201d\nStarting from that moment, Jason, Matt and myself joined together to create the Game Canopy and all of its traveling companions. Over the course of two years, we have come a long way to bring this final concept to fruition. It began with the forging of the great paper pattern, and moved, after a crash course in sewing, to the fabric prototype.\nHere, I will introduce you to Fieldtex: a manufacturer of high-end military, medical, industrial, and specialty bags.  Their portfolio includes the manufacturing of the USA Olympic duffle bags, for the Sochi 2014 winter Olympic games, that were designed by Ralph Lauren. From the moment we walked into their factory, we knew we had found the source to produce the bag of our dreams. We were treated to a grand tour, by one of the upper management staff, and got an insider's look at their quality and craftsmanship. After a brainstorming session with their highly skilled design and sales team, we fell in love with the prototype.\nAll great quests come with a price. This one is no different. When we first got the numbers for manufacturing, shipping, handling and overhead cost, we had a bit of sticker shock for ourselves. We realized, at that point, that the suggested retail price for the Game Canopy [including a matching shoulder strap] would need to be $159. How could it add up so quickly? The reality is that the dream of what we wanted, and the satisfaction of a well crafted piece of design, does not come cheaply. In all honesty, we understand that this bag is not for everyone\u2019s budget. Our hope with this Kickstarter, is to make it available for those travelers on the same quest.\n                                      We are dedicated to the creation of story and experience driven content, whether it be through illustrated literature, thematic board games, or digital interactive and video content. We believe that the story arc is what drives our innovative designs and fosters the projects we pursue. Creating stories is a rewarding and messy process that we\u2019re not afraid to venture into. From conception to completion we have no problem getting our hands dirty to produce the ideas we envision.\nThe team here at Level 3B has a wide and diverse set of skills ranging from design, color theory, motion graphics, video editing and sculpting. We also have several years experience operating, fixing, and modifying a range of 3D printers and other fabrication equipment. In addition to the primary team of co-founders, Level 3B is assisted, behind the scenes, by a large group of family, friends, and supporters like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have complete confidence in Fieldtex to deliver a great product in a timely fashion, there are always small chances that there can be a delay somewhere in fulfillment. Should this unlikely event occur, we will keep you updated as to all changes in schedule or the final product design.\n\nThe main risks for this project involve slight variations to the final color of the products and the Vanguard logo, as we continue to find the most pleasing color combinations, and the VAT and other fees for out of the country pledgers.

Producing the show is almost a part time job for several people.\nThe funds raised from this Kickstarter will help to offset production costs for the remainder of 2016.

It\u2019s a chance to host an unforgettable night of fun with your friends as you race against the clock to twist your brain around puzzling problems and cunning clues. \nWe can\u2019t tell you too much without ruining the surprise, but these are not just pen and paper puzzles. There are locked boxes! Keys and codes that must be found! Feats of dexterity, quests for knowledge and mind-bending brain teasers that must be accomplished.  \nEscape Rooms are a wildly popular new form of live gaming sweeping the country. The basic concept is a group of people gets locked in a room and has to solve puzzles both physical and mental in order to find keys and codes that will get them out of the room. In our game, we have all the awesome excitement, so players can have the same immersive and challenging experience in the comfort of their own home (and for a lot less money!). We\u2019ve done a lot of research and despite the massive popularity of Escape Rooms, there is nothing like this on the market.\nYou will receive a beautifully designed, fascinating box. You will take off the lid and notice that there is a panel that you CANNOT LIFT until you start the game.\nIntrigued, you will invite your friends over for the ESCAPE ROOM IN A BOX PARTY. You can even make appetizers, drinks and decorations from the Official Escape Room In A Box: The Werewolf Experiment Party Planner (which you found right under the box lid.)  \nThe day of your party will arrive, everyone will be excited and curious about what's to come. You will eat, drink, be merry and gather around a table to begin this once in a lifetime experience.\nYou will lift the lid and\u2026\nWe can\u2019t tell you any more without spoilers and we would never do that to you.\nOkay, we can show you a little more:\n                                                               Actually, it\u2019s better:\n1. Location: Maybe you don\u2019t live anywhere near an Escape Room. Maybe you don\u2019t want to drive to an unknown part of town or pay for a babysitter. Escape Room in A Box is in the best location (your house) with awesome parking (because it is at your house.)\n2. Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Like, $30 a person! That\u2019s $180 for your six person group! Our game is a fraction of the price for 152% of the fun.\n3. You won\u2019t be locked in a room: For those of you who love puzzles but hate the thought of being locked in a room, in our game you aren\u2019t locked in a room. You are just stuck with a box\u2026of AWESOME. And themed snacks.\nAnyone who loves Escape Rooms. Anyone who loves puzzles. Anyone who wants to host a super unique party. Anyone who wants a really fun team building exercise or ice breaker: companies, schools, clubs. Families who want something that will bring them together without being bored or staring at a screen. Also, just, everyone. Are you breathing? Buy this game.\nYes, the game is primarily a one time use game like the real Escape Rooms or Murder Mystery Night Games. As you'll see when you play, it isn't just solving puzzles, the puzzles are part of a complicated web of clues and meta puzzles that lead you to your goal, so after the first play you'll know too much!\nHowever, we want some replay-ability, so we will be selling a very cheap refill pack (included FREE with the kickstarter!) that will include a .pdf of the puzzles, replacements for the elements that are used up, and instructions for reconstructing the box. We will also include a \u201cgame master script\u201d for the host so that you take charge of certain elements (timing, hints, etc.) as you lead another group of your friends through their adventure and watch them escape their terrible werewolf fate (or not!). \nIf you\u2019re up for a room-sized adventure in a pint-sized box, then grab some friends and a little kibble (just to be safe), and head on over to this game\u2019s Kickstarter before its time runs out too! - Ryan (Cardboard Republic)\n                    Review from The Room Escape Artist!\nWe're on LAist!\nInterview on Fanboy Comics!\nWe're on Geek & Sundry!!!!!!\nReview from The Room Escapist!\nArticle about us on escape-rooms.com!\nArticle about us on Intervirals!\nWrite-up on Giant Fire Breathing Robot!\nWe're on Amy Poehler's Smart Girls!\nWe're on World of Wonder!\nMisplaced Pixels did an awesome story about us!\nWant to make your Escape Room Party even more immersive and atmospheric?\nLauren Rock of Boonzy Arts Candles specializes in hand crafting candles to enhance the gaming experience. She played our game and was so inspired that she created a candle that will make you feel like you've stumbled into the intriguing lab of a mad scientist with a werewolf lurking just out of site (in the most pleasant way possible of course). The Werewolf Experiment Candle is herbaceous and woody with slight hints of amber and citrus.\nThe candle is 8oz, 100% soy wax, has a cotton wick, premium fragrance oils, and features original Escape Room In A Box artwork. Each candle has around 50 hours of burn time, so you can certainly enjoy it before you game to anticipate what's to come and then after to remember what a blast you had. Scent is the sense most closely tied to memory after all.\nSome of you may recognize Lauren from her incredibly successful Wheel of Flame campaign last year where she introduced candles to enhance your role playing games (like Port of the Ocean and Forest of Enchantment).

Because we wanted to include quality components, real locks and complicated puzzles the game materials cost a lot more than your average board game.

They are designed to replace commonly used tokens and markers that are frequently used with board games, collectible card games, and role playing games. GameKnight Tokens have different icons on each side which doubles their usability and helps make them more affordable. \nA pic of our production samples\nSize of GameKnight Tokens\nMeet the Tokens!\nThe following is a list of all 21 of the GameKnight Tokens along with some recommended uses.  We're sure you'll think of many other uses beyond these.\nSet Configuration\nAt the end of the Kickstarter, you will receive a link to our pledge manager that you will use to indicate how many of each token you want in your set.\nBoard Gamers - since board games use a very broad range of elements, virtually all chips would be value.\nShadows of Brimstone\nCollectible Card Games (CCGs) Players - The Token Creatures, Polarity, and Health & Fatigue Tokens would be logical choices.\nSome CCG friendly tokens\nRole Playing Gamers - Many of the tokens would be useful, particularly the ones that represent combat\\spell conditions.  We've found it convenient to place tokens under miniatures to easily track which units have given condition.\nMiniature Games - Games that use miniatures are another example of how GameKnight Tokens can be used.\n Details\nGameKnight Tokens are the same size as standard poker chips which allows you to use a broad range of poker chip cases, carousels, etc.  \nThe chips are 39mm in diameter and weigh approximately 10g\nTokens will be manufactured in the United States using high density solid composition materials.\nCeramic chips are highly resistant to play wear.\nThe artwork is embedded into the chip surface via a dye sublimation process - will not peel like chips that use stickers.\nArtwork - many of our token designs were created by noted artist Raymond Gaustadnes.  If you are looking for Fantasy Art images, check out his site.\nPricing\nWe are trying something different this time - all pledge levels have the same price per token.  Buy what you need - same pricing. \nShipping\nTokens are heavy.  We use USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate boxes for almost all orders as this is the most economical way to ship.\nNote that the shipping charge we apply does not include any import duties or fees for countries outside of the United States. These duties and fees are the responsibility of the backer.\nNo surprises section\nOne of my personal pet peeves is to receive an item and find out that it falls short of my expectations. In this section I will try to give you as much information as I can, so that when you receive your tokens, they will be exactly what you expected.\nSize - standard poker chip size -39mm in diameter and are approximately 3.3 mm thick and will weigh about 10 grams each.\nColor - The colors on your computer screen may appear a bit more vivid than the physical product. This is true when comparing just about any physical object to an image on a screen.\nDimples - Another thing to note is that GameKnight Tokens have a small dimple on the rolling edge. This is part of the manufacturing process. It's very minor, but I wanted to make sure you were aware.\nAn example of a dimple\nAbout GameKnight Products Inc\nGameKnight Products Inc. is a small business that is focused on delivering products and services for tabletop gaming.

I'm here to present you with \"A Cosmic Journey\". I've always been a lover of the cosmos and to me, that's where Fantasy meets reality. This cosmic journey is both a collection of paintings I have done over the past year, and my dive into a new realm of art, all inspired by this fantastic universe.\nI've started branching out from environment design and incorporating characters into my artwork. I would love to create a series of beautiful and expressive images that combines evocative characters and majestic settings. It all began with this piece: \"Cosmic Musings\u201d\nOne of the biggest risks with going the route of an independent artist is taking the time to pursue my own unpaid work. It means possibly having to turn down paid work from companies. Not only will the money from this campaign go into production costs, but it will also fuel my personal work for months to come while I continue adding awesome artwork to this Cosmic Journey series for you!\nInitiative: Tabletop wrote an amazing article about the kickstarter \nI grew up with a love for art, but studied web design when I got into college. It wasn't until my fourth year of college that I realized I wanted to be an illustrator. Tabletop and video games were my favorite hobby, but what I was truly passionate about was the art in them! It's only been the past 2.5 years that I've been digitally painting seriously, but I know this is exactly what I want to be doing. Currently I'm making a living freelancing and love it. However, pursuing the goal of becoming an independent artist will allow me the opportunity to create remarkable imagery that doesn't require an art order sheet! I can't do that without your help!\n\nSince I started selling my work, I've been striving to source all of my production locally (if not from Michigan, then at least from the U.S.), so you can be certain that you'll receive quality pledge rewards!\n\nIf you're curious about the quality of the rewards you can see an awesome video review of them here from Raine at Initiative Tabletop!\nNolan Nasser's A Cosmic Journey is a mini art book clocking in at right about 30 pages. Each page will bring you behind the scenes drawings and sketches that were done for various paintings, accompanied by my thoughts as I've grown as an artist! The book measures 5.5 x 8.5 and will be perfect bound(Pages glued to binding) so you can rest assured the quality is high! \n\nThanks to you for all your support We're able to open up new rewards from companies I've worked for like Greater Than Games and 2cGaming\nNew Rewards!

I wouldn't, without a doubt, be able to do this without you.\n\nAs far as production and delivery, I get all of my printing done locally and have already been using these sources for some time.

My parents have worked tirelessly at their restaurants for over 25 years; seven days a week, only closing on Thanksgiving. The food and restaurant industry has been a part of my life since day one. On top of that, I just love sauces. If you know me, then you know that sometimes all I care about is the sauce!\nI graduated from Drexel University last year, found a nice corporate job, and thought I was happy. But I still had a longing to do something else. It wasn't until a few months ago that I was introduced to homemade hot sauces by a friend\u2019s dad. I was immediately inspired to create WUJU. I worked to find a very particular balance of heat and sweetness, perfected the formula, and had the sauce analyzed and shelf-ready. After I started showing the sauce to industry people in Philadelphia, restaurateurs, friends, family, and foodies, I knew that WUJU could be the next big hot sauce. \nYou can ask anyone. WUJU Hot Sauce is like no other hot sauce they've ever tried. With an array of spices added to a mixture of mango, habanero, mustard, agave nectar, and brown sugar, it\u2019s a subtle and powerful mix unlike anything else out there.\nBottling homemade WUJU by hand over Christmas; First unlabeled bottles produced by a manufacturer at R&D!\nAfter packing up 1,000 samples to ship out for Reddit (an online news community)\nAt the video shoot!\nWhat I will do with the funds\nThe main purpose for raising these funds is not only to get an amazing hot sauce to your doorstep and to adopt you into our WUJU family, but also to establish a strong foundation for WUJU to sustain itself as a business. Here are my plans if we get funded:\nReserve booths at shows like the All Natural Food Expo or the Fancy Foods Show. \nCertifications for Kosher, Non-GMO, and gluten-free.\nIncrease bottle sizes because people are using it like crazy.\nOrder more bottles at a time to drive costs down.\nAdjust and add new heat levels based on your feedback to ensure everyone can enjoy WUJU. \nSpeed up development of other exciting WUJU products: spicy mayonnaise, spicy ginger sauce, and spicy barbeque sauce. \u00b7\nGet into grocery stores and restaurants, to get WUJU into your hands easier and cheaper! \nI believe in WUJU. I have left my first job out of school to jump into this business with both feet. WUJU is a great endeavor, and it deserves my full attention.\n\nWUJU Brand Story\nI found it challenging to create a personality for WUJU. As I developed the sauce, I looked to other brands like Chobani and Honest Tea because of their simplicity and elegance. It took countless designs to get to this perfect one and I can't thank my talented sister, Serena, enough for all of her support and brilliant work in helping find the face of the WUJU business. My friends and family helped to guide me, particularly my inspiring friend Cody. \nI decided on a sunset background for the bottle when I saw an amazing photo of my friend Cody looking out from a beach into a sunset. Cody, my cousin, and even my mother have battled with cancer, and through their tenacity and positive outlooks on life, they have helped me push forward and pursue my passion. They embody the core brand message of WUJU, which is to always -- from sunrise to sunset -- do you.\nOur friend Cody\n\nTying back to a Social Good\nI have recently established a relationship with Drexel University's Center for Hospitality to provide $500 for every $10,000 of our revenue. That money goes towards their efforts in hosting cooking classes and dinners for The Hope Lodge, a place where cancer patients can stay close to where they are getting treatment.\nRewards\nExtra Photos\nSamples on samples... Shout outs to Andy, Linag, Robbie, Steven, and Locker for helping out with that!\nSome video shots from my killer video crew: Sam, Big Ben, JJ, Kathleen and Anthony.\nAlso a BIG thank you to some of the key players in helping me get the word out there: Nick, Carly, Andy, and Cheese, thank you guys!\nTestimonials from RANDOM Samplers\nFrom Reddit: \n/u/superstorm_sandy - Hey man! We just got your sauce and it is AWESOME! Thanks for sending it all the way to Alaska :) we'll definitely be ordering it in the future, very unique and yummy!\n/u/comaboy13 - Just got my bottle in the mail today after forgetting I had signed up. This sauce (medium) is damn good and is something that both myself and my family would love to buy. Planning on putting it on some Bubba burgers tonight Nd using it to dip our fries in. Spent a solid 10 minutes thinking about all the food this would work with so I am very excited to try it on fish and with various chicken dishes as well. Thank you for the free bottle and you won me as a customer with everything. The label, design, and the sauce itself are all perfect. I wish you the best of luck.\n/u/snorkle256 - Thought this was pretty tasty as well. Would be great on wings! Lures you in with the sweetness then hits with a little bit and leaves you with the \"smoky\" spices, cumin and curry. Yumo! (Received the extra hot.)\n/u/szheanyi - I got WUJU extra hot in the mail today and tried it with my dinner. I had chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn. I feel like this sauce you could put on almost anything. Mango is my all time favorite fruit, the mustard twang with the kick of heat is a great flavor. I would recommend this to anybody. The only thing I have to say negatively about it is the label. But its a good start. Straight to the point. I wanna try the others now! Keep it up! You're doing great\n/u/shepspc - My WUJU came today! I am a fan! I love it. Great flavor...sweet and spicy. And it's a full size bottle; I was expecting a sample size. THANK YOU! I will for sure be wanting to purchase more when I'm done with this bottle. Is there an ordering site? Cheers to Cody Schuler! edit: just saw that there will be a Kick Starter. Count me in!\n/u/Donnie373 - Awesome Sauce! Your friend makes some fine hot sauce for sure. I have 7 different bottles in my fridge right now and this WUJU stuff will probably be the first to empty. I gave out samples to 4 friends and they all want their own... actually, they want mine but, that's never going to happen. I'm definitely interested in the kickstarter campaign!\n/u/cutiekk17 - We just got our free sample today and my fiance LOVES IT! He is obsessed with it now and is afraid to run out of the small bottle we have!! I just went to the Wuju website to go order some but there's no way to do that. So i came to good old reddit to try and find some more info. We definitely want to be part of the kickstarter campaign!\n/u/thesmokedjoint - Got my sauce today, thank you. Awesome flavor profile. Good luck with your company, you should do well.\nFrom our Site: \nKyleneS - I received the bottle of \"just\" hot, not extra hot, but it still has quite the kick! I've tried it on steak, pork chops, eggs, fried green tomatoes(it brings out a bit of sweetness) chicken(my favorite so far) and used it as a spread on a sub sandwich. I love the unique flavor that it has and wanted to say thank you for the chance to try it!\nJenny - I love spicy foods but have never been a huge fan of putting hot sauce on my food. I'm more of an \"slice up a habanero on my nachos\" kind of person. My husband on the other hand has hot sauce with almost every meal, so I thought I'd try and get in on the free sauce and surprise him with it. I received my free sample of the extra hot sauce on Saturday and we were both pretty geeked that the bottle was a real sized bottle, not a small sample. I tried it and immediately was reminded of a hot sauce that I do love very much from a little restaurant in Boston. Since we no longer live there, this is a pretty big deal for me.\nAnyway, we're so in love with this sauce that we've been basing our meals around it. \"Will that go with WUJU?\" It's maybe a little pathetic of us, but let me tell you it's been an awesome week.\nI went to grab the bottle this morning to WUJU my eggs and noticed that our bottle is already half gone. Somehow we're going to have to make this thing last until we can get our hands on some more.\nNeedless to say, this stuff is awesome. Thanks so much for the sample.\nElisha - Hi there! I received your sample of the extra spicy and brought it unopened to a weekend beach trip with 14 other friends. We demolished that bottle and everyone was a huge fan. I especially love the thai-inspired flavor. Can't wait for it to be commercially available!\nC. Todd McCormick - THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE SAMPLE. IT'S GREAT AND I'M THINKING HOW TO USE IT BEST. CHICKEN I THINK. IN THE MEANTIME, SET UP A FACEBOOK PAGE SO I CAN LIKE IT AND ENDORSE YOUR PRODUCT. THANKS AGAIN, TODD\nJeremy C - I just got the extra spicy sauce and it's so good I'm going to start putting it on everything!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce funded, one of the biggest challenges will be fulfilling and sending these bottles out on an individual level.

With its combination of tools, it's bound to wow your friends and make your everyday tasks a lot simpler.\nOur focus for this key was to create a tool that is stylish, strong and most importantly functional. We focused on the importance of the usage. We took note of our everyday habits and focused on tools that we use the most on a daily basis and we started incorporating those tools into our design. \nMaterial: To deliver a long lasting experience, we decided to use Grade 5 Titanium that has high strength, low weight ratio and outstanding corrosion resistance.\nThickness: 0.100\"  Weight: 0.185 oz \nWe care for the safety of our backers. The semi-sharp blade is sharp enough to cut open a letter but not your skin!

Each key is precisely cut via CNC Water jet, grinded and brushed. We pride ourselves on quality and we want nothing short of that for our backers! In order to achieve quality, we will be using american made titanium and our manufacturing process will be held in the U.S.\nWe designed MyKee to be not only lighter and stronger, but functional and innovative. So we started from scratch, adding essential design elements to a deceptively simple but yet functional design. Patience has been an important factor in our designing process. We have continuously tested and prototyped different designs in order to create MyKee. \nWhat are KeeBits? KeeBits is our latest addition to the campaign! They are patent pending dedicated flat bit tools that are designed and engineered to work with MyKee. \nThe sole purpose of KeeBit tools are the added functionalities. KeeBits gives us flexibility and introduces new possibilities.\nHow it works: It's Quite Simple!

With that being said, I was held accountable for fulfilling the orders in a timely manner with quality in mind. However, even with a well thought out pre-planning, the fulfillment phase of the project underwent through bumps that couldn\u2019t have been predicted or avoided. Taking a dive back to when the campaign ended, our only concern was to get the keys to the backers but with 4500+ keys to be manufactured, it posed a difficulty for our first manufacturer responsible. The first batch of keys that were manufactured weren\u2019t quite the way I expected them to be even though our manufacturer insisted so. Long story short, I continuously worked with the machinist and the water jet operator, making few trips a week to make sure they were following on my demands. Working out the perks caused delays that were unplanned for. The same can be said about the shipping process, as we continuously worked with the helpful staff of USPS Santa Clarita Distribution Center to insure the packaging we chose for our international backers were appropriate as the change in prices that occurred in 2016 doubled the cost of shipping for us. The recent delays that were caused were due to us changing our manufacturing and engineering group and transferring all of our work and material to them.

We have made many improvements to our processes which will allow for faster production and fewer misprints so hang on to those rare coins if you have them!\nNew Thicker Coins\nMany of our new designs will be 3mm thick which will provide for more heft and a better feel. Sound is also important so if a coin is circle and 30mm in diameter, it will be 2.5mm thick since anything thicker would begin to sound dull.\nNew Boxes\nOur new box measures 145mm x 40mm x 64mm and is made from thick paperboard, laminated with a matte finish, and sturdy EVA foam on the inside. Each box will have a unique barcode, SKU, Description, and pictures of the coins on the bottom for easy fulfillment. Although the box will no longer have a view window, there will be pictures of the type of coins on the bottom so you can keep these for a storage solution. Each set will even have unique artwork for the tops.\nThis new design not only makes fulfillment and storage a breeze but it also provides better protection for the coins during shipping.

If you discover this after the project ends, you can pre-order the chests (with all stretch goals) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of the original Stonemaier Games Treasure Chest bring you 18 new types of premium, custom-sculpted resource tokens to enhance your favorite games. All tokens come pre-painted in the following configurations (no mixing and matching):\nFood Crate: steak, coffee, crate, bread, grain, and corn (28 tokens each)\nResource Vault: water, wool, barrel, bag, cloth, and steel (28 tokens each)\nEnergy Box: fire, gas, oil, uranium, coal, and trash (28 tokens each)\nThe barrel, bag, and crate can be used for any type of resource (e.g., if a game needs a rum token, it's in the barrel). Many other tokens also have dual uses: vegetable (corn), wheat or sand (grain), hazardous waste (uranium), etc.\nThe original Treasure Chest isn't available through this project, as it is currently in stock for you to buy in the US, Canada, UK/Europe, Germany/Europe, and the rest of the world.\nThe dimensions of each token are a little over 1 cm (height, width, length).\nFood Crate: steak, coffee, crate, bread, grain, corn\nResource Vault: water, wool, barrel, bag, cloth, steel\nEnergy Box: fire, gas, oil, uranium, coal, trash\nHuge thanks to sculptor Scott Wadyko for creating such beautiful tokens for us!\nYou can see (and add to) a list of games that use these resources here (or Google Doc). The tokens in the Food Crate, Resource Vault, and Energy Box replace the cubes found in many of these games. The crate, barrel, and bag tokens can theoretically \"contain\" anything.\nSome games that use resources in the Food Crate, Resource Vault, and Energy Box are:\nNote: Some of these games include resources that are concealed or drawn randomly from a bag, so their use might depend on how competitively you play. We haven't played all of these games, so any mistakes on this chart are by accident.\nAlso, some of the resources in these games are covered by the gold, stone, brick, wood, gems, and ore in the original Treasure Chest, which is in stock and available for purchase now.\nThe maximum number of tokens each compartment can hold is 30 (180 total tokens per chest), so we'll cap the stretch goals at that point. These stretch goals are included in every version of the treasure chests we make (there is no difference between the Kickstarter version and the retail version, except that the retail MSRP is $60 and will be in limited supply).\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 6 total chests per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional chests, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like your treasure chests within 1 month of receiving them, you can return them for a full pledge refund. We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited first run of these products as based on the final pledge totals.\nDiscounted Price: We will sell extra treasure chests post-Kickstarter for between $39 and $50 (compared to between $29 and $35 for KS prices).\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more backers we get, the better the treasure chests will be (see stretch goals). The Kickstarter prices will remain the same, but the post-Kickstarter price will increase as we add tokens.\nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--you will have a direct impact on the types of tokens we include in future treasure chests.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted products are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in a low shipping rate.\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and sculpts, but we can't manufacture and ship these tokens without your support.\nThe new resource token samples are currently in China with our manufacturer, Panda GM. They've tested the sculpts for durability and color and are ready to make the final molds if this project is successful, but there aren't any tokens created yet for reviewers. However, you can learn about the overall quality of our treasure chest series by checking out reviews of the original Treasure Chest here.\nWe selected the resources for these treasure chests thanks to the feedback from backers of the original project. Thus the resources in these treasure chests are set--we won't be adding or changing the tokens at this point.\nWe still want to hear your ideas for future treasure chests. We're particularly interested in resources that (a) can be represented in a \"realistic\" way, (b) aren't already produced by another company, and (c) apply to several popular games (not just one game).\nWe anticipate that some backers may want a ton of a specific type of resource, but our supply chain is based on creating one cohesive version of this premium product, making it affordable for you, and shipping it to you quickly and cost-effectively. \nHowever, we've worked out a solution with our friends at MeepleSource and Game Trayz to sell individual packs of tokens at a premium price ($10-$14 per bag of 25 tokens, plus shipping from the US) after the new chests are delivered to backers. So if there is a chest that contains only 1 or 2 token types you want to use (or if there are 1 or 2 types you need extras of), they will be available separately in late January 2016.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please contact Jamey directly at stonemaiergames@gmail.com for pricing information and manually make your pledge in full through Kickstarter during the campaign.\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory as add-ons through Kickstarter, we have special deals on some of our products through our website, Amazon, and retailers:\nTreasure Chest (US, Canada, Europe, Germany, other). If you only want specific tokens at a premium price instead of the entire chest at a discounted price, our fulfillment partners, MeepleSource and Game Trayz, will soon have them available\nMetal Coins (US, Canada, Europe, Germany, other)\nWooden Stars (US, Europe, Germany, other)\nTuscany Prima (US, Canada, Germany, other)\nBetween Two Cities (pre-order)\nViticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria are available from your friendly local game store and online game stores\nFood Crate, Resource Vault, & Energy Box: We prefer if you pledge through the Kickstarter interface, but if that's not possible for you, you can PayPal the funds to us with your mailing address, phone number, and a note about which chests you want. Shipping cannot be consolidated with other products.\nIf you don't see our games at your local game store, you can ask a manager to restock them. Thanks!\nOriginal Treasure Chest\nSome of the games that use the tokens in the original chest are found in the chart below (the full list is on BGG here).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith one treasure chest under our belt, we have a much better idea of how to mass produce custom tokens. It all starts with the sculpt. We worked with local hobbyist and sculptor Scott Wadyko to create the sculpts for these new treasure chests, then we sent them to Panda Game Manufacturing in China to test the tokens for how they fit into the molds.\n\nWe also learned about how \"inking\" the creases and cracks of the tokens can add depth and realism. Also, while we liked the original felt-lined box, the soft lining sometimes came off on tokens, so we've replaced it with a hard plastic insert with scoop-friendly compartments.\n\nMany of the new tokens require both painting and inking by hand at the factory. We've tried to identify any areas of concern in advance, but it's possible that some issues may not arise until we enter mass production. If they do, we'll work to resolve the issues.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the products arrive in perfect condition.\n\nFor 2 of those projects we delivered during the holiday season (Thanksgiving through New Year's), and we're not going to do that again due to the poor treatment of packages by couriers during that holiday rush and the sheer number of people who travel during that time and aren't personally able to receive the package (we highly prefer that backers provide a safe and secure address where someone can receive the package during the day to reduce the chances of theft).\n\nIt is for this reason that we've estimated January as the delivery month--it is a conservative estimate that factors in avoiding the holiday season and giving us ample time to get the tokens right.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "The Token Trilogy is live!", "update_content": "Hi!

All Cottage, Undercity, Overcity, Hamlet, Village, Capital City and Empire Backers are eligible.\nIntroducing Stefan's Volume of Maps & Secret Dungeons!\n  The Bridge Of Valor featured across two towers.\nStretch Goal Map -- The Bigger The Campaign, The Better It Gets\nThe map below shows the items that unlock at various total funding levels.\nIf you have trouble displaying it, please click here. \n Please note that Tourist, Cottage, Book, Undercity and Overcity pledges do not receive free stretch goals.\nWe founded Dwarven Forge in 1996 to offer the world\u2019s finest quality, best designed and most useable 3-D modular gaming terrain.\nNearly 2 years ago, we launched our first Kickstarter, Game Tiles, made from a brand new casting material called Dwarvenite. Dwarvenite is a proprietary, nearly indestructible compound that feels great in the hand and captures exceptional detail. While Dwarvenite is more affordable than resin, the expensive steel molds it requires make funding from the Kickstarter community essential.\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE POWER OF DWARVENITE!\nBackers\u2019 support for that first Kickstarter, as well as a second one in 2014 (\"Caverns\") was overwhelming. And in the course of making the millions of pieces needed to fulfill these campaigns -- and in shipping both Kickstarters on time -- we made important advances in every step of the process, including our casting know-how, our painting team, our quality-control and our packing and shipping.  \nMore than a decade ago, our founder, Stefan Pokorny set out to create a modular city terrain system inspired by the detailed maps he\u2019d drawn depicting Valoria, the capital of his world of Mythras. But after months of testing prototypes, our plans were thwarted by real world concerns: the city was too costly to tool and too complicated to produce. We just weren\u2019t ready for something so ambitious. But now, we are!\nThe base of the City Builder System starts with your main pledge (shown in the right hand column), which includes some amazing modular buildings. Qualifying main pledges also include a long list of Free Stretch Goals (which are added automatically in quantities that reflect your pledge level as the funding level grows).  Then, if you want, enhance your pledge with a dizzying assortment of brand new Add-On Sets at backer-exclusive prices, including streets, sidewalks, alleys, underground sewers, ruins, balconies, figural minis, battlements.  \nAlso keep in mind that these sets go beautifully with existing Dwarven Forge terrain. The end result: you'll be able to build an infinite number of highly detailed, incredibly sculpted settings for nearly any adventure.\nDawn on the High St.\nRuins!\nProtecting the Keep\nSearching the sewers for Ratmen\n\nOne of the key things to keep in mind: you are the master builder, and what's shown here is just an example of what's possible. The floors, walls, posts and roofs can be reconstructed in many different ways. You can build a single story 4\"x4\" house. You can build multiple stories. You can increase the floor plan and build wider, deeper, or both. You can use Tudor or stone walls, wood or stone floors, slate or terracotta roofs. \nAnd that\u2019s just to start. Imagine an assortment of new rooftops, chimneys, different walls, shutters, interior accessories. Now add streets and sidewalks, townspeople, signs, lights, underground sewer pieces. With even a modest assortment, you can play for years and never build the same setup twice.\nThe sketch below shows how the basic building easily fits together.\nHow do you get in on the action? \n1) Select a main pledge level (e.g. Tourist, Cottage, Book, Hamlet, Undercity, Village, Overcity, Capital City, Empire). These are shown in the right hand column and illustrated in the graphics below.  Please note that Tourist, Cottage, Book, Undercity and Overcity DO NOT come with Free Stretch Goals; For qualifying pledge levels -- Hamlet, Village, Capital City and Empire -- the higher the pledge level, the more of each free stretch goal you receive.\n2) Decide which \u2013 if any \u2013 Add-On Sets you want to include. (All pledge levels except Tourist may purchase Add-On sets.)  Click here to see the Add-On Sets. \n3) Visit our Pledge Calculator to add up the total pledge required for the items you want, or add them up on your own. \n4) Go to the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top right of this page. Enter to the total for the Main Pledge + all Add_on sets you wish.  Also be sure to select your Main Pledge Level (e.g. Hamlet, Village, etc), so Kickstarter registers your pledge. (Please note that Kickstarter does not capture specific Add-On selections; we will confirm this directly with you after the Kickstarter closes.) Kickstarter will then take you through the remaining steps. \nClick here to see a variety of sample set-ups showing various pledge levels with selected add-on sets are outlined in our photo gallery.\nIf you have trouble seeing the pledge level graphics, please click here. \nDungeon Gray or Completely Hand Painted Dwarvenite\nAll of the pieces in this Kickstarter will be made of genuine Dwarvenite. You choose between unpainted sets infused with \"Dungeon Gray,\" or sets that are completely painted by hand in intricate, exacting detail. The difference between these choices is highlighted below. \nStretch Goals!!!\nAs our overall pledge total grows, so will the size and variety of your sets! When the campaign hits key pledge levels, we unlock Stretch Goals. Some of these are completely free pieces that we add automatically to your base pledge. Others are larger, paid Add-On sets that will add a vast amount of variety to the world you create. \nThe higher your pledge level, the more of each free stretch goal you receive. Here are the details:\nTourists And Book backers do not qualify for Stretch Goals or the purchase of Paid Add-on sets. \nCottage, Undercity and Overcity backers may purchase paid Add-On Sets, but do not receive free Stretch Goal pieces. \nHamlet backers will receive 2X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nVillage backers will receive 3X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nCapital City backers will receive 5X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nEmpire backers will receive 10X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nIf you pledge for unpainted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will also be unpainted. If you pledge for painted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will come hand painted. \nOne other important point: just like our previous 2 campaigns, free stretch goals are exclusive to Kickstarter. After the campaign ends, free additions will no longer be available.\n  How do I figure out how much to pledge? \nUse our Pledge Calculator. It lists all currently available items (with photos) and will calculate the total pledge required for your choice of Main Pledge, Add-On sets (and any non-US shipping). Then -- and this is important -- go to the upper right of the Kickstarter page and enter your pledge amount (you also have to select a base pledge level).\nPlease note: if you want Add-On Sets, all you need to do is add the amount of your main pledge and all additional pledges or Add-On Sets together. Then submit this total pledge amount on Kickstarter.  You do not need to tell Kickstarter your Add-On Set selections; we will obtain these from you using our pledge manager software after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\nShipping and Delivery\nAs with our previous campaigns, US ground shipping (probably ground FedEx or UPS) is included. \nShipping outside the US requires an additional payment per base pledge and per Add-On set.  All these charges are displayed on our pledge calculator. While we will make every practical effort to smooth your delivery through Customs, all backers are responsible for any applicable import fees. We deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these charges.\nWe expect to deliver your Kickstarter product by January, 2016.  While we're working toward an earlier date, we need to budget a little more time this year to test the fit of the vertical pieces, just in case.\nIf you like what you see, please spread the word and join the conversation in the Comments section.  And if you have a chance, download our specially created avatars and downloadable posters, one of which we were honored to receive from artist and backer, Justin Martin.\nBefore closing, a few words from our founder, Stefan:\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Kickstarter is very special to me. While we actually decided to do a city years ago and are now able (with your help) to make it happen, you could say that this project has been a lifetime in the making. I grew up around architects and city planners in the greatest city in the world, NYC. \nMy father ran a small architecture firm right out of our 4 story Manhattan townhouse. His office and drafting studio were on the top and bottom floors \u2013 and we lived in the middle, with architects walking through our house from dawn to midnight. During the day they built miniature balsa wood models (I helped arrange the trees and the tiny people), and by night they drafted beautiful drawings. It fascinated my eager young mind and fueled my creativity. \nMy parents were European, and every summer they took me to Europe to visit relatives. From a young age I was deeply influenced by the ruins in Rome and Athens, and the storybook architecture of Prague, my father\u2019s hometown.\nSo it\u2019s only natural that when I started building my own RPG world, that all those projects and the magical places we visited came alive in my own work. I have never been so consumed by a project, or more proud of its result. This fully modular Old World city is an extension of my soul, in many ways crafted from the love that my parents gave to me when they adopted me so many decades ago. I present it to you with all my heart, and I ask you to have fun, and be the Architects of your own kingdom! \nThank you all so much. Now let the games begin!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been the in the terrain business for nearly 20 years, with a constant dedication to quality and service.

It is not exclusive to Deluxe Backers from Kickstarter.\nOrl\u00e9ans is for 2-4 Players aged 12+, taking 90 minutes. Now with all English language on the board.\nFor $57 you can get our special Kickstarter Deluxe edition, with metal coins and wooden tokens instead of cardboard. And for just $2 more, you not only get the deluxe edition of Orleans, but also a TMG original game by Andy Van Zandt, Bottlecap Vikings!\nA Brief Description of Orl\u00e9ans\nDuring the medieval goings-on around Orl\u00e9ans, you must assemble a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through trade, construction and science in medieval France.\nIn the city of Orl\u00e9ans and the area of the Loire, you can take trade trips to other cities to acquire coveted goods and build trading posts. You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.\nImage Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nIn Orl\u00e9ans, you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.\nOrl\u00e9ans English Rulebook (4MB PDF)\nImage Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nThe Deluxe Edition\nFor the Orl\u00e9ans deluxe edition, we have made the following upgrades to the base game:\nProvide Metal Coins (we still include the cardboard tokens)\nWooden Discs + Stickers are available for the workers. (we still include the cardboard tokens)\nIn addition to these, we can unlock with Stretch Goals further improvements to the components as detailed further down below.\nWe will only be manufacturing the deluxe editions once. Other than some extras made to cover damage, loss, and a few convention sales, they will not be available again from TMG.\nThe cost to upgrade to Deluxe Edition matches our cost to produce the upgrades.\nTom Vasel Reviews Orl\u00e9ans\n Rahdo's Final Thoughts On Orl\u00e9ans\n If you would like to see Rahdo's run-through of the gameplay, click here.\nAnd if you want the extended gameplay, well... Then, click here.\nUse this area to get rid of undesired workers and gain a one-time reward Image Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nStretch Goals\nFUNDED! @ $60,000 Funding - Add 16 wooden wheels to the deluxe edition for use in place of the technology tokens.\nFUNDED! @ $80,000 Funding - Add 14 meeples to the deluxe edition for use in place of the various citizen tokens\nFUNDED! @ $100,000 Funding - Add 4 custom meeple shapes to the deluxe edition for each of the individual players.\nFUNDED! @ $125,000 Funding - Tavern & Depot tiles will be included for the deluxe edition of Orl\u00e9ans\nFUNDED! @ $185,000 Funding - Add 90 wooden goods tokens to the deluxe edition of Orl\u00e9ans. This does not replace the cardboard pieces.\n@ $210,000 Funding - We will double the stickers for your worker wood.\nWhat is Bottlecap Vikings?\nBottlecap Vikings is a small box game (like Harbour or Dungeon Roll) internally developed here at TMG and designed by one of our game developers Andy Van Zandt.\nThe not yet quite finished cover for Bottlecap Vikings.\nIf you are pledging for the Deluxe Edition of Orl\u00e9ans, it is only an additional $2 to get Bottlecap Vikings, and well worth it. This is not a game on the scale of Burgoo or Coin Age, but more like Harbour or Dungeon Roll.\nIt is a quick and variable rondel game which has your decisions heavily influenced by where other players are. The rondel setup is variable, and so are the player powers...\nUpdate #5 was all about the game if you would like to read more about it.\nWhat If I Want Multiple Copies?\nIf you would like to pledge for additional copies at your tier level, then please just add the base cost of the tier again.\nSo, for example, just add $59 to get an additional Deluxe Orl\u00e9ans and Bottlecap Vikings. Limit 4 total outside of the USA for shipping costs purposes.\nWhy USA / Canada / Australia Only?\nThe nature of our agreement with game publisher DLP and the designer Reiner Stockhausen is such that we are only able to sell in the USA, Canada, and Australia on Kickstarter.\nOnce this Kickstarter is over, then we will only be able to sell in the USA and Canada.\nThe tracks where you collected workers and rewards. Image Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe LOVE Orl\u00e9ans here at the TMG headquarters. We personally believe that it was the best game released at Essen in 2014, which says a lot since we also like AquaSphere very much.\nWe love the game so much that we wanted personally to have premium versions of the game. Now, the cost to print and sell these through distribution is just too high!\nSo, we have added our cost of the deluxe upgrade to the game to the Kickstarter price without any profit added in. We want as many people to be able to have this as possible and we hope that you decide to order on this Kickstarter project.\nAlso, if you have Belfort, Village or Harbour, then you know that we like to have stickers on wood.

These two things are closely related, of course. \n\nTo address any concerns related to production TMG hired an operations manager in April 2014 to escort everything through the checkpoints and hurdles with our manufacturers.

Even with great strides being made in the name of gender equality and numbers of women in the industry increasing, female game makers are still in a great minority and face amazing challenges in our otherwise inclusive field.\nAfter compiling stories and advice for years, Elisa decided to write a book on the matter, and there is no better way to discuss such important topics than to include many voices with important viewpoints on the subject.  So, we've gathered together some amazing contributors to each add a chapter on various game topics for a book that has never been see before!\nOur chapter topics include:\nAnecdotes or stories about being a woman in the game industry\nAdvice for women on overcoming challenges women face in this field\nAdvice for men on how to make inclusion a reality in our great industry\nGlass ceilings, male co-worker dealings, and general inequality of women in the field\nCreating balanced game design for both men and women\nWhy games are important for girls\nDealing with \"fake geek\" or \"real gamer\" comments when playing games (or just existing) in mixed company\nTwo words: Booth Babes.\nFemale representation in games\nBeing taken seriously as a professional in a male-dominated category\nTips on getting your foot in the door at a game company\nThe pros and cons of Games \"for girls\" \nand so much more!\nWho is this book for?\nGirls on Games is for everyone.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGirls on Games is actually a pretty straight-forward project, but it has the potential to grow very large, with possibility of many chapters being added to the book. As a project like this grows, there is the increasing possibility that the editing of each chapter or adding artwork will take longer than expected. \n\nWe have a set game-plan, however, with strict deadlines for contributors, and we have plenty of book design and printing experience behind us. Elisa recently did the graphic design on the extremely successful Maze of Games puzzle book), and laying everything out for print is much like an extremely huge instruction book (not that we'd ever recommend such a thing) or Role Playing Book. Plus, Elisa runs a magazine (Cupcake Quarterly) on the side, and the layout process is nearly identical.\n\nWe lack most of the risks associated with the types of Kickstarters we are used to (ahem, full games) because we have no components to source or a ton of artwork to produce, so our risk level is very low.\n\nWe currently have 3 options for printers/fulfillment all lined up and ready to go, and we will choose the one that makes most sense when we see how large the Kickstarter gets - which is all up to you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Books have been shipped from the printer!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "The PDF has been delivered, and an update on printing status!", "update_content": "Happy 4th of July Weekend, Backers!\nLast night, you all should have received an email from BackerKit (where you should have already filled out your survey) with a download link for the PDF of the book.

I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! I spent all of my free time that week designing tokens, turn trackers, and other odds and ends to make. The members of my gaming group and I covered the cost of materials, and by our next meeting I had a big box of goodies to give out.\nSince then my tokens and other items have been seen at a number of local events. I've had many positive comments and requests to make more, but without my own equipment I can't meet the demand for what I've already designed, or bring new ideas to life - and I have a lot of new ideas!\nAs summer approached I began to seriously research what it would take to purchase my own equipment and set up a small shop so that I can continue to produce accessories for the games we love to play. I am finally ready to put the project out there and ask for help with the next step. I'm very excited about the possibilities that lay ahead!\nHow your support will help:\nA quality laser engraver is a marvel to work with and offers a wealth of creative opportunity, but the technology is expensive! Funding this project will not only allow me to share the great designs I already have with the backer community, it will also enable me to continue to create and share new designs in the future.\nPledge Reward Levels:\nAll artwork used is original artwork created for Azogames products.

With a variety of rewards for various pledge levels and a variety of add-on options it will require careful bookkeeping and planning to make sure that everyone receives rewards on-time.\n\nTo help solve this problem I will be using BackerKit, an excellent resource for managing Kickstarter rewards. BackerKit will make it easier both for myself and backers to enter shipping information, choose rewards and add-ons, and communicate.\n\nI have done production time studies during the prototyping phase of the project and have very good estimates for how much time I will need. In addition I am building in extra time in the case of overfunding or supplier delays. \n\nI will need a lot of raw materials to make the rewards themselves, and plan to order most if not all of them even before the equipment is installed so that once I am up and running I will be able to get to work right away.\n\nI know that I will need to spend a week or so getting my equipment set up correctly, and I have built in some time for that as well.\n\nMaking all of the rewards myself means I will have the flexibility to put in extra time where needed, but it also means that I'm responsible for solving any problems that come up. The vast majority of manufacturing problems have already been addressed during the prototyping phase of the project. I hope that I have built in enough extra time to address any additional issues that come up during full-scale production, and of course backers will receive updates during each phase of fulfillment.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dennis Chitko\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nI've always enjoyed making things.

All tokens come pre-painted.\nWe love how realistic resource tokens add to any tabletop game experience, and we want to share that with fellow gamers around the world. We've already created the sculpts for these tokens--now we just need your help to make them a reality!\nWe will add 1 resource token for every 100 backers (+1 gold after the first 100 backers, then +1 wood after the next 100 backers, and so on).

After selecting your reward level, add the shipping cost to your pledge total.\nThe following may be added to the $33 pledge level and above. After selecting your reward level, add this cost to your pledge total:\nAny backer may pledge to the $290 level--you don't have to be a retailer.\nViticulture & Tuscany are available for pre-order through our website, as are the wooden stars and lira as stand-alone purchases. We also have a few copies of Euphoria.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like the Treasure Chest within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ).\nHuge Discount: Based on the manufacturing cost, the Treasure Chest should have an MSRP of $60. We can keep the price much lower by only selling the first print run directly through Kickstarter, our website, and Amazon.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more backers we get, the better the Treasure Chest will be (see stretch goals). The Kickstarter price will remain the same, but the post-Kickstarter price will increase as we add tokens.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping prices for pre-ordered games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nWe Need You: We need your financial support to be able to manufacture and ship these Treasure Chests to gamers around the world.\nFree Euphoria Recruits: We're including 16 updated and revised Euphoria recruit cards in every Treasure Chest. They'll also be available from BGG for $5 in December.\nWe selected the resources for this first Treasure Chest with the help of thousands of voters on our website. Thus the resources in this Treasure Chest are set--we won't be adding any more or it would significantly impact the production schedule.\nHowever, we still want to hear your ideas for future Treasure Chests. We're particularly interested in resources that (a) can be represented in a \"realistic\" way, (b) aren't already produced by another company, and (c) apply to several popular games (not just one game).\nThe realistic resource tokens in the Treasure Chest are a great way to upgrade the retail version of Euphoria (shown here).\nWe anticipate that some backers may want a ton of a specific type of resource--for example, enough gold tokens to fill a swimming pool. There are companies that are really good at selling individual resource tokens...but we are not one of them.\nOur supply chain is based on creating one cohesive version of this premium product, making it affordable for you, and shipping it to you quickly and cost-effectively.\nphoto courtesy of Kim Euker at http://kiestone.smugmug.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Treasure Chest is a first for us in that it's not a game--rather, it's a box full of tokens used in a number of games. The challenge with these tokens is that they're all custom sculpts and moulds, which can be time-consuming and expensive to perfect. Fortunately we have lots of experience with wooden, resin, and metal pieces from Viticulture, Euphoria, and Tuscany.\n\nWith such precious components in every box, we're taking extra precautions to make sure the contents arrive safe and sound. Specifically, we will use a microfiber-lined box insert to protect the tokens from scratching, and there will be a layer of bubble wrap inside each box. The boxes will be made of very sturdy 2mm cardboard that can be stored vertically as well as horizontally without dumping the contents.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Token Trilogy and the Final Update", "update_content": "Hi!

Relaunch is currently scheduled for November, so if you're not already a backer, pledge a token amount, which will cost nothing, to get on the list for notification when Ex Labrys returns to KS.\nBeware the Minotaur!  In Ex Labrys, you must get your pawns across an ever changing labyrinth.  Do you move your pawn or move the minotaur to attack your opponent?  Do you change the maze to open your own path, or to block others?  Or better yet, both?\nAs you move your pawns across the maze, you and your opponents will be turning tiles, swapping them, and moving pawns and the minotaur around for best effect.  \nWhat's in the box: 30 maze tiles, 60 cards, 12 regular meeples, 1 Minotaur meeple, and the rules.  If the loot tokens are unlocked, they will, be in there too, of course.\nEx Labrys is a game I've been working on for a few years, as time has permitted. A theme change and many playtests later, it's ready for the public. \nNow I want to move forward.  Small-lot printing isn't cheap, but if I can get a few copies out there, I feel confident that it will, at the very least, give a few people some enjoyment.\nI want you to be one of those people.\nThe game design is substantially done, with thorough playtesting and adjustment.  What the game needs more than anything is great graphics.  I can do some of that with my own 3D modeling skills, but it deserves the touch of a real artist.  I have Robert Beachler, a talented artist, working on this.  It's looking good!\nThe prototype tiles.\nIn the meantime, you can have a look and try it out now, for free.  Just download the low res Print & Play, and see how much fun it is!  If you want to invest some ink, use the PnP with Prototype graphics (80mb). \nPlaying Ex Labrys is largely what you make it.  At it's core, you are moving pawns across an ever changing maze, making changes to build a path for your pawns as you go.  Depending on how aggressive you and your opponents choose to be, the game can be a relatively quick race, or \"Sorry\" on steroids, as you constantly send each other back to the start.\nA preview of the new graphics.\nSome playtesters will know this game as Living Labyrinth.  Unfortunately, I was informed that the name has already been used.  Fortunately, this was in time to make a name change before the art & campaign were finalized.\nAs a veteran myself, although I was never in combat, I have some understanding of the trials that deployment brings.  That is why I am planning to send copies to deployed, or deploying, units.  This will be done using an as-yet-undecided percentage of the proceeds.\nThis one is a little harder to see, an example of a Shift action.\nWhere will the money go?  The bulk of the funds will go to producing and shipping the game to you.  The goal amount includes payment for art and video services. After all promises are kept, what is left will be used to prepare for future projects, largely by forming a LLC and purchasing some equipment and software (and hopefully a dedicated computer) to use in further projects.\nRewards:\nNot much to say here, as it's all there in the right column.  If you want more than one copy, just add $20 per added copy to your pledge.  If we hit the $25,000 mark, you can make that $15 per extra copy.\nStretch goals:\n* Once the project reaches $25,000 in funding, I will add an add-on option to get additional copies of the game at a reduced cost.  This will pass some of the economies of scale on to you, my supporters.\n* At $35,000 I will add \"loot\" tokens, random items dropped wherever the Minotaur pauses, revealed when a pawn lands on the space.  Items include: a sword or axe to fight off the minotaur, extra actions, a pit which sends the pawn back to start and makes the space impassable.  Just a little extra touch to liven it up a bit.\nDigital Version: I am a software developer, and love Android apps, so there is a good chance the I will embark on an Android version in the future.  If this does come to pass, ALL BACKERS of this campaign will receive a free (download) copy.\nFinally, a note on the project timeline.

Don't worry though, because after all, it's Nothing Personal. The clue's in the name.\nThis campaign is to raise funds for the expansions, which are estimated to be delivered by October 2015. The reason for this? Well, they need art. A LOT of art, and art is expensive! However, if we get the expansions in our hands before that time, we'll send them out as soon as we receive them. After all, we want YOU to play with them! \nYou'll also notice that you're able to get your pledges in that include copies of the second edition of the game. These will be sent out in Fall 2014, so you'll be able to get playing as soon as possible! The expansions will follow in 2015, shipped at our expense. \nAnd now we're delighted to present a whole new bunch of reprobates and 'respectable' people in these latest expansions! Power & Influence and Associates bring a whole new selection of gangsters to play with, as well as introducing new rules that can be added to the base game!\nIn the original Nothing Personal, players use their mob family's influence to control gangsters and move them into positions of power. They look to hold the most influence over these gangsters and use them to increase their respect. Over the course of five turns, players will play influence cards as they fight for control over the gangsters. As well as gaining respect for the controlling player, they also bring in money which can be used to further your family's goals. Some gangsters have special abilities that can be used but your main focus will be on using the powers associated with gangsters' positions of power.\nHowever, players must be careful as it's easy to attract the attention of the Feds; gangsters could end up in prison - or worse. When the game comes to an end, the player whose family has gathered the most respect is the winner of the game! It's a game that allows players to make deals - but not necessarily follow through on them. It's a game of negotiation and backstabbing. One thing to understand... this is no co-op game!\nNothing Personal - Power & Influence adds a raft of new gangsters for you and your fellow players to bring into the game. New abilities. New characters. New ways to fight your way to the top of the tree. \nThe Associates expansion will add even more options to your Nothing Personal gang, meaning that no two games will ever be the same. Just make sure you don\u2019t catch the eye of the Feds!\nCHECK OUT THE ORIGINAL HOW TO PLAY WITH TOM VASEL!\n                                                       Game Salute Guaranteed is our promise that the Nothing Personal expansions will be produced with quality components and that you will enjoy the time you spend with the game. If you're not satisfied with the Nothing Personal expansions, simply return them to our headquarters within 30 days of receiving them, and we'll refund your pledge. That's our no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. \nWith Game Salute Local Support you can pledge for the Nothing Personal expansions here AND support your local store. Simply select your favorite local store when you complete your delivery survey and your pledge will benefit the store just as if you purchased the game through the store. Start out by using www.GameStoreLocator.com to find a Game Salute Select Store near you. If your favorite store is not on the list, be sure to ask them to sign up today at www.GameSalute.com/SelectStoreSignUp. \nShipping is expensive. We've calculated the cost to ship this game to backers around the world and we're subsidizing that to help keep your costs down. The cost to ship this game to backers in the USA is $9.01 for the Expansions and $16.47 for the Expansions and the 2nd printing of Nothing Personal. Game Salute is covering $9.01 and $16.47 respectively of the shipping cost for ALL backers around the world. \nThat means that the pledge level for US backers includes shipping. For international backers, we're passing along the same savings on shipping. Simply check the charts below, find your destination group, then follow the line to see your total pledge amount. \nASSOCIATES AND POWER & INFLUENCE:\nTHE ORIGINAL:\nTHE BIG SCORE:\nShipping at this level will be split sending out the 2nd printing of Nothing Personal and the Young Turks expansion fall of this year to be followed by the Associates and Power & Influence expansions in fall of 2015.\nTo keep the shipping costs as low as possible, we ship packages via a variety of shipping services depending on your specific location. We use USPS, FedEx, UPS, and DHL. You will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. \nWe are pleased to offer access to our game designers and creative team for podcast, blog, newspaper, or television interviews. Team members can also be present for conventions and event appearances with a timely invitation and appropriate travel and lodging expense allowances. Please contact Media@GameSalute.com to discuss any of these media support opportunities. \nIf you have any questions while our campaign is running or following the conclusion of the campaign, feel free to post on the main comments thread or email Kickstarter@GameSalute.com. Our service team strives to reply promptly to all questions and comments (except for when we're sleeping or eating or other basic bodily functions, and sometimes even then!) \nWhen we announce that reward packages are shipping, you can direct your inquiries to Service@GameSalute.com or call 1-888-57-GAMES (examples: when packages have shipped, updating your address, reconciling payment). \nOur service team is in the office from 9 AM - 5 PM Eastern Time and we always look forward to serving you! We generally post updates every few days during an active campaign. Once the campaign concludes, we post updates every two weeks. \nYou can follow us on Twitter @GameSalute, on Facebook (www.Facebook.com/GameSalute) and we invite you to join our Weekly Briefing email newsletter to keep abreast of all the Latest and Greatest in Games from Game Salute.

There are always potential bumps in the road that can slow down the project and cause issues.\n\nWe work with third-parties from all around the globe, independent game designers and developers, artists and graphic designers, printers and manufacturers, postal services and shipping companies, freight forwarders and customs agents, and in each of those individual operations there exists the potential for delays. We inform our backers about every milestone that we achieve during this process. You can expect regular updates about every fortnight, even if it's just us letting you know that we're still alive and working on this project.\n\nWe love your comments and feedback. Know that we read all the comments and suggestions, though we can't reply to all of them individually. We'll provide any changes inspired by your feedback in our updates. If you've got a question or comment, whether it's in person, by phone, via email, or on this project page, we appreciate it.\n\nYour pledge in this campaign is going towards funding the first editions of these expansions. Even with multiple edits and continual proofing, there may be minor typos, grammatical errors, or other elements that don't impact game play. If you\u2019re the kind of person whose enjoyment of the game will be negatively impacted by these sorts of imperfections, please do not pledge toward this campaign. We\u2019ll work consistently hard to ensure that everything in that final package is as good as promised, but we\u2019re human, just like you. We treat everyone we come into contact with as respectfully as possible and don't think it's too much to ask for that to be a two way street. Errors can happen. For those of us who can handle that concept without pulling a Veruca Salt, we'll have a grand time making something awesome!\n\nSometimes we need to make changes to a game after the campaign is done. These may be artistic alterations, rules rewrites, perhaps even converting components, and while we will always endeavor to let you know about any changes that we need to do to a project, please remember that the final call is down to us. Yes, we love to listen to our backers \u2013 you\u2019re vital, as without you the project won\u2019t get made, and suggestions from backers often find themselves ending up in a game \u2013 but if we\u2019re making a call on something that needs to be switched up, we\u2019re doing it with good reason. We\u2019ve learnt a lot over these past years and work with some highly talented people who really do know what they\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re alright with putting your trust in them and are willing to let them make an awesome game for you, we\u2019re looking forward to having you along for the journey towards making a game that you'll enjoy for years to come.\n\nObviously, if you\u2019ve got down this far into the Risks and Challenges section, you\u2019re OK with reading things. It's great that you make sure that you read EVERYTHING that\u2019s written on a page. The more you know about a game, the better you can determine if you want to pledge. We don't want you to get a game you won't enjoy; that's why we have the Game Salute Guarantee. We want to make sure that you go into this project with your eyes wide open and a brain full of detailed information about what you\u2019re pledging towards. When everyone\u2019s on the same page, that\u2019s a wonderful thing and it helps us all greatly.\n\nNow, sometimes life happens and a few people will want to cancel their pledge after the campaign has ended, and that\u2019s fine too. We can handle this for you \u2013 all we need is for you to email Service@GameSalute.com with your username, real name, and the Amazon Payments Transaction ID that\u2019s in the email you\u2019ll receive after your money is collected when the campaign closes. Now take note: when we receive your funds, we only receive around 85% of what you paid thanks to various fees and charges, so whatever your pledge was you\u2019ll get it back less 15% to cover those charges. Remember that you\u2019re also able to cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, so if you're not sure that you really want this or can't afford it at present, then this campaign may not be for you. It would be best to get a copy later through your favorite game store.\n\nIf this campaign doesn't fund, we\u2019ll be disappointed; you\u2019ll be disappointed\u2026 it\u2019ll be a sea of frowns as far as the internet can see. Unfortunately, not every campaign hits the necessary goal, and if this project does not reach it's target, then it will not get made. Game Salute has an excellent track record in getting our projects funded, created, and delivered, so while we are always confident in what we do, we are reliant on you fine backers to help make this project a reality.\n\nThanks for supporting us.

DICE UNLOCKED! WORKING ON BOARD OVERLAYS!\nUPDATE- STRETCH GOAL VIDEO! \nPLAY\n\n(If you've already been here, scroll down to check out our stretch goals!)\nToday there are very few options of tabletop games for blind players. A few traditional games such as Monopoly, Uno, and Scrabble do exist in accessible formats. These usually cost 2 to 3 times normal retail price. Any blind players who want to play modern games have to have someone help them transcribe the games themselves.\nTransparent sleeves will allow blind players to use braille to play with sighted friends\nOur campaign so far will allow us start producing a new line of products that would add accessibility to existing board and card games with far less effort. These accessibility kits would be add-ons to games that would allow both blind and sighted players to play together. \nOur first kits are going to be transparent sleeves for many different card games. Our base funding goal allowed us just to make these sleeves and our stretch goals will let us expand this to many more complex games. Like traditional game add-ons these products still require that a copy of the game.\nWe realize that some games may not have enough room for all their text on a given card so for those games we will using QR codes or reference sheets to make certain that the blind players have all the information that they need to play the game.\nQR codes allow users to use their smart phones on cards with a lot of text that are infrequently used. Game specific reference sheets will let players reference more frequently used but repeated cards.\nNow that we have funded we are looking into ways to do additional products including dice and board overlays. If we can keep the momentum up we can make much more than just card games possible.\nWe are also going to be releasing a tactile microgame Yoink that will be something that anyone, blind or sighted, can enjoy.\nOur Tactile Microgame Yoink!\nWhat are the stretch goals?\nStretch Goal Diagram\n$10,000 - Unlocked\nMore choices at end of campaign\n\nLarge Games: Munchkin and Dominion\nSmall Games: Guillotine and Hanabi\n$12,000 - Unlocked\nFree Color Blind Print & Play accessibility stickers for Hanabi, Battle Line, Set, and Race for the Galaxy available to EVERYONE!\nThese will be made available to download from our website.\n$15,000 - Unlocked\nMore choices at end of campaign  \nLarge Game: 7 Wonders\nSmall Game: Lost Cities\n$17,000 - Unlocked\nAble to produce braille dice for RPGs, King of Tokyo, or Roll Through the Ages.

I'm not blind\nIf our tactile microgame Yoink isn't enough to tempt you we ask you to remember that as a tabletop gamer one of the great pleasures is being able to share the games that we love with others. Meetups, conventions, game nights and more that exist for the sole purpose of spreading our hobby. \nThis campaign will provide a chance to share our hobby with an entire segment of the population that has been completely ignored. You can be a part of letting them in on the fun.\nWe aren't the only ones who think accessibility is important. We've been talking to publishers and are pleased to say that the following companies are official supporters of our campaign. Their titles will be among the first that we make sure are accessible and they are helping behind the scenes to make this happen. Just because you don't see their games on the lists yet doesn't mean we're not working on it.\nLogos\n3 Hares Games, 5th Street Games, 9th Level, Ape Games, Brotherwise Games, Cards Against Humanity, Cheapass Games, Crash Games, Eagle Games - Gryphon Games, Evil Hat Productions, Game Salute, Gamelyn Games, Indie Boards & Cards, Level 99 Games, Living Worlds Games, LudiCreations, Mage Company, Minion Games, Plaid Hat Games, Portal Games, Rio Grande Games, Stone Maier Games, Sun Tzu Games, Tasty Minstrel Games, Terra Nova Games, Wattsalpoag Games\nWhat is Braille?\nBraille is a code that was developed by Louis Braille in the early 1800's. A version of this system is used throughout the world as a writing system for people who are blind or visually impaired. \nRead more about Braille\nAre you just doing Braille?\nWe think that braille is an excellent option and will be our primary focus especially early. We are committed to accessibility in all forms.  Print disabilities such as color blindness, low vision, and dyslexia are a barrier to gamers and we want to remove those barriers.\nIt is our hope that the success of this campaign will provide a springboard that will allow us to address more disabilities. It is our hope that soon we can start addressing more disabilities such as Low Vision and Color Blindness.\nIn fact our recently announced stretch goal will provide free printable Color blind stickers for some specific games that have artwork that hasn't taken into account color blindness.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe equipment to produce braille products is highly specialized and expensive. Braille is mass produced using a device known as an embosser. It is a \"braille printer\" that creates raised dots by pressing into the paper. \nWe had been looking into companies that produce braille hoping to find one would produce quality braille to our exact specifications in a cost-effective manner and found no companies in a position to accomplish this. We believe that it is possible if we do it ourselves. \nWith the supplies such as the embosser, sleeves, the sticker paper, shipping materials, reward levels, Kickstarter fees and setup we estimate we will need at least $7500 to really get started making these sleeves available for sale on our website. \nIt is our hope that we will get a lot of support from both the blind and sighted communities in this campaign. Our product would only be useful for blind users so we have designed a small tactile microgame that will be fun for both sighted and blind backers.\nWhat are the rewards?\nWe will be happy to receive any sort of support. Everyone who supports this campaign will have access to our updates but if you are able to pay 10 or more dollars you will be entitled to the following rewards.\n[$10] Digital Rewards\nListed as a Supporter on our website so everyone can see that you helped make board games accessible to blind people\nDigital Wallpapers\nExclusive access to a digital download of In Touch with the Game, a documentary turning published games into an accessible braille title.

Players are not allowed to use their eyes so all players, blind or sighted are on an equal playing field.\n\nPlayers must feel the cards to determine when they have cards with all the same or different attributes. In the center of the table there are totems (we use dice) enough for all the players except one. When a player has a set that is all the same(or different) numbers, shapes and fills they will reach for the totems at the center of the table. \nOnce the first player has their set they declare 'Yoink!' and the remaining players scramble to get the remaining totems. Players who don't get a totem are eliminated and play continues.\nThis game was inspired by the good people at Set .. but it is a VERY different experience.\nDraft of Yoink!

We will not have large stock of games on the shelf ready to go. These will be sold on our online store that we will be adding to our website.\nWe will initially support a few titles and increase our catalog as we are able. We will initially plan to offer accessibility packs that are compatible with Love Letter, Tichu, Lost Cities, The Resistance, Coloretto, Phase 10, Uno, Guillotine, For Sale, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, Skip-Bo, Bohnanza, St. Petersburg, Pairs, Eminent Domain, Pixel Lincoln, Council of Verona, Dominion and more. \nWhat we add to the catalog beyond that is going to be determined by our backers, publisher support, and demand. If there is a title that you feel should be adapted right away let both us and that publisher know. \nWe can make it happen without publisher support but it will happen a lot faster if they are on board.\nGames with boards may require transparent overlays that are more difficult to produce and we may not have the tools to do an adequate job but we have some further plans for that eventually. Additionally games whose key mechanics rely on sight in some way may need to be adjusted or modified.\nNot all of these games are offered as rewards but they will all be offered on our website when we get it up and running. The huge differences in the number of cards made it too difficult to price some of these games appropriately into the reward levels. \nWe may run into some games that just do not make sense to make accessible but I am confident that these games are the minority. \nWho are you?\nRichard and Emily\nRichard Gibbs is a teacher working in Special Education. He has worked side by side with his wife on numerous braille literacy programs and has extensive knowledge of braille himself. However, his real interest lies in the development and design of tabletop board games. He currently has many games in various stages of development and two games as finalists in the Hippodice game competition. \nEmily Gibbs is a graduate of Louisiana Tech University with her Masters in Teaching Blind students. She has her National Certification in Literary Braille and has lead braille programs across the country. Currently she is working as a Teacher of the Visually Impaired and coordinating the Texas BELL Program. \n64 Ounce Games is the brainchild and merging of their individual interests. They got tired of all their blind friends not being able to play games. Therefore the company's goal is to produce high quality, engaging, strategy games that are also accessible to blind and visually impaired gamers. \nVideos\nHow else can I help?\nIn order to help us make the widest variety of products we need to spread the word. We would really appreciate it if you shared this on Facebook, posted on Twitter and shared this on Google+. \nWe have also made these social avatars for Facebook, Google+, Linked-in or Twitter to help spread the word.\nBraille Sleeves\nYoink!

Please watch the video above (if you haven\u2019t already), and take a look below, which shows what 2-set backers get. It includes 54 free stretch goal pieces (27 for each set) so far! Click to see the latest Stretch Goal Map or our Offer Guide, which lists all our latest Add-on Packs.\nIf you\u2019d like to back this Kickstarter, there are two key parts: 1) Main Cavern sets, now with lots of free, included stretch goals (pledge for as many main sets as you\u2019d like); and, 2) optional Add-on Packs, which add incredible variety to your setups. You must pledge for at least 2 main sets to order add-on packs.\nOur modular game tiles are like beautiful, highly detailed, handcrafted Lego for gamers, made of a specially developed material called Dwarvenite.  Dwarvenite feels great \u2013 and it\u2019s nearly indestructible.\nThe links below provide a gallery of photos and Offer Guide, with more videos here, and lots of details below.  \n                      Please note that the water is pure Dwarvenite, not an added acrylic layer. We have found this look is better, and the product much more durable.\n  Here's our \"Death By Caverns\" 60 second video for some amazing layouts.\nTHIS NEW VIDEO BELOW SHOWS DETAILS OF OUR WATER, STALAGMITE, MUSHROOM AND ELEVATION PACKS.\nClick on the image below to use our free online Mapmaker program.  You can see how all the new set and add-on pack pieces work together to form amazing layouts.\nThe background: Last year, after 17 years devoted to our beautiful resin terrain, we decided resin just wasn\u2019t good enough! Why? While resin holds great detail, it is costly and a little bit fragile. But what to do?\nAfter nearly a year of research, we developed an incredibly durable, more affordable and high quality casting material called Dwarvenite.  We launched Dwarvenite dungeon tiles last April on Kickstarter -- and your support was staggering. \nNow, we aim for the next level \u2013 deeper detail, more intricate shapes, dramatic depth and complexity.  We\u2019re proud to present: Dwarvenite Caverns! \nJust like last year, we face the same challenge: to produce Dwarvenite Caverns, we must commit to costly steel tooling and a high production run.  So once again, we're asking for your help.  In return for your support: exclusive pricing that won't be available and incredible stretch goals that won't be included after this Kickstarter. \nWe hope you'll read on -- and join us in making Caverns an even more exciting campaign than last year!\nWhat is Dwarvenite?\nIt\u2019s a non-toxic, PVC based material, specially compounded to hold precise detail, take paint well, and withstand a serious beating. About the same density as resin, Dwarvenite has a wonderful, tactile feel. And the pieces look great. In last year\u2019s Kickstarter, Dwarven Forge President, Jeff Martin threw the original Dwarvenite Game Tiles off a 10-story tower, and then ran them over with his truck \u2013 and there was not even a scratch. While we don\u2019t suggest doing that at home, Dwarvenite will stand up to almost anything\nWhy Caverns?\nAlthough their complexity makes Cavern-shaped pieces a little more costly than last year\u2019s straight dungeons, perhaps no environment has the dramatic visual impact of a Cavern. Yet creating a great Cavern is no simple task. You need exceptional textures, vivid shapes, rich detail \u2013 and the ability to create a nearly infinite variety of subterranean scenes.\nDesign and sculpting took months to perfect. Before starting, Stefan traveled to Mammoth Caves, the world's largest cave system, to study their formations. From the shapes of the stones in our cavern floors, to the subtle curvature of the stalactite covered walls, to the striking formations throughout, our Caverns will bring your game alive. The Main Set has beautifully detailed floors, walls and \u201ccorners,\u201d along with a ton of Kickstarter-only free stretch goals.  Special add-on packs (passages, lava, water, stalagmites, mushrooms, elevations) add much more!  \nDungeon Gray or Expertly Hand Painted?\nYou may choose either of two finishes. \nDungeon Gray is infused with a single color that looks great right out of the box. You can embellish these tiles by adding paint yourself. We offer custom formulated paints and brushes made specifically for painting Dwarvenite.  (Please note that add-on set features like lava or water will also be gray on Dungeon Gray sets.)\nOr, for a reasonable premium, pledge for Expertly Hand Painted sets. These are completely hand painted precisely to Stefan\u2019s specifications, perfect for a Cavern, and a great complement for your other Dwarven Forge terrain, including your Dwarvenite Dungeons.\nWhy We Need Your Kickstarter Support\nDwarvenite is less expensive to produce than the classic polyresin in large production runs. But the large steel molds make up-front costs extremely high, and that makes small production runs impossible.\nWith a successful Kickstarter, we can commit to a single, large production run -- and offer these Caverns to backers at an exclusively low price. The stronger your support, the more efficient our production, and the more generous our stretch goals. If our total reaches levels close to last year\u2019s Game Tiles Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be able to cover your table in incredible new pieces!\nThe amount of your pledge is up to you. But certain pledge levels qualify for specific rewards. The cost for (ground) shipping your Caverns to a US address is included with your pledge. To ship your Caverns outside the US, an additional payment must be added to your pledge as specified below.\nThese pledge levels are not eligible for stretch goals:\n$10: Your Dwarven Forge forum account receives a Caverns backer graphic.\n$25: You will receive a Dwaven Forge Caverns Backer canvas tote. (Non-US shipping: add $25.)\n$75: 1 Dungeon Gray Cavern Set (plus graphic and tote). (Non-US shipping: add $50.)\n$110: 1 Expertly Painted Cavern Set (plus graphic and tote). (Non-US shipping: add $50.)\nThese pledge levels all qualify for free stretch goals (1 set of stretch goals for every set you back) and make you eligible to purchase add-on packs, shown here.  Each level also receives a forum graphic and a tote:\n$145: 2 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $75.)\n$205: 2 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $75.)\n$210: 3 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $105.)\n$285: 3 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $105.)\n$325: 5 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $165.)\n$455: 5 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $165.)\n$615: 10 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $350.)\n$875: 10 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $350.)\nPhotos of the various pledge levels are shown below (most show the Expertly Painted Sets).\nIf you would like add-on sets, please add the amounts for those sets (plus any applicable international shipping) onto your total pledge amount. Please use this pledge calculator to determine your pledge total.  \nKeep in mind you must (and can only) select a single pledge level listed in the right hand column, even if your are pledging for additional items. Please be assured that  after the campaign closes, our Pledge Manager will capture the order details.\nNote: Free stretch goals are not included for 1 set pledges.\n   \n                               The graphic below shows the amazing amount of FREE Stretch Goal pieces you get with EVERY SET you back.  So, if you back up for 10 sets, you will get TEN TIMES the amount of pieces shown below (in the paint finish you backed).\nWho gets stretch goals?\nBackers for 2 or more sets are eligible for stretch goals (a 1 set pledge does not qualify).\nWhat are stretch goals?\nMany are free individual pieces; others are optional, larger paid \u201cadd-on\u201d sets, available exclusively to 2+ set backers at especially low prices. New stretch goals unlock as we hit specified total pledge levels.\nFree Stretch Goals: 2+ set backers automatically receive one (of every) free stretch goal per every main Cavern set in their pledge (e.g. a 3 set pledge receives 3 sets of free stretch goals). The finish of your free stretch goal pieces (Dungeon Gray or Expertly Hand Painted) will match your pledge. So, if you pledge for (2 or more) Dungeon Gray sets, your free stretch goals will also be Dungeon Gray. If you pledge for (2 or more) Expertly Hand Painted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will be Expertly Hand Painted.\nPaid add-on packs: 2+ set backers may purchase as many paid add-on sets as they wish by adding the appropriate amount to their pledge, i.e. \u201cover-pledging.\u201d*  You can calculate the correct amount to \"over-pledge\" by referencing this Offer Guide and using our online Pledge Calculator.  (Buying paid add-on sets does not affect your free stretch goal rewards in any way.) \n*You may also over-pledge to obtain more than a single pledge level (e.g. for one 2-set pledge and one 5-set pledge).\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal! $2,100,000   Wicked Cavern Add-on Pack -- based on backer input  \nWe will open an online survey to get our backers\u2019 votes for pieces they want for this pack. Stefan will pick the best ideas and he will sculpt the pieces this week (or as quickly as he can). Then backers can add funding to order theWicked Cavern Pack inside Fundafull, our Pledge Manager.

These metal pins are both stylish and functional, allowing you to take working dice with you wherever you go!\nWe've spent some time testing these and have found no end of cool uses and different fun styles we want to make, so we're excited to be running another Kickstarter to produce a wide variety of pins.\n\nSpinPins?\nSpinPins are metal pins that contain a back piece with an arrow and a free spinning front piece with a random element such as numbers. By spinning the front, you can randomly select one of the numbers on it (similar to a prize wheel or wheel of fortune wheel). The pin back allows them to easily attach to a bag, shirt or jacket. By ensuring the varied distribution of numbers around the wheel and by keeping the wheel a uniform weight, SpinPins produce a fair random number when spun.\nSpinPins are about 1.5\" in diameter and weigh about 1.5 ounces. They attach in the back via a butterfly clasp. While they're not nickel-free, you can get a rubber backer instead of the traditional metal clasp. It doens't prevent the pin from spinning as much, but it does mean the part that makes contact with the interior of your shirt, bag, etc is nonmetallic.\nColors and Styles\nWe will be starting by offering 4 colors of SpinPins: Purple, Red, Black\\White and Rainbow. In each of the images below the grey represents silver metal on the final pin. We hope to add an additional color via stretch goals, and you can get a custom color with the $300 or $1000 tiers.\nWe're going to start by offering 12 styles, though we expect to add more via stretch goals throughout the campaign. All of our styles will be available in each of the colors offered.\nD20\nD12\nD1%\nD10 (these will have a '0' instead of a '10' in the final version)\nD8\nD6\nD4\nD2 (Heads, Tails)\nRock Paper Scissors\nD6 w\\Pips\nFUDGE Die\nEmoticons \nWe'll be using a survey during the campaign to help decide which additional styles get added as stretch goals.\nRewards\n$1 - Our thanks for helping us bring SpinPins to the world.\n$10 - Any one pin of your choice (US shipping only, sorry.

That image is an older project used as the basis from which this project developed. This project is VERY similar in design, but you will see some differences.\nWhat Are These?\nThese custom-molded dice at 16mm and made from plastic acrylic. They will be made with the \"Elder Sign\" symbol shown in the pictures. The green \"Normal\" dice show an Elder sign on two faces, indicating a \"Success\" in many Cthulhu-themed board games. The blue \"Blessing\" dice show a success on three sides, and the \"Curse\" dice show a success on only one face, to represent the different conditions a player might find themselves in!\nUnlike in the photo, none of the faces will be completely blank. Each face of the die will have a small number in one corner. The purpose is so that the \"Success\" sides are more readily identifiable, but the dice themselves can be used for any game you can think of! With numbers on every side, they can be used in all of your board games, dice games, etc!\nSample Images\nDice sides - Cursed, Normal, Blessed\nLayout for Blessed dice\nAs you can see above, the numbers on the faces will be small but readable. The primary goal is to make the \"success/fail\" aspect of rolling the dice as quick and obvious as possible, while still maintaining flexibility in terms of alternative uses for the dice. \nDice colors - Ink color may be different!\nWhat Are They For?\nThere is more than one Cthulhu-themed board game out there that uses this \"Success/Fail\" mechanic. This works with any of them, or any number of other games you can imagine! Take these dice to the table when you battle Eldritch monsters in Arkham Massachusetts !

Playdek is excited to be partnering with one of the most legendary game designers, as well as you the fans, to bring out a refreshing, immersive new take on the tactics genre.    \nIn the hands of the veteran tactical RPG master himself, Unsung Story will re-imagine a classic game genre, as Yasumi Matsuno weaves together one of the complex and rich game worlds that he is known for, with inspiring class based tactics game play.\nHistory is written by winners, and tells the tales of heroes. But where there are winners, there are losers, and wars are not won by heroes alone. Behind the veil of history, there are countless stories that lie forgotten. Reliving these hidden tales is the concept behind the Unsung Story.\nUnsung Story: Tale of the Guardians presents an epic sweep of history through the eyes of the ones that make it, but are overlooked by the passing of time. It presents a fundamental twist on the hero\u2019s story, as it immerses gamers through the experiences of those lashed to the great wheel of history!\nThe Unsung Story timeline covers many chapters of the sprawling war-torn history of the fantasy world of Rasfalia. The central plot follows the struggles of heroes who fought in the Seventy-Seven Years War between great kingdoms and empires. \nThe story for each hero will constitute an episode, with each episode being comprised of many stages of game play. Each episode will depict a part of the Seventy Seven Years\u2019 War from the vantage point of various protagonists. Some episodes will span a single year, while others may take place over a decade or more!\nFilled with intrigue, warfare, betrayal, alliances and espionage, Unsung Story is a detailed and immersive game world that players will bring to life through their actions and decisions. It will tie you not only to the names that history remembers after the conflict has ended, but also with the characters behind these immortalized individuals. \nWithout these people, the unsung ones, the course of the history of Rasfalia would have taken a different turn. You will connect to these unsung heroes through your decisions and experiences, as you live these events through their eyes.\nFor more information about Unsung Story from Yasumi Matsuno, check out our Update #11 here:Detailed Design Insight from Yasumi Matsuno\nUnsung Story is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. YOU, the player, research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events. \nYour viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle. In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!\nBattles take place on a 3-D landscape, with an immersive player controlled camera, while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes. \nEach class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs! The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!\nThe character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can mold to your individual play style, and adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield.\nHere is a visual look into the game from a game play perspective. The battle system for Unsung Story is a turn based system that puts importance on speed for each units actions. Therefore, faster units will act on their turns first. The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player\u2019s party in blue and the opposing force in red. All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.\nInstead of a square tile system, Unsung Story will use triangular tiles, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.  \nThis image below depicts different target choices for the player in this triangular based system. In this example, the Active unit has three options:\n1) Use attack \u201cX\u201d on the adjacent Enemy A\n2) Use attack \u201cY\u201d on Enemy B, two tiles away\n3) Use defense \u201cZ\u201d to aid the adjacent Ally C\nThe attack radius shown above is a radius of 2, in other words. A, B, and C are all within the acting unit's range. A and C are well within range, and B is at the edge of the range. The purpose of this system is to explore what more can be presented to the player, by way of multiple action choices, while having a consistent six possible direction choices available to them.\nThis is a concept of what the look and feel will be as you play through the game. It\u2019s not an in-game render but hopefully helps to convey some of the level of detail that we will put into the game.\nIn Unsung Story, classes are spread across three game play types that allow for unique party construction:\nWarrior types that are geared for attacking and defending \nMage types that use magic for attacking, healing and buffing \nMonster types that excel in the use of specialized attacks\nWith this perspective in mind, the system is then made up of five primary class types:\n\nThis is a class connection map that shows the options for leveling characters across class types and professions.\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize attack power. They fight with long swords, massive axes, spears, and maces, for example.\n\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize defense. They are equipped with a shields and other defensive equipment, and will protect their party from enemy attacks.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield offensive and support magic, including the ability to strengthen a party\u2019s attack abilities.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield defensive and healing magic, and can strengthen a party\u2019s defensive position.\n\nThese are characters that command mythical beasts and monsters. The tamed monsters can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nAll of these class types have a Profession, which are a cultural/intellectual/craft alignment, and each profession has an affiliation bonus with another profession. \nA unit\u2019s primary class type and sub-class is determined by the type of weapon equipped, and by using various weapon types, a player\u2019s character can gain XP in any class level this way. Units will be able to freely switch between classes that align with certain professions, as each weapon will belong to one of the primary classes and any experience points earned will be applied to levels for that class.\nThese branches show various class types aligned to certain professions.\nFor example, equipping two different Defender weapons, the Knight\u2019s short sword or the Hoplite\u2019s short spear, will both earn experience points toward the Defender primary class level.\nWhat makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.\nEssentially, the system allows you to shape a unit\u2019s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.\nA Tamer Class putting a dragon under his control.\nThese four listed classes are the classes you will be able to choose from as your backer reward for all tiers that specify a Kickstarter Edition class:\nWar Mage: Profession \u2013 Clergy\nThe War Mage is a member of the battle caste of the Clergy. In addition to powerful magical arts, the War Mage can wield Short Swords, Daggers, and Slings, along with Grenade Weapons, and imbue them with enchantments.\nBallast Knight: Profession \u2013 Noble\nThe Ballast Knight is part of the Nobility, and heralds from the upper elite of society. This access to wealth allows them to bear costly yet powerful weapons and armor. Some of the weapons the Ballast Knight wields are the Great Sword, Short Sword, Axe, and for mounted knights, the Lance.\nPolearm Knight: Profession \u2013 Pioneer\nA Polearm Knight is the upper echelon of the rank and file, the commoners who make up the majority of the Rasfalian cultures. A fierce and heroic fighter, Polearm Knights are known to wield Pikes, Halberds, Scythes, and other pole weapons.\nAerolest: Profession \u2013 Estate\nThe Aerolest is a highly skilled, highly educated warrior, immersed in mathematics and the sciences. Known to design and develop their own secretive and extremely deadly ranged weapons, the Aerolest uses various types of Bows, Crossbows, and Scorpios.\nUnsung Story is the inspiration and creation of an incredibly talented set of veteran video game developers and content creators.

Click the image below to get started.\nA showcase of some of the more amazing models from this Kickstarter.\nREWARDS               \n Options\n                  Why are we doing this?\nThanks to you, our last Kickstarter was an amazing success! We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

All monsters have special powers. The attack and defense powers only take effect in a combat when the wacky die comes up with the sword or shield symbol (or both!).  Record hits by sliding marker clips up and down the monster card's hit point counter.\nMonsters have to go forward, but if you are moving a monster you don't like, you can have it waste movement by zig-zagging off into non-native terrain instead of sprinting along the clear path toward the finish. You can also have the monsters beat on one another. Did I mention that already?\nYou can play a quick game in half an hour or load up more boards for a marathon of mayhem!  This isn't your average race game where you move your piece and I move mine. Each player has a hidden agenda for how they want the monsters to finish. Players take turns moving whichever monsters are available.\nI originally published a version of Monster Derby with Gamesmiths in 1995. In addition to some new kick ass art by Neal Von Flue and production value upgrades, there are some key design innovations that make this the best version of the greatest monster road race ever! \nGame Play Summary\nEverybody gets an agenda card that assigns a value to the colors of the card stands for the monsters. On every turn of the game, each monster gets to move and act once. On your turn, you get to move any of the monsters that haven't yet moved or you can claim the starting player marker if it hasn't yet been claimed this turn. If you are moving a monster you like (has a high value on your agenda card) you want to zip it along toward the finish. If you don't like it as much, you might squander its movement to end in front of an enraged dragon or something. After the first three finishers, the game ends. Add up the points on your agenda card for those three monsters so even your least favorite monster gets you one point.\nPreview the rules here:\nsiadek.com/monsterderbyrules.pdf\nComponents\nThe game will ship in a bookcase box along with the following components:\n25 Monster cards \nSample Cards\n8 double sided full color map boards (2 each of 4)\nOasis board\n5 attack dice (red six-siders with three blank faces and 3 \"X\" faces)\n1 wacky die (six-sided with three blank faces and a sword, shield and both)\n1 regular die for movement\n24 agenda cards\nSample Agenda Card\n9 plastic stands\n20 marker clips\nKickstarter Exclusive\nEvery backer of Monster Derby will get an extra attack die and an extra wacky die with their boxed set award!\nADD - ON AVAILABLE!\n25 card monster expansion pack.
