It is a Hawaiian word, the one, the pureness. On behalf of Pono, we thank you for helping us give music a voice. You have helped to set the stage for a revolution in music listening. Finally, quality enters the listening space so that we can all hear and feel what the artists created, the way they heard and felt it.\nThis is done when the artist makes the best available, wanting to share it with you. It happens when the artist lets you hear and feel more than what is on your CD or MP3 of any song. CDs and MP3s are derived from the original masters, and now, with the PonoPlayer, you can finally feel the master in all its glory, in its native resolution, CD quality or higher, the way the artist made it, exactly. That\u2019s the beauty of Pono.\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. It was not easy getting this far, but you made it happen by supporting Pono\u2019s vision for better listening. We have been working with the labels, with the artists and producers, and we will continue to do that. We go to the source to find the best and bring it to you. Pono wants to preserve the history of music, in all of its beauty and expression, for all time. Forever.\nThere is a way to do this right, and we are going to do it. We will be sharing how we will do this with you over the next few months, while we build your first ever PonoPlayers. We are going to do some revolutionary things. We will make music available in a way that has never been done, a way that allows for constantly attaining the best listening experience.\nThank you to the artists, the recording companies, big and small, and most of all, thanks to you music lovers for making this happen with your amazing support.\nThanks for listening,\nNeil Young \n& the PonoMusic Team\nA message to Artists: \nFirst, we say \u201cthanks\u201d to all of you artists who have been here with Pono since the beginning. We are deeply grateful for your encouragement and support. \nWhen you and your recording team go into a studio or recording environment to create your latest music, there are many choices for you to make. Besides the studios, songs, players, singers, producers, engineers, microphones, and other equipment, you have the ability to choose from the numerous digital resolutions at your disposal to capture your sound. This is where Pono can make a giant difference.\nNow, whatever resolution you choose to employ for your recording process, your masters can be heard by your listeners exactly as you created them. You no longer have to be satisfied with MP3 or CD being what your fans hear. Pono plays back anything you can create, just as you made it, in the digital domain.\nEven if you record in analog, when you mix your songs and record them to an analog 2 track, you can copy that to the digital resolution you choose (preferably the highest) and have your listeners hear that exact recording. \nIf you are an artist who has been recording for years and this has been your life and always will be, your original creations in analog can be transferred to the highest quality digital and heard anew with Pono. No longer do your original recordings have to be the compressed sound of CDs and MP3s. It\u2019s all up to you. It is in your power to rescue your art and bring it into the 21st Century, preserved for generations to hear and enjoy. You can talk to your producer or record company and learn how to make that available to your listeners on Pono. \nIf you are a new artist, always released on MP3s and CDs, then your horizon has just been radically expanded. You can now record in whatever resolution you choose and your fans will hear the same quality you heard in the studio. You no longer have to lose part of your sound when it goes to the people. You probably know what I mean, having heard your creation when you mixed it, feeling that rush, only to be let down by the end product, the product your audience has had to accept. You probably know it was better when you first heard it than what they got. That is over. You are no longer limited by a format. Now your audience can hear what you hear. \nGo back to your digital masters and see what they sounded like compared to what was released. Now, if you want to, they can all be released in their original glory. If you elect to, you can make the higher-resolution sources of your CDs and MP3s available to your listeners on Pono. It doesn\u2019t matter what resolution you originally employed; if it is higher than what was released, and you can hear the difference, your fans can hear it. They deserve the best and Pono delivers it for you. Pono plays anything back just as you made it. \nIn the studio, with your brand new creations, high resolution is a great option. Resolutions are all different in their depths and textures. These can be used, and mixed together. A hook can be recorded in a higher resolution than the track it sits on, further setting it apart in your creation. So can a vocal. Resolution is a new tool for you to use. As long as you mix in the highest resolution found in your creation, or higher, everything will be captured. Especially, real echo and acoustic instruments, like drums, benefit from higher resolutions. Don\u2019t take anyone\u2019s word for this. Listen for yourself. Make your own decision. It\u2019s an artistic right you have.\nDoing this does not mean you cannot still make CDs and MP3s. They can be derived from your original masters. \nYour choices matter now more than ever before because your fans will hear the difference. Thousands of documented Pono listens have proven that music lovers can tell the difference between what they had before with CDs and MP3s and what they can have now with Pono. Look at the videos on ponomusic.com and see the reactions. Those are your people. They feel more from the music with Pono. \nHigh quality digital is wonderful to hear and sense. It is the sound of the 21st Century. Almost no one has heard it outside the studio. As artists, with Ponomusic, we have renewed opportunities for expression that have long been lost. \nThe Ponomusic player can bring new light to all of your creations through Ponomusic. \nRecord companies, this is an opportunity to rescue the art of recorded sound. Why should a Frank Sinatra recording or an Adele recording or a Nirvana, Rolling Stones, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Who, or classical recording be limited to the CD format for the future? This music is world cultural history. All of this cultural history should be preserved for enjoyment of the people in its highest possible form forever. In the 21st Century, people, and art, deserve this technology. Bring it on. Now, as never before, it is possible. \nOur listeners should hear what we heard. \nThanks for listening, \nNeil Young \nWhat is PonoMusic? \n\"Pono\" is Hawaiian for righteous. What righteous means to our founder Neil Young is honoring the artist\u2019s intention, and the soul of music. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been on a quest, for a few years now, to revive the magic that has been squeezed out of digital music. In the process of making music more convenient \u2013 easier to download, and more portable \u2013 we have sacrificed the emotional impact that only higher quality music can deliver. However, the world has changed in the last 10 years \u2013 technology has solved some of the underlying problems that forced that tradeoff. You no longer have to choose between quality and convenience when listening to music \u2013 you can have both. This is the fundamental idea behind PonoMusic. \nFirst Edition PonoPlayers: Black & Yellow\nPono's mission is to provide the best possible listening experience of your favorite music. We want to be very clear that PonoMusic is not a new audio file format or standard. PonoMusic is an end-to-end ecosystem for music lovers to get access to and enjoy their favorite music exactly as the artist created it, at the recording resolution they chose in the studio. We offer PonoMusic customers the highest resolution digital music available. PonoMusic is more than just a high-resolution music store and player; it is a grassroots movement to keep the heart of music beating. PonoMusic aims to preserve the feeling, spirit, and emotion that the artists put in their original studio recordings. \nWe are pursuing this vision by building a system for the entire music listening experience \u2013 from the original master recordings to the PonoMusic.com Store to the portable PonoPlayer. So now you\u2019ll hear the nuances, the soft touches, and the ends on the echo \u2013 the texture and the emotion of the music the artist worked so hard to create.  \nPlease see FAQ at the bottom of this page for answers to the most commonly asked questions.  \nKind Words from the Press & Our Backers:\nThe Washington Post: \"The Pono Kickstarter was funded because people wanted the Pono Player.\"\nMaureen Jackson, Kickstarter backer: \u201cPreserving the history of music. I like that!\u201d \nForbes: \u201cPono Music\u2019s Kickstarter campaign is actually brilliant.\u201d\nMark Sterling, Kickstarter backer: \u201cHow long was that? 8 hours?

It turned to reality.\u201d \nMark A Smith, Kickstarter backer: \u201cMusic is such a part of the positive legacy of humankind. Never Stop Creating!\u201d\nWhy should you support our Kickstarter? \nPonoMusic is about a lot of things, but first and foremost it\u2019s about the connection between the artists and their fans \u2013 the music, and the people who can\u2019t live without it. We see Kickstarter as a way to strengthen those bonds by letting musicians and music fans get behind the thing that matters most to all of us \u2013 the music itself.    \nOur Kickstarter is about bringing creators and consumers together.  It is about the formation of a community that values the experience of listening to music the way the artists made it, at the highest quality they can obtain.  \nWe also wanted to allow music fans to connect with their favorite artists in a special way through the campaign - we are offering limited edition Signature Series PonoPlayers from artists such as:\nElton John, ZZ Top, Portugal the Man, Grateful Dead, Kings of Leon, The Eagles, Kenny Rogers, Neil Young With Crazy Horse, Tegan and Sara, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Crosby Stills & Nash, Foo Fighters, Willie Nelson, Metallica, Patti Smith, Arcade Fire, Beck, Dave Matthews, Herbie Hancock, Buffalo Springfield, Norah Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Pearl Jam, My Morning Jacket, and James Taylor. \nThe Artist Limited Edition PonoPlayers have a non-metal casing with a chrome finish. They will have laser-engraved artist signatures, including all band members in the case of groups. They ship to you pre-loaded with the artist's two favorite high resolution albums from their own body of work. We will be introducing additional Artist Limited Edition Series PonoPlayers throughout the campaign as more artists step forward - so keep watching our pledge levels & rewards on the right to see new artists as they become available.\nArtist Signature Series: Neil Young\nArtist Signature Series: Patti Smith, Willie Nelson, Dave Matthews Band, Tom Petty\nArtist Signature Series: Buffalo Springfield (Stephen Stills, Dewey Martin, Bruce Palmer, Richie Furay, Neil Young)\nThe Grateful Dead's emblem will be printed on their player\nMore about the PonoPlayer... \nThe PonoPlayer is a purpose-built device, designed by world-renowned audio engineers, to do one thing and one thing exceedingly well - let you hear high quality PonoMusic as close to its original recorded resolution as possible, and therefore, the original musical experience.  \nPLAY\n\nYour PonoPlayer works in much the same way as most other portable music devices. The PonoMusic App (for Mac or Windows PC) provides you access to the PonoMusic.com Store, where you can browse, search, purchase and download high-resolution music to your computer.  You then simply connect your PonoPlayer micro USB cable to your computer's USB port in order to sync your favorite music and playlists. Then you can enjoy your music on your PonoPlayer at the same quality level as the original recording.  The touchscreen LCD allows for easy \u201cswipe\u201d navigation between songs, albums, artists, genres, and playlists. It also allows you to change the settings in the player to suit your personal taste. \nThe PonoPlayer has two output jacks. The first is a normal mini-stereo output specially designed for headphones and is meant for personal listening. The second is a stereo mini-plug analog output specifically designed for listening on your home audio system, in your car, or with your Sonos Connect \u2013 so you can share the PonoMusic experience with your friends and family. \nThe PonoPlayer ships with a total of 128GB. 64GB of memory is built into the player and another 64GB of memory on a removable microSD card. The expansion slot can accept microSD cards of up to 64GB or SDXC microSD cards of 128GB or higher. Unlike many other portable music players, the microSD cards are designed to be easily swappable. For example, you can build a library of various playlists or genres on different cards and simply swap them in and out, much like you'd swap game cards on a portable gaming console. So in reality you have infinite capacity on the PonoPlayer.\nHow many songs can it hold? That depends on the quality of your music files:\nCD lossless quality recordings (44.1 kHz/16 bit): About 5000 tracks. \nHigh-resolution recordings (48 kHz/24 bit): About 3200 tracks. \nHigher-resolution recordings (96 kHz/24 bit): About 1600 tracks. \nUltra-high resolution recordings (192 kHz/24 bit): About 800 tracks.\nThis is a LOT of high-resolution music, and we say, \u201cthe more the better\u201d. You\u2019ll get hooked on how good this music sounds.\nWhat do we consider to be high quality digital music?\nGenerally speaking, mp3 files have a bit rate of 192kbps or 256kbps.   These are highly compressed files and are much smaller in size than higher resolution music files.  The good news is that you can keep a lot of mp3 files in a small amount of storage on a portable player or mobile device.  The bad news is that they\u2019ve lost a lot of the musical information that often reveals the most pleasant and satisfying aspects of the music. It is mostly that sense of realism, dynamic range, and detail that higher resolution recordings typically capture in a way that restores the emotion in the song.\nOn the \u201clow end\u201d of higher resolution music (CD lossless, 44.1kHz/16 bit), PonoMusic files have about 6 times more musical information than a typical mp3.  With ultra-high resolution recordings (192kHz/24 bit), the difference between a PonoMusic digital file and an mp3 is about 30 times more data from which your player reconstructs the \u201csong\u201d.   \nThe PonoMusic.com Store uses FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) audio format as its standard, for compatibility, although the PonoPlayer can play most popular high-res music formats from other sources. PonoMusic has a quality spectrum, ranging from really good to really great, depending on the quality of the available master recordings:        \nCD lossless quality recordings: 1411 kbps (44.1 kHz/16 bit) FLAC files\nHigh-resolution recordings: 2304 kbps (48 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files \nHigher-resolution recordings: 4608 kbps (96 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files\nUltra-high resolution recordings: 9216 kbps (192 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files     \nThe Evolution of the PonoPlayer Design... \nOver the three years of PonoPlayer development, we considered many different designs and concepts. One of the early ideas was to make an accessory for a smartphone that contained storage for the music tracks along with advanced audio electronics. The phone\u2019s display would be used to navigate and play the songs, but with the songs would be stored in the accessory\u2019s memory. A Bluetooth connection would communicate between the phone and the accessory to select and play the desired song. This design was dismissed, for now, because it was very complicated to use and required two devices to play music.    \nWe talked a lot about making the player thin, to snap onto the back of a phone so it could be carried as one unit. But that meant you\u2019d need a different player design for each phone model, and we found that it was not possible to put some of the large audio components \u2013 required for the best performance \u2013 into a thin package.  This led us to design the accessory in the shape of a triangular \u201cToblerone\u201d shaped chocolate bar.  It allowed us to use larger audio components and to separate them far enough apart to prevent electrical interference between the various subsystems. It also allowed us to use a large cylindrical battery that\u2019s much more efficient than a flat battery.\n\nIt then became obvious that if we added a touch display, we could make the player completely self-contained.  It wouldn\u2019t need to be tied to your phone and there would be no interruptions from an incoming call while you were enjoying your music. It would be the best playback device ever for listening to high quality digital music. We realized that music this good deserved a truly purpose built, dedicated device to enjoy it. There was no \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d good enough for the music we wanted you to hear.    \nThis triangular shape also has additional benefits: it can be held upright for one-hand operation or it can sit flat on your desktop or home stereo system. The display automatically rotates depending on the orientation of the device. But the best thing about this shape is that we were able to include the best sounding audio components with absolutely no compromises. The PonoPlayer will certainly be recognizable on your desk as the unique product it is \u2013 the world\u2019s best sounding portable digital music player.\nCheck out more rewards...\nPonoMusic Founders Club: Kickstarter-exclusive T-Shirt & Sticker.

PCH International understands every step from design to direct fulfillment, and supplies products to many of the world's leading consumer electronic companies. \n\nThe PonoMusic and PCH teams began collaborating at the design stage almost two years ago at a meeting with Neil Young and Liam Casey, the CEO and founder of PCH International. As the design progressed, we worked closely with the PCH team to ensure the product was designed for high quality, high volume production. The PCH team includes engineers, toolmakers, a project manager, procurement specialist, packaging designer, and production specialists. \n\nTo date we have completed our tooling for first samples of the final enclosure, which have been used in building 50 units for testing, including listening tests by artists and audio experts. For these units we designed and built the circuit boards and did final assembly in Silicon Valley. \n\nOur next step is to do one more revision of our electronics board, implementing some specific additional audio technology from Ayre Acoustics. We plan to build 50 additional units for more testing. Once we are fully satisfied with our final design we will be moving from our current engineering build environment in California to a pre-production facility at PCH International in Shenzhen. We will then work with PCH to build out the final assembly line, install the test equipment, and do two more builds before beginning production. \n\nAfter several generations of prototypes and successive improvements, the latest generation players have undergone extensive testing for over six months. We now need to complete the final iteration of the design, conduct extensive testing of the player, develop and test our online PonoMusic.com Store, and move into production.\n \nPonoMusic.com Store\n\nWe are currently engaged with one of the world's best Content Delivery Networks to build out the backend of our PonoMusic.com Store. Furthermore, we are working with a fantastic desktop media center vendor to build out the PonoMusic App for Mac and Windows PC. This media management application will act as the hub of your Pono ecosystem. It will allow you to:\n\n\u2022 Browse, sample, purchase, and download music from the PonoMusic.com Store\n\u2022 Manage and organize your entire music library including building playlists\n\u2022 Load your favorite music on to your PonoPlayer for enjoyment at home or on the go\n\nWe are also working diligently on our main website, PonoMusic.com, where music lovers will be able to explore the PonoMusic universe, provide us feedback, collaborate with each other, and be part of PonoMusic as a movement for the highest quality digital recordings. We are very excited about the community of music lovers that will form and grow on our site.\n\nWe will begin to populate our music library with a great collection of high-resolution music. This is an on-going, never-ending process that we are eager to begin and will be delighted to continue every day at PonoMusic.com. \n\nWe believe that the risks described above are manageable, assuming a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\nRewards & Fulfillment\n\nWe plan to fulfill the product rewards directly from PCH International to our donors using 3-day delivery. We plan to start production in late Summer and deliver the rewards to our supporters in October, 2014. We will be keeping our supporters informed on our progress through the various phases of our development and production process. Delays, should they occur, typically will likely be due to supply chain lead times of some special audio components or any unexpected challenges in the ramping up of production. However, we have great confidence in the substantial experience of PCH. They are real pros.

How?\n1) We are partnering with a former designer from the Vera Wang Collection to bring you designer clothing at a reasonable price.\n2) Our production facility is based right in Silicon Valley and has worked directly with Nike and Levis.\n3) We worked along side the world's leading textile technology company to allocate the best hydrophobic nanotechnology on the market.\nSped Up Spill Shots:\nPLAY\n\nWhy Do You Need This?\nThroughout the day, our clothes are exposed to numerous things that can damage them. The biggest risk factors are the things we eat and drink. Ever spilled wine or dropped food on your clothes and had to change your entire outfit? SILIC is determined to help you stay clean.\nFeatures of the SILIC Shirt\n1.) The Design: We spent countless hours creating a design that screams confidence but remains simple. Our patterns enhance any figures torso which gives you a bold look. We need your help to bring our concept to reality. The final colors will be black and white.\n2.) Hydrophobic Fabric: The fabric has a nanotechnology bonded to the fibers on the microscopic level. Most liquid molecules will not be able to touch the fabric because of a microscopic layer of air that forms between the liquid and fabric. This is because the fabric is layered with billions of silica particles. Water based liquids will form a 150 degree sphere and roll right off! As a result, this barrier protects your shirt from potential accidents.\n3.) Safe Application Process : Unlike other hydrophobic nanotechnology application processes out there, ours is not cancerous. Our number one goal besides your satisfaction is your safety.\nWarning Label from NeverWet Spray\n 4.) Washable: Unlike other hydrophobic technologies that wash away after one cycle, our shirts are fully machine and hand washable. They will retain their properties up to 80 wash cycles. \nHow to Wash My Shirt?\nDo not use fabric softener Machine wash, cold Line dry \nDo not bleach \nWash with like colors\nDo not iron \nDo not dry clean\nTo reactivate water repellency, tumble dry, normal, low heat at least every three washes.\nWhere We Are\nOur prototypes have been tested to meet our requirements and the finished fabric is ready to be cut and sewn. We need to meet all the minimums to order this fabric and that is where your pledges help.\nWe have our concepts ready to give our contract designers who will create a finished pattern.\nOur supplier has ensured us they will have the fabrics we need when the time comes to order.

By pre-ordering your JewelGram you'll receive a coupon which can also be used as a voucher gift to the ones you love.\nThe Story\nSome months ago two Instagram-addict friends Gianpiero and Michele were discussing on how much it would have been great to have jewels with Instagram pictures printed on them. In fact, they thought, there is a famous citation that says \"Diamonds are forever\"... \"but pictures too!\" they said.\nJewelGram comes from this: it turns your Instagram pictures into jewels.\nIt happens that one of those friends is an electronic engineer and software programmer and the other one is a jewelry designer.\nThe Project\nMichele: \"I've been a jewelry designer and a goldsmith for more then 15 years and I put all my experience in this project. We've spent the last five months researching, designing and developing the most perfect shape to marry Instagram pictures to our jewels and this is the result: clean lines and special materials as gold, silver and glossy plastic.\"\nOur JewelGram collection is made in Venice (Italy) with high jewelry techniques and a strong attention to details.\nTo better highlight Instagram pictures we use the sublimation print which allows us to stamp any kind of image at a high resolution, merging it with the jewel, as we want to make sure your JewelGram, with your favorite picture on it, will last forever.\nFinishes and treatments of our precious metals (silver and gold) jewels are hand-wrought. So, like fingerprints no two such JewelGrams are exactly identical.\nProduct Specifications\nEvery JewelGram comes with a 0.98x0.98\u2033 (25x25 mm) area to print pictures. Considering that Instagram stores pictures at 612x612 pixel of maximum resolution it means that we are printing them at more then 600 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. Extremely good considering that human beings are not able to recognize dots printed over 300 dpi.\nOur plastic rings have the following European ring sizes: 12-14-16-18-20-22-24. Our precious metal rings instead are equipped with an adjustable ring size system.\nDesigning JewelGram Concept\nWhy We Need Your Help\nWe are almost there. The design and the first series in precious metals are ready and we've developed and launched our website, where you can play seeing a simulation of a JewelGram made with your own Instagram pictures.\nNow, kickstarters, we need your help to start the mass production of our glossy plastic jewels collection as the molds to produce them cost thousands of dollars.\nWhat we have done so far:\nDesigned rings and pendants for our JewelGram collection;\nDeveloped the molds to produce the precious metals (silver and gold) jewels;\nFound the supplier for the sublimation printing;\nProduced the packaging for JewelGram (see image below);\nProduced the first series of JewelGram made of precious metals;\nDeveloped the site to present our collection and a simulation that allows you to print your Instagram pictures on a Jewelgram.\nWhat we need to complete our project:\nDevelop the molds for the plastic jewels;\nDevelop an e-commerce section on our site.\nJewelGram Packages\nThe JewelGram Collection\nWalden Ring\nGlossy White Plastic Ring.

Financial backing \nWithout your support, we can't cover the cost of tooling and get a handle on the minimum order quantity we should commit to for the first batch. The molds for plastic elements costs thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Developing the Molds \nWith our experience in designing and producing jewels in precious metals we have been able to produce that kind of jewels quite immediately. On our site http://Jewelgr.am and on our Instagram profile @jewelgram we got a lot of requests regarding jewels in plastic materials. So now our challenge is to develop the molds to produce them. We have already contacted a supplier here in Italy. They provided us an offer with the cost details and they run a feasibility analysis that proves there are no practical risks in developing such kind of molds.\n\n3. Web \nlightNshape is the team behind the JewelGram project that is developing our e-commerce section.The team is the result of the collaboration of professionals coming from product design and software development. It is based in Venice (Italy) where we are currently producing precious metals jewels and where we are going to produce the next plastic jewels series. We also have collaborators in San Francisco, CA for software consulting, and at the moment our website server is located on the USA West Coast.\n\n4. Goal \nOnce we reach our funding goal, our first commitment is to send the jewels to all our backers. This will be straightforward as every backer will receive a special code which she/he will be able to redeem on our e-commerce site for the chosen reward (at no extra cost).

There's enough storage space inside to support short camping trips.\nSAFETY & DISCLAIMER    \nWe've designed the Oru Kayak to be as strong and safe as possible with normal use, but it's still a boat. That means you can capsize or get hurt.

We\u2019ve been working on the Oru Kayak for more than four years. Together, we\u2019re thrilled to launch Oru Kayaks into the world. We strongly believe that spending time outdoors makes people happier, healthier, and more productive. We see our kayaks as a way to explore and connect with the natural world, even in cities. We hope your Oru Kayak journeys are as fun and inspiring as ours have been.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!  \nWe thank you all for your support, and want to express special gratitude to those who\u2019ve helped us get to this point!\nphotography: Nicolas Zurcher. videography: Hei Cheng. music: Studiocanoe. kayakers: Coralie LeClerq, Joe Lee, Sally Madsen, Yvonne Mouser, Adam Reineck, Christina Seely. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike any innovative hardware product, the Oru Kayak is challenging to produce at scale. Our team has worked hard to address these logistical and fulfillment challenges in advance. One member of our team is a manufacturing expert with over 40 years of experience in manufacturing and assembly, and others bring solid experience in product design and operations. \n\nPRODUCT\nThe steps from prototype to fully-tested, manufactured product can be long and complicated; prototypes aren't always a reliable indicator of how the final product will perform. To address this, we have:\n- Built over 25 working prototypes, not just one or two.\n- Extensively tested prototypes for performance and durability. This has included extreme and abusive conditions, to make sure we have a product that meets rigorous safety and endurance standards.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nMaking a scalable product from working prototypes is another major step. Many comparable products have run into problems when a preliminary part turns out to be more complicated or expensive than expected. We have designed this product from the beginning with manufacturability in mind. We will streamline the process by:\n- Manufacturing in the USA, to retain tight control of operations, quality and logistics.\n- Using many of the same manufacturing techniques at scale, as we have used in the working prototypes. Our current prototype skins have been made and tested using the same types of dies that will be used in final production. Many other components are lasercut or off-the-shelf, minimizing tooling complications and design/engineering transitions between prototype fabrication and full manufacturing.\n- Using established relationships with contract manufacturers. We have built the skin prototypes with our manufacturer, who understands our product and specifications. We have hard quotes for all of the other components. Our manufacturing partners have vetted and approved our production plans, anticipated quantities and schedule.\n\nFULFILLMENT\nMany Kickstarter projects have run into shipping delays. We want to keep our backers happy! So, we are:\n- Maintaining a realistic timeframe for scaling up production.\n- Dividing production into batches: instead of trying to get 500 boats out by one shipping date, we'll start with smaller runs (for the limited edition and early birds), followed by two batches at a higher capacity. This will let us manage manufacturing and fulfillment at a manageable scale and pace.\n- Limiting the number of Oru Kayaks availble on Kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Manufacturing Update", "update_content": "It's been an amazing 35 days.

The Aervine bottle opener is a combined corkscrew and wine aerator. Over the last 2 years I put countless hours into this project because I wanted to get it right. Your bottle opener should add to your wine experience and not take away from it.\nCoolmaterial.com: \"Not only are your bottles of vino going to be easier to open (you actually turn the bottle not the corkscrew like you\u2019re used to) but you can open up the bouquet (man we hate using that word) thanks to the aerator.\"\nSwiss-miss.com: \"A beautiful brainchild...I'm backing this\"\nTechmash: \"The corkscrew has not really changed much over the years, you know how it works!

Luego podemos darle la vuelta al cilindro, quitar el sacacorchos y usarlo de aireador sobre la copa.\"\nishouldhaz.com: \"1 of these would make macguyver look like child's play.\"\nUPDATE Dec 24, 2012- Happy Holidays to everyone! There is only 6 days left and that is only 144 hours and we still have to raise $5222. I am contacting every blog, newspaper, radio and TV stations I can think of to get the word out there. We have to make the $10,000 goal by the morning of the 31st to make this a reality so please help spread the word.  I have no doubt we can make this happen.\nUPDATE Dec 22, 2012- A big thank you to all of our supports. With only 8 days left there is still much work to be done to get the word out there so please help spread the word. All blog, twitter or facebook post will help. Here is a link to the Aervine kickstarter project if you want to copy and past the link:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/418696790/aervine-a-combined-corkscrew-and-wine-aerator\nUPDATE Dec 19, 2012- Time for something positive! #26acts, I am all in.\nUPDATE Dec 7, 2012- Aluminum versions are done and photos added below.\nUPDATE-Dec 6, 2012- Just had 2 aluminum openers turned on a lathe by my Canadian friend and they are AWESOME! He turned them for a bottle of crown royal. Very cool. I included a picture below so you can get an idea of what they are going to look like. They are not done yet so they will only get better. Tomorrow the openers will be threaded, glass bead blasted and then anodized. After I get that done I will get more photos up.\nUPDATE- Dec 3, 2012- Added aluminum Aervine Bottle opener version for rewards. Replace the acrylic with aluminum, will have same finish as handle. Will have photos up for the aluminum version on Saturday Dec 8th or Sunday dec 9th. \nThe aervine bottle opener is designed to work a little differently from other corkscrews. The corkscrew threads into the bottle opener the same way a bolt threads into a nut. With this design you turn the bottle into the corkscrew rather then turning the corkscrew into the cork.\nAn advantage of this ergonomic design allows you to hold the bottle opener with one hand and the bottle with the other to break the cork free. You never lose control of the bottle when removing a cork and it just feels right when using the corkscrew without awkward hand and wrist positions.\nAnother advantage of this design is the ability to remove the cork without putting a hole completely through it. Some wine drinkers would prefer to have a glass or two of wine and then reseal the bottle with the same cork. A traditional corkscrew punctures the cork top to bottom so the cork cannot reseal the bottle again. The Aervine bottle opener can remove the cork and keep the cork intact giving you a much better chance to reseal the bottle and preserve that expensive bottle of wine for another day\nThe patent pending design also includes a wine aerator. Many red wines need to breathe before you can drink them making for a better tasting wine. To use the Aervine bottle opener as a wine aerator simply remove the corkscrew, hold the aerator over a glass and pour wine through it. You can enjoy your wine instantly and not have to wait for it to decant. You could spend $40 on just an aerator but with your Aervine bottle opener the aerator is included.  \nThe materials used are all food safe. The handle is made from aircraft aluminum, the corkscrew from stainless steel, and the body from cast acrylic or aluminum. Why cast acrylic? I used cast acrylic because it is food safe and there are no BPA's or any other harmful chemicals in cast acrylic.  It is also the strongest type of acrylic and is not damaged by UV rays. \nMost wine aerators are made with polycarbonate and BPA is in all polycarbonates. We will never use any materials with BPA or any other harmful materials to make our products. \nI also used a different approach with building this bottle opener. I wanted to use CNC machined parts with no glues or adhesives. CNC machined parts have a better fit and finish and the parts have no seems. Machined parts can also be built with stronger materials resulting in a better bottle opener. Nobody else is building a bottle opener like this.\nThe aluminum handle is glass bead blasted and then hardened. It has the same type of finish as Apple's aluminum laptops. I wanted it to be a simple minimal design that was built to last.\nHave your Aervine bottle opener engraved with up to 10 characters. We will set up a CNC machine just for engraving. This is a much more expensive and time consuming way to engrave but it's a better way and it fits with the character of the opener.  Laser engraving would be faster and cheaper but it's just not as good as CNC machining.  \nYour Aervine bottle opener will come with a cotton drawstring bag to protect it while not in use.\nThe Aervine bottle opener will retail for $44 plus $4 for engraving plus shipping and handling.  Kickstarters will be getting a significant discount for supporting this project.   \nWith your help we hope to get enough orders to cover the tooling cost and material cost for the first production run.\nPlease help spread the word about this project.\nYour support is greatly appreciated!\nWe just added photos for the all aluminum version below. It's a beautiful, classic design. I have never seen a cooler bottle opener. I love it.\nThe all aluminum version will use the same aircraft aluminum and have the same glass bead blasted finish as the handle. It will be CNC machined from a solid piece of aluminum and we did nothing to reduce the weight of it. With a weight of just over 12oz or 320 grams it feels just like it should in your hand. The bottle opener was already in the aluminum, we just took away the material that should not have been there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been an industial engineer for about 20 years now and I have been involved in product launches for all of those years. Most of my background is in automotive and I have also done consulting work for many parts suppliers. Lean manufactuing is what I do for a living. Over the years I have seen just about everything that can go wrong with product launches. I think I can avoid most of those problems. \n\nAfter the project is funded it will be critical to get things moving quickly. Materials will have to be ordered and then sent to the machine shop to have the CNC lathe work done on the acrylic body and the aluminum handle. The machine shop will need 4 - 5 weeks to machine those parts. \n\nAfter the machine shop is done with their part I will do some additional machining on the acrylic and handle in my own shop. The acrylic will need to have threads put in for the corkscrew and the hole for the aerator. The handle will need to be slotted and engraved. The handle will also be deburred, polished, glass bead blasted, anodized and sealed. This process takes time but it's the right way to build it. \n\nSo the biggest challenge will be to stay on schedule and not fall behind with timing. Things can be held up easily and it's hard to make up for lost time. We also have the occasional winter storm in Cleveland. \n\nI will do all I can to pull parts from the supplier as they are made to speed things up. The machining will all be done in the Cleveland area so it will be easy for me to keep an eye on things and it may be possible for me to do better with timing but I will not know that until things are moving along. \n \nI have an overseas supplier for the corkscrews but as soon as I can find an American supplier I will have them made in the US. I will do all I can to get that part made in the US. \n\nPlease help get the word out about my project. I want to do my part to help create jobs in the US and I need your help with this project to make it happen.

Perhaps the thinest concrete pen in the world, it boasts the first unified concrete design. Compatible with many of the most appreciated ink refills.  The Contribute Case is a unique design in itself. \nAs a Pen enthusiast, I was motivated to design a pen that showcases the advancements in concrete functionality and one that makes a versatile and unique addition to ones pen collection.   \nIn addition to pushing the bounds of what concrete can do, successful funding of the Contribute Project will also help to pass on some great opportunities!  The experience of incredible concrete objects is just the beginning of what I hope will contribute to others. \n____________________________________\nRewards:\nI've been experimenting, researching, and testing concrete mix design for five years.

Because I've created with technological materials and developed innovate manufacturing, I've engineered a concrete mix that enables me to produce a sleek, durable, and versatile concrete pen. \nContribute products are made with extraordinary concrete. As you can see, it's exceptionally beautiful.  This concrete is way beyond the strength of common construction concrete.  In fact, this pen would not be possible without using the precise recipe and manufacturing techniques I've developed.  No other concrete pen compares to this!\nUnlike other concrete pens, the Contribute Pen is structurally supported with engineered concrete and neodymium magnets.  The Pen body and back cap are joined together with a spring-plunger.  Ink refills are changed by unscrewing the back cap and spring plunger.\nWrites How You Like\nLike some of my personal favorite pen housings, the Contribute Pen accommodates several different ink refills making it the perfect fit for any job you have in mind.  \nContribute has a very balanced feel.  You will find it surprisingly light as it weighs 1.6 oz when housing the Signo-DX.  Although smooth and polished, the concrete grips your hand, but feels soft.  If you've touched a highly polished piece of marble, this would be a similar feel.  Contribute takes on the ambient room temperature and will warm with your touch.  \nThis Growing List of Compatible Refills:\nCross Switch-it #8780 (manual adjust pencil height)\nCross Ball-Point #8101-2\nFisher Cross Type ** (needs to be tested but looks like a fit)\nPentel EnerGel #72512 (also fine: 24375 6) **\nPilot High Tec-C Cavalier \nPilot High Tec-C \nPilot G2 Gel Rollerball #77240\nPilot Q7 #77245 **\nPilot V-Ball #77285 **\nUni-Ball Gel #207 \nUni-Ball Signo (DX)\n** to accommodate a wider variety of ink refills a spacer will be provided with your pen.

I was considering the option to help hold the pen in my shirt pocket or prevent it from rolling out of a notebook.  If the button is placed near either end of the pen (where the magnets are) the two will join.  Although the holding strength is about 1lbs., the button does a great job of holding the pen cap if you prefer the shorter pen length while in use. \nI'm excited to see how others will use the button.  I think it could make a great addition to a notebook or bag next to where you will store the pen.  Or, it can be a decorative button with secret powers.  Maybe a handy paper clip holder for your administrative friends?   \nTop Center Button features circle and black concrete option\n____________________________________\nThe Contribute Case\nContribute Case in Black Palm (bio-based natural finish)\nPoints of Excellence:\nHardwood\nHandmade & Finished \u2014 USA (excluding magnet)\nConcrete Cover + Neodymium Magnet\nPerfect Fit for the Contribute Pen\nCover & Pen create a Latch effect\nEco-Friendly - Bio-Manufactured & Human Safe Sealant\nSubs as a Gum Case?\nCase in Birch with bio-based natural finish (natural saturated color)\nDimensions:\n6.75\" L x 1\" W x 1\" H\nThe Contribute Case is a joy to open and close.

With the need to build on what I've learned and do what I love, I established Faddis Design. \n\nThe challenge I'm ready to face is integrating the tooling and bulk materials into my production.

When the tooling quantities are determined, I will finalize the curing duration to confirm that I've obtained the greatest possible strength & durability. \n\nSo, other than common challenges of developing a new system, I've already achieved great milestones. I've made and presented working prototypes, perfected my concrete mix, selected the magnets, and perfected the details of my casting process. I've also established some baselines associated with de-molding and curing.\n\nI've experienced receiving rewards several months beyond estimated delivery dates. However, I've backed projects that have fulfilled rewards before the estimated delivery date. This added a sense of delight to my experience with supporting them. To maximize my ability as a project Creator to provide you with similar delight, I've set an estimated delivery date that I think is reasonable to allow me to meet the quantity demand and to hopefully stay ahead of schedule. \n\nThus far, I've organized and prepared an incredible foundation. I love sharing my process with others and communicating; so, I will keep you informed along the way! I prefer good vibes, blessings, and high5s.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nDustin\n\n\nAll brands, logos, and trademarks displayed and/or mentioned are used for informational purposes only and are sole property of each respected company and owner.

(In french).\nWe will keep you posted of all developments\nThe IFLOW Team\nWatch the review here: http://vtele.ca/videos/ca-commence-bien/vendredi-30-novembre-2012-une-invention-quebecoise-pour-stabiliser-vos-images_53627_53638.php\nFor people outside of Canada, you can the video here: http://youtu.be/hj0TJEPlKL0\nSorry for the bad quality, the only way i could show it is by recorded it from tv with my iphone5.\nIFLOW: Stability In Motion\nDo you film everything with your Smartphone, Compact or SLR camera? If so, this innovative new product is just for you. Created by a passionate team of image and video enthusiasts, the newly-launched IFLOW is the world\u2019s first portable camera dolly. It stabilizes camera movements enabling a fluid, professional-quality shot, no matter where you want to film. Lightweight, powerful, and easy to use, IFLOW is designed for compact cameras, SLR cameras and Smartphones. You can use it at a downtown skatepark, on your next hiking trip, or in the studio! With IFLOW, you can put your creativity in motion, filming the movement wherever it moves you.\nIFLOW wih a 50mm Carl Zeiss Lens.\nIFLOWwith a Canon 200m F2.8L\nIFLOW is filming on a curb for a Skateboarding movie\nThe origins of IFLOW\nAlmost two years ago, we found ourselves in Whistler, BC, on a backcountry ski trip with some fellow riders. We were having a blast and like many, we wanted to capture our experience on film but frustration quickly set in as we attempted to bring our shooting to a higher level. A jib and traditional dolly aren\u2019t exactly backpack friendly. At that point, it dawned on us that we should design something that was. We quickly realized there were a lot of professional accessories that had not yet been made accessible to the public thus limiting video possibilities. Until now, most accessories were too heavy and bulky, restricting filming and making long shots impossible in spontaneous or solo filmmaking. IFLOW opens up a whole new range of video possibilities for all filmmakers.\nRediscover Video\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new age for the video, and we\u2019re really excited about it. The first feature film shot entirely with a Smartphone was recently released on big screens across America. With the democratization of HD, high-performance devices are becoming more and more compact and portable. We noticed though, that there were still some professional equipment accessories that had not yet been made accessible, which really limited the possibilities of what you can do as far as video. Up until now, loads of accessories were still too heavy and bulky, which limited filming and made long shots impossible for any spontaneous or solo filmmaker. We designed IFLOW to open a range of new possibilities for the video for all kinds of filmmakers!\nThe founders\nOlivier and Richard are the founders of Cliche, a firm accessory for the filmmaking industry. IFLOW is the result of a partnership between a creative photographer and an experienced manufacturing product specialist. Olivier is a freelance photographer and professional videographer. He has also been a partner in an advertising and marketing agency where he acted as a specialist providing input in the visual aspects of all the projects. When it comes to anything related to photo or video, Olivier is a passionate perfectionist. Richard has extensive experience in developing and manufacturing products. For nearly 20 years, he owned a manufacturing company made up of 60 employees. He was also the Vice-President of Operations for a large manufacturing company (225 employees) specializing in plastic injection products. A love of photography is the common thread between Olivier and him. The two are now branching out on their own to create an entirely new range of accessories for the filmmaking industry. Olivier and Richard\u2019s approach is simple: design innovative and portable products to simplify the way filmmakers work.\nOlivier St-Onge / Photographer & Richard Mourand / Manufacturing Specialist\nIFLOW's Team\nPLEDGES\nIFLOW would sincerely thank you for your support. We will launch for April an exclusive kickstarter artist edition. Be among the first to embark on the IFLOW adventure! Get the \"Artistl Edition\", designed by street artist Astro.\nArtist Edition designed by Astro.\nAstro\nTransport bag included with every IFLOW\nUnique and ingenious\nInspired from an hair clip system, the IFLOW is a lightweight and compact camera clamp with a unique rolling system. It\u2019s 8 inches long and weighs only 2 pounds. When it\u2019s time to film, simply place your Smartphone or any device weighing up to 2 pounds in it. Then attach your IFLOW to any flat or circular surface around you. Within seconds you are ready to perform stable movement shots and precise time-lapse videos. So now you can follow a moving subject and get a professional finish to your shot.\nPROJECT TIMELINE\nWe currently have working prototypes ready for production. We tested them for over 3 months and used them for the making of the video. It gives us the opportunity to adjust all the mechanical parts for most of the camera on the market. Between November 2nd and December 12th, we will be online on Kickstarter. If we accomplish our 50 000$ goal. We will proceed the manufacturing.\nProject MileStones\nTIMELAPSE\nThis Timelapse was made with the new Iphone 5 & Frameographer apps.

Was the IFLOW used for the realization of the video? / A. The IFLOW was used for the entire video combined with an iPhone 4S and the Canon 5D MarkII.\nQ. When will my order be shipped? / A. We expect to deliver all \"Backers\" during the month of April. You may refer to the above section titled \"Milestone\" which explains the various steps leading us to the said deadline.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst IFLOW step\nAlthough we have succeeded in developing a prototype that exceeded our expectations - after an initial concept change, a multitude of adjustments and several prototypes - we understand that there are challenges ahead. \n\nSpring tension\nWe will have to strike the right balance between sufficient tension to keep the IFLOW in place and minimal tension for user-friendliness. Defining the required tension cannot be done at the drawing board or on a prototype. It can only be done with the first production samples. We plan to use the first units, adjust the spring tension and ask some enthusiasts to test the products. Given our extensive manufacturing experience, we find this challenge stimulating. Once the correct tension is found, the manufacturer must ensure it is respected at all times - which leads to another challenge.\n\nConsistency\nWe will have to ensure that, from one unit to the next, all mechanical and dimensional parameters are identical; particularly, if we are greatly successful and sell IFLOW by the thousands. This is the most important challenge. Judging by our experience, it is possible to encounter difficulties in this area. We have already enlisted the assistance of someone who has monitored quality assurance for several manufacturers for over fifteen years. This person has helped us select the best manufacturer and will monitor quality control at the plant during production. We also intend to carry out random quality audits when units are delivered to our warehouse. Obviously, should any issue arise, we will verify every unit in the delivery. We will never ship an IFLOW that does not meet our standards. However, should there be any issues, we may not be able to meet the established deadlines.\n\nThose, as far as we know, are the main challenges ahead; but, we must also point out all the challenges that will inevitably occur and that we have not considered. (From our perspective, dealing with these small problems is a part of the fun of launching a new project.) With this in mind, we plan on keeping you informed during every upcoming step.

We have developed a detailed plan for every possible issue we can think of, as well as a plan for unforeseen problems. \n\nIn our product development experience we have seen many projects come and go, some successful, some not so much. We see three major risks to getting a project out on time.\n1- Design does not meet well with reality and requires revision. \n2- Quality does not meet expectations and requires scraping the first production run. \n3- Real lead times are not known and suppliers give unrealistic lead times. \n\nOur plan for these issues:. \n1- We are totally confident in the design. The product has had months of testing and hundreds of printed prototypes including aluminum prototypes and small production runs. We also have a group of beta testers. \n2- We have delayed release to do small production runs to work on quality control processes. Quality is now up to our expectations. \n3- Having good suppliers you can trust goes a long way.

This is a system you will be proud to show and a system that that could well be in your family for generations...\nDetail of LED power button.\nTube Amplifiers History\nVacuum tube amplifiers are an old technology, invented more than 100 years ago. The silicon transistors used in most amplifiers today were invented in the 1960's and very rapidly replaced vacuum tubes in almost all audio products.\nThe solid-state amplifiers have a few notable advantages over vacuum tube amplifiers:\nmuch smaller and lighter;\nusable in low power situations, such as battery-powered radios;\nmuch improved energy efficiency;\nno warm-up time (tube amplifiers need to be warmed up before use).\nSo on the face of it, solid-state amplifiers would seem like a much better choice, but that's not the whole story...\nTube amplifiers have a more refined sound, very different from a transistor amplifier. The tone of a vacuum tube amplifier is softer, warmer and more natural. Vocals are more articulate, the separation of the instruments is much more defined and the entire listening experience is greatly enhanced.\nThere is only one reason to invest in a tube amplifier...To thoroughly enjoy your music as it was intended to be heard.\nThe Titanium full-range speakers will bring your music to life. The speaker frame is constructed of cast aluminum for maximum rigidity.\nSpeaker Specs  25 watt / Voice Coil 1\" / Znom 8 ohm / Frequency Response 70-20,000 Hz / Diameter 4\" / Titanimum cone / SPL 87db 1W/1m\nSubwoofer\nsize - 6.5\" Power Handling (RMS) - 50 watt Power Handling (Max) - 100 watt Impeadance - 4 ohm Frequency response 35-800 hz Sensitivity - 83db 1w/1m\nOur Story\nThe vacuum tube circuit we have incorporated in the BlueTube Amplifier is a design that has been around (and still around) for over 30 years. It is a proven \"Class A\" amplifier design that has been reviewed and compared to other vacuum tube systems costing 3 times as much. We decided when designing our amp that in this day and age lots of music collections are in a digital format on a device that has BlueTooth capabilities. We incorporated a Class 2, 16-bit A2DP BlueTooth radio for true stereo output. We also included voice command setup so there are no buttons to press on the amp to set up the BlueTooth connection. Another decision we made is to include a USB charging port on the unit so you can listen to your music and recharge your devices at the same time.\nIn designing the case we wanted an enclosure that simply looked awesome. Ben,our master craftsman, hand selects 3/4\" cherry and walnut lumber, laminates them together and hand sands each board. After constructing the enclosures, everything is hand-rubbed with linseed oil and finished off with 3 coats of wood wax that is then buffed to a smooth and durable finish.\nNot stained but oiled and waxed for a classic finish\nThe amp and optional speakers feature gold-plated, spring-loaded speaker connectors that allow easy connection.\nOur goal was to produce a vacuum tube amp that sounds awesome, looks great, and will outlast its owner. We believe the BlueTube amp meets all 3 of our objectives. This is a piece of equipment that won't end up in a land fill someday, but will be passed down through generations.\nBlueTube T-shirt design\nPictures, Pictures, Pictures and more Pictures\nBlueTube amplifier and speaker combo\nBlueTube amplifier and speaker combo\nClose-up of BlueTube amplifier and speaker\nThe glow of the tubes and the power button give this a look as good as the sound\nThe Power button has a soft blue glow when powered on\nThe exposed tubes give the Amp a look of elegance and beauty\nWarm glow, Warm sound\nThe speakers are just as beautiful as the amplifier\nMatching the Amplifier with Cherry and Walnut Hardwoods\nTitanium Cones and Cast Speaker Cage provide a superior sound\nA pair of speakers is all you need to fill a room with the beautiful sounds of music playing the way it was meant to be heard.\nNot enough pictures?

Also the FAQ below may answer any remaining questions.\nFAQ\nAre stereo tube amplifiers really better? \nTube Amplifiers have a sound that is much different from transistor amplifiers. The tone of a vacuum tube amplifier is softer, warmer and more natural. Vocals are more articulate, the separation of the instruments is more defined and your listening experience is greatly enhanced.\n\nThe only reason to invest in a tube amplifiers is simple: To listen to music as it was intended to be heard and to enjoy every nuance in the recording.\n\nRecorded media of today (MP3 and CDs) is compressed and has lost much detail, how does the Blue Tube amp compensate for this?\nAn advantage of tube amplifiers is that they will improve the sound produced by digital music formats like the CD and MP3. Have you ever noticed how the \nsound produced by your digital recording can feel cold and lifeless? Tube amplifier circuits will soften the sound coming from digital sources and greatly improve the listening experience. Playing your your digital music through a tube amplifier will breathe new life and excitement into your music collection.\n\nWhy does the BlueTube amp have a BlueTooth option? Doesn't BlueTooth compress the music even more? \n\nA lot of people will say that it is crazy to take a recording that's been compressed, run it though a blue tooth radio that compresses the music even more, then play it through an expensive vacuum tube amplifier. We have only one reply to this......Hearing is believing. Although your music will not sound quite as good as it will when plugged directly into the amp, it will still sound clearer  and have the expression and emotional tone missing from a transistor amp. Regardless of what you feed into the BlueTube amp, it will sound clearer and more defined when it comes out of the speakers. And with BlueTooth you can control your selection of music and volume without ever getting out of your chair.\n  Why does the BLUE Tube Amp not have a bass or treble adjustment?\nThere are two very good technical reasons for eliminating bass and treble tone controls: \n  1) Tube amps don\u2019t need sound altering circuits to modify the sound like transistor amplifiers do\n2) Bass and treble controls make the sound worse, not better. (read on) \nFirst, when playing low to moderate volume levels, tube amplifiers retain the tonal balance much better than a transistor amp, eliminating the need to constantly adjust the tone or bass to alter the recorded sound.\nSecond, sound altering circuits, such as bass and treble, color and mute the sound and subtle details in the recording can be lost. Most listeners aren't aware of how much detail can be lost with unnecessary sound processing. You will never see a transistor amp without a tone and bass control, but it is rare to see a tube amplifier equipped with a bass or treble adjustment. Music is recorded, mixed and mastered with equipment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to give you a recording that if you closed your eyes you would swear that you were at the performance. With the BlueTube Amp, you can experience the music like it was intended to be heard.\n  How long will the tubes last?\nThe BlueTube amp uses a triode pentode tube that can be purchased from many \"tube stores\" on the internet, the price varies from $12.00 to $64.00 depending on what brand you select. The vacuum tubes are designed to run at 300 volts. By running the tubes at 180 volts the BlueTube amp puts much less strain on the tubes, significantly increasing their life.\n\nWe predict the life of the tubes to be around 40,000 hours (1600 days or 4.3 years if run non stop) This increases to 25 years if run for only 4 hours a day every day. \n  Tube break-in period \nThere is a trade off for the warm, silky sound of tubes over transistors. Vacuum tubes need to warm up to a constant operating temperature and any existing gasses need to burn off. The tubes takes around 15 minutes to reach a temperature for their optimal performance. You will without question notice a difference in the sound of a \"cold\" tube vs a \"warm\" tube. The transformers also need to reach thermal stability, which could take a bit longer than the tubes themselves depending on ambient temperature. (The breath taking sound of fully heated vacuum tubes running at full operating temperature is well worth the wait) You will also notice after 100-200 hours of tube break-in, the sound will become even more defined and sweeter. \nIs 8-watt output enough power? \nIn typical transistor amplifiers, there is a tendency to play music at a much higher volume level than necessary to compensate for the inherently \u201cthin\u201d transistor sound. (remember the bass and treble controls?) Low power, single ended tube amplifiers like the BlueTube amp are famous for providing breathtaking detail and a full, rich sound even at moderate volume levels, so that many users find it unnecessary to play music at high sound levels. When matched with efficient titanium speakers, the Blue Tube Amp will fill a small to medium sized listening environment with surprisingly full, extremely detailed, high-fidelity sound. If you like to play your music at sound level that will cause ear damage or have a bass thump that will knock the pictures off your wall...This system isn't going to do that. On the other hand, if you want to hear your music with crystal-clear vocals, stand-out guitar and drum, and super-defined bass, the BlueTube amp will go beyond your expectations\nWhy do the speakers have a single speaker instead of 2 or 3?\nIn the audiophile world it is known that high-efficiency, single driver, full-range speakers--with no crossover--give the best sound. The titanum speakers we paired with the BlueTube amp are full-range speakers designed to reproduce every detail of you music from 80hz to 16khz. The BlueTube Amp so accurately reproduces your music input, that you don't need tweeters and subwoofers to achieve a realistic live performance sound. \nWhy does it seem I can listen to my music longer? \nDon't be surprised if you start listening to more music every day. Another advantage of the sound of a tube amplifiers is the minimizing of \u201clistening fatigue\u201d. The fast transient 'attack' characteristic of transistor amps may sound impressive at first, but after extended listening will produce listening fatigue. Analysts have attributed this fatigue to \u201ctransistor hash\u201d, the tendency of transistor amplifiers to produce higher amounts of odd order harmonic distortion, and the tendency to emphasize sharp transients. Because vacuum tube circuits eliminate the transistor hash, you can listen to your BlueTube amp for hours at a time and enjoy the warm tube sound of your favorite music without listening fatigue.
