"SYNCOPATION\nArtist Selene States and choreographer Ryan Fran\u00e7ois are working on a b/w 16mm dance film entitled Syncopation exploring the differences between 1940's and contemporary swing dance.\nThe final film will be 6 minutes in length. The routine will consist of two variations developed in both a 1940's and a contemporary style. World-class swing dancers Moe Sakan and Remy Kouakou Kouame will perform the routine to a Slim Gaillard tune.\nAward-winning cinematographer Tim Sidell will film the dancers from above in a bird's-eye view and from below shot through a glass floor. Costume designer Lise Marker will create hybrid contemporary-period costumes that hint at shifting perceptions of time.\nThe film builds on the aesthetic developed by Francis Picabia's 1924 Surrealist film Entr'acte, and Will Jason's 1944 cult classic short Groovie Movie, both of which use dancers' footwork shot from beneath a glass floor.\nSyncopation brings a team of experts on vintage aesthetics together to shoot a new angle of the beautiful classic theme of dance viewed through a glass floor.\nYOUR PLEDGE\nWe need your help to raise $5000 to build the largest plate glass dance floor since these shots were taken in the early 20th century. Your contribution will go towards the construction and installation of the glass floor's steel frame and scaffolding so that Moe and Remy can safely perform their routine.\nFor the steps you take to help out, we offer our thanks in the form of film credits, stills prints, as well as the opportunity for you to dance on the floor yourselves.\nShown at dance events and international art galleries, the final film will be synchronously projected on the floor and ceiling in a film installation, as well as distributed on-line.\nEvery pledge gets us more of a foothold on the final film project Syncopation, so, please pledge as much as you can and be a part of this very special project!\nTHE TEAM\nDirector: Selene States (DE/UK/USA) is an artist working with film and video. Her work investigates nostalgia and anachronistic aesthetics, with solo exhibitions in 2012 dedicated to swing dance and vintage revival such as in her Swing Shoe Shop at the State Museum of Fine Art Baden-Baden and Frigidaire at the Kunstverein Friedrichshafen. http://www.selenestates.com\nChoreographer: Ryan Franc\u0327ois (UK) is considered to be one of the foremost authorities on vernacular swing and jazz dance of the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's.

Available on Bandcamp and iTunes.]\nHi everyone,\nI'm Yuno (fka unouomedude). I started making songs alone in my bedroom in 2007. I made an EP called \"Marsh\" in my bedroom in 2010. In 2011, I released a single called \"Frequency\" that was made in my bedroom. Now, I want to make another record in my bedroom! I'm making a new record called \"V\", and this time I want to make it bigger and better!\nGoal: $2,000\nI started this Kickstarter to raise funds to record my new record, \"V\", and to be able to play these songs live. If I reach my goal of $2,000, I will be able to get the music gear I need to play live shows and some of that gear will also be used to record \"V\". $2,000 will pay for things like a guitar amp, effects pedals, instrument upgrades/repairs, instrument cables, cases, accessories, and new instruments to record and tour with. If I don't reach my goal of $2,000 then no one will be charged, and no rewards will be sent.\nUltimate Goal: $4,500\nIf I reach my ultimate goal of $4,500, I will be able to not only play live shows, but also fully realize my ideas for \"V\" and other future releases. I have a lot of musical ideas, but I don't have the equipment to make all of the pretty sounds that are floating around in my head. Things like a more powerful computer, a better microphone, more instruments, studio monitors, and a better audio interface will allow me to make the sounds that I want to make, without all of my current limitations.\nThere are several exclusive rewards for people who fund this project.

It is scheduled to appear in the sky above the Bay Area between Sept. 12 and 16.\nMerging art and technology, ISHKY has brought together a team of artists, programmers and scientists to give life to a compelling vision that a community of millions will directly experience. The conceptual work, Pi In The Sky, explores the boundaries of scale, public space, impermanence, and the relationship between Earth and the physical universe.  \nPi In The Sky has two unique interpretations: one within Earth's atmosphere and one well beyond it. A team of synchronized aircraft will skywrite the first 1,000 numbers of pi's infinite sequence in a 100+ mile loop around the San Francisco Bay Area. The second interpretation, in outer space, will include a constant string of pi emitted from a satellite. \nOn Earth \nAt 10,000 feet altitude working with our technical partner AirSign, a team of five synchronized aircraft equipped with dot-matrix technology will skywrite the first 1,000 numbers of pi's infinite sequence in a 100-plus-mile loop around the San Francisco Bay Area. Each number will measure over a quarter-mile in height. A sixth AirSign plane will fly above the writing team, documenting the entire process. The two-hour mass intervention is a central feature of the 2012 ZERO1 Biennial. The work will begin above the ZERO1 Garage in San Jose and will follow a flight path determined by ISHKY to include a pantheon of educational and mathematics institutions: Stanford, NASA Ames, Livermore Labs, UC Berkeley, San Francisco's financial district, Twitter, Google, Facebook, and Apple, among many others. \nPi Route\nWithin moments of execution (3.14159265...), the specific meaning of the numbers in the sky will be lost. The piece will dissolve into an unprecedented visual anomaly that prompts curiosity, providing rich opportunity for social interaction as well as basic math education. The Bay Area\u2019s seven million inhabitants will be able to witness the arc of the event in real-time, from its creation to its gradual disappearance. \nIn order to increase opportunities for civic engagement, ISHKY has enlisted the technical expertise of Stamen Design, a world-class creative firm specializing in data-visualization. Stamen, working with data from OpenStreetMap under CC BY SA license, will develop a platform for the public to document and share experiences of the event. \nIn Outer Space \nIn outer space, miles above our atmosphere, a second interpretation of Pi In The Sky will include a constant string of pi emitted from a satellite. Slated to launch later in the fall by a Bay Area start-up satellite firm, the numbers of pi and its GPS coordinate will broadcast from the satellite and circle the Earth every 90 minutes, covering more than a half-a-million kilometers per day. Receiving stations on the ground will pick up these signals and relay the information over the web. ISHKY Studios is developing a smartphone app that will enable users anywhere in the world to locate the satellite overhead and track pi\u2019s travel as it wraps our Earth like a ball of string. \nFunding \nOur Kickstarter goal of $31,415 will help defray hard costs of over $100,000. This includes everything from aircraft landing fees, fuel, lodging for pilots and documentarians, programming costs and more. You can help us reach our funding target and push us well beyond. \nTogether, we will provide a free and uplifting experience for millions of people and create a historic moment for conceptual art, redefining notions of scale and site specificity. Set this momentous and historic undertaking in motion. \nAbout the Artist \nISHKY is a California-born artist with a Bachelor of Science degree from UC Berkeley. As a professional communicator and designer, the agency he founded has helped name and create visual identities for infrastructure projects totaling more than $15 billion in civic investment. His work has focused on public space, health, safety, utilities and transit. As Board Chairman of Illuminate The Arts, he is the visionary behind the public art project \"The Bay Lights,\" a stunning fine arts experience that will live for two years on the Bay Bridge West Span starting in 2013. Designed by artist Leo Villareal, \"The Bay Lights\" is a production of the nonprofit organization Illuminate The Arts which is dedicated to the creation and presentation of community-activating public art.\nEverything is impossible until we prove it is not.

Kickstarter would finance machine hours, improving accuracy, shortening production time. Purchasing material in bulk in combination with access to machines will lower costs + pass the savings on to the consumer. \nWhere to Use: HEX6AGON is a follow up series to FACET. HEX6AGON can be used both indoors + outdoors for up to 5 years. We recommend using HEX6AGON on glass surfaces, like windows, mirrors, even bottles, as the adhesive is \"permanent\".\nDepending on the number of tiles you have, you can use HEX6AGON in differently scaled spaces, or on objects, providing visual definition. HEX6AGON will color your space, variably, changing as the day progresses.\ndimensions may alter in production.\nHow to Use: Pick or design your own pattern. A printed reference sheet will be included in shipments. Start with a cleaned surface, follow cleaning product recommendations for your specific surface (avoiding oils).\nConsider your layout, think about the design. Do you want it centered or floating? Start in a corner  for linear patterns, or from the center, for radiating patterns.\nHEX6AGON tiling vinyl allows for both wet or dry application. The 3mil vinyl has enough of a lip for you to perfectly butt-up each tiling vinyl. HEX6AGON is easily cut with scissors or an Exacto knife for a custom fit.\nLayer HEX6AGON over other tiling vinyl, to create new colors.\nPlay with negative space, your natural view becomes an additional color + texture in the patterns.\nPermanent adhesive. Cleanly removes from glass. Do not apply to precious surfaces, may damage upon removal.\nExpected Lifespan:  A clean surface will give HEX6AGON the best start. You can expect HEX6AGON to \"stick around\" for 5 years. \nIncentives: The semi + full sets of HEX6AGON on Kickstarter are offered below the projected retail price. So buying now, saves later.\n$1 Reward gets a COCO in Color Video!\nShipping: HEX6AGON will ship in November. If you would like tracking, delivery confirmation, signature on arrival, or other specific shipping requests, please make a note in your order (additional costs will be confirmed prior to shipping).  \nInternational Shipping:\n$5 rewards, shipping is on me. :) \n$10 + 15 + $25 rewards, add $2. \n$50 rewards, add $5. \n$135 rewards, add $10.\nWhere the Kickstarter Money Will Be Used:\nProduction machine hours\nPurchasing entire rolls of transparent vinyl material \nProduct packaging - cardboard tubes, plugs + envelopes \nGraphic packaging labels\nGrouping tile series for interior packaging\nInformational inserts\nBasic shipping costs\nKickstarter + Amazon processing fees \nProduct shots\nHow the Kickstarter Investment Will Effect HEX6AGON in the Longterm:\nPreorders will serve as a small market test for retail buyers.

Not just the animals, but the growing industry that surrounds them. The first of these books 'hunters' explores the complex relationship that man has with animal, through the eyes of the tourist trophy hunter. \nIn the 19th Century these hunters would have been from aristocratic backgrounds, the monied elite of Europe and America. Today's hunters are hedge fund managers, surgeons, dentists, attorneys, and their wives and children. They have the option to attend 'safari' training schools in their home countries, shooting remote controlled Elephants, Leopards, and Lions. Most have a place for their trophies in their homes back in the US and Europe, long before they even arrive in Africa. They have expectations of Africa, and these must be met by an industry priding itself on the fact that size does matter.\nSo far this work as been totally self funded. I can only now publish the book, if funds can be found to contribute to the cost, which is why I am asking you, and the Kickstarter community, for sponsorship to help fund the publication of this book.\nI've been approached by an amazing dutch fine art publisher, Schilt, who wants to produce the book in a limited edition (2000), but only if funds can be found to contribute to the cost.\nThe book will be 24.5 x 30 cm (landscape) and hardbound with a dust jacket. There will be 192 pages, and approx 120 full colour plates.\nIn the back of the book, I intend to put a second, smaller book in concertina format. This will be enclosed in a pouch in the back cover, and hold the work from 'elephant story' (see below). On the back of the plates will be the complete essay 'shooting an elephant' by George Orwell.\nThe total cost to produce the book is USD 30,000\nTo make this happen I need to raise at least USD 20,000\nEvery cent received, will contribute directly to the production of the book.\nProject Awards to date.\nWorld Press Photo Award (Elephant Story) the Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize (Huntress with Buck) and  Sony World Photography Award/Nature and Wildlife (Safari Club).\nElephant Story by David Chancellor.\nShooting an Elephant by George Orwell.\nGeorge Orwell's essay 'Shooting an Elephant' created a deep, lasting impression, when I read it as a child. This was brought vividly back to life when I documented the hunting of an elephant by an American hunter in Zimbabwe, and the utilization of it by the local community, under the Campfire Program. I was struck by the stark reality of that death, and the similarity of Orwell's description of the slaying of a rogue elephant in Burma, possibly by his own faltering hand.\nHunters at the Saatchi Gallery, London.\nSaatchi Gallery showcased some of the best photography of the last 50 years.\nPrints.\nAs all my work is shot on 6x7 film, I print both traditional Hand Photographic C-Types, and Archival Pigment Ink. All work is limited to an edition of 5 in total, plus 2x AP, unless otherwise stated.\nA note on how to use Kickstarter to make a pledge:\nTo make a pledge click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button.

Thank you all so much for your support, this has been such an amazing ride so far! We want to take a quick moment to point out our next stretch goal - this is what will happen if we keep going:\nAt $95,000, we\u2019ll drop in what we call the \u201cPerformance Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater variety of terrain. We\u2019ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a higher ground speed. We\u2019ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of autonomy, for future robot development.\nAnd now, back to our Kickstarter page!\nOur Dream\nWe dream of a world where imagination becomes reality simply because enough passionate people decide that an idea has merit. We dream of robots of all shapes and sizes being made across the globe, because the high-end technology needed to make them is simplified, generalized, and made publicly accessible.\nThe first step in achieving that dream for us is building a rideable, 18 foot  wide, 4,000 pound, 6-legged, engine-powered hydraulic walking robot named Stompy, and sharing exactly how we did it with the world.\nWho We Are\nWe are Project Hexapod. We\u2019re a team of 3 instructors, 1 TA, and 15 students based out of a makerspace in Somerville, Massachusetts called Artisan\u2019s Asylum. We\u2019ve spent the last four months running a class on how to design giant robots, and  Stompy is the end result. Our instructors (Gui Cavalcanti, James Whong, and Dan Cody) are professional roboticists who have designed military and commercial robot legs, arms, prosthetics, walking machines, and more. Our TA (Adam Bercu) is a national champion Battlebots builder, and our students come from backgrounds ranging as widely as engineers working for defense contractors to professional programmers to electronics enthusiasts.\nYou may have heard of us and Stompy before, a couple of months back \u2013 we were written up in Wired, Boing Boing, Hack A Day, DVICE, Hizook, the Boston Globe, and Engadget, among others.\nWhy You Should Care\nFirst of all, we\u2019re building a giant walking robot that you can ride, and if all goes according to plan, we\u2019ll be showing it off at a festival or fair near you. Depending on your level of support, you may even get to ride it or drive it - how about that?\nBeyond that, though, your support for Project Hexapod will drive a personal robotics revolution (if we have anything to say about it). The past twenty years have seen an explosion of productivity in hobbyist robotics made possible by cheap, easy to use microcontrollers and RC servos. The hobbyist community has built a wealth of knowledge and infrastructure around these components, but RC servos severely limit the size of robot you can build.\nProject Hexapod wants to make large-scale robots easier to build, and inspire people to build them.\nStompy is 6 giant steps towards that dream. Once we finish this robot, we\u2019re releasing our plans, our CAD, our diagrams, the presentations from all the lectures we gave in class, our lists of materials and parts, everything. The construction and control techniques we're using will drop the cost of controlled hydraulics by an order of magnitude or two from where they are now, and will make giant robots affordable to small groups of enthusiasts everywhere.\nThe robot isn't just being built for fun, though - it has incredibly practical purposes, as well. With 6 force-sensitive legs and a ground clearance of 6 feet, the robot will be able to walk over broken terrain that varies from mountainous areas, to rubble piles, to water up to 7 or 8 feet deep - everywhere existing ground vehicles can't go. Not only that, but while navigating such terrain, Stompy could carry 1,000 pounds at 2-3 mph, and up to 4,000 pounds at 1 mph. This is important because in disaster areas like Haiti's Port Au Prince, it's taken more than three years to clear the rubble out of some areas - meaning that throughout that entire time, people have had to be rescued or resupplied by helicopter, because no ground vehicle could reach them. Stompy (and the technology it represents) could easily reach people who can't be reached by any other means in a natural disaster.\nWhat You Get\nWe\u2019re not your average Kickstarter campaign, so we don\u2019t have  your average Kickstarter levels. At a level of support of $100 or below, we\u2019re going to shout your name from the top of the White Mountains, give you a ton of cool swag (designed by local artists Maria Stangel and Ecco Pierce), and list you as a supporter on our website. At the $10 level, that swag includes a bumper sticker proclaiming your desires for your other car:\nThe $20 level includes a robot apocalypse friendship bracelet that reads 'FRIEND OF ROBOTS - DO NOT TERMINATE'; wear it to ensure your safety during the upcoming robot revolution! At the $40 level, you get your choice of one of the following T-shirts:\nAt the $75 level, you'll get both shirts (or two of one, if you prefer). Feel free to add $35 to any pledge level to get an additional shirt!\nFinally, at the $100 level, we'll send you a signed photo of the entire team in front of the finished Stompy, giving the camera cheesy thumbs ups! After the swag levels, though, things get\u2026interesting.\n\nAt the $200 level, you get to choose between having 10 characters of your choice welded onto our chassis or supplying an inanimate object of your choice for Stompy to crush mercilessly. At the $300 level you get a ride, at the $1,000 level you get to drive, and at the $2,500 to $5,000 level you (or your company) get to be listed as a sponsor. At the $10,000 level we\u2019ll fly you out to Boston for a weekend (if you\u2019re in the lower 48 states \u2013 international supporters, call us beforehand!), give you free ice cream and burgers, and take field trips with Stompy to local rubble piles and scrap yards.\n\nContact us directly if you\u2019re interested in higher levels; $25,000 will get you a Stompy appearance in the lower 48 states once the robot\u2019s done, and $300,000 will get you another Stompy of your very own!\nWhat We've Done So Far\nOver the past four months, we've...\nDeveloped radically low cost computer controlled hydraulic joint designs\nDesigned, built, and successfully controlled a half-scale prototype leg (affectionately known as Gimpy) to test our low cost designs\nDesigned a simulation environment with models of hydraulic force and flow to test our robots before we build them\nGot our engine and hydraulic power unit up and running for the full scale robot\nDesigned and posted our class presentations as we went\nDesigned and ordered parts for a full-scale prototype leg\nDesigned 80% of Stompy's chassis\nWhat We're Doing Now\nRight now we\u2019re building a full-scale prototype leg to make sure our design methodology, actuator sizing, and finite element  analysis are all up to snuff before anyone sets foot in the actual robot. Once we establish that, we\u2019ll be finishing the design of our chassis \u2013 at the end of our four week Kickstarter campaign, we expect we\u2019ll be ready to press print on our drawings and start cutting and welding steel!\nWhat We'll Do With The Money\nWe\u2019re asking for a lot of money, and it\u2019s all going straight into the hardware necessary to build the robot. We estimate that each leg will cost around $6,000, to cover the 350 pounds of waterjet-cut steel, high quality shock absorbers, three hydraulic cylinders, valves, sensors, and what have you. The body of the robot (which accounts for around 1,000 pounds of steel), consumables, electronics, and miscellaneous items like screws and wire make up the balance.\nWhile $65,000 sounds like a lot of money for a project claiming to be low cost, bear in mind that an equivalent robot built with high-end technology could easily cost on the order of a couple of million dollars. As a point of reference, using our technology results in position-controlled hydraulic actuators that can produce 18,000 pounds of force, with strokes up to 2 feet in length... for all of $400 an axis. That's less than some hobby servos. Most of the cost of this project is in steel and other components.\nOnce we get the money, we'll order the thousands of pounds of steel, start the waterjet running at Excell Solutions (our contracted machine shop), and start welding everything together at Artisan's Asylum. We're budgeting 8 months to finish the robot, from the initial steel order.\nOnce we finish the robot, we\u2019ll have a series of demo days and festivals where we give rides, let people drive, stomp things for fun, and more!\nWhat We'll Do With A Lot Of Money\nWe have big plans for what will happen if this takes off\u2026\nAt $95,000, we\u2019ll drop in what we call the \u201cPerformance Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater variety of terrain. We\u2019ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a higher ground speed. We\u2019ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of autonomy, for future robot development.\n\nAt $125,000, we\u2019re going to install the \u201cFlair Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll give Stompy an animatronic head, a killer paint job, a sound system, and (pending a full safety review of the robot once it\u2019s built) flame effects.\n\nAt $300,000, we\u2019re going to make this a Really Big Deal. We\u2019re going to buy a waterjet cutter and install it at Artisan\u2019s Asylum for public use, start a company devoted to creating open-source high-end robotic technology, and start developing a zoo\u2019s worth of rideable robots. We\u2019re not even kidding.\nAny funding left over from the project will be put in a bank account and reserved for seed funding for future giant robot projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Lower Legs: 83% Installed!", "update_content": "(We should've waited a week to send out our update email, it turns out!)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Project Hexapod Final Assembly is Underway!", "update_content": "Hello everyone! \nThe most important things first - this is what Stompy currently looks like!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Stompy Build Progress!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe've had a few requests for updates to the website and Kickstarter page, so we went ahead and put together a comprehensive update for everyone that draws on our recent photo albums.

We have a great idea but we need your help.\n1. Why does this clothing line have to exist?Because many women who don't fit into the societal \"feminine\" category have never been able to find clothing made just for them. There has never been a designer or clothing line that design for androgynous women. They have had to find substitutes and be happy with the limited items found in the boys or men's department. The existence of this clothing line will also bring awareness and make people more accepting of others.\n2. Why are we the team to make it happen?\nBecause A Lee has experienced first hand what it's like when looking for neat, clean and simple clothing that fit. We understand the frustrations from the customers\u2019 side and the design side. We also have the capacity for hard work (thanks to our mom) and determination to make this work. We're passionate and believe in this whole-heartedly.\n3. Why should it be done now?\nBecause people have waited long enough. We think society is ready for a change. \n4. Why is this clothing line significant? Why do people need to be a part of it?\nBecause it's greater than fashion or clothing. It's about challenging the gender roles societies have created and being true to yourself. It's about creating a movement that can influence people to be more open and accepting of others. It's okay to be different because that's exactly what makes you who you are.\nAndrogynousFashion.com\nWhy we started androgynous? Instead of making compromises and trying to fit into society, we should embrace who we are and stay true to ourselves. Most people change to fit the mold the world has created because they fear rejection. But there are those brave and courageous souls that remain true to themselves. And they have been looking for a place that sells clothes that suit their personality for too long, to no avail.\nAs far back as I can remember, there was never a time when I was into women\u2019s clothing. The button-down shirts just have too many \u201cstuff\u201d I couldn\u2019t find purpose for. They\u2019re tight and wraps around my body like I\u2019m out to show my curves and to accentuate my breasts and hips\u2026it\u2019s like \u201cLOOK! I HAVE BREASTS AND HIPS!\u201d\nBut my biggest frustration of all \u2013 those two lines in the front of the shirt and the \u201ccleavage\u201d cut. And pockets that are not actual pockets.\nI went on a search for men\u2019s clothes that would fit my body. My search led me to a few websites that catered to tomboyish women. The only problem was that these sites all consisted of T-shirts, which I could find anywhere. I wanted button-down shirts, jackets and dress pants. I wanted the clothes from the men\u2019s runway show. \nOn many occasions after I\u2019ve exhausted my efforts at the women\u2019s department, I would \u201cdrift\u201d into the men\u2019s and try to make it seem like I was just passing by. If I didn\u2019t spot anything, I would then \u201cdrift\u201d into the boy\u2019s department and try my best not to look weird though I was very self-conscious.\nYears passed and finally one day, it just clicked. Why don\u2019t Vee and I just start a clothing line for androgynous people? Somewhere out there in the world, there must be people like me who spend days thinking of how they can take their wardrobe and magically turn it into something like high end menswear.\nVee and I spent many months searching for inspirations. We studied men\u2019s fashion from the last 900 years. What I discovered was that fashion, particularly style, changes VERY slowly. My guess is that people conform to society\u2019s views of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d without questioning.\nThe designs we've come up with are not formfitting, don't taper at the waist and hips, and there no darts where the chest is. Simply elegant, classy, clean-cut menswear made to fit women.\nWe believe that a little weirdness, and a little \u201ccraziness\u201d can cause big changes. And we believe that something as trivial as the clothes you choose to wear can change the way society thinks about what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d\u2026especially what society thinks about what\u2019s right or wrong.\nPart 1.

We need to complete a few more pieces and then finish it all up with mixing and mastering.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur goal is to receive enough pre-orders to afford us additional studio time. We'd love the chance to polish up the tracks and add in a few extras that would make this record exactly what we've been envisioning the past 2 years.\nWe've been tracking since October for the full length record that features most of the material we've been touring with the past year. Being that most of us are in Baltimore (where the record is being tracked) and a couple are in New York (where it is not), the process of writing, recording, and touring this batch of songs has required additional time and money.\nFor having only a single official release as a 6-piece, we're a well traveled band, having toured almost everywhere this side of Texas and Illinois. We recently took a two week run down south to Austin as an official act at SXSW. A tour van and recording costs add up fast, especially when we have only $5 copies of our two year old album to peddle along the way.\nRewards\nWe are offering a bunch of rewards for people kind enough to back our record. Including a few of our previous tape releases (digital files included), Kickstarter only double tapes, Vinyl/Digital versions of the new record, performance opportunities, and test pressings of the final cuts of Rainer before it goes public.\nWho's releasing this?\nFor this release we're sticking with a smaller independent label who will cover only production costs. We're finalizing the fine details of the releasing label and date. Backers will get updates with everything going on with the release!\nWhen is it coming out?\nWe've been working on this release for the past year and have already pushed it back a few months to allow the time to properly complete it. We were recently fortunate enough to film a Shaking Through Session and are using that as the launch point for the record. The session is set to come out in October which is the same time we hope to announce our label plans, along with the album artwork and the first single. The record is currently set to come out in January of 2013 at the latest. \nSecret Mountains?\nAnything else you might possibly want to know about us can be found at www.secret-mountains.com\nHere is another track from the record called \"Golden Blue\".

My name is Brad Walsh. I have recorded a few albums and done some remixes for some pop stars that you might have heard. There have been great reviews of my music in magazines and newspapers, on blogs, and my songs have been on television shows and commercials... YET... for some reason I don't have a Scrooge McDuck moneybin and the leaves on my trees are not hundred dollar bills! So I need some help getting my next album recorded and distributed.\nMaking a record can cost a lot of money, especially when you're doing everything yourself, like I am. The $6000 I am trying to raise is the low end of the projected costs, which include everything from studio fees to song mastering, disc pressing, digital distribution costs, printing of promo materials, and even a little bit of advertisement. I've thought up some fun pledge rewards, though, so your pledge results in you actually getting something cool in the end. In addition to the final album on CD and delivered digitally, you can also choose to receive some of my photo work, or a custom song made just for you, or even some special one-on-one experiences with me and my partner. It's up to you, so please take a look at the different pledge level rewards.\n\nThis new album I'm working on is very danceable, fun pop, and it's by far the best music I've ever made. I'm even impressing myself this time around. There are going to be several really incredible guest singers and players on some of the new tracks as well - different artists that I am a huge fan of - and every day that goes by and every vocal track that's recorded, I have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. It's so cool that these great talents are into making some music with me.\n\nKickstarter is completely changing the way music is made and how artists connect to people who enjoy their work. The estimated date of completion is listed on all rewards as December 2012, but as this is an artistic project they may occur sooner or later than that. Your rewards, however, will come as soon as they are possible. Thank you so much in advance, and I promise you're going to like what you get!\nThe audio track in the video above is one of my new songs (with the lead vocal taken out - only the background demo vocals are left on it so as not to spoil the surprise).

My first book Bodyscapes (2007) contained vibrant creative artwork with painted bodies moving through some of the most diverse landscapes on earth.\n\nThis Kickstarter will allow me to round off the necessary funding to complete, print and publish a second book of photography.  Leap into the Blue dives deeper into our beingness, creating \"fantastic\" interventions within the landscape that challenge viewers to question the lines we draw between mind and body; human and nature; figure and landscape; dream and reality.\nThrough a unique fusion of mediums (such as photography, painting and performance ), all 240 photographs point to our inner freedom, to the humor hidden behind our life predicaments, to our capacity to embrace the unknown, or the unity between our Mind and Body and between ourselves and the environment.\nI\u2019m hoping that through the unexpected wealth of surreal situations photographed, one may be brought to experience a different sense of living poetically or find new liberating perspectives in regards to how we can relate to our surroundings, appreciate beauty and light, or wonder about our own being or what we aspire to.\nTHE THREE MOVEMENTS OF THE BOOK\nARISING GEOMETRY                                                                            The first series of photos explores our Mind\u2019s need to organize our surroundings into recognizable visual patterns and geometries.\nPAS DE DEUX\nThe second series displays the Body and its innate impulse to engage with another human in an infinite dance, pas de deux, or literally, \u201cstep for two.\u201d\nLEAP INTO THE BLUE\nThe third series touches upon our inner aspirations that are here invoked through the flying body.\nFUNDING\nI have already invested over $300,000 in this project since early 2000 and borrowed $20,000 towards the $30,000 necessary for the publisher to cover the printing costs. We are hoping to raise the remaining $10,000 through Kickstarter.\n\nThis final sum will insure the printing and distribution costs of the book, which includes 240 full color photographs, several pages of drawings that show the creative process of the project, as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD by Carmen Cheung. This DVD, with desert footage by filmmaker Trinh Minh-Ha, will give you a chance to listen to some of my views on this work and how it relates to one\u2019s life path, while giving you some insight into the production process.\nANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY\nIn a time when digital manipulation and effects reign in the visual environments that surround us, analog photography is not often the go-to format to creating what I call \u201cstaged photography.\u201d\nAll my photographs of flying bodies, cliff paintings and landscapes have been shot on analog film without the use of any digital technology.\nA grand reward of funding this project is the invitation to be a participant in one of our future expeditions, to co-create the unimaginable and to witness firsthand our whole process.\nABOUT MYSELF\nStarting at an early age in my native country of France, I have always held a passion for the earth, painting, drawing, dance, light, architecture and photography. My interests in architecture, landscape, archeology, and antique murals have greatly influenced my artistic endeavors.\nMy latest book, Vernacular Architecture of West Africa (in which I assembled my photographs and drawings of a disappearing way of building), came out in 2011 and my latest photography book Bodyscapes was published in 2007.\nSince 2000, my photography has focused exclusively on the body and the land and I would love to include as many readers as possible in this ongoing exploration.\nABOUT THE PERFORMERS\n\nAnother purpose for seeing to completion the publication of Leap Into The Blue is also to give homage to the fifty friends who volunteered to be part of this project over these many years and contributed with their energy and creative talents.\nNeedless to say, each of the photographs you see is the outcome of many thrills and ecstasies, but also many trials and unseen sacrifices. All the little or big difficulties encountered during our trips have been outweighed by the unspeakable joys of experiencing the desert\u2019s bare-bone beauty, and being in touch with the Body and Earth in an intimate and colorful way.\nAs much as myself, they would also love to inspire others with their artistic contributions, allowing us to see this Earth and our beings through a different lens.\nWHY YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK\nIf you enjoy adventures, you\u2019ll appreciate the unbelievable landscapes that we found in several deserts of the Western United States.\n\nIf you enjoy dance, you\u2019ll notice our playfulness with the geometry of the body as well as the section that features the Body as literally flying.\nIf you love art and poetry, you\u2019ll enjoy our paintings and the inspiration we took from some of the great masters of our time.\n\nIf you are interested in photography or film, you\u2019ll engage with the settings, staging, lighting and colors of each project.\nWhomever you are though, thank you for reading until this point and thank you from all of us if you can make the publication of Leap Into The Blue possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "MY FINAL UPDATE ...", "update_content": "...

Does the thought of what their aesthetic might sound like if relocated to warmer climes and infused with the passion and counterpoint of the tango sound intriguing? If so, then you need to listen to Sebastian Plano's debut album.\nThe Arrhythmical Part of Hearts was released last year with little fanfare, but is an album that should not be allowed to slip quietly by. Across seven short tracks Plano, a young San Francisco-based composer and multi-instrumentalist who plays everything on the album himself, weaves together an array of sounds including cello, keyboards, bandone\u00f3n, wordless vocals, and electronic effects and percussion into a compelling and emotive suite of compositions charged with tantalizing twists and turns.\nAlthough the music is instrumental, there is a strong sense of storytelling, both within each track and across the album as a whole. Sounds and instruments are added and dropped, tempos are raised and lowered, sudden subtle changes of mood generate forward motion, leading us into new episodes and interludes. The tone is by turn insistently yearning, wistfully pretty, gently melancholy, and urgently rhythmic. The sequence of \u2018In Between Worlds\u2019 and \u2018Emotions (Part III)\u2019 is a good example. The yearning cello of the all-too-brief (but crushingly gorgeous) \u2018In Between Worlds\u2019 begins in a meditative vein that becomes more urgent and dramatic as the track nears its end. The track finishes on a provisional, questioning note, without full resolution, leaning us forwards into \u2018Emotions (Part III)\u2019. The transition catapults us from yearning strings into a passage of faintly exotic percussion, which in turn opens into a restrained and plaintive electronic keyboard motif before drawing us back into the cello\u2019s ardently ascending voice. At each stage we are drawn onward, ears open for what comes next, needing more to complete the tale. The album is full of such miniature dramas, filled with life and beauty. It will reward the time you spend with it.\nhttp://thesilentballet.com\nArticle by Yakob Olesky\n             For longtime readers of The Silent Ballet like myself, the website's year-end list is a special treat, and we anxiously await it like a six year-old who can't sleep on Christmas Eve. One phenomenon that has been constant over the years is TSB's ability to pluck musicians out of complete obscurity and place them into the list as if no one would notice. The act itself is not difficult - anyone could find an unknown musician and rave about him - but what is impressive is that these artists never fail to deserve the praise that they have suddenly been given. Why no mention of these types of acts ever appears on the website prior to the end of the year list still remains a mystery to me, but as a recent addition to the staff I hope to unravel it one day. Sebastian Plano was 2011's \"surprise\" pick. Plano is an Argentinean composer who composed, recorded, and produced The Arrythmical Part of Hearts last year, which proves to be one of the strongest contemporary classical albums of the year. Hearts draws from a wide pool of influences; Plano is obviously influenced by much of classical's main body of work, but we also find similarities to some electronica producers, as well as certain contemporary movie score composers, such as Yann Tiersen. Cello is the main tool utilized on Hearts, but that is not to say that it in singular in its musical voice; rather, Plano achieves a rich network of sounds that dazzle as they weave in an out of one another - old and new, everything is as fresh and smooth as the first time it was played. Hearts is steeped in a deep passion that makes it irresistible - as Plano was previously a completely unknown artist, we can imagine that he was able to create this album without the slightest amount of pressure or fear of scrutiny. As a result, the album is branded with an attractive freedom and confidence that few established artists can afford. Plano's career is bright and wide open ahead of him. Here's hoping that he can relive the magic of Hearts on future works.\nhttp://thesirenssound.com\nArticle by Mog\n               I\u2019ve been listening to The Arrhythmical Part of Hearts for the last two weeks over a dozens of times already and the best part is every time I hear this title, the sound within kept unfolding secret chambers and new avenues. Regardless of the number of listens I gave this album I swear I keep hearing something I didn\u2019t hear on my previous listen. The Arrhythmical Part of Hearts is one hell of an amazing title. Too bad we haven\u2019t got a download yet but by all means do yourself a favour and stream the entire album.\nRecent Seb's interview + review:\nhttp://musicisgood.org/2012/03/interview-sebastian-plano/\n-----------------------------------------------------\nNEWS!!!\nSEBASTIAN PLANO - ARTIST OF THE MONTH IN ECHOES.\nhttp://echoesblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/the-heart-of-ambient-chamber-music-sebastian-plano-2/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Dear Friends and Supporters:", "update_content": "Dear Friends and Supporters,\nI have news about the upcoming records.

Some of you have asked me what exactly these digital toys are. They are sort of like windup toys, except that they are magic. Being magic they can do impossible silly things that toys in our primitive real world can't do.\nYou operate the toys yourself by stimulating them with your mouse and key commands. You can play with them on your computer or mobile units and you can collect and trade them with other toy collectors around the world. We have just begun to explore the possibilities of these ethereal creatures, so check out this video below to get an idea of how they work (wait about an hour while it uploads to vimeo). By the time we finish Cans Without Labels the toys will be much further along.

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys. Tear it out of the virtual package, roll it around, click it in sensitive areas and watch it do something stupid and lovable. \n  You can get a pack of 3 of my fancy-ass new digital toys to collect and trade with friends from many lands through the internets\n          How would you like to get your hands on the folks you put in office who ignore all the things you wanted 'em to do?

Maybe you\u2019ll hold the next famous cartoon character in your hands! Or maybe you'll just get greasy fingers. And you'll have made a funny cartoon!\n    You will get not just one gorgeous hand-made cartoon drawing - but a whole Goddamn scene! Spumco big shots Jim Smith and I drew each scene lovingly with pre-digital age stone tools (pencils) with YOU in mind. Flip through the drawings to see how a real traditional cartoon is acted. Or frame them and show 'em off to all your friends at the reform school.\nThis is some rare shit folks! I happen to have every page of the classic comic \"Comic Book\" drawn by Jim Smith, Vincent Waller, Mike Fontanelli, Shane Glines, Rick Altergott and other top Hollywood cartoonists.

You will own and cherish a whole layout scene from Cans Without Labels - and as an added bonus - a real live painted animation cel from one of Spumco's cartoons, rock videos or commercials. Turn all your neighbors green with envy. Signed by me of course.\nI will not only give you a credit in the cartoon - I will personally draw YOUR HEAD to put next to the credit. Here's a sample:\n  Here's a whole pile of samples of my caricatures:\nhttp://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/search/label/caricature\nYou can show off your head and credit in the cartoon to all your friends and family and act like a big time Hollywood executive!\nYOU'RE PART OF THE 1% AND PROUD OF IT!\nOK, folks here is THE BIG ONE. Join the esteemed ranks of top celebrities I have animated. You - yes YOU will make a cameo appearance in the cartoon. That's right!  I will personally do a caricature of you and animate you into the credits of the cartoon and thank you for being the philanthropic high-roller that you are! Maybe George will even pull your pants down.\nWhere Is Your Money Going?\nWe still need to animate, clean up, inbetween and color the cartoon. We will paint the backgrounds and build a cg set and some props. Then we need to pay for music, sound effects and final editing.  The whole process will take about 7 months.  It will be 8-10 minutes long, which is about the same length as a Ren and Stimpy episode, but for HALF the price!\nWe will also make DVDs and produce the prizes to ship out to all you swell folks who backed the project! \nThis is your chance to be your own Hollywood Cartoon executive and produce a Spumco-type cartoon the way you like it!\nThanks in advance for bringing the future of cartoon-making into the world of now!\nYour best friend,\nJohn Kricfalusi\nP.S.\nDon't for get to check this out!\nmusic courtesy of www.apmmusic.com\nHere's me showing how we ink our cartoons using Toonboom's \"Animate\" program.

We have, and we\u2019d like to make that possible with your help. Every album you\u2019ve ever heard is exactly the same as the first time you heard it, and it will be the same the next time you hear it. Starbound is different. It\u2019s an album that changes each time you play it, and the more you play, the more it changes. Confused by what we mean? Check out our HTML5 Audio Demo. \nIn April of this year we released Earthbound on Porto Franco Records, a small San Francisco based indie label. We had the opportunity to work with some amazing people, NASA scientists, musicians, authors, and artists. This project is the sequel to that effort. Starbound is a remix app to Earthbound that will include millions of remixes that adapt to your input. Starbound is an ambitious project that will also include sonified light curves (the sound of actual stars), an augmented reality space flight game, and an interactive art widget that includes a comic book written by award winning sci-fi author Nnedi Okorafor, artwork by Facebook muralist Jonathan Matas and original illustrations by Tanna Tucker, and tons of unlockable content, from unreleased songs and artwork to star charts to mini-games and playable instruments.\nAn upgrade from our beta version available on the app store that allows you to remix our song Phone Home using any 10 digit number. Every phone number will have a unique version of this song! For those of you counting that\u2019s 10 to the 10th power or 10 billion remixes. \nThis will be a 24 hour long remix to our song Wake Up that changes in 5 minute increments. In order to hear the same version of the song you\u2019ll need to set an alarm.  \nYour story remixes the song. Remix our song Stories using 140 character tweets. You will be able to write a story, hear what it sounds like, and then share it with friends via hashtag. For those of you counting, we have no idea how many remixes this is, but it\u2019s a LOT. \nKaraman Line is an augmented reality game played on the back of the Earthbound CD, or by using a printed AR marker. You will be able to see a \u201chologram\u201d of the CopperWire spaceship hover over the words \u201ccopper wire\u201d written in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Once you launch the ship you will be able to fly through space listening to remixes of the Earthbound album. The spaceship flies with the rhythm of the music, and your actions in the game will determine the how the songs in this app are remixed.   \nSoundTouch will use original interactive artwork by facebook muralist Jonathan Matas to unlock hidden content including, interviews and unreleased songs by CopperWire. SoundTouch will also include paintings, and sketches from other artists including illustrator Tanna Tucker. This widget will unlock a 20 page comic book written by DC comic writer and renowned sci-fi author Nnedi Okorafor based on CopperWire\u2019s Story.\nRemi(x) System\nWe utilize a system that binds musical elements to data using the rules that govern harmony and melody. The rearranging or changing of these data sets creates variations (remixes). We realized that every song at its core is an abstraction that exists as just one iteration of virtually infinite possibilities. We just try to account for as many of these possibilities as we can using a little bit of math, a fair amount of code, and a whole lot of experimentation. The Remi(x) system allows for literally any input data to be turned into musical variation; anything from the rotation of the Earth to how you\u2019re feeling today.\nIf want to see it in action check out the demo web app! (chrome only). \n\nStar Sounds\nJon Jenkins was kind enough to allow us the use of some of his stellar light curve sonifications. What are stellar light curve sonifications? Basically they are interpretations of the sounds of stars based on their brightness over time. Jon found certain stars which pulse at regular intervals (like a drum) and took this pulsing and transformed it into sounds. We take these sounds and modify them using a variety of synthesis and analysis techniques.The end result is a truly unique sonic landscape.\n\nAugmented Reality Game\nThe words \"copper wire\" written in Amharic are designed in such a way that it can function as an AR marker. Utilizing the Qualcomm AR toolkit Vuforia, the app reads the marker and pulls a 3D model of the CopperWire spaceship from a server that can be manipulated in real time in the Unity 3D Game Engine. From your perspective the spaceship actually appears in front of you. Once activated the ship then travels through a space tunnel and will encounter obstacles and bonus pickups that will create additional variations on the music using the Remi(x) system.\nHave a question about how something works? Or even about something else? Please, ask us a question! You'll be helping us, and everyone else who visits. You can message us, or use the link at the bottom of the page. \nWe're very excited to get started on this project but we need your help. We have a talented group of collaborators, experience in mobile and web development, and all the necessary pieces to put the puzzle together. We have basic prototypes for most of the pieces of the app but we still have a lot to do, we still have to...\ncreate the music\nrecord, mix & master\nturn star sounds into music\npurchase developer licenses\npay development costs\ndevelop the app itself (lots of code!)\nalpha & beta test\ndesign the comic book\ncreate the 3D models \nSome of these things cost money, some of them just take a lot of time...and time is money so pretty much we need money to cover the costs of producing a project of this scale.\nThe short answer is absolutely. The development team that will be working on Starbound has a broad spectrum of skill sets that include 3D modeling, graphic design, app development and musical composition experience that ranges from Hip Hop to Classical to Dubstep to Tech Metal. The lead developers Ellias Fullmore and Chris Coniglio have both studied generative and adaptive music and have applied the theories behind this process in several previous iterations that include a 180 degree projected video game, a generative music touch table game, music from brain waves, and an HTML5 web app that applies the concept of Musica Universalis to make musical compositions generated by the orbital motion of planets, moons and stars. As owner of AppSynth Media, Ellias has designed and produced (among other apps) a beta version of one of the elements of Starbound, Phone Home Remi(x) currently available on the app store. At this point in the process we have the enthusiastic support of an impressive list of graphic artists, scientists, musicians, network specialists, app developers, and most importantly fans who are just as excited about Starbound as we are.\nCopperWire - The Ethiopian American sci-fi Hip Hop group consisting of Senior TED Fellow, songwriter and cultural activist Meklit Hadero , Seattle underground hip hop legend Gabriel Teodros and rapper/ producer Burntface provide the lyrical content and inspiration behind StarBound \nChris Coniglio - Chris, producer of the Earthbound album, is a classically trained musician and computer programmer who is the technical wizard behind the code, design, and much of the musical composition behind Starbound.\nAppSynth Media - Ellias Fullmore AKA Burntface in addition to being a rapper/ producer is co-owner of AppSynth Media an Oakland based app development start up. AppSynth Media has collaborated with CopperWire in the past and is looking forward to working on the Starbound app.\nPortoFranco Records - PFR has been generous enough to be supportive of this experiment called Starbound. As the label explores news ways to be relevant in the age of \"free downloads\", owner Peter Varshavsky has been an invaluable resource.\nNnedi Okorafor - The award winning science fiction author has contributed an original story inspired by the Earthbound album and is considered an honorary member of CopperWire. She has helped to garner suppor for CopperWire among the sci-fi and comic book communities.\nDr. Jon Jenkins - Jon is an analyst at NASA Kelper labs, who has produced sonic light curves (the sound of stars) created using data from NASA's Kepler Spacecraft. Dr. Jenkins was been gracious enough to allow us to use his work to make \"star\" music.\nRay Gilstrap- Ray is a network engineer and acting CTO at NASA Ames Research Center, finishing his PhD. in Electrical Engineering. He is a data networking specialist who has volunteered his time and expertise as consultant on this project.    \nJon Matas - Jon is a painter, muralist at Facebook. He will be contributing artwork to the SoundTouch interactive art widget included in Starbound.\nTanna Tucker - Tanna is an illustrator, comic book artist and co-creator of Sea Wulfe, she will be providing original character designs inspired by the CopperWire science fiction story.\nYou- At the end of the day, you provide the input data and create your experience, without you there would be no Starbound.\nEven if you can\u2019t donate to the project you can help us out a lot by sharing the link to the kickstarter or the Remix Demo with your friends.

If you are drawing in Photoshop or Illustrator, we recommend exporting at 6000 px tall.\nPerfectly clear: Your image is 2700 px tall or greater. We can easily size it up from  this without any loss in quality.\nStill safe: You image is 1800 px tall or greater. We can scale it up and use some filters to get it to print clearly.\nIf you have a vector file, you can email that to us and we'll print from that for perfect sharpness. (We haven't figured out supporting vector files on the website yet.)\nDSLR photos are great.\nFor iPhone photos: Our benchmark is the highest size from the iPhone 4 camera, landscape orientation: 2592 x 1936. We have scaled this up and use some Photoshop filtering to get rid of any noise so it prints fine. \nWe have also printed a smaller photo...The nyc dress in the example above used an image that is 1600x1000px. It needed some more filtering to resize it up to printable resolution, but the end result still looked good. (Looks like a photo viewing as a dress, more watercolor-y if you examine the fabric.)\nAnything I should know about colors?\nLarge areas of black are not super black. The ink just doesn't get as black as dyed fabric does. Lines and smaller areas are fine--I've printed houndstooth--you just notice it if you have a large section of black.\nIs $10,000 really enough to do all of this?\n$10K is enough to get us started with an initial batch of preorders. We're quite handy with design and tech, so we're coding our own website and designing everything that goes with it, as well as sewing the initial samples. The funds will help us pay for studio space and materials so we can finish design and testing of the first styles.\nWith the preorder quantity, we can work with a garment production workshop in NYC that will sew the pieces with the best professional standards. Since every piece is unique, we're not doing the traditional wholesale order process that's standard in the industry. But fortunately we can make great use of local sample production.\nWe're getting the fabric printed with a supplier, so we are not budgeting for an industrial grade printer. If this Kickstarter exceeds our expectations, then we can get our own printer much earlier, which means faster order fulfillment times for everyone. \nYou guys seem familiar...\nLast year, we put our project, \"Continuum: Computational Couture\" on Kickstarter. We didn't reach our goal, but we got lots of positive feedback, and have taken that to refine our idea to create CONSTRVCT. Our earlier project was a little more art, and Constrvct is a little more product, but they both center around the same idea of interactive fashion design.

We have met our goal! Thank you all so very much for making this happen. The support and love we've been feeling has been overwhelming.\nBut we're not done yet! Because our $16,000 goal was set conservatively, we do encourage our supporters to keep spreading the word and pledging. Our budget estimate was set to the absolute minimum to make Drag Dad possible, and we could still use more help. Any funds raised beyond our goal would go towards making the film even greater, including:\nExpanding our shoot schedule to capture more material with James and Jeremiah.\nUpgrading our equipment rental package to include the very best tools with which to make this film.\nHiring an award-winning post-production team to to make the final product something we can all, as backers and supporters, be proud of.\nPurchasing Errors and Omissions Insurance to be able to move the film into the theatrical and broadcast medium.\nSubmitting to more high profile international film festivals (this is costlier than you'd think!).\nStrengthening our marketing and distribution efforts to help this film and its message reach as large an audience as we can.\nABOUT THE FILM\n\"Having Jeremiah when I was 17 saved my life.\" -James William Ross, IV (aka Tyra Sanchez)\nDrag Dad is an independent documentary project about a six year old boy named Jeremiah and his father, the drag queen superstar named Tyra Sanchez. In 2010, Tyra Sanchez won the popular reality show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, propelling Tyra and her creator James into stardom.\nCapturing both the everyday and the sensational aspects of James\u2019 dual existence as a drag queen and a parent, the film will examine James\u2019s experience of leading these two contrastive lifestyles. What is it like for Jeremiah to have a dad who is sometimes a man and sometimes a woman? Is James any different a dad because he works as a female impersonator?\nFilmed in an observational cinema verit\u00e9 style, Drag Dad will combine interviews with James, Tyra and Jeremiah, and footage of their everyday domestic lives in Atlanta to gain an in-depth view into this unique LGBT family.\n\"It's like Will Smith's father-son flick, The Pursuit of Happiness, only in lipstick and a bigger wig.\" omgblog.com\n\"We're falling in love with Drag Dad!\" -thefrisky.com\nAlso featured on jezebel.com, walltowatch.com,  gay.net, passportmagazine.com, Los Angeles news KTLA 5's Sunday Edition Show, Icelandic News Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 and RUV, and the Twitter feed of the queen of queens, RuPaul!\nWHY DOES THIS FILM NEED TO BE MADE?\nMost Americans today still believe children should only be raised by a man and a woman. As filmmakers, we feel a need to break down the idea that some parents are somehow better than others because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We think it\u2019s important to show those who hold prejudices against LGBT families that these things do not define what makes a good parent. It shouldn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re gay, straight, a Wall Street broker or drag performer. Love and dedication to your child defies all labels. We\u2019ve seen James and Jeremiah together, and the sweet nature of their relationship. We want to bring that relationship to the screen.\nJames stopped by in New York City recently to perform as Tyra Sanchez, and we were lucky enough to tag along and film Tyra\u2019s adventures for a couple nights (some of which you can see in the above videos). Most Drag Race fans will grant that James is an electric presence on stage. But, from having spent time with him for this first part of filming, we have seen that he is an always engaging, always entertaining character-- and such a great subject for the kind of documentary we want to make.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nTo make this film, we need to raise money to travel with a small crew to Atlanta to film James and Jeremiah in their home environment. We have worked out that $16,000 is the absolute minimum amount to make this film possible. This all goes towards making the film, not to the filmmaker himself. The Kickstarter goal covers the production of the film, post-production, promotions, festival submissions and everything in between.\nYour contributions will go toward:\nProduction: equipment rentals, insurance and taking a small, dedicated team of filmmakers to Atlanta (budget travel, economic lodging and cheap food)\nPost-production: editing, sound mixing, grading\nPromotions/distribution: marketing the film, reaching out to press and communities, film festival submissions and travel. We want this film and its message to reach as large an audience as possible!\nYOUR REWARDS!\nFor making this film possible, we have arranged a fabulous set of rewards for contributors to show our appreciation. With the generous cooperation of Tyra Sanchez herself, we are able to offer you exclusive goodies such as signed photo books and posters, limited edition DVDs, video drag lessons from Tyra, Tyra memorabilia, and even the opportunity for Tyra to personally \u201cdragatize\u201d you and perform at your party, which we\u2019ll film! All contributors will receive a password to stream the film, and all pledges $10 and over will receive a digital download of the film upon its release.\nWe hope you can tell how very excited the filmmakers and James are about making this project happen, and we hope you are too! \nThank you so much for your support!

It was an idea that I'd never seen done before and would love to make myself.\nWhen I first thought of the idea for making this short, I thought that it would be best shot in live action and then 3D tracked, with the letters animated and composited in 3D in post-production. I have experience in 3D tracking, compositing, shooting, and some 3D modeling but I needed extra help with the animation to really make things look right, so I decided to turn to kickstarter for help. With help from the kickstarter community I should have no trouble at all putting together an amazingly fun and entertaining short film.    \nAll funding will go towards creating the most amazing 3D short animated film about text coming to life and battling that I can possibly make. There will be explosions, ink splattering, and most likely comic sans is going to get blown to bits at some point. I'll be using the funding from this project to hire an additional animator and compositor to help with the workload. I will also be hiring a composer to help score the piece properly, and the rest of the funding will go towards the purchase of equipment to shoot and edit the piece. \nDonating also means you can feel good about supporting independent film-making...but honestly, that only goes so far. So, as a reward for your investment I've spent a lot of time designing and producing some very cool stuff to give back. These prints and T-shirts will be limited edition and will only be available through kickstarter. I hope you have as much fun wearing them as I had designing them. \n\"Helveteran\" and \"Arial Squad\" are both printed on high-quality next-level apparel tri-blend shirts in various styles and colors shown above (as well as printed in grey). I chose the tri-blend shirt as it is incredibly soft and comfortable, but also durable and a great cut. These shirts will be awesome, and if you're at a party wearing one, most people, including myself, will have a hard time not making out with you. That's not a threat, it's a promise. \n\"Arial Attack on Inky Hill 64\" is printed on a well-cut 100 percent cotton next level apparel shirt. It is a discharge print so it's extremely soft after washing and has a high amount of detail. The design has some of the history of Helvetica and Arial hidden in the text as well as a few printing tools and some other Easter eggs that will be fun to find as you wear it. It too has the power to make you ridiculously attractive at parties. Use it wisely. Note: there may be minor tweaks in the design before printing as I am a perfectionist at heart and want to make the best shirt possible for you. \nThis is an 11x17 limited edition \"War is helvetica\" poster print. It will be shipped, signed, and numbered as well. If you take it to a party, people might make out with you. I'm just saying, it could happen. \nHey, thank you for viewing my Kickstarter project. Even if you decided to not invest, I just wanted to say thanks for stopping by. Also, If you see a friend or loved one in need of some nerdy design apparel, you know where to point them. Everybody has a birthday, and they hate you when you get them socks. They smile and seem grateful, but really they hate you. So, stock up on cool stuff while you can. Thanks for your help.  \n1. How will I order the right shirt, color, and size? \nWhen my goal is reached and the kickstarter project is over, I will send out a order form to fill out depending on what level of rewards you chose. \n2. How do I know you're not just going to take all the money, go to Vegas, and put it all on red? \nBecause everyone knows you put it on black....No, no, I kid. I am extremely dedicated to this project. The preparation for it, believe it or not, has taken months, and I'm sticking with it until I can sit back and watch an amazing short film, just like the one I envisioned when this idea was first conceived. Your dollars will go to good use. \n3. Did you really write a book called \"Hey is that Dan Schreiner? Or just a tree wearing glasses?\" I can't find it on amazon.  \n No, the ideas in it were too dangerous to publish. \n4. Why is the due date for the actual production set to March of 2013? \nThis film is going to be deliciously difficult to produce and at the moment I'm on another video project that will take a lot of my production focus until later in the summer. On top of this, I really want the animation in the film to be smooth and convey a fun story and that may take some time. Finally  I want to have a really cool musical score to tie things together which pushes back the date I can deliver this piece. Even in a short film format, a production like this will take time. I want to deliver a quality piece for you guys, not something rushed and hobbled together. Here, have a hug, we're going to get through the wait together. Believe me, I want to see it just as bad as you do. If things clear up or if time allows I will try and push production forward as much as I can without sacrificing quality.\n5.

It was the first time I'd seen a place where people all over the world could post their ideas and get the backing of a really awesome community. I started studying it, wondering what attributes would make a project successful, what might cause them to miss their funding. There were all sorts of anomalies and different projects, but I decided that to see something become successful you would have to offer your backers something really special and heartfelt, something original, and unique. I was riding the red line in Chicago looking at all of the street art, stencils, and graffiti and I thought to myself, \"What would you do if you were a street artist?\" I came up with an idea about typefaces fighting and set to work in the middle of a web conference designing a first draft of what eventually became the arial attack on inky hill 64 shirt. I kept building on this idea, kept pushing myself to build a project that I would want to see on Kickstarter, to make rewards that I would want to have, so I kept designing, building other shirts and posters. I eventually went through about 5 drafts of the arial attack shirt before I even posted the project, I went to a local screen printer to do a test print. to make sure it was even possible. The printer was perplexed by why I was going through the trouble until he saw the design. \"Holy Shit.\" he said, \"That's crazy. You're crazy. We can't do that\" But we built a prototype and did it anyway (it's one I'm wearing right now) and after that I updated the design to print cleaner and better.

Detroit is aflame with controversy after the Detroit Lions announce that the popular Canadian band Nickelback will be the halftime entertainment.

Only one problem...they aren't a \"real\" band... YET.\n\nSince the announcement in May, the band has taken huge strides towards legitimacy by showing up to do a photo shoot and creating a Facebook page.  Only one hurdle remains:  a studio album of Motown-styled Nickelback covers.  This is where YOU come in. \n\nWe're asking for your help to cover the studio and licensing costs involved in creating a full-length CD of Nickelback hits- each one painstakingly transformed via the classic Motown sound.  \n\n\nHelp A Motown Tribute to Nickelback pay tribute to legendary modern rock icons...by redo-ing all of their songs so that they sound like classic Motown tunes instead. \n\n\nA Motown Tribute to Nickelback on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/motownnickelback\nThe video that started it all:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KzP4bC1Ypg\nLive At Squamish:    http://liveatsquamish.com/lineup\n\nThe Road to Squamish documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GywZxUonEcw\nAn interview with Scott Bradlee: http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/11/scott_bradlee_nickelback_cover_motown_detroit_thanksgiving.php\n\n\nOFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY:\nThe brainchild of NYC pianist/arranger Scott Bradlee, A Motown Tribute to Nickelback offers an alternative take on Nickelback\u2019s recorded legacy by painstakingly converting the Canadian modern rock band\u2019s entire oeuvre into authentic Motown styles of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. A Motown Tribute to Nickelback rose to prominence in November of 2011, in response to an internet petition protesting Nickelback\u2019s scheduled performance at the Detroit Lions\u2019 Thanksgiving Day halftime show. The band\u2019s debut video, a tambourine-heavy cover of \u201cHow You Remind Me,\u201d quickly achieved notoriety on the internet as a means to satisfy both Nickelback fans and anti-fans. The band has been featured in media outlets such as The Huffington Post, the Village Voice, and the Vancouver Sun, and was described as \u201ckiller\u201d on Nickelback\u2019s official Twitter feed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "A Motown Tribute to Xmas", "update_content": "Hey folks,\n    Last year at this time, I was calling Drue, Allan, Tim, Adam, and Steve to tell them to show up at my place at 9pm to film a cover of a Nickelback song.

We specialize in creating new and innovative music by combining various genres (classical, pop, etc) and incorporating comedy skits and choreography when we perform live.  We have had requests for an album but have not had the means to produce something of high quality thus far. Our group would like to create an album in order to share our music with a wider audience and to break the barriers between previously separate fields of music.\nWhere will all the money go?\nIn order to make this album, we first need to pay for a recording studio and engineer.  With a studio and engineer, we can have our audio professionally recorded and mixed into a highly listenable CD.  \nBecause we have so many arrangements of popular songs, we also have to pay a hefty sum to purchase copyrights to legally record our arrangements.  Each song can cost hundreds of dollars.  Some of these arrangements are our most requested and we would love to bring them to you!  (These include, but are not limited to: Lady Gaga Saga, Gotye's Somebody That I Used to Know, Fireflies by Owl City, Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap, Forget You! by Cee Lo Green, and many more!)  \nWe also will use funds for travel so we can meet up at the recording studio and make the album.\nWhy support our project?\nWe love making music and bringing entertaining pieces to you in a way that you might never have heard before.  Your donation will not only help us realize our project (to make an epic album!), but it will also go towards knocking down that line between classical and popular music.  What better way to join both genres than a bassoon quartet playing classical, popular, and original works?!\nWe can't do this project without all of you - if we fall short of our goal, we won't receive any of the pledged money (everyone gets refunds) - so thank you thank you thank you!  Please send this page along to anyone and everyone who has ever listened to, loved, or made music.  Thank you so much for your time and help!  \nLook below for more detailed information about our project.

You will be asked to enter your pledge amount and select a reward.  Then, you will be prompted to complete the purchase with Amazon.  If our project is successfully funded, your card will be charged when we reach the funding deadline.  Please contact us if you need help!\nMore Information and Details:\nWhy did we come to Kickstarter?\nThe album is going to be a compilation of a wide array of music, but a lot of what goes on the CD will depend on how much support we receive from YOU.  On Kickstarter, if we meet our fundraising goal, we receive every penny we raise!  The more we surpass our goal, the more songs we can do.  \nWhy is that?  For all the popular tunes, we will be recording someone else's copyrighted music.  Copyright is a really wonderful thing for musicians because it means that others cannot legally reproduce or sell their work without providing some type of compensation.  When we ask for donations, a large chunk of them will go toward other artists' copyright fees and permission to record.  If we go beyond our goal, we can record more popular songs and make a more comprehensive album.  \nAlso, the more support we get, the more studio time we can have.  When we put money towards studio time, we are not only paying to use the space, but we are also renting the recording equipment and a technician to mix the tracks. So the more money we raise, the longer we will be in the studio perfecting our performance and potentially recording extra tracks!  (Bonus features, anybody?)\nWhy do we do what we do?\nBecause we love it!  That goes without saying, but we have a number of other reasons to perform, present, and teach.  First, we feel fulfilled when we know that others are smiling, laughing, or thinking because of our performance.  Wherever we perform, we always have audience members come up to us and tell us how much they enjoyed it.  They hear some songs they know, some they don't know, and learn more about their own preferences!  We also get to raise musical awareness.  That is, we show the public that a seemingly stuffy and stodgy instrument like the bassoon can be fun, inspiring, and play more than just the Mozart Concerto.  We love all kinds of music, and introducing new textures and styles to audiences via the bassoon helps us break down the barrier between classical, popular, rock, jazz, and other genres.  With the production of this album, we hope to spread our reach and touch new audiences. \nWhat is an arrangement, and how do we write one?\nUnlike a composition, an arrangement is essentially a rewrite of a pre-existing song, but for our instrument.  If you've ever listened to something on the radio and then figured it out on piano, cello, or kazoo (or jammed with your garage band!) that's basically an arrangement.  For us, writing an arrangement begins with hearing a song that we really like and would love to play.  This can be anything!  We listen to the song over and over, paying special attention to the melody (in pop music that's usually the singer and sometimes the lead guitar) and the bass line (this is often the bass guitar and sometimes piano).  These are usually the two easiest voices to hear in a song.  Once we are familiar with them, we go to a piano or bassoon and start figuring out the pitches.  (If you want to do your own, you can use any instrument at all.  It can be a bit tricky at first, but if you keep at it, it gets easier!)  When the bass line and melody are written out, we listen to the inner voices.  These are the remaining voices that don't fit either the bass or melodic lines.  A lot of times they are guitar riffs or little fillers throughout the song.  Once those are written in, the writing process is done!  For us, the next step is clear--just grab a few friends and jam out to a brand new arrangement!  \nIf you have any other questions, comments, suggestions, please don't hesitate to write at thebreakingwinds@gmail.com.

Shona is a New York City based Australian film artist whose work involves the physical, alchemical, and sculptural manipulation of found images and materials to create abstract animations. We met for the first time this fall and now are plunging ahead with our first ever film collaboration. Yes folks, film not video, on 16 mm black and white film stock! We are so excited for you to get involved, learn about what we are creating, and help us make this project a reality!\nOur film invokes the spaces of Vaudeville through a Dada/Surrealist eye. These worlds share aspects of humor, oddity, and slapstick. Through a conjuring of these forms, we want to bridge the divide between \u201cart\u201d and \u201centertainment\u201d by creating a new visual language that combines these aesthetics, summoning new possibilities of magic, humor, pathos, and ephemerality.\nInspired by ghost towns, silent era clown films, voguing, slapstick, and eccentric dance, the ghosted figures in Ghost line conjure a vaudevillian past as traces \u2013 remnants; as if rising from the dust, transmitting signals of light and shadow.\nOur film will not attempt to represent any of these forms or histories, but instead summon them through a practice of imagining. The filmic space will be amorphous and mysterious, with the ability to mimic our shapeshifting character\u2019s visual and kinetic rhythms. Using the body and the anatomy of the film strip as the physical testing site for these multiple identities, we will use a practice of \u201cghosting\u201d the past to contact the depths of our historical collective unconscious.\nBringing these images out from under the dust requires currency!  We are looking forward to exploring the depth of what we can visually conjure.  And what you can help us conjure! \nLet us tell you a little bit more about this project:\nGhost line is a 16mm b&w experimental film and a collaboration between performer/choreographer, Cori Olinghouse and experimental filmmaker, Shona Masarin. The film plays with abstract patterns, rhythms, and alchemical techniques to conjure a lost world.  It begins with a vaudevillian preparing to perform for a nonexistent audience.  We find ourselves in an old theater, shut down and eroding - vaudeville has been long forgotten - a relic of the past. A ghosted character conjures a series of vaudevillian line drawings.   Summoning this lost history through a non-sequitur channeling of multiple characters and personalities, we imagine \"lines\" of history on a fragile emulsion.\nAbout us\nCori Olinghouse is a New York-based choreographer, teacher, and archivist whose work explores the shapeshifting capacities of the body in relationship to creativity, health, and culture.  She was a member of the Trisha Brown Company, a Movement Research Artist-in-Residence, and has performed with Bill Irwin, among others. \n\u201cOlinghouse performed with Trisha Brown for four years and, more recently, with Bill Irwin. If those two had a kid together, it might have thought like her (especially if it had begun to study voguing)\u2026What Olinghouse has quite entrancingly deconstructed is the notion of calculated expertise, efficient timing, and showmanship.\u201d  -Deborah Jowitt, The Village Voice  \nShona Masarin is a New York City based Australian film artist whose work involves the physical, alchemic, and sculptural manipulation of found images and materials to create abstract animations.\n\u201cSome come close to pure abstraction\u2026the uninhibited play with colour, light and texture in Shona Masarin's Behind My Mouth, Beneath My Lips, on My Eyes, where scratched fragments of material drift by like off-cuts from a dressmaker's workshop.\u201d  -Jake Wilson, \u201cFestival\u2019s Reel Time Experiment,\u201d The Age, April 29. 2010\nStills from past films by Shona Masarin\nGhost line collaborators\nFilm by Shona Masarin and Cori Olinghouse\nGhost lines originally conceived by Cori Olinghouse\nCinematography and Editing by Shona Masarin\nChoreography and Performance by Cori Olinghouse\nGuest appearance by Eva Schmidt\nCostume Design by Andy Jordan\nSound Design by Jake Meginsky\nFor more information about our Ghost line \u2013 the film, please visit us online at: http://ghostlinesproject.tumblr.com/\nTo see our most recent test footage, click here!\nPrizes - sneak preview!  \nONE-OF-A-KIND!

A combination of ambience, sound effects and simple thematic music is half of what makes a great animated experience. \nThe Story of Flewn follows an old whale crossing a continent on stilts made of driftwood in search of a new ocean for himself and the sea creatures he carries on his back. As he grows a beard and a weary heart he meets a frog on a unicycopter and a rabbit with wings. Together the three characters must use their creativity and courage to find a new ocean and confront the reason their world is falling apart around them. \nA new character.\nWhy tell a story interactively?  The Story of Flewn combines interactive game mechanics with cinematic storytelling set in a richly illustrated world.  Traditionally a reader would turn pages of a book or sit passively watching a film to discover a story.  In Flewn the player must keep the main characters (Frog and Rabbit) well fed and flying across beautifully illustrated landscapes in order to progress the story. This interactivity allows the user to feel a closer connection to the needs, ambitions and reactions of the main character.  By adding ambient sound and music the story takes on an immersive environment as the story unfolds. The audience experiences the world and feels a greater sense of discovery and fulfillment. \nPROJECT GOALS\nThe primary goal is to finish the interactive Story of Flewn into the equivalent length of reading a classic children\u2019s book.  (Think \u201cJames and the Giant Peach\u201d as an immersive, animated book with sound and music)  Currently Flewn is a work in progress.  All the technical and creative barriers have been overcome.  The challenge now is to enter into full production to add enough content to complete a great story experience.\nCurrently Supported Devices\nMac/PC + iPhone/iPad/iPod + Android + KindleFire + NookColor \nIllustrated PDF and other ebook formats that support images.\nI will be also be exploring new formats to tell the Flewn story. (printed book, animation film, etc.)\nYour funding will allow me the time to finish this painstakingly animated story in its full glory. I want to be proud of this story and want you to be as well.\nMore animation!\nquality music recordings/pro musicians\nProfessional sound design\nSoftware/Hardware updates\nCoding support\nMoney raised beyond the goal will be re-invested into art and new characters to make Flewn the greatest experience it can be.  \nJoin the Adventure!\nYour support makes this project possible. Lets make this happen! I want you to be a part of the process.  If you want to help brainstorm, provide feedback, describe your thoughts and test the experience I am open to all ideas and will carefully consider each suggestion.\nsooo....how am I going to deliver such an ambitious goal?\nCheck out my portfolio.  www.gabrielsmetzer.com I have worked on many high profile projects for clients like NASA, Intel, Yahoo, Adobe and many others in both art and technical director roles and am bringing that experience and hard work to this project.

The central spike of the crown rises 10 feet into the air.  The nose and hair rise three feet off the ground, which is an ideal height for children to roam over the head.\nThe whole piece will be painted with metallic copper paint and an acid activator, which will create the same green patina that coats the Statue of Liberty.\nThe Statue of Liberty is Bartoldhi's monument to America in 1886, The Face of Liberty is my monument to America in 2012.\nThis project, as with pretty much every project I've ever done, is a massive undertaking.

This film is not a biographical report on someone\u2019s life, nor is it a linear story.  Rather, it is an evocative study of a human being and an exploration of form and content that reflects the complexities of Kate and her world.  Engaging with Kate\u2019s personal and public persona, the film captures her multifaceted, sometimes contradictory, and always charming personality, which has won the hearts of people worldwide, while also alienating others.\nKate Bornstein is a Queer & Pleasant Danger explores Kate\u2019s artistic practice, her influences and the way she has created language, space, and permission for generations of people to live their lives outside traditional frameworks of gender, politics, and art.\nKate\u2019s life journey as a shape shifter, gender theorist, and survivor of great depression offers provocative new ideas on the nature of art, community, and what it means to be queer and transgender.\nAs of 6/1/12 we reached out Kickstarter goal of $20,000!

All the details are on the official XOXO site.\nHey Kickstarter! We're organizing XOXO, an arts and technology festival in Portland, Oregon this September 13-16th.\nXOXO is a celebration of disruptive creativity. We want to take all the independent artists using the Internet to make a living doing what they love \u2014 the makers, craftspeople, musicians, filmmakers, comic book artists, game designers, hardware hackers \u2014 and bring them together with the technologists building the platforms that make it possible. If you have an audience and a good idea, nothing\u2019s standing in your way.\nXOXO is in three parts:\nConference (Saturday \u2013 Sunday). Talks from artists and creative technologists around the country that are breaking new ground.\nMarket (Saturday \u2013 Sunday). A large marketplace with a tightly-curated list of the best of Portland's arts and tech scenes, sharing and selling their work, with food supplied by the best of our thriving food cart scene.\nFringe (Thursday \u2013 Sunday). A series of unique events around the city, including live music, film screenings, indie videogames, and craft beer and coffee tastings.\nPortland's the perfect place for XOXO \u2014 it's the most independent and DIY-friendly cities in the world, which runs through every part of its culture. It's no wonder that Portland's one of the biggest cities on creative platforms like Kickstarter and Etsy. This is a great way to experience the best of Portland under one roof.\nConference\nOn the top floor of XOXO, we're building a stage to host a single-track of talks from people we love who are changing the world. \nConfirmed speakers include the leaders of amazingly creative communities like Etsy, Kickstarter, Canvas and Metafilter, the fiercely independent creators behind World of Goo, MakerBot, Indie Game: The Movie, Star Wars Uncut, Diesel Sweeties and Black Apple, and industry-changing startups like The Atavist, Simple, CASH Music, and VHX.tv.\nThe full lineup's still evolving, and we'll announce additions and changes as they happen.

We're still reaching out to creators and making the schedule, and we'll announce the festival's project lineup and food carts as we have them.\nFringe\nWe\u2019re taking the ideas behind the conference and building a fringe program around it, teaming up with local partners to take over venues around the city for a series of unique events, including lectures, workshops, hackspace, live music, film screenings, indie videogames, a craft beer festival, meetups and parties.\nThis is a perfect opportunity to experience the best that Portland has to offer, to explore the city and interact with its rich maker culture with other like-minded attendees. We\u2019re deep into fringe event planning, and will announce updates as the schedule comes together.\nVenue\nWe're holding the event at the YU Contemporary in the historic Yale Union Laundry Building in SE Portland, a cavernous two-story brick building within easy walking distance to some of the best restaurants, microbreweries, coffeehouses, and bars in town.\nRewards\nFor rewards, we're offering a few options:\nConference passes.

Your donations will pay for only the basic essentials to make this happen: shirts, screen printing, bumper stickers, and shipping.\nA bit more:\nOne of the fundamental problems with sociopolitical slogans is that upon achieving any widespread degree of public awareness or adoption, they tend to become visually innocuous. Their ability to trigger critical thought quickly gives way to predisposed, apathetic dismissals, often based purely upon the audience's preexisting biases.\nThe movements to legalize gay marriage and marijuana, while objectively unrelated, are two of the most important and contentious social issues of the past decade. With this project, I aim to approach both issues from a fresh perspective by combining them into a single, irreverent slogan that is almost certain to catch the greater public off guard.\nBecause 'Legalize Gay Marijuana' lacks any clear literal meaning, its power lies in the unexpected--a peripheral glance and cursory recognition of the adjacent words 'Legalize' and 'Gay,' or rather 'Legalize' and 'Marijuana,' will invite a traditional snap-judgement, but before the viewer is able to dismiss it, the cognitive dissonance created by this simple juxtaposition will force them to reassess the words themselves, as well as their intended meaning. Ultimately, the slogan's inherently abstract message will ignite the mechanisms of critical thought that are usually lost when viewing more conventional political slogans.\nI am starting with a single, simple design, but once funded intend to expand the project with additional designs, formats, and artistic interpretations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Backer Rewards Have Arrived!", "update_content": "I'm happy to announce that all backer rewards have arrived and are headed out for delivery!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Rewards in Production!", "update_content": "Hello All,\nI just wanted to let you know that your shirts, bumper stickers and mugs are being printed as we speak - within the next two weeks I should have everything in-hand and ready to ship!\nI'll update you again as soon as the reward packages are assembled, at which point I should have an exact shipping date nailed down.

It is our first step in inspiring the next generation of female technology innovators.\nRoominate is a stackable, attachable & customizable miniature room with working circuits that you build yourself.\nOur Idea \nWe are three women who majored in engineering, math, and science. Throughout our education and at work, we were all far outnumbered by men. We realized that our own experiences in childhood were integral in attracting us to math and science as adults.\nAlice grew up playing in a robotics lab and her father gave her a saw when she asked for a Barbie.\nBettina built hundreds of Lego creations with her older brother and hence gave no thought to any gender differences in toys growing up.\nJennifer loved solving math riddles with her dad, and one of her earliest childhood memories is of her grandfather teaching her how to do long division in her head. \nBased on the belief that childhood exposure can facilitate excitement, familiarity, and confidence between young girls and STEM, we came together to design Roominate. \nRoominate is a kit of wooden building pieces and circuit components with which a child can use her creativity to design, build, wire, and decorate her own unique interactive room. \nAND, the rooms are attachable and stackable, enabling girls to build and design expandable structures. The pieces are made to be simple and intuitive so as to allow a girl to explore and discover on her own.\nDeveloping Roominate\nOver the past few months, we've worked with over 200 girls in our target age range to reach our final prototype for Roominate. Young girls have experimented with our toys at local events and at the Children's Creativity Museum in San Francisco. They have tested our toys individually, in small groups and in large groups, both with and without adult guidance. \nWe\u2019ve learned a lot about the way that girls play and have been performing rapid product iteration based on feedback and observation. We have seen that designing a compelling experience is important for getting them to try new things - like circuits! That experience includes both the physical pieces and the imagination girls use when deciding what to build and create.  \nUsing only rudimentary prototypes, we have seen Roominate\u2019s pieces spark remarkable creativity and excitement in young girls.\nProvide a girl with a buzzer and a motor, and she\u2019s decided her room is a restaurant, with the motor serving as a fan to cool patrons and the buzzer being used by the chef when an order is ready.\nProvide a girl with a set of animal stickers, and her room becomes a pet shop, complete with dog beds and animal food bowls.\nConstructing, creating, connecting, and designing integrate together to make Roominate a blast!\nConstructing the rooms and furniture gives girls control over the customization of their creation while exposing them to hands-on building and spatial skills.\nConnecting the circuits brings the rooms to life; a fan or a light can instantly make a room interactive. Most young girls have never made a circuit, but they love the intuitive experience our color-coded circuits provide.\nDesigning the room ties the experience back to common play patterns that we know girls love!\nYoung girls have loved the product and are anxiously awaiting the opportunity to own their own kits. \nRoominate Reel\nWe\u2019re more than just a toy company. We want to inspire your daughters to be the great artists, engineers, architects, and visionaries of their generation. We intend to give them every tool to reach that potential.\nWe have discovered that storytelling increases engagement. With Roominate Reel, a series of mini-movies, we will set the scene for Roominate.\nWe will tell the story of Roominate -- to get girls excited about the world they are about to jump into.\nWe will engage girls with lessons applicable to Roominate -- to enhance the educational value of the toy.\nWe will provide prompts and challenges -- to keep girls coming back to Roominate. Our prompts will stimulate girls' problem solving and creativity skills, while also ensuring that Roominate stays compelling, entertaining, and illuminating.\nRoominate Reel will help girls experience the joy of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math!\nJoin Us!\nWe want to introduce Roominate to the rest of the world, but producing the kits by hand is unsustainable.\n\nThat's where you come in! \nWe need your support to help us scale up our production through large quantity orders on wood, electronics, and assembly costs. Also, since Roominate is designed to be played with by children under the age of 14, Kickstarter will enable us to fulfill the tests needed to certify compliance to toy safety standards.\n-------------------------------------------- \nWhat do the Rewards Include?\nWe are continuing to perfect Roominate. Thus, the Roominate you receive is going to be even more refined than the one seen in the pictures and video. \nOne Roominate Kit includes: 2 wooden walls, 1 wooden floor, interchangeable wooden building pieces to construct at least 3 pieces of furniture, 1 complete circuit, and assorted decorations to get you started.\nA Deluxe Decoration Pack includes: tons of additional decorations so that you can adorn your creation over and over again!\nBringing Roominate To You\nHere are the details of our plan to bring Roominate to you:\nUpon successful completion of our Kickstarter, we will be able to refine our prototype, test its safety and usability, and begin production within a few weeks.  \nWe will continue to do all of the designing, prototyping, and usability testing ourselves.\nUpon refinement of our prototype, our wood will be laser cut through contract shops in the Midwestern United States or in the Bay Area. The final contractor will be selected based on our ultimate production quantities. Shipping, treating, and cutting the wood will take approximately ten weeks (treating the wood ensures that it passes toy safety standards).\nOur electronic components are all off-the-shelf. All of the parts we will be using are UL certified, and we will also be conforming to additional toy safety standards. Our assembly specifications with contract manufacturers include in-house reliability and safety testing. The assembly will be done locally. Lead time, set-up, product testing, and assembly will take approximately eight weeks.\nBefore we start producing, we will ensure that our scaled-up version of Roominate is as safe, engaging, and exciting as our prototype.\nPacking and shipping will be contracted locally. This process will take two weeks.\nThe price includes the cost of our final prototyping, manufacturing, testing, assembly, packaging, and shipping (in the United States).\nJoin us in creating a brighter future for girls!

(and about that harassment stuff)\nAbout this Project:\nI love playing video games but I\u2019m regularly disappointed in the limited and limiting ways women are represented.  This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.  The series will highlight the larger recurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.  I\u2019m going to need your help to make it happen!\nAs a gamer, a pop culture critic and a fan, I\u2019m always working to balance my enjoyment of media while simultaneously being critical of problematic gender representations. With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce. I will be researching and playing hundreds of titles from across the gaming industry (including some truly awful games that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone!). Your support will go towards production costs, equipment, games and downloadable content.\nPlease pledge any amount you can and become a backer of Feminist Frequency\u2019s Tropes vs Women in Video Games!\nFeminist Frequency is an ongoing web series of video commentaries focusing on representations of gender, race, class, sexuality and ability in pop culture. \nLast year I released a video series called Tropes vs Women analyzing female representations in the mainstream media.  This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!

Wow! Time has flown on Kickstarter! Three days to go and we've reached TWO goals already. Thank you to all of you for supporting this idea. None of this would be possible without you.\nSince we've hit our $8000 target let's take it to the third and final level with only three days to go: Let's aim for $15000! The more exposure these Posticks get the more likely it is that I can get them onto the shelves. If we can inspire enough friends with this project in the next 3 days we'll most definitely inspire a postcard revolution and potentially play our part in saving the Postal Service. Let's do this thing!\nI need your help to raise $15000 to produce my first batch of Posticks. To inspire you and everyone else to send postcards again. You'd effectively be pre-buying the Posticks (and so much more) by pledging for some of the fantastic rewards listed on the right hand side of this page.\nPOSTICKs are white adhesive labels with rounded corners (like in the picture). They're slightly smaller than your average photograph and they have the normal postcard-backing lines printed on them. The labels are easy to write on with a normal pen.\nYou could take a photograph of your weekend away, stick a Postick on the back, write a message on it and send it to Bob who moved to Barcelona. He'll love that! You could take that awesome portrait your 5 year old niece drew, stick a Postick on the back and send it to uncle Harry in Hollywood. He'll make her famous! You could stick one on the fabric scraps, send it to aunt Augusta in Austria. She'd be over the moon! You could get some of those awesome black and white vintage photographs (of people you know nothing about) from the antique store, stick a Postick on the back, write a note and send it to your hipster friends in Berlin. The options are endless. Really.\nThere's something strangely wonderful about receiving postcards. It's hard to describe since it's a little piece of card. But it's much more than just processed wood and a hand written note. It's a thought of someone that spontaneously manifested somewhere else in the world. A thought so strong that it transformed itself into hand-written words on a piece of card. That random little thought survived a complex (and fantastic) postal system, continents, human error and the forces of nature and finally made it into that exact little mailbox. It's a miracle!\nI've created a bunch of fun \"rewards\" for each pledge to inspire you and your friends and cousins to back my fantastic campaign. I've listed the rewards on the panel on the right hand side so have a look. Especially the $250!!! It's the only reward limited to 20 backers so if you're in you better be quick with the credit card! Keep scrolling to see examples of some of the beautiful things you can get for the various pledges below.\nA set of 10 beautiful Birthday cards with this little guy on them and of course a set of Posticks.\n10 of my favourite photographs printed postcard-size and a pack of Posticks:\n8 Kickstarter limited edition hand-illustrated quote cards printed on beautiful off-white paper. Is it a potential postcard? Is it something to hang on the wall? There's no need to decide:\nThere are a few more rewards so have a read through them on the right hand side to find the one/s that suit your personality.\nPLEASE NOTE: The $250 reward INCLUDES the TUTTI FRUTTI BUNDLE from the $150 reward.\nWhere will the cash go?\nReaching my goal of $4000 will enable me to produce the first big batch of 20000 labels with professional label-printers. This includes the set-up cost of creating plates and dyes specific to the exact size I'm after with rounded corners. It includes the costs for printing the first bulk batch (the more I produce the cheaper I can make these babies for you). I have made samples with adhesive paper but the paper's incredibly pricey and I need to take it to the next level and have them made by the people who know how.\nThe money will also go towards all the packaging elements such as printing the packaging label (that explains the product to passers-by in all the great retail stores that will stock Postick), the plastic sleeve, the paper and the stamp. I've done all the design work already so the cash really just goes into production.\nI've created a site: postcardhappiness.com which serves as a hub for all kinds of awesome postcard-related projects. I already have two great projects up so have a look and get involved. It's free. (Especially check out the Postcard Happiness Project) If you have some great postcard initiatives up your sleeve which you'd like to run off the same platform, get in touch. I'd love to have you on board as long as it's positive and inspires people to send postcards.\nIf we (you and I) make it over and above the goal of $4000 I would like to expand the website so that it's a little more user-friendly with regards to creating a community and expanding on the functionality since I'm effectively a graphic designer, not a programer.\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with Kickstarter: I have 33 days to make my target goal of raising $4000. If I don't make it to $4000 I don't receive any funding at all and nothing comes off your credit card. It's one of the Kickstarter principles and it's a good way to gauge whether or not the project has potential to be a winner. So please share this link with as many of your friends as possible, share it on facebook and tweet about it and help me reach my goal so that you and I can spread the postcard happiness like never before.\nThanks for reading through all this text and thanks for supporting my little vision of postcard happiness.\nThank you Charlie Winston for the beautiful background tune to my video.\nFollow me on twitter @postcardhappy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Bringing Postick to Europe and the US", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Festive season Postick specials for Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hello again\nIt's been a fantastic year for Postick.

I went to a new and fabulous factory yesterday (I won't bore you with the details on the old one) and felt papers, checked ink quality and discussed the way forward. The adhesive papers I've seen so far have been too thin for our awesome Posticks, so they're in the process sourcing a heavier label as I type, and looking into tools that will accommodate the heavier stock.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:\nIt comes ready to use out of the box with everything you see above: MaKey MaKey, Alligator Clips, USB Cable.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). \nLet's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the MaKey MaKey to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys:  \nOr let's say you Google for an online \"Pacman\" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil):\nThen you can play Pacman by touching the drawing with your finger.\nOr you could load up facebook or gmail and send a message on a custom-made alphabet soup keyboard:\nHow Does it Work?\nAlligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple.\nWhen you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. \nMake + Key = MaKey MaKey! \nWho is MaKey MaKey For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone. Here is an 8-year-old girl in a Maker Space:\nShe invented a \"knife-and-log\" interface for cutting virtual wood in an online game.\nWe ran a workshop in February 2012 with some professors and grad students who specialize in interaction design. One grad student made this beachball game controller:\nAnother grad student made this working pressure sensitive switch by layering Play-Doh under a spring:\nThe workshop took place at Queen's University during a conference.\nWith MaKey MaKey, kids can start inventing right away, and experts can make working prototypes in minutes instead of days.\nWhat materials work with MaKey Makey?\nAny material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work (if it doesn't already work, just rub it with bananas, spray it with water, or apply copper tape). Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:\nOther materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more...\nRequirements?\nMaKey MaKey works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.\nWhy Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.\nWe are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the \"Maker's Mindset,\" you know you can change the world.\nBefore we created MaKey MaKey we worked on other creative tools and invention kits such as Drawdio, Singing Fingers, and Scratch.\nWhy Are you Doing a Kickstarter?\nIf we raise $25,000 then we can do a large first run, which brings the retail cost down significantly, so that we can sell the kit to you for $35 (including shipping). We want this to be accessible to beginners, educators, artists, inventors, engineers, and anyone else regardless of income. \nWe are raising Kickstarter money to fund the first large run of MaKey MaKey kits. That is why most of the rewards are kits themselves. That's what we're spending the money on: manufacturing the kits.\nHave You Prototyped This?\nEverything in the video is real, running on either the first or the second prototype. Two years ago, we created the first prototype for MaKey MaKey, and ran a workshop at the San Francisco Exploratorium where people made \"Drum Pants\" and \"Tweet Tea\":\nThen we built the second prototype from 2011 to 2012, and we tested it with professional interaction designers. It looks like this:\nOur third prototype was just made, and will be tested at the Maker Faire and by 100 beta testers. It looks like this: \nNow we are designing the kit a fourth time. This will be the kit you, our KickStarter supporters, will receive. It will look mostly like the third prototype, with some aesthetic modifications.\nHow Are You Manufacturing the Circuits for the Orders Placed on Kickstarter?\nWe are collaborating with the amazing team at Sparkfun. Sparkfun is the perfect choice for us because they make safe, environmentally responsible (RoHS compliant) circuit boards. They are located in the USA (in Boulder, CO), and they treat their employees fantastically. Workers are paid a generous wage with benefits, can bring their dogs to work, listen to music while they work, etc. That may sound like it should be \"normal\", but in the world of circuit production it is very rare and there are lots of sad working conditions elsewhere. Also, Sparkfun is the world's largest manufacturer of Open Source Hardware, which is critical to MaKey MaKey, an all Open Source Hardware project.\nWe worked closely with Jim Lindblom and others from the Sparkfun team to get the board ready for manufacturing. We\u2019re grateful to have them as our partners in this project. With their help we will be done manufacturing and shipping by the end of August. They have a lot of experience meeting deadlines.\nWhat Does the Back of the Board Look Like?\nThe back of the board has hookups for 6 keyboard keys, and mouse control. It also has the open hardware logo, a link for help getting started, and an area for using the board in Arduino mode.\nWait... Is this thing an Arduino?\nYou could say this board is 2 for the price of 1. MaKey MaKey runs on top of Arduino. You can start using your MaKey MaKey board in \"Arduino mode\" at any time. This would allow you to spin motors, turn on LEDs, or anything else that an Arduino can do. If you want to learn to use Arduino or other electronics, but want to start without any programming or breadboarding, MaKey MaKey is a good starting point. There's no need to understand Arduino in order to use MaKey MaKey.\nSeriously, I Am a Geek, Tell Me All the Krazy Tech Stuff\nMaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. For sensing closed switches on the digital input pins, we use high resistance switching to make it so you can close a switch even through materials like your skin, leaves, and play-doh. We use a pull-up resistor of 10-50 mega ohms. This technique attracts noise on the input, so we use a moving window averager to lowpass the noise in software, saving money on hardware filtering. There are six inputs on the front of the board, which can be attached to via alligator clipping, soldering to the pads, or any other method you can think of. There are another 12 inputs on the back, 6 for keyboard keys, and 6 for mouse motion, which you can access with jumpers via the female headers. If you wish to use a different set of keys, or otherwise change the behavior of your MaKey MaKey, you can simply reprogram it using the Arduino environment.

So please, find it in your heart to support me, and young, funny women filmmakers everywhere.   \nThis project is extremely important to me as it's the last film I will make in my Undergraduate career.

It's also important to me to support women filmmakers and their stories.

I'm a professional photographer in London and now need funding to turn this two-year project into a beautiful fine-art book. Any help you give would be INCREDIBLE (and fulfill a life-long dream to see my work published) and in return you can get stunning gallery prints and a copy of the first edition book with your name printed in the back. See the links on the right for more information.\n.\n.\n.\nDogs in cars - why on earth??\n\nWhen I first had the idea five years ago I thought it was foolish. Dogs in cars? errrr..\nBut the best ideas are the ones that stay with you and after many years of being lodged in my subconscious this one eventually had to come out barking.\n\nI now realize the pictures come from fairly deep fears I've had of being alone and without a voice (I found it almost impossible to express myself when I was a kid) and also from my early fascination with animals, dogs in particular, who also seemed vulnerable and somehow mute.\n.\nI\u2019ve suffered from depression on and and off for much of my life \u2013 and I'll place a fair bet that these fears are at the heart of my struggles. But strangely enough I found peering into those cars and seeing the dogs inside somewhat beautiful - as if I was looking into the darkest places inside myself and seeing a face there. A silent face. But one that I recognized.\nSome people find this project funny, and I have no problem with that. But I hope it is also poignant and ultimately hopeful.  If you have experienced the anxiety and darkness that comes from feeling alone and can connect with these images then please pass on the word.\nKickstarter is all or nothing. I HAVE to raise my goal or no money gets transferred, zero.  It would be wonderful to see this project reach its final resting place as a book.  I would be grateful to each and everyone one of you that helps.\nTHANK YOU!!\nHow did you make these images?\nThese images are shot on location and the dog is placed in the car. That's important to say.  A lot of people think these are incidental images. This isn't the case... partly because its very hard to find dogs stuck in cars whilst you are carrying lights around and partly because these images are not meant to be documentary, but something more dreamlike and cinematic. They evoke a feeling. Lots of lights are used and the mood is carefully controlled.\nWhy dogs and not people in the car?\nDogs are emotionally honest. They don't hide who they are. The dog in the car is a metaphor for those raw and dare I say it - animal - parts of ourselves that we keep locked away. But the images also say something about the way we control the animals in our lives.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhy do you need all that money?\nAn amazing German fine-art publisher called Kehrer wants to produce a  limited-edition book -  but only if funds can be raised to contribute to the cost. This is standard practice in the art photography world (especially in these hard times). Since the book will be of an extremely high quality (rich photo paper, linen cover we hope) and limited to around 1000 copies at a relatively large-format (up to 14 inches wide) and also printed on a special European press the costs are considerable.\nBut it means the book will be BEAUTIFUL!!! Woof!\nEvery cent of your donations will contribute directly to the book. The more that is funded, the bigger and more lavish the book will be (without any extra costs to you). And the publisher expects the final book to cost more than it does on kickstarter - so getting pledging! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

Mostly to share with all of you lovely people! \nScore rental \u2013 Since a few of the pieces we are presenting are owned by publishers, we need to pay fees for renting the score. This money we pay to the publisher also filters down to the composers in the long run. We are all for that! \nOther stuff \u2013 Printing costs for posters and fliers, pizza for our crew putting in long hours on the day of the concert, the last minute trip for batteries that we forgot to account for. Plus, kickstarter and amazon.com take a (admirably small) amount off of whatever we make. \nIT DOESN'T STOP THERE!\nIn order to create a sustainable model for our future, we want to change the way we do things.\nFor our last four concerts we have paid all the expenses for a concert out of our own pockets and then reimbursed ourselves (well, partially reimbursed ourselves\u2026) out of ticket proceeds while putting a priority on giving most of the money from ticket sales to our performers. Even with huge crowds and incredibly successful concerts we have hardly been able to give our musicians enough money for a cab ride home and never have been able to carry money forward to the next project. BUT WITH YOUR HELP we plan on changing that model! We want to use the money we raise here to pay for the costs of putting on our cello concert so that this time we can apply proceeds from the ticket sales toward our next concert. We are so excited and motivated to continue growing our collective and expanding its possibilities that we want to make sure we are doing it in a way that is healthy and sustainable for many years to come.

My own site, facebook, twitter all bear witness to my endless doodling. \nSo what is this project all about?\nI'm making prints - and not digital prints. Linoleum cut, relief prints, using CYMK process inks and watercolors, to be specific.The funding will go towards buying the highest quality paper, inks, linoleum, and press time at a professional printing studio.\nThe main focus of this project will be a 24\" x 36\" linocut. It will be printable as a diptych for the final tier of rewards - yielding a 3 by 4 foot print. (I think everyone should own at least one huge piece of art, but there are going to be plenty of smaller pieces created for this project as well.)\nWhat makes this project super special is the level of customization. Every print is hand-colored after it's pulled, so each one will be unique. Not only that, every print larger than the postcards can be customized to suit your preferences. If you want a vibrant autumnal palette, or a calm sea-green composition, or even just something to match your sofas, just make sure to leave your email. I'll be talking to each funder to ensure they get exactly the kind of print they want, as I produce them.\n- a selection of the mini-posters that will be available - \nMore specifically I'll be making these prints available:\nThe smallest prints will be about 4\"x6\" and will be a set of three different designs, perfect for post cards, gift tags or letters.\nThe next size up is a mini-poster (see above image.) The printed space is about 11\"x12\". I will make several more of these specifically for the project, and you can pick your favorites.\nThe next size up is a large poster size print called Radiation. It measures 18\" x 24\" and can be presented as a diptych or printed twice on a single sheet as 2'x3' piece. (The top image is two prints of Radiation, presented as a diptych.)\nThe final piece will be a print at least twice the size of Radiation, at approximately 24\" x 36\". Tentatively named Extropy, it's going to look something like the sketch below. This will be the largest piece created specifically for this project. The work can be presented as a diptych or printed on a single sheet as a 3'x4' piece. \n      - a sketch of Extropy, as a single piece and a diptych - \nMy Motivations -&- Why I'm using Kickstarter\nMy art tends to be extremely time consuming. This cut-paper piece, the largest I've done, took over 100 hours. (You can see the making of a smaller piece here.)  I estimated once that it would take me about six months non-stop working to make a piece the size of a Rothko or Pollock. Transitioning into printmaking has allowed me to scale up my work far beyond the constraints of my cut-paper work, with the added benefit of being able to quickly produce large editions once the meticulous cutting of the linoleum is finished. Leviathan Color is all about making work with the same vibrance and detail as my paper-cut work, while pushing my art towards a monumental scale. \nSelling art can be difficult in the best of markets, especially as an emerging artist without institutional backing. Funding this project with Kickstarter doesn't just mean taking on an ambitious project; since I'll be tailoring the production to exactly meet the demand, I can get this work into your hands for a damn low price. I think if you look at the rewards you'll see it's an amazing deal.\nI see this project as a small step forward towards a long, ambitious artistic career.

Each artist involved will receive an invitation to a specific place in New York City where the delivery of an installation or package will take place. The collaboration begins when the artist chooses to produce a piece in response to the installation received. This  exchange will be documented and presented in the Other Travel book in conjunction with an exhibition. \nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nWe are so grateful for the participation and support we have received with the launch of this project.\nWe have already planned delivery places and elaborate (large scale) installations tailored to fit each artists involved in the project.\nUnfortunately, we cannot move forward at this point without additional funding. The most financially significant thing we need funding for is the publication, which will take up 75% of our allotted budget. We also need to buy materials for all of the installations planned and their delivery and also work with graphic designer duo Full-Time / Part-Time. \nWe deeply appreciate anything you can give us and look forward to seeing you at the show!\nThe Other World \nThis unique interaction depends on a belief in the ability of Hayden and Meriem to act as creative mediums, enabling the invited artist access to their creative \u201cother\u201d that exists in another plane of existence.

no label, no rules, no fuss, no muss. just us, the music, and the art. i'm also making sure EVERY PRODUCT sold through this kickstarter is unique to this campaign, to reward all of you who KNEW ME WHEN and were willing to support me from Day One.\n\nhere we go, yo:\n**ALL SHIPPING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN EVERY PACKAGE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE!**please bear this in mind when you look at the prices. it was easier to do things this way, but it also means, in the spirit of art-in-the-mail-democracy, that those of you living in new york might be paying a little bit more to cover the shipping to the people in, say, tibet. \n\nwhile i can't force you to listen to it on a certain type of media, at a certain time of day, with a special pair of headphones, with a certain flavor of incense burning while you consume a very specific whiskey...i CAN make sure that what you get in your mailbox containing said music is as badass, fancy, and gorgeous as possible. i'll be damned if i don't at least PRESENT it to you in as fancy a way as possible.\n\nyou can get a digital download for as little as A DOLLAR.\nbut, should you wish to HOLD a copy of my album\u2026\n\u2022 both the COMPACT DISC and VINYL will be limited edition \"kickstarter-backer\" editions, never to be made again.\n\u2022 the COMPACT DISC will be in a beautiful hard-bound case and include an art booklet.\n\u2022 the VINYL will be a black 180 gram double-record set, and come in a gorgeously packaged case with extensive large-format art. you will freak.\n\nover THIRTY artists have been slaving away for the past few months to make art (over 70 images so far!) for this album, and the results are STUNNING. here's a sneak peak at a FEW:\n\nALL of the art will be printed in a beautifully bound ART BOOK. the artists include some of my long-time collaborators, like Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, Molly Crabapple, Kyle Cassidy in collaboration Neil Gaiman, Zea Barker, and my favorite 7-year-old draw-er on Twitter, @GavinLovesAFP. I also reached out to some new artists I've never worked with, like the german sculptor Heide Hatry, brooklyn writer/artist Tao Lin, and many others. but best of all I talked some of my musician friends (like DJ spooky, kristin hersh from throwing muses, conrad keely from \u2026trail of dead, and one of my songwriting HEROES robyn hitchcock) into making art which you'll be able to see:\n\u2022 in a hard-bound ART BOOK (similar to the \"Who Killed Amanda Palmer\" book) which will contain the art, photos, lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks at some of the artist's creations, and much more\n\u2022 LIVE and IN PERSON on our ART SHOW TOUR June-August (we'll be hitting Berlin, London, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston)\n\nthis is a package i dreamed up for people who like to get SHIT IN THE MAIL, CONSTANTLY. when i was a teenager i used to love 7\"-of-the-month-clubs, punk rock style, and fanzines that would arrive with weird ziploc bags full of crap in them. if you're a freak for surprises...this is the package for you. over the course of the summer, you'll get a series of 5 packages (sent every few weeks starting in july). the final package will include the deluxe backer-edition of the album, and packages 1-4 are going to be limited edition 7\" vinyl that feature some of the amazing album artwork. and with your 7\" singles, i'll also include an ARTS&CRAFTS SURPRISE. i wanted to stay away from things like shirts and posters and crap...i wanted to make things for you to DO, and MAKE, and SHARE back at me. i'm really proud of the bizarre things we thought up for this. the shipping of multiple packages all summer long is going to cost us a lot, and that's reflected in the price.\n\"BUT ((SAD FACE)) I DON'T HAVE A TURNTABLE....\"\nTHEN BUY ONE FROM US. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.\nVINYL IS BACK. we're going to buy and decorate some really high-quality Crosley USB-turntables and include them in higher-priced packages JUST FOR THIS REASON.\nat some point this summer Cassandra Long (who also happens to be my housemate), Meghan Howland, and a few of the other Album Artists are going to have a massive 2-day party in boston during which we get together and paint all these turntables for you. your excuse not to buy vinyl IS GONE! POOF!\n\n\nlast july, I started randomly drawing people who tweeted black and white photos of themselves to me...with a sharpie of course, because I always have one on my person, because THAT is the secret to being a successful musician. I love to draw these in quiet moments on the road or at home before the mayhem of the day starts. I figured I would extend the offer to be a sharpie-rendition of ANYTHING you send - it doesn't have to be you...it could be a loved one, a lost one, a place, a favorite mug...go crazy. we'll pack it up really nicely and send it to you right along with all the music & art book stuffs. here are some that i've done in the past (for twitter-folk @sermoiii and @SDuPreeBemis):\n\ni'll have neil explain this one, because he writes gooder than me. please be amused at the fact he is, therefore, referring to himself in the third person:\n\n\"To make art for 'The Bed Song', Neil wrote a script, as if Neil were making a script for a five panel graphic novel, and gave it to Kyle. Kyle and Neil talked, emailed, Kyle took photos, and the final sequence of five shots that made 'The Bed Song' art was created.\nWhich left us with a lot of amazing photos of people in beds that we didn't use. And we wanted people to see them. So we are making a limited edition book, with writing by Neil and photographs by Kyle and lyrics by Amanda. Unless you are one of the models in the beds, Neil, Kyle or Amanda, this Kickstarter will probably be the only way you can get one, I'm afraid. There will be a limited, signed, numbered edition of 666 copies, with a very small number of additional unnumbered artists proofs.\nWarning. The book contains naked people, naked emotions and unmade beds.\"\n\nTO KICK OFF THIS YEAR OF MADNESS, in which we'll be touring ALL OVER THE WORLD, we're going to unveil the new material and the original large-format album art/paintings LIVE in six select cities: BOSTON, NEW YORK, LA, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON and BERLIN. in every city, we've PARTNERED with a local ART GALLERY or EVENT SPACE, where we'll hang the art on beautiful walls for y'all to come and admire in person. then we'll have a special kick-off ART OPENING just for kickstarter supporters who back the event. we'll load you down with odd gifts, hugs, and drinks (if you're of age...if not, root beer throwdown) & the band will play a special acoustic set in the Art Space. we're keeping these openings limited to about 100-150, even in spaces where we could fit more people. one of my favorite things about this is that i'll get to MEET you guys in person, and thank you for your backing with a kiss. i'm hoping that our night together, among the art, making acoustic music with the band and sharing wine, will be totally fucking magical & unforgettable.\n\nin each city, we'll ALSO be playing a SMALL plugged-in rock show. the rock shows are open to the general public and have almost all sold out, but the art show kickstarter backers will have guaranteed guest-list to those performances, as well. the tickets to these smaller rock shows will be HARD to get, so backing in your city is a surefire way to know you'll get in.\n\n\neven though we've assembled a tasty variety of backer rewards - $1 all the up to $10,000 - i also know that there are some of you you are HELLA RICH and who would like to put more money towards the project. i know because...i've been asked. SO: for you more invest-y types, i am proud to announce THE LOANSPARK COLLECTIVE.\n\nwith LOANSPARK, i'm not asking for donations; i'm asking for people to step forward as high-level patrons and help out with interest-free loans that will be fully paid back after the album is cranked out and earning money. in exchange for your high-rolling loan, i will make some very special art and/or do a performance to support a charity you're passionate about. it's a slightly mad idea, but if it works, we may be onto a new form of patronage that could work for other artists...so i'm very happy to take a crack at it.\n\nall the info is up on the LOANSPARK WEBSITE, which we've launched in conjunction with this project:\n_________\n\nand that my dear comrades, is it.\n\nWE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.\nthank you, thank you, thank you.\nLOVE,\namanda\nfucking\npalmer\n\namandapalmer.net | @amandapalmer\np.s. a random note about the video: i DID pick up all those fucking signs i'd drawn. i did not leave them in the street in melbourne. we'll figure out what to do with them later...by the time we finished shooting (we did 2 takes), most of the cards had been run over by a car or a bicycle.\n\nBand photos and KS video by Jim Batt | @battsignal\nCollage of the ART (from l-r, top to bottom): Kyle Cassidy, Tony Albert, Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, David Mack, and Tony Albert\nAFP/Keytar photo by Andrius Lipsys\nAdditional images/editing/maintenance by Sean Francis | @indeciSEAN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "heya, it's been a minute. long catch-up letter...& i've got a new album", "update_content": "hola everybody!!!\nGreetings from upstate new york. i\u2019ve missed you.\nthis is an email to my long-lost, wonderful 24,883 ttheatre Is evil\u201d kickstarter backers. long time, no see\u2026.\nTL;DR: i am using patronage now. it is awesome & has changed m life. have a new record out. my patrons get tour ticket access for TWO MORE DAYS, & the cool merch. if you still want to help me make art, join at https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer for as little as $1/month."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "\"the bed song book\" is not imaginary, it's coming!!

We gave 10 disposable cameras to 10 people in Paris to take with them on a trip and be the first link in a chain of five persons who were each to take five photos.\nSix months later we got the first of the cameras back and published the photos on our website. Not only did the project work, but the photos were amazing!\nThe massive positive reaction and the hundreds of comments and emails by people who wanted to join the project prompted us to plan a second run on a bigger scale. That's why we are coming to Kickstarter to raise funds to finance the operation and connect with the community to give everyone a chance to be part of the project this time.\nIf the project gets funded we will send 99 disposable cameras around the world.\nConcept\nWith social media, smartphones, digital photography and ubiquitous Internet access - even in the most remote places - it has never been easier to log your travels and share trips with followers.\nNot only can we share as much as we like about our travels on the net - often with anonymous strangers through blogging and on Twitter - but we can get tips on what to do and feedback on what we\u2019re missing.\nThe great thing about the way we travel in this day and age - apart from the endless online resources and literature available - is the amount of connections we can make. Not only can we easily find the people we want to meet more easily, but they can find us too.\nAnd it\u2019s the personal connections in travel that we are interested in highlighting. But we\u2019re interested in both the energy and face to face experiences between travelers - in the traditional spirit of travel - and in the way travelers come to meet and stay in touch.\nSo, the basic idea: we\u2019re sending disposable cameras to travelers who want to start a trip and a chain of Disposable Stories. The first person takes a few photos of their travels, and then passes the camera along to someone they meet along the way who is heading in a different direction and wants to continue the chain by documenting their travels and passing the camera along. The end result of the camera\u2019s trip and the images captured on it will be a complete surprise to all in the end.\nThe new age of connecting - both innovative and traditional!\nThe plan\nOnce the project is funded, we'll buy 99 disposable cameras to send to the backers of the project initially who can start the chain during their next trip. Then we'll give the remaining ones to travelers that are enthusiastic and committed to the project at the rhythm of about two per week until we don't have any more left. \nEach chain consists of 5 people taking 5 photos each. The last person on the chain gets in touch with us so we can arrange and finance the shipping to our office for the development.\nEvery time we get a camera back, we'll publish the photos on our site and on Facebook. We'll also send digital copies and prints to all participants (depending on the pledge).\nA page will be dedicated to the project on Hejorama.com, featuring a map showing the last known location of every camera, the name of our amazing backers and all the photos of the cameras that have come back so far.\nIf everything go as planned and we get enough back we'll organize an exhibition in various places and possibly make a book using the photos.\nThe funds\nHere's a breakdown of the expenses for this project explaining the total 4,800$ goal.\n30% to buy the 99 cameras (for the test run we used Kodak Funsavers that proved solid and had good photo quality).\n3% print of labels for the customization of the cameras\n10% shipping of 30 cameras back to our office*\n20% development of the film from the 30 cameras in a specialized photo lab*\n27% shipping of the 99 cameras around the world.\n10% money transfer costs. Unfortunately we are not in based in the US and need to use a friend of ours to receive the money and transfer it to us in France.\n*Why 30 cameras only? Well, for the test run we\u2019ve only got 2 cameras out of 10 back which means a 20% return rate. With the project receiving more attention we hope to get to 30%, but realistically 70% will still get lost. If we get more, we'll be so happy with the success of the project that we'll pay from our own pockets.\nThe Map\nWe have built an in-house mapping project that we are using to follow cool travelers around the world. We will enhance it to be able to map the cameras in real time using twitter.\nBasically people will simply have to tweet something like \"@hejomap camera 5 is in Paris\" to update the location to a camera on the map. And if they send us the location via email, we'll update it manually.\nThe test run\nWhen we launched this project, we could only afford to buy 10 cameras. No one around us believed it would work so we had to dig in our own pockets to finance the operation and prove them wrong.\nIt took 6 months, but finally a camera that traveled from Paris, France to Saigon, Vietnam was sent back to us from the US after having visited Germany, Austria and Norway on the way.\nHere are some of the photos.\nAnd three months later we got a second one back.

It is believed that the souls of the departed return to visit the living on this day. It is not a time of mourning since \u201cthe path back to the living world must not be made slippery by tears\u201d. Originating in ancient Mexico, the Day of the Dead is celebrated in many North, Central, and South American countries. It is a mixture of indigenous and Catholic traditions and includes gathering at cemeteries for the clearing and decoration of gravesites, and the constructing of altars to the deceased. These altars consist of items favored by the departed, such as a favorite drink or a favorite meal. Special skull shaped candies and breads are also made for the occasion. Central to the celebration is the skull or skeleton. It is the predominant symbol in the Days of the Dead, but it is not presented to frighten. Instead, the calavera represents the playfulness of the dead, as they mimic the living and frolic amongst us.\n     In some parts of Mexico during the celebrations of the Day of the Dead, it's traditional for people to paint their faces like skeletons to both be in solidarity with the departed and in celebration. In this project I will create portraits of people with their faces painted, following in this tradition. It is my goal to have the paintings differ from the usual day of the dead artwork by making them more ethereal rather than frightening or overtly sexual, as is the case with a lot of the day of the dead artwork I\u2019ve seen out there.\n     I start these paintings in acrylic paint, establishing the image in black and white. Once dry, I add color with oil paints, giving the images a richer texture. The use of both mediums makes the painting process take longer, but the results are worth the effort.\nIn the spirit of community prevalent in Mexican celebrations, I'm encouraging the public's participation by creating some of the portraits for this project from photos sent to me by interested people, as you can see in some of the rewards.\nUltimately, I would like to mount an exhibit of this body of work to coincide with the celebrations of the Day of the Dead in October/November 2012. I would like the exhibit to be open to the public, to allow for the maximum number of people to see it, as educating others about this Mexican holiday is one of my main goals.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Maryann Luera\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nNative San Diegan Maryann Luera has been painting for over 20 years.

The answer is no. But we thought we'd share it with you because it contained the word \"bear\".\nPhoto: Hipster glasses sold separately\nWhat the???\nWelcome to Griz Coat, the original grizzly bear jacket. \nThe concept behind it is straightforward. Last Halloween, a couple of us wanted to wear a grizzly bear jacket, but we couldn't find one for sale that looked realistic at all. We weren't going for the cartoonish mascot look, we wanted to look like we were actually donning a grizzly bear. We're talking about a realistic-looking head, claws and fur. The closest thing we could find were coats made from real grizzly bears for, like,  two thousand bucks.  Ummm...no thanks for a lot of reasons.\nSo, we ended up having a professional costume designer create a couple coats from scratch. Once we wore them, a bunch of people said they wanted one, so we made a second small batch.  Then the same thing happened with the second batch...more people were asking where we got it and had a tough time believing we had them custom made.  So here we are, asking the Kickstarter community: \"WHO ELSE WANTS A GRIZ COAT?\" This is where you reply \"I DO\".  Because if you've read this far, you probably want one (or you're just a friend who's about to contribute $1.50).\nPlease note that the Griz Coat is highly appropriate for: Halloween, Bay to Breakers, Monday morning meetings, most weddings, Tuesday morning meetings, high school reunions, and first dates.\nWhat Are We Doing With the Dollar Dollar Bills, Y'all?\nWhat we've done so far:\nA professional designer has produced two different iterations of the coat.  Kinks have been worked out.  Blueprints have been made. \nAll materials have been sourced, and their prices have been negotiated with the wholesalers.  \nManufacturing and assembly partners have been tested and selected.\nWhy we need some kickstarting:\nBasically, we've done all the necessary legwork, and our only roadblock is that the materials and manufacturing are expensive. This is why we can't do things the traditional way (i.e. front all the money, make a bunch of coats, and hope people want them), and why we need the Kickstarter community to step up. So we'll be using the funds to buy materials and get Griz Coats manufactured for anyone who wants one.\nBut it can't be that expensive, right?  We thought the same thing until we started researching how much the materials cost, especially the fur.  And once we have all the materials ready to go, then we have to pay someone to do the cutting/stitching/assembly by hand right here in America.  That's right, Griz Coat is HAND-MADE IN THE USA, which is probably appealing to some, not-so-appealing to others, but definitely justifies the $200 sticker price!\nPhoto: a dude taking a photo of a dude\nProduct Description\nFaux fur: ultra soft, incredibly-realistic fabric\nBear-head hood: shockingly lightweight, with a comfortable foam interior; plus, it's detatchable, in case you need to wear it in a more formal setting\nEyes, teeth, claws and nose: striking resemblance to the real-deal\nReinforced over-stitching: double the strength, double the fun\nOne size fits most: we've had people anywhere from 5'6\" to 6'3\" wear it comfortably\nPhoto: bears are lazy, so they wait for buses too\nNeed we say more?

I'm a composer living in Brooklyn, NY, originally from Baltimore, MD. Three years ago, cellist Ben Capps premiered my Cello Concerto, a piece for solo cello and small orchestra. Now, Ben has asked me to write him a solo piece to be recorded on his upcoming album, \"Cello Horizons\". The piece is in 4 movements and is a musical depiction of memories I have from growing up in Baltimore, MD. Ben and I have decided to premiere the piece in Baltimore. I intend on using a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the official commissioning* of the piece as well as the documentation and release of my piece, Charm City Cello Sonata on the album, \"Cello Horizons\".\n*The solo piece I'm writing for Ben hasn't been finished yet, but I have a sample for you to check out below. \"Official commissioning\" is what happens when performers or organizations give money to composers like me to write them pieces of music. In this case, the commissioner for the piece is Ben Capps. \nHere is a sample of my Cello Concerto, with Ben Capps playing Cello.\nhttp://www.robertkarpay.com/uploads/8/8/2/1/8821207/last_two_movements_of_cello_concerto.mp3\nThe first few opening bars of Charm City Cello Sonata:\nABOUT THE PIECE\nMy piece Charm City Cello Sonata is about different memories and emotions I have about growing up in Baltimore in the 90's and early 2000's. The piece is in four movements. Each movement combines elements of rock music, classical music and undulates between different emotional worlds. To me, Charm City Cello Sonata creates a thoughtful but exciting nostalgic environment of memories that pop in and out of my mind every once in a while but were never as strong as they were when I was getting ideas for this piece.\nI've always had ideas for a piece about growing up, not necessarily in Baltimore. Over the past several years, I've been living in New York. Every now and then, I go home to visit and I feel like I get even more attached to Baltimore each time. I tell people that I am a New York-based composer, but I owe who I am to my experiences growing up in Baltimore. I didn't choose for this piece to be about that. It just happened like that. Like when you're reading some post modernist book that starts out being about one thing, but by the middle of it, it turns about to be about something else all together.\nABOUT THE ALBUM\nBen Capps is going to release the album \"Cello Horizons\" on the label Innova Records. Other composers writing pieces for Ben to record on this album include:\nReiko Fueting\nEvan Tremo\nMarcus Paus\nDavid Del Tredicci\nCELLIST, BEN CAPPS\nWHERE THE MONEY GOES\nThe money I receive from this kickstarter will go towards the official commissioning of Charm City Cello Sonata, as well as some of the production costs for the album, \"Cello Horizons\".\nIf you'd like to get to know more about Ben and I and our music, please visit our websites:\nwww.robertkarpay.com\nwww.bencapps.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "New Music Update!", "update_content": "Here's an update on the status of the writing of my \"Charm City Cello Sonata\" and the recording by cellist Ben Capps, which you generously supported through Kickstarter\nI finished writing the sonata a few months ago, as you may recall, and Ben made an initial recording.

I promise to take Astor Barber even further...with your help!\nTHANK YOU !!!\nAstor Barber All Stars:  a documentary feature about the people that own, work at and go to Astor Place Hairstylists.\nWith so many NYC Institutions dropping like flies,due to skyrocketing rent ,one barber shop remains. Since 1939, Astor Barber has been cutting hair with pizzaz and is still one of NYC's most loved institutions. Get your hair cut from cradle to grave...literally! The Vezza family, their loyal customers and over 50 stylists working at Astor will show why this 3 generation family owned business attracts 'em all. It\u2019s a story of endurance and a family ,it\u2019s employees and customers that stuck together against the odds in NYC. \nAs a family run business since 1939,the owners have many stories to tell. A success story in itself, I want to explore their perspective on the daily workings of the place and the people that have walked through their doors. From the countless celebrity customers to the karaoke in the back with other 50 barbers,this barber shop is never dull.\nI will ask them how things have changed and how some remain the same. Also, what they think makes it a place people gravitate to.\nHow stylists are chosen to work here and what they look for when hiring.They have the ability to keep loyal and long-time employees. How do they explain this?\nThrough interviews with the stylists, I\u2019ll explore why they choose to work at Astor. Why have some worked at fancy upscale salons and prefer working at Astor? \nI'll show the daily routine at Astor and how it\u2019s different every day. You never know who will walk through the door. Their first appointment could be a cut & color, the next, a walk in for an updated Mohawk or hair tattoo. I want to show how Astor caters to anyone that walks through the door.\n I will show the phenomenon of how many people have had their hair done at Astor at one time or another in their life. How it brings a smile to their faces and always a vivid memory. I want to show what\u2019s going on right now at Astor and how many are returning even after many years. What keeps customers coming back, return or stop in for the very first time?\n Ultimately, I\u2019ll put a much deserved and long awaited spotlight on Astor Place Hairstylists.

In this slice of life, we watch through the eyes of adolescence how a girl learns of the difficulty and consequences that arise from embracing one's identity.\nTHEMES & IDEAS\nThis film explores our main character's sense of self in relation to those around her. We are all shaped by our environment, but there comes a point when we take our own actions, go against the norm, and dance to our own drummer. This is the point in which the film takes place. \nFor this character, identity is a real, breathing thing. Identity is complicated and multifaceted, and touches upon the various details that make a person who she is, including, but definitely not limited to: race, religion, age, and sexuality. \nThere is a Spanish saying: \"Dime con qui\u00e9n andas y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres.\"  In English, \"Tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" This phrase haunts our character throughout the film as she moves forward in this coming-of-age story. \nHOW YOUR PLEDGES WILL HELP\nTAKING CARE OF OUR CAST & CREW \nYou've probably heard the phrase, \"Film is a collaborative art.\" I believe this with my whole heart. This project would be impossible without the talent and devotion of my beautiful cast and crew, which is why I need to make sure they are taken care of during this production. \nYour pledges will help support our team in the following ways:\nFood -- one of the most important things on any film set.\nLodging -- making sure everyone has a clean, safe place to stay.\nTransportation -- to move from A to B to C to D with everything we need. \nGETTING THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE CRAFT\nAll artists need tools for their work, these can range from a paintbrush to a scalpel to a camera. Help us to get the right tools to tell this story the way it deserves to be told. \nYour pledges will help support the art of the film in the following ways:\nEquipment rentals -- Lights and Camera come before Action.\nArt, props, and costumes -- We want to look pretty!\nDistribution -- Funding for marketing and film festival submissions.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\nWhether you have already monetarily supported our film or are personally unable to donate the next best thing you can also help our film is SPREAD THE WORD.

I needed to raise money to support a production in Portland and to cover cost of getting to New Mexico. When this kickstarter launched I was blown away by how quickly support, words of inspiration, and the call to action happened. I am humbled by the big hearts and minds of our supporters. As I choreograph the dance, I often find myself referring to my Butoh teachers words... \"create the consciousness and the movement will follow.\" You as a community of supporters are doing that VERY thing, creating a \"consciousness\" around this work, and the movement IS following. Now is the opportunity to seed the grand  future of this work. You have inspired me to share my ultimate vision for \"We Two Boys.\"  This show needs to be seen by the world. People need to be touched and transformed by it.  This is bigger than just Portland or Albuquerque and I have known this from the moment the creation process started. This story wants to be told. Through your continued help, I believe this leap can be achieved. I believe a wind can blow across what started as a small project and turn it into a passionate flame that will touch the hearts and minds of many.  Join us in the taking this project from an evolution to a revolution.\n\nThank you!!!\nMeshi\n\"We Two Boys\" a multi-layered duet between two men, captures the timeless journey of love, attraction, struggle, and surrender. Viewers are drawn in, finding themselves wrestling with the stories of love and sexuality while being captivated by the familiarity of their own lives as the dance unfolds before them. \"We Two Boys\" is a powerful narrative of a relationship that transcends labels of \"gay\" or \"straight\" and becomes a provocative story of human nature.\nBased on Walt Whitman's poem \"We Two Boys Together Clinging\" and incorporating the art of Butoh dance, this work is an ever evolving journey of my heart as a gay man, choreographer and dancer. Being able to bring this work to a national level is a personal and professional dream, and a necessary conversation in light of political issues facing our society about equality.\nThe premiere of the reworked piece will be performed in Portland at Studio Two May 18-20 and tour to Albuquerque, New Mexico for the Wild Dancing West Festival May 25 & 26. It will serve as a launch pad for further performances around the country. The newly informed, inspired, and revised piece has a stellar artistic team - live music composed by Adrian Hutapea, choreography by Meshi Chavez, and dancers Meshi Chavez and Chip Sherman.\nMy opportunity to bring this work to Wild Dancing West is particularly close to my heart since I grew up in Albuquerque. This will be a homecoming allowing me to return back to the origin of my birth, and to the community that I left behind in pursuit of my personal and artistic survival. \u201cWe Two Boys\u201d addresses some of the challenges I faced in this city coming out as a gay man. The opportunity to take \u201cWe Two Boys\u201d to Albuquerque seems particularly appropriate and auspicious.\nI am seeking funding to be used to pay for Portland performance venue fees, costume and lighting designer fees, travel cost to New Mexico, as well as Artist fees. If \"We Two Boys\" speaks to you, I hope you will consider investing to continue the momentum.\nPortland Show dates: May 18, 19, 20 @ Studio Two \nAlbuquerque Show dates: May 25 & 26 Wild Dancing West Festival at the North 4th Theater\nChoreography: Meshi Chavez Dancers: Chip Sherman & Meshi Chavez Music: Adrian Hutapea with Lisa DeGrace Lighting: Alex Gagne-Hawes Costumes: Kirsten Moore Video: Karl Lind Photography: Stephen Miller Graphic Design: Eric Gillmore Special Thanks: Kriya Kaping, & April Hauck\nwww.meshichavez.com for more information on show dates and times.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Success!", "update_content": "Supports,\nIt has been a little time now since we opened and toured \"We Two Boys.\" I am happy to report that we were very successful.

We want to show you what makes Kenny G tick, how he's taken hits from critics in stride, how he's remained such a fun and important part of our pop culture, and why he keeps trying new things and working so hard to stay on top. This film is a chance to understand a man and a part of our world that has never been explored before.\nWe're doing this project on Kickstarter because we want everyone who remembers Kenny G \u2014 from young people whose parents were fans all the way to long-time devotees of Kenny \u2014 to come together and join us on this adventure.

Since his self-titled debut in 1982, he\u2019s sold 75 million albums \u2014 more than Eric Clapton, Prince, or Bob Dylan.\nNow Kenny has begun to pursue a new goal \u2014 becoming a movie composer. But will he be able to convince producers and directors, even if Kenny himself knows he can compose memorable melodies?\nFull of humor and warmth, Kenny: A Documentary in G will tell the incredible story of Kenny G's unlikely rise to the top of the mainstream music world, from his beginnings as an underground funk musician in Seattle to his chart-topping successes and victories at the Grammy Awards. Interviews with industry titans, fans and critics will paint a picture of Kenny's place in pop culture history. Then we'll follow Kenny into the world of film composing in Hollywood, go on tour with him in Asia, where he is massively popular (his music plays on national trains and at the end of public school days in China), and trek across the United States on his door-to-door journey to reconnect with old fans.\nNo matter if you're a fan of Kenny's music or not, you'll fall in love with the man behind the sax \u2014 warm, engaging and hilarious, Kenny G might not be what you expect. This is the ultimate entertainment documentary about one of the most successful musicians of the era: Kenny: A Documentary in G.\n---\nNew Incentives Every Week!\nEvery week we'll be adding a NEW experience-based reward that Kenny G himself has been generous enough to donate to the production.

We're hoping that fans of Kenny G will support us, and people who aren't fans or don't know much about Kenny's music \u2014 who know him as the dude with the sweet curls and the saxophone \u2014 will want to learn more, throw us a few bucks, and get some AWESOME rewards.\nIs $100,000 Enough To Make A Movie?\nOur goal is to raise $100,000 from your support in order to \u2018kickstart\u2019 (pun fully intended) production on this film. Its going to take a lot more to fully finance the film but with your help we can paying for our initial production costs, including crew, equipment rentals and travel/transportation to and from shoots with Kenny. Any amount that we raise over $100,000 (Let's do it Kickstarter!) will work towards filling our budget and reducing the need for other fundraising. The more we raise, the more we will be able to retain creative and marketing control!\nOK, enough talk...lemme SEE what I'm getting for INCENTIVES!\nThe 'Romance Kit' includes a Romance Initiator (to use, pop in your Kenny G CD, light the initiator and watch the romance blossom) and a Romance Reduction Brick (freeze, apply in cases of extreme romance).\nThe Sax Upkeep kit includes Original Formula Sax Wax and a can of Sax Polish.\nThe basic t-shirt.\nThe 'Handy Field Guide to Kennys of the World' Famous Haircuts poster.\nThe Special Edition 'Famous Haircuts' t-shirt.\nAll products!

Fools Gold, is the first color combination of the Facet Collection, the 3 diamond shaped tiles come in matte white, matte black + mirrored gold. The diamonds are precision cut to meet seamlessly with the sides of each of the 3 shapes. The application of the thin tiles to the floor is meant to delineate space, riffing off of inlayed wood + tile, of classically designed + constructed buildings. They add color + pattern, in a clean + graphic way, with modern design + an undertone of whimsy. \nProudly, FACET is made + all materials sourced in California. \n3 diamond tiles cover an 8\"x9\" area, 3mm thick. $10 buys 3 tiles inside of the orange box, $15 buys all 9 tiles pictured above.\nWhy Kickstarter:  As a designer, exploring mediums + applications is an investment of hours. Arriving at a final process + resolved product is financially costly. Up to this point, I have cut my product by hand, which is labor intensive + leaves room for error. Kickstarter would finance three dies to be made, improving accuracy, shortening production time + ultimatley lowering costs. \nWhere to Use:Facet was conceived to be applied to interior floors, but can be used on most cleaned interior surfaces, walls, tables, etc. Facet will stick to cement, wood, tile, laminate, painted surfaces etc, + can be removed without damaging residue for up to 2 years.\nDepending on the number of tiles you have, you can use Facet in different scaled spaces, entrance halls, around + under coffee/dining tables, under dog bowls, basically anywhere you want to visually define, perhaps indicating where specific activities take place.\nIt took 20 minutes to lay the 37 tiles pictured.\nHow to Use: Pick or design your own pattern. A printed reference sheet will be included in shipments for pledges $10 and over, if designing your own pattern I suggest having a small printed or illustrated reference so you don't confuse yourself. Start with a cleaned surface, follow recommended products for your specific surface (avoiding oils). Consider your layout, do you want it square to the room, or on an angle, centered, or floating. Measure out (even mask out the edges) of your projected dimensions. To choose + lay your first tile, think about the logistics, I would suggest starting in a corner  for linear patterns, or from the center, for radiating patterns. \nThe 3mm vinyl has enough of a lip for you to perfectly butt-up each piece to piece. Apply your first piece, smooth out, with your hand  + continue on to your second piece. When butting up pieces, start by matching starting points for corners + slowly lay neighboring pieces straight, using the edge of the already laid tile, as a guide. If you have an air bubble, first try to smooth out with the edge of a credit card, if that doesn't do the trick, pull up part or the entire tile and replace. The tiles are resilient, but be mindful as to not rip away, or stretch the tile when removing. The tile will reattach to the floor. Avoid applying + reapplying the exact same tile too many times. \nPlay with negative space, your floor becomes the fourth color + texture in the patterns.\nExpected Lifespan: When applied, natural wear will occur, leaving your unique imprint on the product + space. Traffic volume + exposure to the elements (specifically water) will dictate much of the lifespan. A clean surface will give Facet the best start. You can expect Facet to \"stick around\" for several months to 2 of years without leaving a residue. \nShipping: We aim to ship FACET in July.\nInternational Shipping: $5 rewards, shipping is on me. :) $10-15 rewards, add $4 for International shipping. $25 and over rewards, add $10 for international shipping. \nIncentives:  Small quantities of Facet will only be available on Kickstarter. The semi + full sets are shown below the projected retail price. So buying now, saves later. \nWhere the Kickstarter Money Will Be Used:\nProduction of 3 Custom dies\nPurchasing entire rolls of vinyl material \nProduct packaging - recycled cardboard sleeves \nHand silkscreening the cardboard sleeves\nGrouping + sealing tile series for interior packaging\nShipping costs + materials\nKickstarter + Amazon processing fees \nProduct shots\nHow the Kickstarter Investment Will Effect Facet in the Longterm:\nPreorder #s will serve as a small market test for retail buyers.\nProduct shots will serve as a marketing tool.\nPrecisely cut samples will be able to be sent out to retailers. \nPlease note that Facet is meant to be used as a decorative element, not to replacing flooring, address flooring problems or as slip prevention. It is intended as a one time use product, not intended to be removed and reapplied.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "We have a sister project, TRANSPARENT Tiling Vinyl", "update_content": "If you love FACET, check out our newest product launched on Kickstarter only.

We believe that controlling robots might be a good way for the bonobos to interact with guests and visitors outside their caged areas.

We are Project of the Week on indieWIRE - the leading online publication for independent film!\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \nFlex Is Kings is an independent feature length documentary about street dance in Brooklyn. It\u2019s almost done and now we need your help!\nThis is a story of urban improbability.  East New York is an impoverished section of Kings County with one of the highest crime rates in the borough. And yet a large and growing group of young men have transformed their streets into a stage.\nFlex Is Kings looks at the culture of flexing, a unique and vibrant dance form in deep Brooklyn, and the realities of the dancers who practice it. We, the filmmakers, have followed a group of dancers for over two years and have shot over 275 hours of film.\nFlex dancing channels the grittiness of East New York into choreographed violence: guns battle, bones break, and hearts are ripped from chests. Using dance to illustrate their everyday lives and their inner aspirations, dancers jump into beautiful and imaginative dream logic and feats of daring: monsters roam train cars, young lovers meet, souls fly from bodies.\nYou'll meet Flizzo, a charismatic showman who first dazzled us four years ago when a zebra finch flew from his mouth for a \"punchline\" during a show and brought the house down.  His attempts to juggle dancing with a new baby and dismal job market cast doubts on the practicality of continuing his craft.\nJay Donn's a stuntman who fears nothing, jumping off bridges and walls.  An opportunity to work with a prominent Brooklyn theater group exposes him to new possibilities as he travels to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to star in an unconventional adaptation of Pinocchio.\nSoup tries to bury his violent past as he prepares for King of the Streets, but the night before the penultimate competition an act of violence forces him to choose between neighborhood loyalties or his art.\nPlus, you'll meet Reem, the savvy creator of Battlefest, the ultimate DIY dance showcase; Storyboard Professor, the first King of the Streets and esteemed dance visionary, and so many more!\nHow Kickstarter Works\nWe need your help to finish this film! On the right, you\u2019ll see the pledge levels with corresponding rewards.  You can donate to our project and receive rewards in return.  It\u2019s a win win situation!!!\n\nWe have set a goal that accurately reflects what we need to get this film to the next step - a rough cut.   If we do not reach our goal, we will not receive any of the funds.  If we exceed our goal, then we can seamlessly move to a fine cut and begin submitting to festivals.\nWhat am I supporting?\nEditing - We have roughly 275 hours of film and the only way to finish this film is to hire an editor to work on it full time.  \nEquipment - We shot the film with all of our own equipment but we need to rent some fancy gear to get speciality shots of dancers. Just wait till you see Soup gliding from a street fight to a prayer.... Their craft is magnificent and a couple shots demand magnificent technology.\nComposers - Music is a HUGE component of this project. We must hire composers.\nMusic Rights - Very different from the last thing.  Some of the film will need custom composition but some of the film needs the current music on the street.\nExpendables - The media storage needed for a project of this scale is enormous.  We have to buy more storage and upkeep what we already have.\n\nWhat happens if we exceed our goal?\nSound Mixing - It\u2019s essential that this film sound great. The film needs to be professionally mixed for theatrical, online and DVD viewing.\nColor correcting - Only pros can do this fine-tuning.\nScreenings - We will set up a series of screenings with Q and A sessions with the Flex dance community throughout the NYC area.\nTravel - Once the film is complete, the team needs to travel with the film to various film festivals with hopes to get it seen by as many people as possible.\nWebsite & Digital Download - Throughout the post production and film release, we will need to maintain our website and pay for bandwidth charges.\nAnd so much more...\nIncentives\nNEW! Join us for an evening of live music and street dance in a special, one-time only event.

Held four times a year and culminating in the King of the Streets competition, this exciting showcase in the heart of Brooklyn is where dancers go to gain respect, establish a social position, forge an artistic identity, and find a sanctuary from the poverty and violence surrounding their young lives.\nRingmaster Jay Donn - one of Flex Is Kings featured dancers - has donated two of his outrageous hat designs to support this film.  Choose between the  \u201cLego Hat\u201d and \u201cShades.\u201d Hats are snap-back and adjustable to fit any adult head.\nNo one works a crowd like Flizzo, another dancer whose story is told over the course of Flex Is Kings.

Walking is not scary, but in some cities and places it can seem that way. Beyond the obvious personal health benefits, with more and more pedestrians on the street, the healthier our places become socially, economically and environmentally. \nBut with the benefits of walking obvious, why aren't our city's sidewalks filled with people? \nWell, one of the greatest obstacles to pedestrian friendly communities is actually public perception, and the visibility of walking as an alternative means of transportation.  So, through this project, we'd like to kickstart the conversation and help anyone make signs to share how many minutes by foot it is to navigate their block, neighborhood or city...\nWhy Raleigh Is Our Testing Ground? \nRaleigh, like many growing metropolitan areas, is dealing with more and more people moving to town. (Raleigh doubled in size from 1990-2010 census) When cities grow this fast, they deal with a lot more people living a lot closer together. \nWalk Your City is about encouraging healthier communities in transitioning cities by simply changing the perception. The more people are on the sidewalks, the safer and pedestrian friendly our urban landscapes become \nIt is also our hometown!   \nSee You On the Sidewalk! \nCredits: \nMain Project Photo - dtraleigh.com\nBody Photos - himynameisnicole.com\nSpecial Thanks:\nwith Walk Raleigh Development & Design \nNicole Alvarez\nDarryl Jones \nwith Walk [Your City]\u2122 Video & Site Development \nCory Livengood\nScott Heath", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "SSSSHHHHhhhhhhh.

See details in the 'updates' section above!\nUPDATE#2: Album cover now up-- scroll down to see \nUPDATE#3:  Playable demo up!  Check out the 'updates' section.\nSide scrolling, arcade shooter action!\nHey everyone, my name is Leo (developing as Arachnid), and I'm a student earning my BFA in Illustration. A fair portion of college life is sitting through long lectures, so what better to do than doodle?  One day, after filling up all the margins in my notes, I said, \"Hey, I could make a game out of these!\"  \nAnd so it was.  College-Ruled Universe is a side-scrolling space-ship shooter, an homage to the old days of arcade gaming.  The game's graphics are entirely hand drawn with ballpoint pen on college-ruled notebook paper, thus the name.  With your help, we can turn this from just a concept to a mobile game phenomenon!  \nThe Project\nThe idea sprouted in November 2011, and ever since, I've been using every ounce of spare time to sketch up new ships, locations, and enemies.  Fast forward to mid January 2012.  I've got most of the artwork needed for the game drawn, scanned, and prepped.  But it's still missing some important factors: Programming and sound design.  \nThat's where you come in.  There's no way we could get premium sound design, a killer soundtrack, and flawless programming without you.  Your contribution turns this project from a dream to a reality.\nArtwork\nThis game is held together visually by a style derived from ink on paper.   Everyone doodles on something, right?  \nThe player can customize their ship, choosing from an array of weapons/armor...\n...To end up with something that looks like this:\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe bulk of the game is fashioned in the classic, shooter genre.  However, when the player gets to a new planet, they can get out of their ship and explore!  Players search for parts on these desolate worlds, and use them to upgrade and customize their ships.  You will need to upgrade to survive.\nThe boss battles will be designed in a cinematic fashion, mixing scripted events with gameplay, and requiring the player have full focus on the boss.  \nSound Design\nThe music (as you've heard in the video) is done by Doc Prop (Proper Productions), a local artist and friend of mine.  If you want to check out more of his work, just head over to  his soundcloud page!  Doc is doing some experimenting with sounds for the game, and coming up with a really slick sounding, spacey ambience.\nTechnical\nI've been working with Flash for over 8 years, so I figured this was a good platform to build the game in.  Especially since the latest version allows for direct export from AS 3.0 into files that can run on a number of devices, including android, iPhone, and iPad.  The demo you see above is animated in flash, and all the assets are directly usable for the game build.  \nA programmer will be hired with KS funding to create an AS 3.0 build of the game that is specialized for Android devices.  Later on, if we want to move to other devices, the switch-over should be pretty minimal, since the original build is in Flash.\nRewards\nCurious about the rewards?  Can't blame you!\nPrints:  The prints are all done on a high quality cardstock paper, with professional quality industrial printing at 300dpi.  They are various scenes utilizing artwork from the game, designed specifically to look totally badass hanging on your wall.   Example:\nUSB: Print stuff is great, but so is electronic.  The USB stick will contain the full resolution PDF containing all 28 pages of the artbook, the soundtrack of the game with cover art, AND the Flash build of the game, completely playable right on your computer.  Seems too good to be true?  WELL IT'S TRUE SO DEAL WITH IT.\nArtbook The College-Ruled Universe Artbook will be 28 semigloss pages of artwork from the game, all immaculately laid out for your viewing pleasure.  8.5\"x11\" landscape bound.  Color cover, b/w interior. Interior examples below:\nCustom Drawings:  For the heavy hitters out there.  The custom drawing is just what it sounds like:  an original sketch, ballpoint on acid-free sketchbook paper, just for you. \nOriginal Artwork:   This is the original piece of artwork that got scanned in and used for the game.  You get THE original.  Framed.    If the game becomes famous, you'll have a piece of mobile game history!  (and I'll probably see it on eBay)\nPoster:  Five feet of beautiful layout, printed on vinyl. preview: \nYour Designs in the game: It's just what it sounds like.  You draw something up on lined paper, and we'll place it into the game in a fitting way.  (If you have a really goofy / dark / eccentric style, we'll emphasize that)  I really don't want you to worry about 'what if I can't draw' because I think anyone's doodles are fun to look at!  So have at it.\nThat about covers it.   Thanks for reading!  And I really hope you like what you see, and to those of you who contributed, a special thanks.

Five years ago we set out to merge our two passions, sparkling bubbles, and fresh picked fruit.  While in pursuit of the perfect beverage, we found that the quality and flavors of conventional fruit based sodas were clouded by blended concentrates, juice fillers, high fructose corn syrup, preservatives, artificial colors and flavors.  We wanted a product that tasted like fresh, raw fruit!  Imagine that!\nOf course,  we can make it ourselves!  Like all entrepreneurs, we figured 'how hard could it be?'  Working together in our kitchen, after months and months of very messy experimentation, we created the best tasting sodas we could have imagined, came up with the name Pop Culture\u00ae, and set out to figure out a way to bring our farm to bottle artisan creation to market.  Working with a food production engineer and a food scientist, we created a unique, scalable production process that allows us to capture that fresh fruit flavor in each bottle.\nTiming is everything!  As they say, if it were easy, everyone would do it. The demand for Pop Culture is growing rapidly here on the Central Coast of California and we have very little product left to sell.  The one bottler here in CA that can produce Pop Culture Artisan Sodas is closing for the spring for 3-6 months to move to a new, larger facility. This is great news for us down the road but today, it means we have to raise the $150,000 to meet the bottlers minimums or we miss an entire summer and fall of pure sparkling refreshment! \n(the Pop Culture patent-pending 1x4 linear 4-pack carrier...creates space on the shelves and looks totally bad ass!)\nThe Pop Culture\u00ae \"Farm to Bottle\" approach:  Pop Culture uses raw fruit to create it's beverages!  This approach allows Pop Culture to do what no other soda company has done before... product tracking from the \"Farm to Bottle\".  Our fruit comes from farms right here in California, Oregon, and Washington where some of the best fruit in world is grown.  Pop Culture purchase fruit only from farms that are certified organic and/or grow certified Non-GMO fruit.  We strongly oppose genetic modification of our food.  \nWhat's up with all the concentrates?  Concentrate too hard and you'll forget where you came from!  Soda's today are a far cry from yesteryear. \"Where's the blueberry in the blueberry soda and why is there White Grape Juice concentrate in a grapefruit soda?  What's a Natural Flavor anyway?\"   We asked ourselves the same questions?  Virtually every juice based soda on the market today is made from concentrates and extracts and, in our opinion, the use of these concentrates yields a fairly bland, homogenous tasting beverage.  Ingredients like Apple and White Grape Juice Concentrate are inexpensive, deflavorized juice \"fillers\" used to up the juice content of the beverage, add sugar, and take up space.  That's all. \n                               (our shout out to vinyl lovers everywhere)\nFAQ\nWhat artisan soda flavors are you launching?  The possibilities are literally endless but Pop Culture fresh pressed: Grapefruit, Strawberry, Tangerine, and Ginger Pear.\nShipping Costs:  We understand shipping is expensive and, if we could, we'd deliver every case to your door by hand, give you a big hug, and say \"Thank YOU!\"  But... we can't!

Epically.\nAcid baths, sand blasting, laser etching - these are some of the techniques jeans companies use to create interesting looks.  The problem?  It's all artificial, anonymous and unseen.  If you want your jeans to say something real about you, put a real story into them.  With your backing we are going to pull off a world\u2019s first  \u2013 sending your jeans tumbling almost 2,000 feet off a sheer cliff into the Grand Canyon!    \nUnderstand, these are going to be your jeans that you already own and love.  We don\u2019t sell jeans \u2013 we orchestrate this incredible upgrade treatment.  Your \u201cBig Tumble\u201d jeans will have the perfect fit, color and style for you \u2013 because you already wear them.  But you are going to love them so much more after they take an epic plunge into the abyss of the Grand Canyon, a quick dip in the Little Colorado River, a light flail on rocks up to 250 million years old, and a helicopter rescue back up to the Rim, before being shipped back for you to wear the adventure.\nHere is a teaser video of what your jeans will go through - but yours will go off a cliff 5 times higher than this one!\nTalk, Walk or Rock?\nYou don\u2019t follow the crowd.  You like to run where most fear to tread.  Others talk a good game about how exclusive or amazing their jeans are, but you walk the walk - refusing to settle for pedestrian threads.  Finding yourself at the bold new intersection of Style and Adventure, you don\u2019t shuffle by.  You rush in headlong and grab yourself a piece of this once in a lifetime chance to rock your jeans like no one has done before. \nExtreme Jeans Experience\nWe aren\u2019t out to destroy or thrash your jeans.  This is a new kind of distressing \u2013 more about putting an incredible story into your pants, not intentionally adding holes or rips.  You bought your jeans because you love how they look, and we don\u2019t want to mess with that.  Your jeans will take a fearsome plunge off the cliff, but that won\u2019t fundamentally change how they look.  What will change is how you feel every time you pull them on, and the fun of wearing them.\nThe heart of our concept is that your jeans become a tangible connection to an extreme experience \u2013 an astonishing action event made possible by your participation.  Something that no individual could ever pull off, no company has ever dared to attempt, and available only to you and the exclusive group who claim the cutting edge.      \nNow, telling everyone that the jeans you are wearing went over the Rim and tumbled through space into the famed Grand Canyon will be pretty cool.  Legendary even.  Trouble is, not everyone is going to believe you.  After all it is a pretty wild claim.  But don\u2019t worry, we got your back.  Every pair of In2mY Pants Grand Canyon \u201cBig Tumble\u201d limited-edition jeans will feature a distinctive commemorative rivet, an exclusive custom designed label, an embroidered In2mY Pants logo, and a laminated, signed and certified Pocket Card officially verifying the stunt stats.\n \u201cOkay\u201d, people might say, \u201cYou bought a label making kit and a home laminator machine and you made your own cute little props to back up your B.S. story.  Nice try.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when you casually pull up the In2mY Pants Facebook pages and Twitter feeds to confirm the details, jump over to Flickr and Instagram to drop their jaws with a photo slideshow of the stunt and then seal the deal with viewings of the amazing \u201cBig Tumble\u201d video on YouTube and Vimeo.\n\u201cOMG! How can I get my jeans Big Tumbled?\u201d they'll cry.\n\u201cHey, sad story.  You can\u2019t.  In2mY Pants Grand Canyon \u201cBig Tumble\u201d was limited-edition and it\u2019s over. So sorry, but you are S-O-L.\u201d\nRole Play\nSo which role in our little denim drama do you want to play?  The one with the ultra-stylin Grand Canyon \u201cBig Tumble\u201d limited-edition jeans or the one wishing they had \u2018em but never can?  The one with the killer story and the goods to back it up, or the sad sack that missed out?\nExclusive??? LMAO!\nGuess how many pairs of jeans are sold each year, just in the USA? 450 million! The odds are that you will see about 450,000 people wearing jeans less than a year old before you find even 1 other person proudly sporting a pair of In2mY Pants Grand Canyon \u201cBig Tumble\u201d jeans.  If we sell out every available pair that still means an average of just 25 \u201cBig Tumble\u201d jeans per state!  Never mind the fact that 95% of visitors to the Grand Canyon never go the bottom \u2013 your jeans will! \nWe are absolutely thrilled that Steph Davis and Mario Richard, legends in the world of vertical adventure, are providing the technical expertise to make the \u201cBig Tumble\u201d possible.  Our Grand Canyon jeans drop has also been registered with Guinness World Records, making you and your jeans part of a super cool official world record attempt.\nSo think about it.  Your own jeans will go to one of the most iconic destinations on the planet, feature in a spectacular stunt orchestrated by two elite extreme athletes, possibly set an official world record, be rescued by a helicopter and receive exclusive custom embellishments, all of which will be professionally videoed and photographed for you to effortlessly share with your friends on your social networks.  Could you wear any more adventure than that?\nDrop Your Pants ... NOW!\nWe hope you love our story, and that we talked you into dropping your pants and sending them to us.  We promise to tumble them real good. \nThe clock is running and this is a very special limited-edition.  Please choose one of our awesome rewards and make your pledge NOW so you don\u2019t miss out.

The Grand Canyon is a huge geographic feature over 277 miles long and up to 18 miles wide.  Much but not all of it lies within Grand Canyon National Park.  In developing the Project we first approached National Park staff and were essentially told it would never be allowed.  Next we explored the possibility of going to the section owned by the Hualapai Tribal Nation, but it did not offer the sheer cliffs required for our jeans drop.  Ultimately, we were thrilled to find exactly the right location on the Little Colorado River Gorge, and have since obtained the necessary permits from the Navajo Nation.

Without bees our food supply and our City would suffer, and we are opening this apiary with the goal of promoting the local beekeeping movement and educating New Yorkers about the many wonderful contributions that bees make.\nThe $20,000 that we are raising through this kickstarter campaign will pay for the bees themselves, the hives where they live, and other beekeeping equipment including smokers, safety masks and beekeeping tools for our beekeepers and apprentices. We want the apprenticeship program to be free for all participants, and we need your help to make that possible.  The money will also pay for fencing around the apiary, a storage container to keep our equipment out of the weather, and a tent where we can hold workshops and training sessions in inclement weather.\n\nThis is the Brooklyn Grange's second Kickstarter campaign.

Monoculture Crop Grower A in California hires Beekeeper to put all his hives on a truck and plop them down in his fields or groves. (Check out the second picture at the bottom to see a hundred or so hives in an almond grove.)\n2.) The bees pollinate all the flowers they can find, until the monoculture bloom fades and there is nothing left for the bees to eat.\n3.)

Here We Grow!\nFun updates   Our photo album   Local news coverage of launch   Volunteer\nRaleigh City Farm is an urban farm startup growing food made from local rain, local compost, and local sunshine. We believe that every city needs an urban farm to reduce waste, improve our health, and deepen the connection we urbanites have to our own food supply.  We see urban agriculture as a major upgrade to city life. The need is great and the time is now.\nWe've secured a highly-visible acre of land within a mile of city-center and need funding to build out the infrastructure that will allow us to research and demonstrate intensive urban growing techniques.\nWe're changing this...                                             to this!\nWe are a completely uncompensated, volunteer-run organization.  There are no salaries and your entire donation goes toward critical infrastructure.  Your donations beyond $10,000 will quicken the farm's progress and help ensure our success.\nOur needs include:\nIrrigation - We want to build an extensive rain-barrel system that will allow us to capture and store water from an adjacent shopping center. Municipal water lines also need installing for whenever we use up the rain water.\nRain Garden - Urban farming faces special challenges that are also opportunities for innovative solutions. For example, we want to design and install a rain garden. Doing so will keep rain water that falls on our lot out of the sewer system and put it back into the ground.  It will also protect the farm's growing beds from runoff from nearby parking lots that could break through and destroy our plant rows.\nTools & Shed - Urban farming uses a lot less machinery than industrial agriculture. We need to put shovels and wheelbarrows into the hands of our eager volunteers.\nHoop House - Hoop Houses extend the growing season by protecting plants from cold winters and offering shade in the summer.  If our Kickstarter campaign raises beyond $10,000, we may be able to add one to the farm\u2014bringing more fresh produce to Raleigh.\nWith your help we will transform one of the city's most underutilized spaces into one of the city's best used spaces.\nOur Story\nThank you for your interest and support!  \"LIKE\" us on Facebook  Follow us on Twitter  Visit our website\nOur team\n\u2014\nSpecial thanks to: Videographer Holt Menzies // Some footage provided by Peter Bell // Graphic Designing Gurus Brandi Gull, Hillary Thomas, Chelsea Dunlap. // Social Media Gurus: Nicole Alvarez, Anita Blomme Pinther, Chelsea Dunlap, John Kurtz, Hillary Thomas, Thomas Thornton, Matt Tomasulo // Creative Gurus: Annelies Gentiles, Zana Wall-Rogers // Fundraising Gurus Lisa Finaldi and Lisa Barrie. \nSpecial thanks to Joanna Lelekacs from Dancing Pines Farm for her early and ongoing major contribution of time, expertise and talent.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Final Kickstarter Reward Update", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarters -- Lots of great news to share with you!\nYou've probably seen this announcement on Facebook and Twitter, but in case you haven't...our friends at @GreenAmerica are hosting a National \u201cPeople and Planet Award\u201d for Green Businesses \u2026 and we\u2019re a finalist!!!

If we reach our new $25,000 Stretch Goal, we\u2019ll be able to improve the film for all of our backers.\nIf we can hit the $25k mark by the end of our campaign, we\u2019ll be able to:\nImprove the quality of the musical score. Reaching our stretch goal will allow our composer to hire session musicians to create a more orchestral, cinematic score rather than a synthesized one.\n\nAdd professional color grading. Our stretch goal allows our color grading session to be more comprehensive, so that the look of every shot can be dialed into perfection.\n\nCreate multichannel sound mixes. Sound is one half of the movie watching experience, and our stretch goal will allow us to create an industry standard 5.1- channel sound mix in addition to the 2-channel stereo mix. This fully immersive mix will be available for live screenings such as the premiere and film festivals, as well as on the DVD and Blu-ray discs.\nWe know that getting another $7,000 in pledges in the next 4 days will be tough, but we are nothing if not ambitious.  With your help, we think we can do it, so don\u2019t forget to spread the word!\nSincerely,\nThe Endangered Team\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHI, EVERYONE!  THANK YOU FOR TAKING A FEW MOMENTS OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT!\nENDANGERED is the new action-packed scifi short film from director, visual effects master, and Project Greenlight winner Efram Potelle. \nTHE STORY:  A man wakes up from cryo sleep expecting to arrive into a futuristic society; instead he steps into a nightmare world devoid of people and technology, but filled with exotic, dangerous creatures that have apparently taken over the world.  As these monsters chase him through a decrepit city, he must learn to survive while searching for the answers to very important questions:  What are these creatures?  Where did they come from?  And where is everybody?  Is he the only one left?  The answers will shock you. \n\nWith ENDANGERED, Efram aims to push the boundaries of what can be done with visual effects on a limited budget, while still telling an exciting and compelling story.  Our goal is nothing short of creating a huge, exciting and epic new world that people will want to explore long after they\u2019ve seen this film. \n                                      Creature scale comparison\nREWARDS\nWe\u2019d never ask for money without offering something in return, and so we'll include our backers as much as possible in the incredible process of making this film.  If you look to the right, you\u2019ll see a galaxy of different reward tiers, from $1 (every little bit helps and is appreciated!) to $10,000, and rewards \u2013 everything from invitations to swanky LA screenings and Blu-Ray copies of Endangered to the filmmaker's rewards, including behind-the-scenes movies and even instructional videos on how to make your own action/scifi film.  Need Efram to personally troubleshoot VFX problems you\u2019re having on your film?  We have a reward for that!  \nWHY KICKSTARTER? \nAfter pooling all our resources, stretching ourselves to the limit of what we can personally do, and calling in favors from everyone we know, we still found ourselves just short of the funds which would make this film truly EPIC.  And epic is the only way we want to make it.  We want this world to feel huge and real, filled with unique and scary monsters that live in their own ecosystem.  We want to create a setting that you'd want to explore.  Our goal is to raise at least $18,000 to make this project the way it deserves to be made. \nThe money we receive from Kickstarter will go to the actual hard costs of production that we simply can\u2019t do ourselves or get for free; mainly prop construction materials and location fees.  To a lesser extent, the money will be spent on equipment rentals (at a thankfully discounted rate), storage space, travel costs, character wardrobe and set dressing. \n                                          Cryotube Prop Design\nThe bottom line is that, we, the filmmakers, are already getting a lot of bang for our buck, which means that you, the wonderful, amazing, and incredible potential Kickstarting backers will, too.  And just to be clear, none of the money we\u2019re asking for will be going to us.  It will all be up on screen.  \nREADY TO ROLL \nWe're deep into pre-production and have finished (or nearly finished) securing locations, creature design, prop building and design, budgets, storyboards, schedules, and countless other odds and ends.  Our Kickstarter fundraising drive runs through the month of March into the early part of April, and if successful, we will immediately finish up pre-production and shoot in mid-May.  Because of the extensive visual effects work, the post-production will be longer than usual, but we\u2019re going to work as fast as we can to deliver the finished film.  \nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS \nEfram Potelle is an award-winning director and visual effect artist, and winner of the second season of Project Greenlight (he co-directed The Battle of Shaker Heights starring Shia LaBeouf). \n               Efram on the set of THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS \nEfram's short films have generated millions of hits, everywhere from Atom Films to YouTube; you may have even seen a few.  Here are two of them: \n                                            \"HellHoles\" Episode 1\n                                                       \"INSEX\"\nIn his spare time, Efram designs his own unique, darkly funny, holiday cards (of which you can get limited edition prints \u2026 just check out the reward tiers to the right!!) \n                    Efram's 2011 Holiday Card - The Exploding Santa\nYou can find out more about him and see the rest of his shorts and reels, including the remaining episodes of HellHoles at his website (http://eframcentral.com), or you can shoot over to his IMDB page (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003768/) for more information.\nGeoff Skinner, Jane Lawton Moore & Morgan Patterson are working with Efram to produce ENDANGERED and help bring Efram's vision to life.  They bring with them over 30 years of movie making experience, ranging from production work to feature development. \nWHAT IS THIS KICKSTARTER THING? \nIn short, Kickstarter allows anyone to donate any amount they would like (from one dollar up to 10 grand) in order to help support the completion of a creative project.\nIn return, Kickstarter donors receive rewards based on how much they give (our rewards are listed to the right).  If you choose to donate, click the reward tier you\u2019d like, verify the amount you\u2019d like to donate, and at that point you\u2019ll be taken to the Amazon.com payment processing center to make your pledge.  It's that easy! \nBUT VERY IMPORTANT!!!!  No money will be taken out of your account until two things have happened.  1) We have reached the end of our pledge drive on April 11, 2012 at Midnight, and 2) WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL OF $18,000. \nThis is all or nothing for us \u2013 if we don\u2019t reach our goal, you keep your money.  It\u2019s that simple. \nJUST THE BEGINNING\nDoes this story end with this film? Absolutely not. This short is the first step in a campaign to build a world of story and hopefully many hours of entertainment for lovers of sci-fi and fantasy adventures. So come with us as we begin the amazing journey into this new world! \nSPREAD THE WORD\nThank you all for checking out our project!  If you do back our project, or if you want to because you like what we're trying to accomplish, please also consider spreading the word via Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, or any other way you can think of.

Read about Mala Mala on The Huffington Post here.\nNEW TRAILER! Hang out with Mala Mala at The Fair\nThis is our first feature length film as a directing duo, and has been an incredibly exciting experience.  We've spent the last few months filming in Puerto Rico, and with your generous support, the money we raise through Kickstarter will help us wrap filming on the island as well as assist with post production costs.  Thanks in advance for your time and support.\nTranssexualism and drag defy the binary most accept as their standard, while acting as a channel to express (and inhabit) one's individuality.  Conventions are broken when men apply lashes, wigs, and dresses.  Prevailing ideas of gender are turned on their head during the transitional process of a transgendered person. And yet as \"other\" and both drag and transsexualism may seem to some, they both reflect the universal human need to explore and fulfill.  To live life as a trans individual is to embody a lifestyle of possibility and endless creation. \nTo capture all of this--the relationship between cultural life in one of the only colonized territories still governed by the United States, and the experience of citizens who themselves inhabit deeply dualistic identities, is for us a rare opportunity to capture a beautifully unique community. \nAs a trans person in Puerto Rico, not only does your experience beg the question \u201cam I Puerto Rican, am I American, or am I both?\u201d but also \u201cam I a male, am I a female, or am I both?\u201d This vagueness, this in-betweenness is what most fascinates us as filmmakers, and with this project we hope to share the stories of people who's voices may not otherwise be near enough to reach your ears.\nAt its core, this film is a people piece.  We are interested in the relationship between the internal and external being, the dynamics between performance and gender, and the power of self-discovery.  \nWe hope that you decide to become part of our community in support of our film, and reach out to us with any questions, suggestions, or any other things you'd like us to hear at DanandAntonio@gmail.com.

By day, Jason makes his own costumes & serves ice cream at Maggie Moo's. By night, he's the island's It-girl. April is known to always take it to the next level and her congeniality is bowed down to wherever she goes.\nKAYRA (Henry) Henry is a human rights activist on the west coast of Puerto Rico. With or without makeup, he is generous, kind, and determined; spreading the message of love and acceptance wherever he goes. Dressed up as Kayra, nothing can stop him.\nZAHARA (Alberic) The Paris Hilton of Puerto Rico, Zahara\u2019s appearance is in constant flux. Anything to give her loving fans what they want: glamour.\nROCHELLE (Roberto) Rochelle is the intellectual of the group. When she speaks, her girls are all ears. She understands the complexity of the Puerto Rican identity and uses the best of both male and female worlds to overcome all obstacles. Her passion is acting, and if a boy is what the casting agent wants, then Rochelle has no problem morphing back into Roberto for the perfect role.\nSAMANTHA Samantha is a former transsexual who began her transition with hormones from the black market until she had to stop due to medical complications. However, if the timing is right, Samantha would give the transition another try.\nSOPHIA After a successful male-to-female transition in New York City, Sophia moved away to Puerto Rico to pursue her dream of owning a little bar on a small island.

I developed the Sutro in collaboration with Mission Bicycle Company to serve as the most practical and elegant geared city bike available.\nThe Bike\nThe Sutro was designed by and for city cyclists to be ridden everyday and everywhere. We took the simplicity of a single speed bike and added the versatility of a Shimano multi-geared internal hub. Then to achieve a clean aesthetic we routed the brake and shifter cables through the frame.\nSutro with 8-speed Shimano Alfine Hub\n8-Speed Internal Hub\nOur first bike, the Valencia, was designed around the simplicity and dependability of single speed riding. It was our answer to the clunky, heavy and unreliable bikes marketed for the city. However, we knew one gear wasn't the solution for every rider. \nSo we searched for an alternative that offered the flexibility of a fully geared bike while retaining the ease of riding and near zero maintenance we'd already developed. We fell in love with the mechanical wizardry of the Shimano internal multi-geared hubs and the potential they offered.\n8-gears enclosed inside the rear hub\nThese hubs allow a simple setup while providing a huge gear range completely enclosed inside the rear wheel. Free of complicated and delicate external parts, they are resilient and practically maintenance free. No dropped chains. No crossed gears. No more derailleur adjustment.\nA single bar mounted shifter simplifies the process\nInternal Cable Routing\nWe've routed the cables for the shifter and the rear brake inside the tubing of the bike, creating a clean and elegant appearance. Just another way we've seamlessly married the form and function of this bicycle design.\nBrake and shifter cables entering the frame\nMaterials\nWe build this bike out of 4130 chromoly steel for its high strength, low weight and durability. Steel is the most resilient choice for city bikes as it takes the daily abuse of riding better than any other frame material. Meanwhile, at 24 pounds, it's light enough to hoist up a few flights of stairs.\nStrong and lightweight steel\nDesign and Build\nUsing the Sutro as the canvas, each bicycle is custom designed by each rider, anywhere in the world, and built one at a time by Mission Bicycle Company. The experienced staff and curated components will help you turn this innovative frame into a bike specific to your needs. No experience necessary.\nChoose from hundreds of frame colors\nOur Story\nEman Eng: I\u2019ve put the torch to dozens of different frame designs and I\u2019ve ridden each one through the streets of San Francisco in pursuit of the perfect city bike. Each success was assimilated into the next design and after many years and many miles the Sutro was born.\nMission Bicycle Company: We began with a simple premise, give people the bicycle they want and they'll ride. Each bike is custom designed by each rider and then hand built right here in San Francisco.\nNext Steps\nWith your support we are going to release the Sutro out into the world. If we meet our goal the frame will go into production and all backers will receive their rewards. If we don\u2019t hit our funding target, no money changes hands. To reach our goal we are giving you the opportunity to be among the first riders of the Sutro and to do so with great incentives.\nComplete Bicycle Backers Please Note: The complete bicycle reward at $1,234 includes customization of standard components and colors.

We made it, thanks to YOU!  So here's the deal.  What if we make $15K?  With a day and a half left?  Why not?

Help Johnny and the tail team make their magic!  Or if you have welding or sewing skills, get the fun of throwing down with our team for a day or two.  Thank you so much for making Quetzalita a SUCCESS!\nThe Firebulb team brings Apocalypta Quetzalita, great-granddaughter of the Mexican feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl, to Burning Man this year. Standing 46 feet tall above the playa, the sumptuous, voluptuous goddess created by our team will embody the act of shedding our heavy past, as she sheds the skin of Quetzalcoatl from whose mouth she is born.  She will reveal her readiness for the challenges of the era before us by deploying magnificent wings that spring from her back once the skin is shed.  Her 55' long mobile tail made from repurposed bicycle frames and wheels will draw patterns on the Playa canvas as it is pushed by participants, revealing how the acts we create today form the inertia of the future: we choose to create the culture we want to live in.\nMade from steel with elements in copper, chrome, stainless and re-purposed waste, Quetzalita glimmers in the sunlight and under lighting at night.  With a frame of rigid steel holding her long curving neck, Quetzalita's body is wrought from stainless braided wire, copper and mild steel elements--a design based on filigree jewelry, on a massive scale.  Her markings follow the natural patterns of a Karman Street Vortex, the pattern of liquids encountering resistance.  \n\nAt night spectacular animated lighting reveals Quetzalita's mood.  With spotlights coloring her from the outside at times, and animated stripes and spots illuminating her from the inside at others, participants will witness her going back and forth from spirit form to embodied being.  Occasional bursts of flame emanate from her mouth and spiral hummingbird tongue, lighting up the playa with heat and bursts of sound.\n\nDuring the beginning half of the week Quetzalita is being born from the mouth of her great grandfather--Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec feathered serpent God of fertility and war.  The skin of Quetzalcoatl is made from large copper feathers and square spirals made of copper, steel, chrome, and metallic fabrics with industrial detritus--car parts, computer chips, gleaming machinery and other modern artifacts, all attached flexibly to each other on an underlying canvas skin.  The skin sparkles in the sunlight, at once seductive, but also embued with the power of all that we are shedding as we lift the veil our old ways and replace them with the new ways of being we are striving to embody.  In a ritual on Wednesday of the burn week, participants help Quetzalita shed her great-grandfather's skin and sprout wings from her back, which emerge through the use of pulleys from a tube inside her body and drop down in a fan to be secured to her back with guy wires.  The ritual is accompanied by the burning of Copal (to add a scent aspect to the sculpture) and the sharing of chocolate with participants in the ritual.  As the skin is removed, we see a narrow slit that allows participants to enter her cozy, fabric-lined womb that rests below her neck and before the flexible part of her tail.  After being shed, the skin remains with the piece, anchored on a PVC framework, a testament to our past, emerging from a masculine-dominated era into a feminine one.\nEt en fran\u00e7ais maintenant...\nEn 2012, les temps changent. les aztecs nous parlent de transformations majeures, de \"fin\". \nMais est ce que \"la fin\" ne laisse pas la place au \"d\u00e9but\"? \nCette ann\u00e9e, le th\u00e8me de Burning Man est : \"fertilit\u00e9 2.0\". \nEn octobre 2011, quatre femmes se retrouvent  autour d un d\u00e9sir commun: Capra , LaTisha, Peggy et Elodie discutent. l une d elle propose \" Quetzal Coatl\" comme th\u00e8me de travail, le dieu serpent a plume des aztecs, \nLe th\u00e8me du dieu serpent a plume a beaucoup voyager entre les diff\u00e9rentes cultures sud am\u00e9ricaines de l \u00e9poques, les premi\u00e8res repr\u00e9sentations remontent aux alentour de 900 ans avant j\u00e9sus christ, et l on continue de pouvoir suivre son \u00e9volution a travers les si\u00e8cles jusque a la conqu\u00eate espagnole. Dans toutes les cultures qu il traverse, QuetzalCoatl est le dieu de la fertilit\u00e9, de la guerre, de la culture, de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des hommes, Venus est son etoile. et les pr\u00eatres interpr\u00e8tent ses dires.

Elles d\u00e9cident de travailler autour de l id\u00e9e de l arri\u00e8re petite fille du dieu serpent, et elles cr\u00e9ent: \"Apocalipta Quetzalita\". \nSelon La d\u00e9finition originale du mot \"Apocalypse\":\n(Greek: \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 apok\u00e1lypsis; \"lifting of the veil\" or \"revelation\") is a disclosure of something hidden from the majority of mankind in an era dominated by falsehood and misconception, i.e. the veil to be lifted. The Apocalypse of John (Greek \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5) is the Book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament.

The Firebulb team wants to thank you again for your massive showing of support.  Here's what happened:\nOn Monday, after we canceled the Kickstarter, we got a message from Bettie June (head of the artery) to call her.  She said they were just finalizing the budget and if they got extra money in their budget this year, things were looking good for our project and if not they weren't.  By way of explanation, we asked the burning man org for a large amount of funding for this project, a fair amount higher than their typical top grants--partially this is necessary as it is much more difficult to raise funds for big projects in the Northwest than the Bay Area, LA or NY.  This is because additional art granting organizations have less money for grants, and because lower incomes in our area make it more difficult to do private fundraising.  Because of this, the success of our Kickstarter was a huge boost to our project!

Actually, it was a bit scary... but in a good way... and, 6 weeks later, I've figured out how I'll be able to make shoes for you all. This page is the first step towards realising that dream and I hope some of you will be willing to pre-order your shoes, so that I have the upfront capital I need to get busy!\nThanks guys. And I hope you will soon be able to enjoy your shoes.\nNow, I realise that some of you haven't the foggiest what an Atheist shoe is. And, admittedly, an atheist shoe sounds like a peculiar idea. But we think a shoe is a lovely, understated way for atheists to out themselves and to be less shy about their godlessness. And we also think our Bauhaus-inspired, 1930s-infatuated shoes will be a welcome antidote to the samey junk pumped out by the big sneaker corporations - not only do we feel our designs are prettier, but we know that the care, craftsmanship and quality of materials going into our shoes are superior to those invested by N**e, *onver*e and Ad***s.\nSo how do you get your shoes? It's easy. You can buy your shoes, here, today, by making a pledge. You'll see amongst our rewards that you can pre-order a pair of shoes for $180, which includes shipping. And then, a month from now, you'll be able to log into our website and choose the colour and sole you'd like us to send you. Those who pre-order their shoes on Kickstarter will be the first to get them!\nIn the mean time, we'll have invested your dosh in producing your shoes and we're hopeful they'll be ready to ship by May 1st, if not sooner. \nWe're not yet ready to show you all the available colours and soles, but we're working on it and it would really help us if, when you make your pledge, you could give us a hint as to which colour you'd like and which sole. We can't guarantee your choice will be available in the end, but if enough people want something, then we'll definitely be able to make it!\nPlease tell us which of the following colours appeals to you most: cream, charcoal black, chocolate brown, brown & sand combo, petrol blue, British racing car green, grey. And which of these soles: \"Ich Bin Atheist\" (embossed), \"Darwin Loves\" (embossed), \"Atheist, Jawohl\" (embossed), \"Ich Bin Atheist\" (decorative).\nWe're really happy to have your support.

See our latest update for details.\nOccuprint is a volunteer-run collaborative project that curates, collects, prints and distributes posters and graphics produced by and for the global Occupy movement. In the Fall, Occuprint launched with an all-poster newspaper, published in collaboration with the Occupied Wall Street Journal.  Since then, we\u2019ve been sending the paper across the globe as a freely distributed tool to keep the #occupy movement as visible as possible, as beautiful as possible, and in as many places as possible.\nThe response has been overwhelming. Since the newspaper was released, we\u2019ve received hundreds of poster submissions from all over the world\u2014many of which we\u2019ve archived on our website: \noccuprint.org\nNow, we want to start getting these images out beyond the internet: into the streets and into the homes, offices, and schools of #occupy supporters worldwide.\nWe\u2019re raising money for two reasons:\n1. So we can print posters\u2014tens of thousands of posters\u2014and start distributing them anywhere there are #occupy supporters.\n2. So we can print a limited edition portfolio of screen printed images, which will ultimately live in the permanent collections of museums, libraries, and other arts institutions.\nThe Posters\n(These are the first two posters we're printing - this week! (March 13th) - with the funds raised by kickstarter. The first is by Molly Crabapple, the second is by Josh MacPhee. We've been so successful that we're able to print 5000 of each! - we added both of them to new rewards for those interested.)\n(This is the first poster we've massed produced - by Alexandra Clotfelter - and we're offering it as one of our rewards.  The images we print in 2012 will be just as amazing!)\nWhile we screen print ourselves, for larger runs of posters we work with union print shops\u2014one here in Queens, NY and another in Detroit, MI. We have budgeted into this proposal:\n$1,800: Two thousand (2,000) copies of a 24\u201d x 36\u201d poster (this includes printing and an estimate of our distribution costs\u2014postage and packaging).\n$6,000: Twenty thousand (20,000) copies of a broadsheet:, poster on one side, short articles and other information on the back (again, includes printing and distribution costs).\n$2,000: Three thousand (3,000) copies of an 18\u201d x 24\u201d poster, with articles printed on the back.\n$2,000: Three thousand (3,000) copies of a second 18\u201d x 24\u201d poster, with articles printed on the back.\nTOTAL: $11,800\nThe specifics of what we print might vary slightly. If we receive more money, either our print runs will increase or we will print additional materials. Occuprint is a volunteer, activist project\u2014all of the money we raise goes directly to printing and shipping.\nThe Portfolio\nThe Occuprint portfolio will consist of thirty poster images from our website. We\u2019ve had help choosing the images from members of Occupy the Hood, Occupy Together, and the Occupied Wall Street Journal. We are working with a number of different printers to make this happen, from members of the OWS Screenprinting Guild to a Do- It-Yourself printshop in Nashville.\nWe will produce an edition of 100 portfolios, and that\u2019s it. That means these are going to be super rare. \u2014 35 are reserved for artists and printers, 30 more are being offered to libraries and educational institutions across the country, and then Occuprint will keep 10 portfolios to lend out for events and exhibitions. That leaves 25 portfolios, which we are offering to YOU, our Kickstarter supporters, to help us make all of this possible.\nAll of the prints in the portfolio are numbered and initialed by the printer, then stamped with the Occuprint seal. There is a front sheet, the \u201ccalaphon,\u201d which offers a short explanation of the project, and lists all the artists and printers as well as the major donors (over 1000$). Finally, all the prints are packaged together into a presentation folio, printed with Occuprint\u2019s seal.\nHere's a selection of images that will be included:\nThe costs for printing this portfolio include paper, ink, shop fees, the presentation folio, and compensating the printers for their work.\nThey are estimated as follows:\n$3,000: Paper (including the portfolio itself)\n$2,000: Shop fees and printing supplies\n$8,000: Printing Labor\n$2,000: Shipping\n[Sub-total: $15,000, minus income from institutional sales : $10,000]\nTOTAL needed from Kickstarter for portfolios: $5,000\nTOTAL NEEDED FOR BOTH PROJECTS = $16,800\n# # # # #  # #  PROJECT FAQ # # # # # # # #\nWe've had a couple people ask about the rewards that involve portfolio prints.  It says \"our choice\" which has made people worry that we might choose prints they don't want - which is a fair concern.  Here is what we will do: after the kickstarter is over, we will email all the people who chose rewards that involve portfolio prints, asking them to list their top 5 choices (top 10 if your reward is for 5 prints). Once we have all these responses, we will go through and make sure everyone gets their first or second choice (hopefully everyone gets their first choice - it just depends on how diverse your tastes are!).  The process will work like this:\ntop available choice for each reward, \nthen 5 print rewards get their second available print choice\nthen each reward gets their next available print choice (reverse order as round 1)\nthen the 5 print rewards get their 4th and 5th available choices\nWhen we curated the portfolio we had such a wide range of interest in different prints, that I'm really not worried about people getting the prints they want.

With LINX you can build everything from ambitious room-sized structures to intricate table-top sculptures, all using LINX connectors and standard drinking straws. LINX are portable, less expensive than anything else around, and ultra light weight, so that even if your mammoth construction falls, no one gets hurt. Here are a few more reasons why LINX are awesome:\n\u2022 Modular and Flat. The connectors come in flat grids which easily snap apart, intersect, and lock into place to create a three dimensional star shape to allow for more complex structures. \n\u2022 Standard Straws. The connectors are designed to accommodate most standard straws that can be found in your local grocery, drug, or big-box store.\n\u2022 Limitless Building. By cutting, bending, or using multiple colors of straws, the possibilities are endless. You can make highly organized geometric structures, or free-form tangles. \n\u2022 Educational. Beyond being a fun way to spend an afternoon, LINX inspire creativity and give children an opportunity to develop their motor and spatial skills through hands-on play. If the campaign is successful, one of our first goals will be to get LINX in the hands of teachers and physical therapists. \n\u2022 Sustainable. We are striving to make LINX as sustainable as possible. The connectors will be made out of a kid-friendly recycled or bio plastic in the US, and come in the most minimal of packaging. Additionally, LINX are designed to be manufactured with little or no waste, and we\u2019ll be involved in every step of the process to ensure socially responsible practices. \nSounds great right?

By setting Instaprint to look out for specific locations or hashtags, any Instagram tagged appropriately will automatically be printed out on inkless paper. Get one for your next party, event, wedding, fiesta....\nTHE BACKSTORY\nInstaprint was invented in the spring of 2011 by our small company called BREAKFAST. Over the past year our prototype devices have been seen at events such as store openings, product launches, a variety of different parties and events including The Grammys and Lady Gaga concerts.\nGoing from prototype to consumer product is a massive step, and is something BREAKFAST has been working on for almost a year. It's a huge endeavor that will require us to bring on more staff and dedicate many months to make it all happen. Some things are sure to change as we get into the thick of it, but that means things will only get better.\nWe're really psyched to try and make this happen, and we hope you'll help us reach our goal. We can't thank all of you enough for any support you can give!\nWHERE DOES THE CASH GO?\n$175,000 will go towards the many months of mechanical design, digital design, hardware development, software development, prototyping and testing for the device hardware, software and website.\n$260,000 will go towards the parts, molds, inkless paper, fabrication and build of the devices.\n$20,000 for packaging and shipping all of the rewards.\n$45,000 goes to KickStarter and Amazon's fees.\nINKLESS TECHNOLOGY\nRather than dealing with ink cartridges that constantly need replacement, Instaprint uses an inkless technology where all color is pulled right from the paper itself. \nDAISY CHAINING\nFor higher volume printing and an even better look, additional Instaprints can be daisy chained together to share power and connectivity. Each multi-box set up requires one Instaprint that has a controller and Wi-Fi module which then drives the other controller-less Instaprints.\nQUICK & EASY WI-FI SETUP\nWhen Instaprint is powered up for the first time, it will show up as a Wi-fi network on your phone or computer. Once connected to the device, you'll be able to set the Wi-Fi network it will use to connect to the internet and associate your Instaprint device(s) with your instaprint.me account.\nINSTAPRINT.ME\nInstaprint.me will be your one-stop-shop for setting up your Instaprint devices with locations and hashtags for different events, and will also host your event galleries. These galleries showcase all the Instagrams printed at each of your events, and give attendees a place online to view the collection of prints.\nTECH SPECS\nSize and weight\nHeight:        6.5 inches (165.1 mm)\nWidth:         6.5 inches (165.1 mm)\nDepth:         2.5 inches (63.5 mm)\nWeight:        1.5 lbs.

It is possible that number could rise or drop, but we\u2019re determined to push for the highest capacity possible.\n\nPower\nHigh performance coiled cables provide DC current to each Instaprint.\nPower supplies will vary depending upon number of Instaprints in the kit you order. A larger power supply may be required for each additional Instaprint that is added to a daisy chain.\nPower supplies will work on 120v as well as 220v, but may require an adapter for international sockets.\nPrinter engine & paper type/price\nWe are still assessing several different printer engine options to ensure the highest quality, performance, and reliability.\nThe paper type will vary with the engine we decide on.
