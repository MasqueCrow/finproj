Featuring 100% new questions never seen on the show before!\nUm, Actually presents you with statements about the fictional worlds of popular movies, TV shows and books. They all sound right... but listen carefully, because each one has a mistake hidden in it somewhere! It's your job to figure out what's wrong and announce it before anyone else, starting, of course, with the magic phrase: \"Um, actually...\" \nBut even if you know nothing about Sailor Moon or Star Wars, you'll find yourself making wild guesses, stumbling into answers, and having laughs along the way!\nCheck out this episode to see how a game goes down:\n\nWe\u2019ve got lots of exciting stuff planned for this campaign! \nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019re going to be building a custom deck of questions with input from you, the backers, so don't forget to GET IN THE COMMENTS! We\u2019re calling it the Community Deck, and it will be included in every copy of the Community and Deluxe Editions of the game.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can look forward to in the coming weeks:\nThese weekly polls will pit card ideas against each other and call on you to vote on which one you would rather see in the Community Deck. Would you rather have John Woo or John Wick? Cloverfield or Garfield? Each week we'll do an update with a link to a poll where you can make your voice heard. Sweet democracy in action!\nEach week, we\u2019ll issue challenges that will allow you to offer your support for one of two categories you\u2019d like to see in the Community Deck. You might be asked to act something out, take a crazy photo, or even cobble together a quick cosplay outfit. Check in each Wednesday to learn about that week\u2019s challenge, then get creative and post your efforts on social media!\nWe\u2019ll be announcing a new engagement piece every Friday, each one designed to test your knowledge of all things nerdy! From getting in the game, to scoring some swag, engage with your fellow nerds and get rewarded for it. \nWe can\u2019t wait to see what you guys come up with!\nNot convinced by our fancy graphics and flashy video? Well, we asked our friends to say nice things about the game... so let's hear what they think!\nPLAY\n\nNot familiar with the show? Watch some clips and full episodes below!\nYou can watch every episode of Um, Actually - along with exclusive series like Dimension 20 and Game Changer on CollegeHumor's streaming service, Dropout.tv. You can also watch a number of classic free episodes on the Um, Actually YouTube channel.\n\n\nIf you're one of the awesome folks who backed a previous Wiggles 3D Kickstarter project, such as 5-Minute Dungeon or 5-Minute Mystery, we'd like to express our heartfelt thanks.\nThanks. No, really. Thanks so much for supporting us!\nAnd as another way of expressing our gratitude, we'd like to offer each and every one of you a free 2-month subscription to Dropout and a CA$ 5 credit, which can be applied against shipping charges or add-ons in the pledge manager after the campaign!\nDropout is College Humor\u2019s premier content streaming service, with lots of great shows like Dimension 20, Game Changer, and of course, Um, Actually!\nYou'll be able to claim this gift at the end of the campaign, when you complete your backer survey.\nLimit one per returning backer.\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over as part of your backer survey in BackerKit. \nWe will be shipping from depots in the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, China, and Australia. We'll choose the nearest depot to you to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes. Shipping to countries other than the ones where we have depots may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before placing an order. \nEuropean and UK VAT and Canadian HST are included in the shipping charges given below. \nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address. We cannot split pledges to ship to multiple addresses.\nActual shipping costs are higher than our charged rates. We subsidize shipping to keep rates affordable for backers.\n\nCurrency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends. Currency exchange rates change regularly. Look at your local currency exchange rate toward the end of the campaign for the most current price.\nOnce again, we'll be partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information.\nAfter the campaign ends, we'll send you a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. You'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game... at the same price as during the Kickstarter.\nIf you operate a game store and think that your customers would love Um, Actually, we'd love to hear from you!

We celebrate simplicity and smart design.  With four successful 30\u00b0 Ruler Kickstarters, 6,500 ecstatic backers, and 20,000+ delivered products, we\u2019re back and better with the 30\u00b0 Ruler 5.0!  \n\nWe believe life is best when simple things work...\nWhen we create our designs, we use various tools-some basic, some advanced. In the midst of design work on others, the humble ruler came to our attention and we began to look at one of our most used tools in a new light.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the 30\u00b0 Ruler?\nSometimes all it takes is one great idea to revolutionize a product. For the 30\u00b0 Ruler, it was a simple elevation. By lifting the slope on the ruler\u2019s face by 30\u00b0, we\u2019ve made it easier to use, and we\u2019ve expanded what you can use it for. It\u2019s simple but effective \u2013 that\u2019s what Orangered Life is all about.\nWith a 30\u00b0 slope, you can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over to use the device. So you switch from a tilted neck to a tilted ruler \u2013 keeping your back straight and your eyes on the target.\nThe elevation also allows for easy grabbing, without having to drag it towards the edge of the table or dig your nails underneath it. Finally, the angled nature of the ruler makes it safe for cutting.\nAlongside simplicity, we believe clarity is key. The 30\u00b0 Ruler does away with teeny measurements, instead opting for large fonts and clear indications. This means you can read the measurements from a distance, and you'll always be sure to find your mark.\nApart from its signature sloped design, the 30\u00b0 Ruler also has a couple of new features.\nThis 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, inches on the reverse. We've labelled them in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.\nThe 30\u00b0 Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler,  so every tick mark is labelled. \nOn the Imperial measurement side, all hash marks are labelled to eliminate guessing and counting of lines.  \nOn the Metric measurement side, both the millimetres and centimetres are numbered and the hash marks rise and fall making it easy to identify specific millimetre measurements.\nThe 30\u00b0 Ruler starts at zero. It is another simple design feature meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.\nThe ruler itself is made from aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the advanced materials make the 30\u00b0 Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant.\nWhat\u2019s New\uff1fNew Color. New Size.\nThe ruler also comes in four sizes of 15cm/6inch, 20cm/8inch, 30cm/12inch and 45cm/18inch; so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you\u2019re measuring.\nThe new colour was one of the biggest asks we got from our previous backers. And we don't disappoint our backers! We exist because of you guys, so we're proud to offer the new colours and new sizes.  Not sure which you like? Don\u2019t worry about that yet! You will get to select your colour choice at the survey time.\nReward\nTimeline\nThank You\nWe love sharing our passion for this ruler.\nThrough Kickstarter, we can cordially invite you on our journey and share with you the manufacturing process. We are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne primary challenge of this campaign is making sure that our product stands up to the tough quality assurance standards we have set.

Every package comes with standard tracking, e-mailed to you the moment the label is printed. To ensure best-practices as far as fulfillment is concerned, we ask that you read this VERY CAREFULLY before ordering.\nDIGITAL DOWNLOADS\nDigital files are sent out 24 hours after we receive our funding, which is typically 14-17 days after the last day of the campaign. These are e-mailed to the address on file and are valid for 7 days. Any extension of this is subjective.\nWe will not be mailing out links after 31 days.\nNo questions asked, no extensions past this point.\nTo ensure that you receive the necessary e-mails that contain these links, DO NOT block, filter, or unsubscribe ICONIC COMICS, KAMEN AMERICA, WETRANSFER, or ORANGEDOX.\nNew to this year is a tracking function that we have backstage that allows us to see download activity based on the e-mail addresses that the link is sent to. We reserve the right to terminate any current or future download ability based on unusual spikes in downloads coming from certain e-mail address. We are aware that people like to enjoy books on multiple devices, but it is at our discretion to evaluate individually any cases that seem to suggest piracy or link sharing.\nSHIPPING\nAll physical items come with an automatically generated tracking number e-mailed to you once the label is printed. We will offer replacements for any lost or damaged item. We will NOT offer refunds / replacements for books that we track as \"DELIVERED\", as it is your word against ours that any form of theft has occurred. Should this happen, please file a complaint with your local UPS / USPS / FEDEX provider.\nWe are not responsible for missing parcels after 3 months from the day they are sent out: that is when tracking information is no longer available to us, and it becomes the customer's word against our fulfillment that a package was not sent. Please read our fulfillment policies very carefully so that there is no confusion later on.\nWe also cannot guarantee the sending of products 3 months after the last package is sent out. Part of our on-time delivery is that customers are responsible for filling out their surveys in a timely manner. We cannot hold on to parcels on behalf of extremely late readers: at some point, we liquidate our stock to make room for new books. While we try to accommodate late surveys, we cannot guarantee either the quality of the book sent or that there will be books available at the time the survey is completed. PLEASE FILL OUT YOUR SURVEY ON TIME. MONITOR ALL UPDATES in the month of expected delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have minimized risks over the last 2 years of crowdfunding by being very transparent with our policies and fulfillment procedures on our campaign pages.

In case of them not being active, they must be carried in the Item Bag taking up one space.\nThe player that uses more than one spell must choose which one to use when their action is performed.\nSkills\nBefore performing any action, the player must decide whether to use or not the Skill.\nThe Skill, just like Spells, will cost Power and the player will benefit from its stats when attacking.\nElite and Boss Skills\nThe deck corresponding to the enemy is prepared.\nA card is revealed each turn of the enemy and that card\u2019s action is performed.\nIf the Skill persists through various turns, the card is put aside, placing Time markers each turn of the enemy until the effect disappears.\n\n\nAs promised on the campaign comments, here is a video of the game captured on TableTop Simulator (TTS). Due to the current Co-VID situation, inviting unvaccinated people from outside JanduSoft, and without an antigen or PCR test would be irresponsible on our part, so that is why we decided to record the game using TTS instead of our printed prototype.\n\nInitially, our idea was having this video uploaded a couple of days ago, but we had an issue with OBS and we did not record the correct audio output, so the only voice in the video was that of the host of the game, and not the four invited players. So last night we gathered four players that worked with us on another playing test session, and this is the game we have uploaded.\nTablet Top Simulator gameplay of MiniQuest Adventures\nTake a look at the video here.\n\nOnce again, since this project has escalated so much, we didn\u2019t have time to script the TTS because it was not our priority, and the game is in a non updated version that we use for testing.\n\nNonetheless, we considered that it would be good to share this TTS game with our community so you can give us all the feedback you can. So the game will be available on the TTS workshop. (An early version, without the extras we have added throughout the campaign). If someone is interested in scripting it, please contact us. \n\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures on Tabletop Simulator\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures here\nThis is not the final version, and has been cut by hand, so we can assure you that although it looks good, the final product will be much better. The colors might be different to the final ones since the prototype has been printed in matte, and the final version will be printed in glossy paper.\nWhen we have the final prototype in our hands we will post an update on the campaign to show the difference in the current finishes and the final ones, and also show you the size of the game inside the box-\nA lot of things inside the box\nTypical game setup\nPLAY\n\n*Handcrafting the prototype tokens\nDiscover the Heroes\n\n\nMartina is a Human Sorceress that takes advantage of her great power to cast devastating spells.\nHer innate ability will allow her to recover power as long as there are enemies nearby.\nDurlan is a relentless Explorer Elf that will take advantage of his movement to get out of harm's way when convenient.\nHis innate ability will allow him to deal deadly blows to his enemies.\nFaenala is a Dwarf Paladin that will do all it takes to protect her companions.\nHer innate ability will allow her to charge at her enemies although wearing a crude and heavy armor.\nRalen is a combat-skilled Human Barbarian seeking glory for his tribe.\nHis innate ability will all allow him to strike multiple enemies with a single attack.\n\n\nIf you like what you see, tell people about it!\nSpreading the word about the game is the best way to help it achieve the kind of success needed for me to produce more material and products for it. \n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\nBecome a Fan on BoardGameGeek \n Retweet & Like on Twitter \n Share & Like on Facebook \n Like & Comment on Instagram \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again as our pledge manager to help with your pledge and process accurate shipping fees.

They  are perfect to pull out when your players unexpectedly take a casual  comment for a story hook and you need an adventure idea, or for planning  what dangers lurk in your kingdom. You may even chain several together for an entire campaign!\nEach poker-sized card has a map on one side and a mini-adventure outline on the other side. The outline starts with a short description for the GM.  (Skim these to find an adventure that fits the circumstances.) Choose  between a couple of story hooks to get the adventure started. Next several encounter ideas move the game along. Customize them to match what your players do (drop some, change them to fit circumstances). Finally each card wraps up with one or two follow-up adventure ideas.\nWe've made 11 of these decks over the past few years, and now we're planning four more:\nStretch Goals\nFriendly Shipping\nWe have friendly shipping for the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and NZ thanks to distributors in those countries. See \"Shipping\" below for details.\nMore About Each New Deck\nOver 50 cards of Monster Hunts & Lairs!  While  each will have a couple of unique ways to get the adventure going, these will also have a couple of cards dedicated to which creatures provide what magical effects (sorted by power/challenge) when crafting  magic items or powerful spells.  So if the characters plan to create an item that confers increased flight and regeneration, you'll have a couple of quests to find creatures with those abilities. Each sidequest card will also suggest alternate monsters for the adventure.\nThe Coastal Town Sidequest Deck has 51 mini-adventures designed to play out in a fantasy coastal area, with the adventure outline on one side and a relevant map on the other. The quests center on several VIPs in town who need help with various enterprises as well as threats off the coast & nearby caves. While the sidequests can stand on their own, they are also tailored to match the Coastal Townsfolk NPC Portraits Deck. Each numbered sidequest could involve an NPC of the same number in the NPC deck (though the sidequests do not mention them by name, so you can substitute in your own NPCs). The NPC decks are available as add-ons through this Kickstarter, see below.\nWe also made a deck of Frontier/Mining Townsfolk NPC deck in a previous project. Like the Coastal Town Quests deck, these mini-adventures use the characters from the frontier townsfolk deck, but they aren't required--fill in your own locations and characters as desired. The quests in this deck focus on the mines & a cult near town as well as several tasks key residents need help performing.\nThese 50+ sidequests focus on historical mysteries and lost artifacts of the real world. Perfect for a campaign of tomb raiding or following up on lost crusades.  While most are set in the first half of the 1900s, as outlines they are easy to move to other time periods or even different worlds & genres.\nVirtual Table Top Maps\nYou'll also get PNG versions of any maps we create so you can easily share them with your players--or print larger versions.  For example, we make any battlemats at a scale of 75 pixels per square.\nSamples\nTroll Stew, card 14 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nSummoning Gone Awry! card 08 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nBy The Rockets Red Glare, card 23 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Mummy Menace, card 36 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Price of Power, card 14 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nPocket Full of Trouble, card 18 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nStuffed to the Gills, card 28 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nLoot Tunnels, card 33 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nReviews\n\"If you are a game facilitator that enjoys creating within a confined  space, I think these products will appeal to you. The outlines are  enough to keep you moving forward for a night of play but have enough  room to add your own traps, puzzles, monsters, or mechanical widgets  that I feel they can make for a comfortable backboard to bounce ideas  against.\" --Gnome Stew\n\"On each of these cards you\u2019ll find what you need to fuel a session,  if not several\u2013it\u2019s not every day you can get a year\u2019s worth of  adventure ideas in a single box\" --Bell of Lost Souls \n\"Highly recommend checking them out... If your players need a break from the main story line of your campaign, give these Sidequest Decks a show.\" --A Pawn's Perspective\nPrior Sidequest Decks\nThe prior Sidequest Decks are:\nAfter the TPK (Total Party Kill) - Ideas for the afterlife and how the party may return to the world.\nArcane Academy - Adventures centered on a magic school, for kid characters or adults.\nDungeons, Caverns, & Ruins Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in those settings.\nHigh Seas, Pirates, & Ports - Fantasy & pirate adventures on the seas or port cities.\nHorror Fantasy - Fantasy adventures with undead/necromancy themes.\nLovecraftian/Paranormal - Adventure outlines based on story seeds left behind by Lovecraft and other paranormal stories.\nModern (Criminals, Spies, & Supers) - Quests that take place in the modern day with mafia, spy, and super-hero themes.\nPolitical & Urban Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in town and cities as well as political plots.\nScience Fantasy - Adventures inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth, Thundarr the Barbarian, etc.\nScience Fiction - Adventures set in the far future.\nWilderness & Frontier Fantasy - Fantasy adventures set in the wilderness or villages.\nAnd as mentioned above the two Town Sidequest decks are related to our prior NPC Sidequest Decks Kickstarter, but they aren't essential if you plan to fit them into your own towns and NPCs.  If you wish to get the NPC Decks as part of this Kickstarter, they are available as add-ons. For that Kickstarter, we made the following NPC Decks:\nAdventurers\nAnimals (Companions, Familiars, etc.)\nCoastal Townsfolk\nFrontier Townsfolk\nHenchmen & Hirelings\nYou can pick any of the above NPC decks as add-ons, but only the Coastal & Frontier Townsfolk are related to the new Sidequest Decks. \nAnd if you don't want to wait to get our prior decks, the Sidequest Decks and the NPC Decks are all available in our store now.\nPledging\nWhile we've set up rewards for one deck (or PDF), four decks, 10 decks, and 15 decks, you can pick any number of decks by adding more via add-ons.  For example, if you want 6 decks, pledge for four, then as you make your pledge you'll be asked if you want any add-ons.  Pick two more.  You'll also be able to add more via the pledge manager later but pledging during the Kickstarter helps us hit our goal & stretch goals. You'll pick which specific decks you want via the pledge manager.\nShipping\nWe're working with a company that has fulfillment centers located in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia to minimize shipping fees for most backers.\nWe'll charge for shipping through the Pledge Manager which allows us to have more detail on the shipping rates.  After some recent kerfuffles with international shipping, we've decided to partner with another company to do fulfillment in order to make sure we have friendly shipping rates for the EU, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and of course the USA.  While we'll ship elsewhere, postage rates to other locations may be high. Here are our ballpark shipping rates, which do include VAT (money amounts in US dollars) where applicable:\nUSA: Flat $6 (any number of decks)\nUK: 1 deck $13, 4 decks $17, 10 decks: $29, 15 decks: $35\nEU: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $22, 10 decks: $34, 15 decks: $40\nCanada: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $19, 10 decks: $30, 15 decks: $35\nAustralia: Flat $20, due to their low VAT and shipping.\nNew Zealand: 1 deck $25, 4 decks $30, 10 decks: $40, 15 decks: $50\nOf course, if rates go up, VAT changes, etc., we'll have to pass that on.\nCollaborators\nWe're blessed to work with a great team of innovative RPG creators:\nAaron Canton: Aaron is a professional writer who specializes in writing fantasy and science-fiction works, and has created content for a variety of literary universes,  role-playing games, and works of interactive fiction. \nKeith Curtis: Keith has done about half of the Cartography on our prior Sidequest Decks.  He has also done work for many other game companies, including work on the Babylon 5 d20 RPG, the Song of Ice & Fire RPG, and the updated 5e Keep on the Borderlands.\nMisha Handman: Misha is a professional novelist and gaming writer who lives in the  Pacific Northwest. He has contributed to several earlier Sidequest decks, as well as work for White Wolf Publications and UFO Press. He is  proud to be the only person with his name on the Internet.\nJosh Parry: Josh is a freelance TTRPG author who has worked with Nord Games and LoreSmyth as well as his own self-published titles on Itch.io and the DMs Guild. \nAndrew Shields: Andrew has worked on our NPC Decks and our system neutral creature cards.  He has his own publishing imprint called Fictive Fantasies and has worked for a number of other RPG publishers.\nJoe Wetzel: Owner of Inkwell Ideas, Joe will manage the project, write some of the adventures, make some of the maps, and pick up anything else that needs doing.\nAnd we're helped by Backer Kit:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 18th Kickstarter in 10 full years!

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Each turn, players can: \n Collect resources by drawing from the Supply Bag or visiting the Market, \n Build stages of their unique wonder, \nor complete Support structures. \nIn games of 4+ Players,  players may also Trade, negotiating freely with other players to add to the fun as more players compete.\nPowerful Leaders can also step in to provide game-changing effects. \nBut be careful! Building can be treacherous. Support structures can speed up the construction of your wonder, but also require time and resources which are taken away from completing your wonder. The choices are yours!\nLizzie at Long Distance Gamers provided a wonderful Unboxing Video to give you an idea of how the components look (Prototype Copy).\nOne Card Wonder is a fast, simple, and strategic game that packs in some tough decisions about when and what to build as you seek to impress the world with your Wonder!\nCollecting resources is key! But how best to do it?\nYou can Produce resources by drawing randomly from the supply bag. Keep two resources you may need and place the rest into the Market.\nVisit the Market to take all of the resources of one type from the supply.\nOr, in games of 4+ players, you can get the resources you need by trading with others, if they'll consider your negotiations, that is. How persuasive can you be?\nOne Card Wonder is highly repayable! \nEach of the 12 player mats in the game has a unique set of Support buildings. \nBuild a Support building to make completing your Wonder easier and mark your special ability using one of four obelisk player pieces. \nWill the time and resources spent building a Support be worth the time away from completing your wonder or will your fellow builders race ahead?\nOf course, the multiple stages of your Wonder must be built from the ground up, while the Support buildings may be built in any order. Complete all stages of your wonder to win the game and become the envy of the ancient world!\n\nDon't forget about your unique Leader! Leaders provide a major one-time influence on the game that can be strategically deployed to create a beneficial in-game effect. Plan wisely!\nDownload the near-final One Card Wonder rulebook to check it out yourself.\n\nNot convinced? You can play One Card Wonder online with your friends using Tabletopia to feel the intense game play in this fast-paced game that is easy to get to the table.\nOr sit back and watch Matthew and Jon from Friday Knight Games play on Tabletopia with designer Nat Levan.\nThanks to 1 Minute Board Games for her quick tutorial on game play.\nClearly, we love this wondrous game!

But they have trouble printing common interlocking building blocks. PrintABlok was my answer to this problem, creating a building block for 3D printers that would just work.\nAnd PrintABlok is remarkable because it can't be mass produced. it can only be made with 3D printing.

Full of zany, whimsical graphics, it's a perfect companion for people of any age building out their self-care toolkit.\nLoosely inspired by tarot, each number covers a category of self-care activities  - like meditation or boundaries. Each suit is an area of life - such as emotion or passion. You can shuffle the deck to pick one thing to do at random, play out a suit to experience many self-care activities in one area of life, or explore a category of self-care by playing out the four cards in one number. As you play, you'll learn a lot of self-care strategies - and gain an understanding of what works for you when.\nEasy to carry, easy to transport, and easy to use. The options are endless whether alone or with a group of friends.\nDuring the pandemic, we saw friends and loved ones begin to really struggle with their mental health, and they didn't have the resources to take care of themselves. We wanted to make something fun and accessible to help everyone invest in their wellness.\nPLAY\n\nThis deck became a labor of love for both of us - a celebration of our long self-care journeys. We've spent a lot of time in self-help book sections, in therapy, and in group programming. We know that there is no Ted Talk one-size-fits-all solution to wellness, and that self-care requires a broad toolkit of skills. In building out the deck, we tried to bring in a broad range of skills - and consulted with experts to keep the activities evidence-backed.\nWe couldn't be prouder of the result. Full of personal, strange illustrations, we believe each card distills down a core self-care skill to its basics, and that the deck as a whole offers a solid foundation for anyone hoping to invest in their wellness.\nThe Deck of Care is for anyone who is looking for ways to invest in their wellness, or who is trying to find a balance in this hard world. Filled with fun graphics meant to keep self-care light-hearted, this deck is your perfect companion as you experiment in finding what works best for you when it comes to well-being.\nThe deck also makes a great gift for friends and loved ones entering difficult new adventures - like going to college, attending graduate school, starting a new job, or beginning a family. It serves as a physical reminder to always invest in wellness - even when it seems impossible. We've even designed the deck to be child-friendly, so it can be a lifelong aid for a young one in your life who is just starting to build their self-care toolkit.\n\nAlso inspired by tarot, each of the suits represent an area of your life and is represented by an animal that we felt captured its spirit.\nIf a player wants to go on a longer journey of self-care exploration, we recommend working through a whole suit from Ace to King over the course of a month.\n\nEvery card has a custom illustration that matches the self-care activity. From an 80\u2019s muscle head owl to a snorkeling narwhal, they\u2019re meant to be light-hearted, slightly absurd, and comedic relief for you as you navigate the new ritual of being good to yourself. Our hope? That the unique visuals bring a smile to your face.\n\n\nWe\u2019re prioritizing functionality and beauty over cost efficiency on our production. We are printing on casino-grade German Blue Core paper with a smooth linen-finish. The cardboard tuckbox is printed on colored cardboard and will print with embossing.\n\n$50,000 - We will create a set of training videos to accompany the deck\n\nIf we hit our first stretch goal, we will announce a second. We are reviewing special touches we could apply to printing and limited editions.\n\n\nExhausted Millennial is a creative collaborative between two old friends - Devin and Christin. We met at Drexel University when we were Resident Assistants together, and continued a best-trash-human friendship into our 30s.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, we started a letter-writing project in which we wrote one card a day to a loved one. We worked together to make a set of greeting cards for the project and enjoyed it so much that we just kept making things together. Our brand aims to make things that make existing in this tough world a bit easier - while not taking ourselves too seriously. More than that, we hope to have fun every step of the way.\n\nThose initial cards are available for free for personal use on our site.\nWe are hoping to use the funding from this Kickstarter to launch an e-commerce store with our designs.  We have a long list of projects we want to work on next, and hope this is just the start of a long journey for our little venture.\n\nYou can find out more about Exhausted Millennial on our website or social media, and get a preview of all 54 cards as we roll them out over the next two months:\nFacebook \nInstagram \nPinterest \nTwitter \nOur Site", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so we anticipate we may hit hiccups and have tried to compensate for that with extra work on the front end. We have done extensive research to source a few high quality manufacturers and to print samples. This has allowed us to test functionality and print quality of the cards. We just need to know what the demand looks like and help to fund the mass production. We are confident in the quality of our design and production choices - but, as can happen in any supply chain, something could go wrong during production that delays our timeline.\n\nWe anticipate that our greatest hurdle will be shipping out the decks, especially if sell a very large volume. We are actively researching logistic centers to explore our fulfillment options, and will begin contracting the relationship once we have a concrete idea of our print volume. Establishing that relationship may cause delays in shipping.\n\nTracked shipping will be available by default for domestic (US) purchases, but may not be available in all international markets.

Her promising young assistant Miriam Mayne has accidentally transferred her consciousness to Saturn, where she falls under the enchantment of an evil sorcerer! Jack Paladin, her love, sets out after her on a thrilling celestial journey to the ringed planet! Swashbuckling adventure and high romance await in Julian Hawthorne\u2019s The Cosmic Courtship!\nA Lost Pulp Adventure Restored!\nWhile most are at least somewhat familiar with Nathaniel Hawthorne as one of the great American authors, less well known is that his son,  Julian Hawthorne, was an incredibly prolific writer in his own right. Julian wrote on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from literary analysis of his father's works to poetry to period romances and adventures. Late in his career, Julian even dabbled in the emerging genre of Science Fiction [Hugo Gernsback had only recently coined the awkward term \"Scientifiction\" when this story was first published.]\nThe Cosmic Courtship was serialized in Frank A. Munsey's All-Story Weekly across four issues, beginning with the November 24, 1917 issue and running through the December 15, 1917 issue. While this story has been in the public domain for some time, it has never been collected or published elsewhere until now.\nCirsova Publishing has partnered with Michael Tierney and Robert Allen Lupton to preserve this story for posterity and ensure that it is not lost to future generations.\nThe Cosmic Courtship was serialized across four issues of All-Story Weekly\n\nGoals of this Project\nThe foremost goal of this project is to get an exciting, essentially lost, classic pulp story back into print and into the hands of scifi fans, pulp aficionados, and readers in general!\nWhat do we mean by \"essentially lost\"? While The Cosmic Courtship is a work in the Public Domain and part of the world's common literary heritage, there's virtually no way for anyone to read it! It has only ever been printed in now very expensive and hard to find pulp magazines. Even if cost were not an object, availability often is. \nThis is the case for many novels and novellas from the early pulp era. Julian Hawthorne's The Cosmic Courtship is only one example.\nThe main issues with a project like this are the investment of time and the risk to (often nigh-irreplaceable) physical materials required to reproduce the texts.\nIt is important that the team be compensated for their time and work that they put into making these texts available. \nPhysical Reproductions of the Work\nThe initial goal for this project is to bring The Cosmic Courtship back into print. People who want to read this work will be able to read this novel without having to invest hundreds of dollars into 100+ year old pulp magazines as they infrequently appear on the open collector market. \nAll backers will be credited in an appendix for helping bring this to fruition.\nWe are offering both paperback and hardback formats, as well as a novelty magazine format [similar to Cirsova Magazine] and a no-frills pocket paperback edition. \nWant to spread the love? Be a super backer and donate a classroom set to your favorite teacher or librarian! Help get this work into people's hands!\nThe Cosmic Courtship cover artwork by Fred W. Small, digitally restored by Michael Tierney.\n$3,000 - Bonus Materials\nNot only will we be including the original text of Julian Hawthorne's The Cosmic Courtship, we will including some additional biographical materials and other works by Julian Hawthorne, including a facsimile version of \"Scenes of Hawthorne's Romances,\" an essay on his father's writings, featuring the text as it was originally presented with numerous illustrated plates. \n$8,000 - Digital Copies + Donation of a Public Domain Copy\nAs mentioned, there is a lot of labor, risk, and costs involved in salvaging these texts--we want to ensure that the team working on this project are compensated: if it is worth everyone's while, this will be the first of many.\nThe ultimate goal of a project like this is to make these available to the world because they are part of our literary heritage and everyone should be able to discover and analyze these works to better understand the patchwork history of this fascinating era of fiction.\nIf we raise $8,000, not only will we provide all backers with digital copies of the volume we are creating, we will create and donate a digital text version of the original story to Project Gutenberg. \nThese will be made available after backers have been sent their physical copies.\nPlease consider donating to sponsor this project, or order multiple copies, so we can reach this goal!\n$10,000 - Ongoing Imprint\nMichael Tierney has an impressive pulp library, filled with innumerable stories that are public domain but have never been in print since the early 20th Century. If we raise $10,000, that will show us that there is sufficient interest and support to turn this into an ongoing project where we work with pulp archivists to \"rescue\" these nearly lost works and make them available both in print and for the general public domain so that they can be preserved and enjoyed by future generations!\n$15,000 - Original Images Available\nMichael has agreed to release the images we used of the four issues of All-Story to compile this edition. Michael will host these these images, nearly 100 pages of pulp, on his website.\n$20,000 - ?????\nWhat will we do for $20,000? I don't know yet, but we'll have to think of something fast, since it looks like it's in the realm of possibility!\nAbout the Team\nMichael Tierney is a pulp historian and archivist who has written extensively on Edgar Rice Burroughs, having created the massive four volume Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 Year Art Chronology, and is currently working on another Art Chronology about Robert E. Howard. He has been involved in the comic book industry for 40 years, owning two of the oldest comic book stores in Central Arkansas until switching to mail-order only in 2020. He is also an accomplished science fiction writer and artist, having worked on his Wild Stars saga since the 1970s. Michael not only made his pulp library available for this project, he provided the photographic images of these rare magazines so that a manuscript could be produced. He has also lent his years of experience digitally restoring damaged pulp art to restore the original cover by  Fred W. Small to create a unique cover for this edition.\nRobert Allen Lupton is a prolific author, pulp historian, and commercial hot air balloon pilot. He has published nearly 200 short stories across numerous anthologies, including the New York Times Best Selling Chicken Soup For the Soul series, and has published several anthologies and novels. His most recent novel, \"Dejanna of the Double Star\" was published in December 2020. Robert has been an active Edgar Rice Burroughs historian, researcher, and writer since the 1970s, including at ERBzine, where several of his articles and stories are published. Robert has painstakingly recreated the text as it was originally published from the digital images provided from Michael's collection.\nCirsova Publishing has been publishing thrilling adventure science fiction and fantasy since 2016. They have published nearly 20 issues of their flagship publication, Cirsova Magazine. Additionally, they have published a number of anthologies, a fully illustrated edition of Leigh Brackett's Planet Stories-era Stark adventures, Jim Breyfogle's Mongoose and Meerkat, and the 35th Anniversary Editions of Michael Tierney's Wild Stars.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the work on this project is done. We're in the process of cleaning up the text, checking it against the scans to ensure that it accurately reflects Hawthorne's story as it was published [while we have corrected a few obvious typos in the original text, we have retained everything else as is to preserve the nuances of Hawthorne's writing].\n\nThe largest task will be fulfillment.

Developed in close association with Adams\u2019s family and literary estate, 42 will be a full-colour, large-format hardback that follows his career from early collaborations with Graham Chapman to his work on Doctor Who, through the Hitchhiker years, Dirk Gently, his groundbreaking non-fiction book Last Chance to See and his later digital work. Alongside this are details of projects that never came to fruition like a proposed theme park ride and a TV series provisionally entitled The Secret Empire. \nAll backers (except for those at the digital poster level) will get their name printed in a special list of supporters at the back of the book.\nJUST IMAGINE\n'I think Douglas was something that we don\u2019t have a word for yet \u2013 a futurologist or an explainer. One day we will realise that the most important job out there is someone that can explain the world to itself in ways the world won\u2019t forget.' Neil Gaiman\nAs Adams's fans know, he was as much a thinker as he was a writer and one of the reasons for creating this book is to properly explore this aspect of his life. The combination of his deep fascination with technology and his unique imagination meant that he had an uncanny knack for predicting the future direction of the digital world. As far back as 1995, he suggested that computers needed to stop being giant hulks of metal and disappear into the things around us to make them smarter. He also had an extraordinary ability to tackle complicated ideas and explain them in entertaining and memorable ways.\nThe following is from one of the speeches he gave later in his life. Bear in mind that when he wrote this, the iPhone, the Kindle, Twitter, Facebook and many other things we take for granted didn't exist.\n'Imagine if every piece of information we ever generated about the world that passed through a computer, whether it's... \na restaurant typing up its menu for the evening, whether it's \na shop maintaining its stock list,  whether it's\n a car noticing what speed it's going, how much petrol it's got left and where the nearest service stations are, and what prices they are charging, whether it's \nsomeone measuring the wingspan of an African swallow, whether it's \nsomeone writing down where and when their grandmother was born, whether it's someone taking a digital photo from the top of the Great Pyramid, \nor just of a flower that has bloomed early this year, \nOr late, or the settings on your thermostat when it's turned on or off,\nOr if every time you took your child's temperature the network remembered.\nImagine all of that gradually creating a shared software model of the world. Just imagine.'\nLetters to Douglas\nThe book will be published in 2022, the year that Adams would have turned 70 years old. A number of his friends and fans are contributing letters to Douglas written for this occasion that will appear in the book. They include Sanjeev Bhaskar, Gary Brooker, Margo Buchanan, Prof Brian Cox and Robin Ince (the Infinite Monkey Cage), Mark Carwardine, Arvind Ethan David, Sue Freestone, Stephen Fry, Neil Gaiman, Simon Jones, John Lloyd, Michael Nesmith, Dirk Maggs, Caitlin Moran and Robbie Stamp.\nThe Book\nThe book will be edited by Kevin Jon Davies, who first met Adams in 1978, knew him for 20 years, and has subsequently worked on a number of Hitchhiker-related projects. \nIt will be 320 pages long and A4 format (210mm by 297mm). For the standard hardback edition the cover will be printed directly onto the cover boards. The collector's edition features an additional wraparound French fold dust jacket printed on both sides that folds out into a poster.\n\nA Note from the Family: \n\"What Douglas loved more than a good idea was sharing a good idea, and whether it was the 1st or 100th time you had heard it, his obvious delight never diminished. It's a pleasure to share that delight with you in this book. We hope you enjoy it.\" \n\n The Rewards\nAbout Kevin Jon Davies . . .   \nKevin with Douglas in the Hitchhikers's studio 1980\nKevin Jon Davies grew up enthralled with Doctor Who and The Goon Show. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide radio series in 1978 combined the best of both, so the young art student sought out its little-known author Douglas Adams, recording an early fanzine interview. Following a career in film and tv, he went on to direct The Making of Hitchhiker, the 1993 documentary for BBC Video. Adams then invited Davies to art-direct The Illustrated Hitchhiker, a large-format book with pioneering digital composites. Since then he has contributed to a number of Adams-related projects, including as researcher into Adams\u2019 archives for The Hexagonal Phase (2018); the final radio series of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nAbout Unbound:\nHi, we're Unbound, the crowdfunding publisher.\nWe bring writers and readers closer together.

And, well, it is. Especially since the Crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space Beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.\nShould you achieve your objective and mine enough Crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jetpack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the Beast.\nIn the event that the Bacteria present in the Beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not despair. Your non-organic parts will certainly be useful in the mining exploits of future Miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of less-than-qualified recruits from past attempts.\nFinally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary Crystals by the time you reach the end of your adventure, without the Beast having digested you.\nIn this case, you will then exit the Beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive... and yet forever changed. In this case we will have to evaluate your performance against that of the Beast\u2019s efforts to consume you.\nIn So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast will face off against one another. \nThe Miner earns points by collecting Crystals and the Beast earns points by developing Immune Responses and by its Bacteria attacking the Miner.\nThe game ends in a win for the Miner if they collect all 8 different Crystals, and the Beast wins by digesting the Miner after four Bacteria of the same type have attacked.\nOf course, there\u2019s always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast\u2019s system, and then the player with the most points wins!\n So, You\u2019ve Been Eaten. can be played as:\nA game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.\nA game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a Hibernating Beast.\nA game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.\nA game for 0 players, with a Hibernating Beast against a robot Miner.\n\nWant the all-in-fire-and-forget pledge?\nThe hyper-high-end one with triple-layered(!) boards?\nThe lovingly deluxified KS-limited objet d'art for your shelf?\nThe one with the bursting-with-bits-even-though-it's-even-bigger-box?\nChoose the Collector Edition pledge level, and rejoice!\nAnd if you have not yet decided to back now, here's why you should:\n- Discounted shipping! Post-campaign shipping costs will be higher.\n- Guaranteed availability of the Collector edition! Due to its bigger, special box, we will likely not be producing this as easily as the retail edition, and due to its heavier weight, this is not going to be easy to ship when not doing mass KS fulfillment.\n- Loyalty discount! Get $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign backed - see below for more details.\n- Don't miss a game full of unconventional asymmetric gameplay by Scott Almes & striking art by Kwanchai Moriya!\nPremium Edition - savings\nThe custom-shaped double-printed acrylic Crystal tokens and the printed wooden Bacteria tokens are going to be available as a $9 add-on, and the Dyspepto-Beastmol mini-expansion will be available as a $5 add-on. By backing the Premium edition, you would get a $4 discount, and also receive the custom-cut Replication token (the \"Miner meeple\"), which we do not expect to later sell separately.\n\nCollector Edition - LudiCreations Loyalty Discount\nBackers of the Collector Edition will receive a discount of $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign they have backed in the past, up to a maximum of $5 off. This will be applied in Backerkit and can be used for reducing the cost of shipping and add-ons. For more information, please see the FAQs.\n\nTuckboxes - Sleeves?\nYes, they fit. We tested with premium sleeves.\nRemember kids, always use protection!\nSo, You've Been Eaten. is an asymmetric game. Players must balance short-term benefit against trying to gain an advantage for the next turns. Many times they will need to simply survive the turn. To win, they need to make clever plays and try to corner their opponent into having to make increasingly difficult choices.\nThe Miner is playing a dice manipulation & placement game to try to eliminate Bacteria and capture Crystals (and Tools) that are present on a row of cards between them and the Beast player.\nThe Beast is playing a hand management and drafting game, to try to position their Bacteria to attack the Miner, and acquire Immune Response cards that can make the Miner player's life difficult.\nThe 2p game\nThe Miner begins, and rolls their dice. They then take an action with each one of those dice, removing Stomach cards from the digestive tract between the players, and at the end of their turn, whatever Bacteria is closest to them attacks!\nThe Beast then strategically refills the tract to cause the Miner the most difficulty, then may develop an Immune Response, refills their hand, and plays a Mutation card against the Miner, trying to match the Bacteria on it with the one that might attack the Miner at the end of their turn!\nIf the Miner collects 8 Crystals, they win outright. If one of the Beast's Bacteria tracks reaches the 4th level, the Beast wins immediately. If the deck of Stomach card runs out, points are counted, and whoever player has the most is the winner!\n\nThe 1p game\nSo, You've Been eaten. can be played as a solo game, either as the Miner (against a Hibernating Beast), or as the Beast (against a Robot Miner).\nAll actions remain the same. What changes is how their effects are triggered.\n\nThe 0p game\nNope, 0 players does not mean that the game will set up and play itself. And no, it probably does not count as a play if you decide to not play it. Yes, it does seem to fit the times we are now living in.\nHowever you look at it, having the two AIs play each other is possible, and a conversation starter for the non-board-game-geeks wandering near your shelf.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten. here.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten.: Dyspepto-Beastmol here.\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

The final produced game may vary in minor ways, e.g. in the tint of some colors, the dimensions of some components, etc.\n\n Featuring:\nSpecial Guest Star:\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, the ones for the EU, from Germany, the ones for the UK from the UK, and the ones for Canada from Canada.\nBackers in the EU, UK, USA and Canada do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nRewards going to Asia/Pacific/South Africa/Middle East will be fulfilled by VFI Asia.\nNote that we can not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nBackerkit carts will be locked and credit cards will be charged shortly before fulfillment commences. There will be backer updates that inform about all deadlines.\n\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for backers who pledge during the campaign being live. Post-campaign pre-order will likely be paying higher fees.\nShipping fees include costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nThe shipping costs per copy are as follows, and include tracking:\nBasic edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nPremium edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nCollector edition: USA - $9 / EU - $14 / Everywhere else - $19\nUnfortunately backers in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Canada do not fall in the EU and USA cost categories.\nThe USA cost category includes the \"lower 48\" states, and does not include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam & Puerto Rico. For these and for any other outlying territories, the \"everywhere else\" category applies. Please ask if in doubt.\nBackers (even $1 backers completing their pledge in Backerkit) will get the game with the discounted shipping costs outlined here. The cost will likely increase for post-campaign pre-orders. \nThe real costs that we have to pay are at least $12 for the USA, and $15 in the EU and worldwide - and that is not counting ocean freight and customs costs for us.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFulfillment providers worldwide are reporting that significant disruptions in deliveries persist in parts of the world. In practical terms this means that shipments to individual countries may be subject to delays.\nWe have taken what we now (March 2021) know into account when determining our production, logistics and fulfillment plans. However, it may happen that we may deviate from the schedule, and as noted in the Risks section, other backers may receive their rewards a lot earlier than you.\nWhen we have specific new information, we will reach out to backers, either via a backer update or individually, as the situation develops. In any case, please be prepared for delays, both in freight (before your reward is shipped), and after individual fulfillment has commenced. \n Retailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/so-youve-been-eaten/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available to retailers who have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. All entities and locations will be verified.\nRetailers within North America may also order from our distribution service provider Hit Point Sales, if signed up with an account. This would likely result in lower shipping costs (e.g. if ordering other games at the same time).\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\n\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\n\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order any editions normally available only on Kickstarter, subject to availability.\n\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: The game will be available through retailers that back the campaign and want the Collector edition. We hope to eventually send a version of the game to distribution.\nGame design: Scott Almes\nIllustration: Kwanchai Moriya\nGraphic design: Viktor Csete\nProject management: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou\nRulebook editing: Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan\nSpecial thanks: Alvin Chen, David Turczi, Philipp K\u00fchnl, Paulo Renato, Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen, Angela Viveen, Adam Singer, David \"Dam\" Amorin Garc\u00eda, and all those brave space miners who helped us develop this completely fictional game that is definitely not from a dystopian future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns have been fulfilled, except \"Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden returns!\". Its production is initiated, and the project is on track to be completed on time. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We are working with retailers and due to that and the realities of international logistics, it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as \"real\" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box. \nThe game will be fully translated in English and French!

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode.

It is the world's first one-piece miniature electric hand drill for creative DIY, and it features super lightweight, ultra-quietness and great portability.\nFinish your DIY projects with the right tool kit is important. WOWSTICK hand drill helps drill small holes of various things: resin, plastic, wood cardboard, paper cardboard, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil, etc. Aiming at its practicality and simplicity, WOWSTICK is the cordless lithium-ion battery powered drill which is crated just like a pen, an ideal tool for DIY-ers as well as general people.\nNo more clunky gadgets, wires, and plug-points. WOWSTICK one-piece miniature hand drill with its dispatchable head lets you accomplish your creation by gripping up, aiming at the point, and pressing one single button.  \nThe WOWSTICK drill is small and light, just 1.6oz (46g) which fits right in your hand and literally easy to carry anywhere, so you can take it to distant workplaces. Sized at 6.8\u201d*0.6\u201d (172*13.8mm), you can grip it like a pen for ultimate control and precision as well as for comfort.\nIt is not only a great tool for DIY projects, but also a hassle-free decoration to put in your pocket or on any desktop.\nEvery bit of WOWSTICK from outside to inside (Except the button and the charging port) is all metal CNC machined to ensure the seamless curves and consistent product quality. Greatly standing out from the conventional drills in the market, this manner is more precisely made to achieve more stable product performance. Our drilling spindle run-out is far exceeding the industry standard to be less than 0.1mm, resulting in high-precision drilling at the right position every time.\nThe WOWSTICK kit has 8 drill bits made of harden steel: 0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and it allows drilling at 420r/min \u00b1 10%, so you can use it in many projects and get accurate results.\nThe handheld device is practically designed to cater for different needs, letting you plug in and off bits based on your projects, and the fact that the bits are fully compatible with 2.35 mm diameter bits accessible in the market, you may drill, decorate and attach your crafts freely.\nThe bits can be used on a variety of materials: resin, plastic, wood, clay, bead, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil and more, very practical items in daily life.\nThe WOWSTICK hand drill is ideal DIY workers like in the drilling industry and general people. It will be a good addition to your artisan inventory. It particularly suits those who perform intricate decorations. You can use the mini drill for making holes, for crafts and more applications.\nUse Tips:\nIt is suggested to take in and out alternatively when drilling, so that the residue can be brought out without getting stuck.\nYou may test it on the spare material before use. When there is no issue, you may start drilling holes in your crafts.\nOn harder metal materials,  it is suggested to start with a smaller bit and then shift to a bigger one when it is aiming at a large hole.\nThe smaller the drill bit is, the more attention should be paid. Due to its small size, it is easy to break off when used improperly. \nNote: Be careful of the operation when you are using a finer drill bit since it is easier to break off. You may perform intricate drilling of valuable materials with its unique low speed optimization.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is more than easy to operate. With just one button built at the position of your thumb when you are holding it, you may just start working with a press on the button. When a pause is needed, you may release the button. \nTo replace the bit is also a breeze based on our particularly designed screwless locking mechanism. It is fairly intuitive and no extra tool is needed. Just gently rotate the chuck out, take out the drill bit, put in a new bit, and then secure it. The process can be accomplished within 10 seconds.\nAfter finishing the works, you may put on the drill cap to avoid accidents caused by unintentional pressing of the button. So it is a hassle-free device.\nThe drill has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the distance between the wall plug and workbench or troubles caused when you forget to unplug the power cord. It provides a safe, effective, clean energy, less stressful operation option. It is cordless, tailored pen-shaped designed and operates at 3.7 volts, 1.036Wh. That said, it can be used for at least one month in regular use at its full charge.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is rechargeable via USB type C charging cable. Full charging time is about 40 minutes and can be used about 2 hours.\nWOWSTICK is the sturdy, high quality handheld tool for DIY projects. The whole body is aluminum alloy one-piece molding, giving the most simplified look, comfortable grip and sturdy and durable in use.\nThe motor of the mini drill has also been heat-treated for endurance, so it can continue to work without getting heated for a long time. You will never complain about its quality build.\nWOWSTICK designers have been digging out the maximum abilities of the pen shape. From installations to actual working, creators always like to use the device instantly from idea to prototype and thus may get inspirations at the fingertips.\nIt comes with an improved ergonomic design to ensure comfortable grip in any situation. Using the aluminum alloy shell, it is ultra-compact and light, slim and very easy to handle for detailed projects. Holding it like a pen, its slim grip makes great sense in detailed works. As a result, no matter walnut or resin, you may just focus on the fun of making things.\nGo experiment with the WOWSTICK\u2019s easy drilling. Go ahead and grab your creativity now!\nThe Imezing team consists of a group of designers, engineers and seekers of quality life. Back to simplicity and convenience are our core concept.

Our co-founders, Joanna and Rivelle met while in graduate school at New York University (NYU) pursuing degrees in educational technology design and games research. \nJOANNA is a D&D enthusiast, a self-taught coder, and an emerging technology specialist. She has previously worked at the American Museum of Natural History on the Virtual Reality T-Rex exhibition and its Augmented Reality application. Before emerging tech, Joanna also worked in theatre education and various non-profit organizations for youth empowerment.\n\n\u201cI was always an introverted girl with lots of imagination. I spent lots of days in my childhood alone as my family moved quite frequently. I filled my hours with rich stories, often acting out in different voices when no one was listening. I became a warrior, a hero, a descent of mythical, powerful creatures. In my stories, I had allies, enemies, and crazy plot twists. I always felt a powerful energy deep in my heart that was waiting to be let out. As I grew up, I turned to other forms of artistic expression, but it was never quite enough. As I grew up, I turned to other forms of artistic expression, but it was never quite enough.15 years later, when I was first introduced to a game called Dungeons and Dragons, I watched as everything in my world clicked. I was me again.\u201d\n\nRIVELLE was reintroduced to the land of fantasy by Joanna and joined Cartographr in Spring 2020. She is currently doing her thesis exploring roleplay and character embodiment in fantasy games and hopes to connect this to future Cartographr add-ons. Rivelle has a rich background in Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (UXD), which gives her the power to bridge imagined possibilities and the constrained reality. She thrives to express the right narrative through design, designing new technology that is both easy to use and intuitive because of her keen ability to empathize with users.\n\"Since I was little, I have always been drawn to the magic of stories and the art of storytelling. I dreamed of being a writer who communicates with such vivid depth and emotion that a reader would be helpless but to succumb to its pull. The best stories allowed me to connect with another path, encouraging exploration and the pursuit of knowledge in ways that the traditional world, or my reality, limited. Stories are a way to journey through another land, one filled with creativity, my lifeblood. As I grew, I went from expressing this as the art of language to the innovation of technology and design.\"\n\nFollow us on: \nInstagram: @cartographr_ar\nTwitter: @cartographr_ar\nJoin Our Discord", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is happening, the only factor is the potential delay of the launch date.

With area control, multiple scoring opportunities, combo driven actions, and a pinch of deck building, Dirge: The Rust Wars fits a whole lot of game in a small package with a 30 minute play time.\nDirge: The Rust Wars was strikingly Illustrated by Aaron Nakahara and Liz Lahner, designed by John Clowdus, and published by Small Box Games.\nYou should probably  check out the FAQs at some point, especially if you're not familiar with  Small Box Games and/or you're an international backer! \nThis is a short, 10 day project with clear goals and an achievable funding goal.  By backing this project, you'll receive either a physical and/or print and play Kickstarter copy of Dirge: The Rust Wars.\nAll cards are 310 GSM Black Core Linen Finish.\n\nShipping Costs for physical Rewards are as follows:\nDomestic $4 \nCanada & Mexico $14\nEuropean Union $15\nUnited Kingdom $16 \nRest of the World $18 \nYeah, I know, international shipping sucks.  I wish it didn't.  Please check the FAQ for more information. \nIn Dirge: The Rust Wars, each player will create a Warband consisting of two unique Units (there are nine unique Units, across three different Unit Types: Infantry, Cavalry, and Engines).  When a player chooses a Unit for their Warband, they get the Unit, the Unit's Stat card (which shows the Unit's Move, Attack, and Wounds, as well as a the Unit's Skill) and the Unit's two Ability cards.  These Ability cards are added to the player's starting deck (each player has a starting deck of five Ability cards).\nIn Dirge: The Rust Wars, the Turn Sequence and Action Cards drive the gameplay. The Active player with the Turn Sequence card chooses a face up Action and takes a turn by completing the top half, while the other player takes a turn completing the bottom half. Then, the Turn Sequence card is passed to the other player. When there are no face up Actions remaining, the Turn Sequence card is flipped and the round ends.\nPlayers move and attack with their Units, play powerful Ability cards, and gain control of Locations across several rounds of gameplay to score points.  At the end of a Round, if either player has scored 12 or more Victory Points, the game ends with the player with the most Victory Points winning.\nUnits move orthogonally on a 4x4 board comprised of 9 Location cards. Units can attack other adjacent Units to cause damage. When a Unit takes more Damage than it has Wounds, it is Destroyed. Destroyed Units can be Respawned at full wounds at any of the 4 corners.\nPlayers score Victory Points four different ways: 1 Victory Point for destroying an opposing Unit, 1 Victory Point for playing two or more cards during their turn, 1 Victory Point if both of their Units are on the board at the end of the round, and at the end of the round, the player controlling the most Sawgrass Sea Locations gains 1 Victory Point.\nYou can view the full rules here. \nBoard Game Barrage talk about Dirge: The Rust Wars in their latest podcast.  You should check it out!\nThere are no Stretch Goals in this project.  Everything for Dirge: The Rust Wars has been unlocked on the front end of the project, and the copy of the game you'll receive by backing this project will contain upgraded and additional items+ that will not be included in future (if any) non-Kickstarter printings of the game.*\nTwo Piece Black and Gold Foil Stamped Box (big enough for sleeves)\nPrinted 12 page rule book\n6 Plastic Slide Trackers\n*These will be limited to the Kickstarter print run, which will be a print run equal to the number of backers for a physical copy of the game, plus a +/- 10% overage.\n+Future non-Kickstarter printings of Dirge: The Rust Wars will not contain the above listed items, and will come in a tuck box.\nWhether you\u2019ve been around since 2007, or you\u2019re just now finding out about Small Box Games, thank you for taking the time to check out this project!\nSmall Box Games is a one man show that I started in 2007 with a pretty simple vision: make small, unique, domestically manufactured card  games in small print runs.  Over the past 14 years, I\u2019ve managed to  stay pretty true to that vision with Small Box Games.  While I stepped away from Small Box Games in 2017, I have been publishing my designs again as Small Box Games since 2019, and it feels great to be back doing what I love!\nThe games I design and publish, including Dirge: The Rust Wars, are hardly, if ever, available in retail (online or otherwise).

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", \"Herbaceous Sprouts\", \"Heroes Welcome, \"Skulk Hollow,\" \"The One Hundred Torii,\" and \"The Whatnot Cabinet\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is shipping to backers in April. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"Floriferous\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, and shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

We all look forward to the beautiful summer months when we can relieve the intense work pace and pandemic exhaustion. With SADE, your summer months will now be more beautiful! Enjoy a few lazy days at the beach with SADE, or maybe a family picnic at your family's favorite park. While COVID-19 has ruined travel plans for some of us, we still have a chance to take a trip to the mountains or the seaside. It is a time of lazy days to relax around the pool, take shore excursions, and vacation on sunny beaches. So, whether your vacation destination is a secluded beach in the Maldives or just your neighborhood pool, make sure you have all the essentials in your beach bag: Sunscreen, sunglasses, maybe the latest paperback novel, and of course, your soft and luxurious beach towel SADE. So let's talk about the numerous advantages of traveling with SADE in summer.\nSADE is very strong, but extra thin. This allows SADE to dry much faster than other towels. This means that there will not be a bad musty smell like regular towels. They are also extra light. This is just one of the many advantages SADE has over other towels, especially when traveling. Another advantage is that it helps to minimize the weight of your luggage! After all, who wants to carry big and thick towels in their suitcase? And when you get to your destination, they are easy to store as they take up very little space.\nSADE is woven from super long fiber, high-quality Turkish cotton (the best quality cotton grown in the world). It will not come off rough or frayed edges after a few uses. It will not wear out in any way with successive washes and drying, it will actually become softer and fluffy.In addition, you will be amazed by its super absorbency despite its lightness and thinness. This means that SADE will dry quickly in the dryer and will not eventually get the annoying musty smell that most regular cotton towels get. It will stay fresh and comfortable for years.\nAnother good thing about SADE is its versatility. Do you need a beach towel? Put one in a beach bag! Also, they are easy to carry, although they are large enough to give you good protection at the beach. In fact, you can take two SADE to the beach - slide one as a pillow behind your head and the other lying on top of the other, and look at the ocean you love on your romantic getaway! If you're going somewhere where the nights are cold, SADE is perfect as a scarf or even a shawl! It can be used for more than just beach or pool towels. Its many uses include bath towels, beach blankets, travel blankets, camping towels, yoga mats, or even a bathrobe. And you will find that SADE is soft enough to wrap your baby after bathing.\nSADE is made from Turkish Cotton - and Turkish Cotton is indeed some of the most versatile ingredients in the world. This type of cotton has much longer fibers than other types of cotton. In a towel, the rule of thumb is that the longer the fibers, the softer they are. Therefore, SADE is much smoother than its voluminous cotton competitors. And because of its super thinness, it dries very quickly, unlike the volume of a terry cloth towel! Moreover, Turkish Cotton, unlike the series production of cloth and towels that are prone to making machine, hand weaving looms generally serves in Turkey.\nThis special care ensures that Turkish cotton is of much better quality than terry cloth. We can also add that Turkish Cotton is incredibly durable, which means you can enjoy your new SADE for a very long time! And another advantage is that this gorgeous Turkish Cotton SADE makes it much softer than regular cotton towels! And the more you wash them, the softer you will see they are! This is different from other cotton towels that start to crumble and become brittle as you wash them.\nFor some people, it seems surprising that SADE is so absorbent because the material looks incredibly thin. However, it is a known fact that they absorb water better than your average terry cloth. Their secret lies in the longer cotton fibers we described above, they also affect the towel's absorbency! If you hang a SADE to dry, it dries much faster than terry cloth.Therefore, there is less time for bacteria - even mold - to settle!\nSADE's size is perfect! Because it is much thinner, unlike bulkier cotton towels, it fits more easily anywhere, whether it is a bath or a beach bag. However, it is larger than a normal-sized towel and is fully usable as a bath towel.\nThe traditional look of a SADE gives it a classic vibe that makes it stand out everywhere! Besides, SADE can have many interesting uses other than a towel. A scarf, a boat towel, sunbed cover, curtains, a blanket for new babies, and even a blanket castle for your kids!\n\n\nSade Towels\nSade Bathrobe\nSade Bathrobe\nStrong hunch, sense of responsibility, easy communication and patience of women are great advantages in the business world. This enables them to be more successful in business life. The reasons for these are not habits acquired overnight. Another reason for women's success in business life is their strong premonition. This feature increases the success graph of women in business life.\nThey can calculate and interpret ideas without seeing the future. Of course, it does not mean that it acts with the desired emotions. Again, based on data about their job, they use their foresight. Women have the ability to do many jobs together. These features also help women to be successful in business life. If you pay attention, while talking on the phone, they can read e-mail, apply nail polish, look at their notes, give instructions to others with a hand-arm sign, and mix food. Such practicality does not exist in most men. The fact that a woman rushes from her job to cook at home and take care of her children and spouses is a proof of her superior skill abilities.\nWomen are more fortunate in communication than men. They communicate more easily, and these features make it easier to overcome difficulties. Overcoming the difficulties increases the success lines. If women love their job, they are patient and resistant to all kinds of difficulties in their work, they do not give up easily, they struggle until they reach their goals. Their self-expression features are high.\nAlthough the inequalities in social, cultural and economic life between men and women in Anatolia are tried to be reduced, we cannot mention that serious progress has been made. When we look at the place of our women in working life, we unfortunately observe that they are far from male employees. Today, while the employment participation rate of men in Anatolia is around 70%, the rate of women is around 30%. This means that most of our women stay out of our working life and away from productivity and stay on the side of consumption.\nSade Towels\nThe reasons that cause this situation are; The fact that women are not welcomed to work, which is a phenomenon caused by a patriarchal social structure, can be listed as the fact that our women living in rural areas cannot be employed in qualified jobs due to the lack of sufficient education.\nWe must accept the fact that women are not only important in family life, but also in our economic life. All women, especially women living in rural areas, should be prevented from dropping out of their education, more vocational training centers should be opened to gain professional skills, and women's entrepreneurship should be opened with trainings that provide technical and vocational skills to our women, apart from the financial dimension.\nWe took a big step in this campaign to include our women in business life. We saved our housewives from their busy housework and included them in collective pieces of training such as design and weaving as a social activity and organized workshops. Our women now have the economic freedom to financially support their families.\nSADE is an enterprise that aims to empower housewives by teaching transferable skills and to ensure dignity and cultural integration in their communities with quality and traditional handicrafts. We are currently empowering many women. With this campaign, we promise a SADE of first class quality with minimalist design. In this way, you will be able to touch the life of a working woman and allow us to hire more women weavers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs all we know, COVID-19 is the one and only ruler of the world.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Since then, the feedback (begging and pleading) has continued, so we were sure to provide LOTS of Dice Jails and Dice Vaults in this campaign. So, what are they? Dice Jails are intended to punish bad dice in style. Dice Vaults are for less naughty dice who need a place to stay for the night... or until their next adventure commences. \n_______________________________________________________________\nEASY TO PRINT!

All Dice towers are designed to work with standard 20mm dice at 100% scale. (*Dice set/tower scales are determined by the size of the D20 in the set.) If you can't print the towers at 100%, then print them at 60% to work with tiny 12mm dice sets (can be found in local game stores or on Amazon.) Teeeny tiny printers such as the Photon and Mars are unlikely to print the majority of dice towers AND work with existing dice. However, Dice Jails and Vaults may work, depending on size and scale. \n (Photo of actual printed objects ^) \nActual Resin print\n_______________________________________________________________\nHave bigger dice? No problem! You can 3D print these files at any scale (*that your printer can support!). Use the dice scaler tab in the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE to determine scale. \n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat printers are supported? All files will be designed to fit within 7\" square print areas (Prusa Mini). Files will be split vertically to fit taller printers.      \nPrinted in Resin (60%)\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a physical product? Although we won\u2019t be selling physical prints through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 15 core products, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We had a plethora of Merchants with our previous campaign, and we expect (hope) we can duplicate the same success here! \n_______________________________________________________________\nWill you be including 6 tray types for towers in this campaign? Sadly, no. Instead of offering 6 simple trays, we wanted to focus on unique designs for each tray for this campaign.  All tower files will come with one removable tray. Our hope is to include spaces to hold dice, but all trays may not have a great spot for dice. Trays will be only one size, one type. In collecting feedback from the previous campaign, we found that the majority of backers were printing the same trays (large.) If we get enough feedback, we may consider an additional tray type (OpenLock perhaps?) but at this moment, one tray is what is being offered in this campaign.\nTrays that are too large for our 7\"x7\"x7\" print minimum will be split into parts using puzzle shapes for easy assembly. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan you teach me how to 3D Print? We have a Fates End Print Support Group on Facebook for all backers with lots of volunteers who can help you get started. Many of our backers from the previous campaign were first time printers, and were able to get up and running with the help of our volunteers. \nWe will send the Facebook Link out to all backers after the campaign funds (usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________\n When will I get the files? \nEach object will take about 1 week to model, print test, repair and deliver. GM screen(s) will take two weeks. Please check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for Release dates.\nThose who back the FatesEnd #1 & #2 or Dual License tiers will receive their FatesEnd #1 files after this campaign funds (*usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________ \n\nQuotes from backers of FatesEnd 1 (previous campaign):     \n_______________________________________________________________\nPrevious Campaign (FatesEnd 1)\nIf you're interested in adding files from the previous FatesEnd campaign (FatesEnd1), but you'd like to see them first, you can find renders, photos and details here. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nImprovements\nWe'll be fulfilling orders from this campaign through Backerkit! We're hoping for a better/clearer process for file access this time around. \n\nSince this is our 2nd campaign, we learned a lot from the previous one. We believe this experience will help us communicate more effectively to help fulfillment run smoothly! \n_______________________________________________________________\n MERCHANTS \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IMPORTANT NOTICE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nNew Merchants: The Merchant license from this campaign does not apply to the previous campaign (FatesEnd1) If you want to sell FatesEnd1 assets, we offer the Dual License for new Merchants.\nMerchants from FatesEnd1: you do not need to purchase a Dual License since you already have a license to sell assets from FatesEnd1 (The first campaign). However, if you wish to sell assets from this campaign (FatesEnd2), you must back the Merchant License tier.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nOur Merchant program in our previous campaign was a huge success! Many Merchants sold so many towers/dice jails from the previous campaign, they were able to expand their print space into a full fledged printer farm! Some Merchants were even able to convert their printing hobby into a full time job from selling FatesEnd merch! To be clear, we can't guarantee the success of every Merchant (that's honestly up to you), but it was fun to see the success of many of our Merchants, especially those who were actively engaged on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: No one is permitted to sell prints form this campaign (FatesEnd2) unless they back the Merchant License tier, or the Dual License Tier from this campaign. Selling/giving away files is strictly prohibited. \n______________________________________________________________\nLicense duration: The license is good for a full 24 months from the date of the last released file. The more stretch goals we unlock, the longer you can sell! \n______________________________________________________________\nMerchant ID. To protect our Merchants and their investment, every Merchant receives a unique Merchant ID. This makes it easy to spot sellers who haven't acquired a Merchant License and put a stop to their piracy (Yarrrrr! Avast ye swabs!)   \n Special note for FatesEnd1 Merchants: for those of you who back the FE2 Merchant tier (this campaign) We'll make sure your IDs have the same number as your FE1 ones.\nRestrictions: You may use FateEnd watermarked renders in your listings, however please don\u2019t use Fates End photos to promote your sales. Please use your own photos when listing for sales (you may use concept art until 1 week after finalized files are delivered.  \nWatermarked Render Example\n ______________________________________________________________\nMerchant-Only FB Support Group\nWe have a Merchant-only Facebook support group where you can all share photos of your prints, ask questions and help support one another. \nIf you want to get a Merchant License, but you're still not sure which tier to back, please check this handy for further clarification:\nDual Licenses are only for new merchants who wish to sell prints from both campaigns.  \nFatesEnd 1 Merchants already have the right to sell files from FatesEnd1. Please do not back the Dual License tier if you already have a Merchant License from the previous campaign. Please back the Merchant License tier.\n\nMerchant Licenses and Dual Licenses from campaign 2 will not be issued until campaign 2 funds (two weeks after the end of the campaign.)\n\nThe new campaign does not limit the Merchant License duration from the previous campaign (FatesEnd 1) in any way.\n\n****SPECIAL FOR ALL Fates End 1 MERCHANTS**** If we get more than 20 Dual-License ($550)backers in this campaign, we will extend ALL MERCHANT LICENCE durations from the FIRST campaign to match the end date of FatesEnd 2 licenses!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign. The first one blasted past all of my expectations. I've learned a lot from the process, and although we had a few hiccups in the beginning, I believe, in the end, that it was a successful campaign. We have an active community of backers who support one another, and to me, that's the biggest success I could have hoped for.\n\nI feel that there is very little risk this time around. I own all the software, hardware and a lot of learnings from the previous campaign. \n\nChallenge 1: Manufacturing/modeling easy to print items\nSolution - Experience! I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill. (Honestly, complex creations that require supports are the BANE of 3D printing! Many swarings have happened in this house due to the struggles of printing items that require complex supports.) I have owned 11+ printers (no kidding!) We currently have 3 Prusa MK3\u2019s, 3 Prusa Minis, an Elegoo Saturn and a Anycubic Mono X.\n\nChallenge 2: Time\nSolution - Self-employed! I have the time planned out to create the remaining files for this campaign. I have the software, hardware, skill and experience, all I need is time. I am self-employed so I have complete control over my time! All I have to do is schedule the time in, and boom - we\u2019re on track!\nBy funding this project, you make it possible for me to focus on this project instead of client work for a time.

Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA: We strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 120 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print. All the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Also great as a travel game to take on holiday or when you're out with friends. It plays in 20-40 minutes for players aged 8+. It's quick to learn but strategic, learn from your enemy and try to get inside their mind to work out what sequence they will lay their cards down.  Artwork by Adrian Stone.\nThis game condenses Operation Market Garden into standard deck of 54 cards, making it highly portable.\nQuick to setup and learn with minimal rules.\nContains historical references so can also be used as a teaching tool.\nFun and accessible to all age groups and non gamers.\nStrategy as well as luck.\nOriginal artwork.\nRecreating the largest airborne invasion in history, Operation Market Garden in World War 2.  Use your battle and tactic cards to out smart your opponent, use your equipment wisely, reveal events and monitor your divisions. Can you win enough battles to secure the vital bridges, will you be able to capture and hold all of them in time? \nEach game will have the following cards.\n3 rule cards (double sided)\n1 Victoria Cross card\n5 Bridge Cards\n7 Allied Battle Cards\n7 German Battle Cards\n3 Allied Equipment Cards\n3 German Equipment Cards\n3 Allied Tactic Cards\n3 German Tactic Cards\n5 Allied Division Cards\n14 Event Cards\nYou can visit my Facebook page Littlebighorngames to view how to play all my games, the link is below.\n https://www.facebook.com/littlebighorngames/videos/?ref=page_internal \nIf you like what you see, please feel free to like the page as well.\nI have also created a youtube video for this game link below\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY2h7Q6TiUI&feature=youtu.be \nOperation Market Garden has also been reviewed by Matt White who has launched several successful Kickstarters.  Please see his link below.\nOperation Market Garden card game Review - YouTube\nI recently did an interview about the game with The Players Aid link below.\n https://theplayersaid.com/2021/01/11/interview-with-thomas-lee-designer-of-operation-market-garden-pocket-card-game-from-little-bighorn-games-coming-to-kickstarter-january-15th/ \nMore artwork is also available to see on the instagram page link below.\n https://www.instagram.com/littlebighorngames/ \n\nThe rules for this particular game are below, they consist of 3 double sided cards.\nRule Card 1 (Double sided)\nRule Card 2 (Double sided)\nRule Card 3 (Double Sided)\nThe aim of the game is to capture all 5 bridges just like in the campaign, these can be laid out on the play area all together in a line and revealed as each bridge is won or just placed individually.\nThe 5 bridge cards and the back of the cards.\nEach player will have 7 battle cards and will use one each battle, whoever has the highest score wins the battle, whoever wins the most battles wins the bridge.  The Allied player must win the bridge to carry on, a draw or loss ends their game. The key of the game is to work out what sequence you opponent will lay their cards down.  What cards have they already used?  What sequence did they use last bridge? Do they have a favorite combination of cards? Can the event card help you get an advantage?\nWhen should you use the Victoria Cross card, use it now or save it for a later battle?\nWhich Division cards have been affected, does the German player favour certain ones?\nCan I make my opponent use their most powerful card on my weakest card?  Should I go on the attack the first few battles or hold back?\nYou can take it in turns to be the Allied player to see who can win the most bridges.\nThe 7 Allied Battle cards and the back of the cards\nThe 7 German Battle Cards and the back of the cards.\nIn addition to their battle cards, each player will have 3 equipment cards, which they can combine with their battle & tactic cards to increase their total points value but use them wisely as they can only be used once a bridge unless stated on an event card or using a Victoria Cross (see later)\nThe 3 Allied and 3 German Equipment cards.\nIn addition to their battle cards, each player will have 3 tactic cards, which they can combine with their battle & equipment cards to affect the outcome of a battle but use them wisely as they can only be used once a bridge unless stated on an event card or using a Victoria Cross (see later)\nThe 3 Allied and 3 German Tactic cards\nThe backs of the Allied & German Equipment & Tactic cards.\nIn addition to Battle, Equipment and Tactic cards there are also event cards which can influence battles.  On the first bridge only the event cards with a 1 in the top right hand corner are used, these generally favour the Allied player and reflect the events in the actual operation.\nThe 7 Event cards to be used on the first bridge plus back of the cards.\nIf the Allied player wins the first bridge on the second bridge an additional 7 event cards are shuffled in to form a new event deck, these generally favour the German player and reflect the events in the actual campaign.\nThe 7 Event cards added to the event deck on the 2nd Bridge.\nIn addition to the cards above the Allied player also has 5 Division cards.  I wanted to reflect the effects on the Divisions and their fighting capabilities as the battle wore on.\nThese start the game on 3 if the German player wins a battle he can choose to change the current event card or reduce one Division card by 1 rotating it accordingly.  Once at zero the effect on the cards kicks in.  These cards are never reset at the start of the next bridge they remain as they are, the more bridges the Allied players wins he will find his tactically and equipment options will reduce.  These cards can be used straight away or added after a few games.\n5 Allied Division cards and the back of the cards.\nIn order to give the Allied player a fighting chance of winning the game or winning a few bridges, I wanted to bring in a final element which again reflecting the actual campaign.  During the battle 5 Victoria Crosses were won for outstanding bravery.  This card can only be used 5 times so use wisely. There are several ways it can be used as below this is also stated on the rules cards.\nChange the current event card at the start of a battle.\nStop the German player reducing a Division card by 1\nAdd 1 point to your total score at the end of the battle once total scores have been revealed.\nGain 1 random tactic card back once all 3 have been used.\nGain 1 random equipment card back once all 3 have been used.\nThe Allied Victoria Cross card.\nThe game comes in a sturdy two piece cardboard box, I could have made this a stretch goal but I wanted to offer this day one to all backers.\nThe two piece box for the game.\nIf you like a game that is quick to setup, learn, play, highly portable, fun, has elements of luck, memory and quick thinking, I believe you will like Operation Market Garden.  Gamers and non gamers will enjoy it.\nHowever if you like more in-depth strategy, rules and a longer game then it may not be for you.\nCopies of my other Kickstarter games will be available during the Kickstarter except Eastern Front which has now sold out, however I still have a few promotional copies of Eastern Front which I will be offering in a free prize draw if certain targets are hit.  My very first game Western Front will also be available.\nLittle Bighorn Games\nHere are a few comments from Boardgamegeek about my games;\n\nEasy to learn, fast paced bluffing game with fantastic artwork! We usually play lomng games (Gloomhaven, Memoir Blackstone Fortress, ...) but when we don't feel like setting one up, we always grab this one or its predecessor Operation Overlord.  Good fun and easy to pack when going on a holiday.\n\nWell balanced, fast, thematic and excellent fun even when you are losing. Mixes a good historical theme with a tense bluffing game that really makes you think how to sequence your card plays.\n\nGot the Kickstarter- played the game quite a few times with other gamers and family. Great fun, plays quick, bluff card tactics work well and great historic theme.  Has a lot of strategy for a simple, easy to explain game. Cards look great and quality product.  Currently one of our favorite go to quick war-game.\n\nVery good fast paced game. Very historical too (and a very strong art direction and illustrations). I strongly recommend it.\n\nGood little filler, like the bluff mechanism not a huge amount of depth to it but definitely what I would classify as good for the pub.\n\nEnjoyed this game much more than I thought. Fun \"guess what your opponent is going to do\" game. This one is similar to Eastern Front (WWII), but deals with Western Front in WWI. For such a small game, does a really good job of simulating the futility of trench warfare and the stalemate that this created. Small size, small table space, and quick game play makes this a perfect game for my collection - travel, high school game club, lunchtime game.\n\nFun little game. My 14 year old son takes great satisfaction in kicking my b**t with this one.\n\nA quality game! Quick to set up and learn, and incredibly fun card game to play. This game is always in our luggage when we go away on holiday. Highly recommended.\n\nI also conceived the game to be a helpful teaching tool, so was absolutely delighted with this feedback.\nHello! I just wanted to send you a message to tell you about my experience with your Western Front game.\nI won it in a raffle at handycon, and it had sat on a shelf for a few months. But recently my autistic nephew (my main gaming partner) has taken a huge and deep interest in world war history, and so I brought it off the shelf to play and it really worked well with him! He loved the attention to details with the cards and he liked the event cards for example the Brits getting support from the USA. Every card we flipped over he would make up a mini story about how the battle progressed with the tanks advancing against the infantry for example.\n  He LOVED when the cards had unique art, for example he got really excited when the Red Baron card was different from the British plane.\n  In closing I just wanted to tell you that it worked really well for him and he is asking to play it over and over (the last game to make him like this was SOS Titanic so you are in good company next to Bruno Cathala!) and since you are a small company I wanted to let you know that you have our support in the future.\n\nI was also lucky enough to get some Pupils at Wycombe Abbey School to play Western Front, their History Teacher Mr N George said;\n\"We love how quick the game is to set up \u2013 you can jump into it in a matter of minutes. The best thing about it is how thematic it is \u2013 everything from the names and artwork on the attack cards to the descriptions on the event cards gives you a really good feel for the period.\nThe event cards are one of our favourite bits, and they teach an important lesson, which is that you can\u2019t plan for every eventuality \u2013 sometimes you have no choice but to use the hand you\u2019ve got as best you can. This is much the same situation as the WW1 commanders faced, so do they deserve the blame they often get?\nI think from the perspective of a History teacher these games are useful in that they get the kids asking questions and give them a feel for the period. So, thank you once again!\"\nThese will not be traditional stretch goals like other campaigns, I could have made the box a stretch goal but I wanted to offer this day one.  Instead during the campaign I will have prize draws once certain targets are reached.  The prize draws will be done after the campaign ends and the free games added to the winners pledge.  Here are the targets.\nFunded 1 copy of Western Front added to the prize draw\n100 New Facebook Likes 1 copy of Operation Market Garden added.\n100 New Followers on instagram 1 copy of Battle of Britain added.\n200 backers 1 copy of D-Day Operation Overlord added.\n250 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n300 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n350 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n400 backers 1 backer gets their entire pledge for free. This will be refunded after the campaign ends.\nPostage is added during the campaign so you know day one how much you will pay. I'm aiming to get the Kickstarter delivered by October 2021.\nLike many people I love games and have backed over 150 projects on kickstarter. With the success of my first three Kickstarters I have been able to do another, and here it is!\nI'm currently working on several new card games and have working prototypes for the following, Wolf Pack, Enigma and Bomber Command.\nWolf Pack will be my first game which will potentially allow up to 8 players to play it, which I am super excited about.\nI also have a working prototype for a World War Weird solitaire card game called 'Hurtgen Horror' \nI have already had three successful Kickstarters, so I'm confident I can deliver again.

In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters.

Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards.

The models were created by 3D scanning real world trees, so they're extremely lifelike (Only mini). \n\nWhy we did it.\nAn essential element of scenery for fantasy tabletop adventuring games is trees. If you imagine traveling through the woods, you imagine a densely forested area with many trees covering the landscape. Other than the visible path ahead or behind, trees block the line-of-sight in all other directions.\nAchieving the feel of a dense forest in a tabletop gaming scenario is difficult for several reasons:\nMiniature trees typically block your view of your characters\nMiniature trees get in the way of being able to move your characters\nMiniature trees are not usually very realistic\nRealistic tree models are a lot of work to make\nRealistic tree models are often fragile\nRealistic tree models take up a lot of storage space to prevent them from being broken\n\nThe Solution.\n3D-scanned, 3D-printable Trees! (This is reward tree 5)\nWe have created 3D printable tree models by 3D-scanning the geometry from real-world tree trunks. By design, our models do not have the leafy parts of the trees so you can see your character models even if they are right next to a tree. Since the models lack the fragile leaf-parts of typical model trees, they can be conveniently stored together in a bin or drawer. The geometry is so tree-like, we've found that we get a very convincing representation of a tree without needing the leaves.\nA real tree and its corresponding digital model\nYou can create scenery that is very reminiscent of a forest by printing these same few tree models at different sizes and positioning them around the tabletop.\nThe same tree model printed at 100% XY-scale on the left and 150% Scale on the right. Bigfoot for scale\nWith just a few of these realistic tree models, you can make an entire forest by printing the trees at different scales and scattering them randomly around the landscape.\n\n Free sample.\nYou can 3D print \"Tree 3\" right now for free. All I ask is that you share this kickstarter on facebook via the link on this webpage. We set it up so that once you do, the download button will reveal itself.\n\nEasy to print.\nThese models print easily and support free on FDM-style printers. Many of the trees can even be printed with zero infill because there are no internal overhangs. Depending on your printer's bridging capability, you might need to print with no top layers if you try to print zero-infill.\n\nTerms & Conditions\nAs a backer, upon successful completion of this Kickstarter campaign you will be rewarded with a license to print and use a set of model files for non-commercial use only. You may not sell, share or distribute any of the digital files or derivative works based on the files. You may modify the files for personal use only. You may not create any derivative works, including printed models, that are to be used in a commercial manner.\nYou will be granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to download, access, and 3D print these model files for the purpose of your own personal use, for your own storage, retention and reference.

Some of the most important missions that took place between 1957-1968 were charted on a beautiful graphic entitled \"The Conquest of Space\" that was issued in 1968 by a Swiss printing company. This magnificent chart displayed the flight paths of these missions and also featured the paths of satellites, and probes to the moon, Mars, and Venus. \nNow, this chart has been fully restored, recolored, and - with your support - will be launched as a special limited-edition reissue.\nThe Conquest of Space Chart\nThis reissue of The Conquest of Space chart will measure 26\" x 36\" ( 2.16' x 3'/66cm x 91cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4\" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. \nClose-Up Detail\nThe chart is printed in two languages - English and French - with an easy-to-read legend on the side that helps you identify which spacecraft are manned/unmanned and belonging to which country. \nThe Details are Amazing!\nThe Conquest of Space chart was first released in 1968 in Switzerland and today it is very difficult to find. Even if one was lucky enough to hunt down one, it would have crease lines running through it because the original charts were issued folded. \nThe Original Chart\nI have restored the graphics on the poster, eliminated these crease lines, brought out the vibrancy of the original colors,  and did some redesign work on it as well. I wanted to keep the chart looking as much like the original as possible but when I was adjusting the colors, the blue background seemed too dull, so that was changed to black...and then, of course, stars had to be added to the galaxy! \nThe captions were initially printed in four languages but it made the chart look overly cluttered, so the reissue features just English and French. The original also had a white banner at the bottom that distracted the eye from the chart, so that was eliminated and the legend moved into a box on the bottom left corner. \nTHE SPACE COLONY POSTER - $12\nOne Space Colony poster. This mid-1970s concept rendering by Rick Guidice shows a proposed design for a NASA space colony. It measures 12\" x 16\" ( 30cm x 40cm ) and will be shipped rolled in a mailing tube. Shipping is $3 within the USA. If you have already selected The Conquest of Space reward, then you can add-on the chart for only $6!\nTHE CONQUEST OF SPACE POSTER - $35\nOne Conquest of Space poster. This is what the project is all about. It measures 26\" x 36\" ( 2.16' x 3'/66cm x 91cm ) and will be shipped rolled in a mailing tube. Shipping is FREE within the USA!\nTHE MAKE 100 - $35 ( Limited to 100 )\nOne Conquest of Space poster....plus the bonus 12x16\" concept poster available only through this Kickstarter campaign! It features a beautiful concept rendering by artist Rick Guidice of a proposed design for a NASA space colony in the mid-1970s. \nTHE CONQUEST OF SPACE X2 - $60\nOne for You, One for a Friend. You'll receive two Conquest of Space posters. You can keep them both for yourself or give one to a friend ( you'll have to give it to them yourself ). Shipping is FREE within the USA!\n\nPERSONNEL REPORT\nMy name is Constance.

NEW OPTION: HIGH ELVEN! VOTE NOW!\nVOTE NOW!\nThe system is pretty simple! Each month, you choose a theme and we create assets that are matching that theme for the Townbuilder, as well as a number of print-ready buildings that you can download immediately.\nIf you back this Kickstarter you will receive a code that will, once redeemed, automatically unlock the release for the current month and all following months for the duration you backed for.\nIf you are supporting any miniature sculptors on Patreon, you will already have an idea how such a system plays out. The only difference is, that you will get buildings and customization assets instead of miniatures, and they will be available on townsmith.de instead of google drive/MyAirBridge/Sync.\nAccess to the Townbuilder Software is not included in the subscription, but also not necessarily needed. Please read the section \"TB not included\" for more information.\n\nBasically, each release is a number of models (Walls, Floors, Doors, Windows, Roofs, etc...) that are fitting the theme of that month and are automatically unlocked for your account as soon as they are available.\nAdditionally, we will create a number of print-ready, support-free buildings, that you can download as a zip file that includes everything you need. You can also customize the buildings with any models of prior releases or our last Kickstarter in the Townbuilder.\nThere are a total of 6 releases planned in this Kickstarter, with more to come if the system is profitable. Depending on your pledge you receive a total of 3 or 6 such releases!\n\nSubscribing after these initial 6 months is optional and you will be asked if you want to stay subscribed when you enter your activation codes.\nWe would love for you to stay subscribed and allow us to expand the Townbuilder each month for a long time, but you can also use this Kickstarter without binding yourself to a subscription and just get the 6 months of assets and buildings.\n\nNow let's talk about our last Kickstarter, Townbuilder Unlimited, which was really successful and allowed us to make the Townbuilder much bigger than we ever anticipated! But as many of you know, that Kickstarter has not yet been completely fulfilled. But as you can see in the delivery dates, there is plenty of time for us to finish the last stretch goals before the first monthly release is due.\nWhat we have learned from our last Kickstarter and from running this company for more than a year now is that the most valuable things out there are information and time. If we know which and how many models and buildings we have to create 4 months before the first release rolls out, it will improve the product quality and lower our stress level significantly.\n\nHere we would like to show you the concept art for the already chosen themes, as well as the options for the later releases.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST CONCEPT ART. HOW DETAILED AND VARIED THE 3D MODELS WILL BE DEPENDS ON THE UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS.\nCheck the \"Monthly Release\" section to see a daily update on how much has been unlocked. \nClick to see more details!\nClick to see more details!\nClick to vote!\nSeptember, October, November: Will be determined after August has been voted\n\nYou can choose in which month you'll start your 3-month subscription. If Draconic, Aztec, or the voted theme in august isn't your thing, you can skip these months and start your subscription with the September release.\n\nI assume that most people who stumble across this Kickstarter are either backers of our last campaign or bought the Townbuilder shortly after on MMF, BackerKit or in our store.\nBut for those of you who are new to Townsmith, here is a quick overview:\nPLAY\n\nWe really can't explain what the Townbuilder is any better than our info page can: Townbuilder Info Page\nTLDR: The Townbuilder is a web-based custom creator for 3D-printable buildings for tabletop games. You can combine small building blocks, such as walls, floors, roofs, and stairs, into complete buildings.\nAh, and of course, if you don't own the Townbuilder yet, you should head over to our store and have a look at it! There are already plenty of models that you can use to create buildings.\nIf you decide to get the Townbuilder, I HIGHLY recommend watching our User Guide Youtube Playlist, it helps a lot with getting started!\n\n\nAbout a year and a half has passed since Tom and I had the idea for the Townbuilder. Initially, it started as a side project next to our university studies.\nWell, we're certainly not at that point anymore. We had a very successful Kickstarter last year and since then the Townbuilder has gone from Open Beta to Early Access 0.1-0.4 and finally to Townbuilder v1.0.\nBut what exactly has improved and changed in the software since you last saw it on Kickstarter?\nImproved Performance\nIncreased Server capacities by a factor of 10\nImplemented under the hood services that allow us to better monitor the performance and problems of the Townbuilder\nImplemented OpenLOCK capabilities\nDeveloped our own peg and magnet system, allowing for 1-6mm magnets and pegs to be placed on almost any model\nCreated a peg placement mode that makes it much more convenient to place pegs\nEnabled scaling of the exported building to a variety of popular scales\nStarted a partner system to get models of other designers into the Townbuilder\nAdded Fillerblocks, a way to fill out empty space or use them as placeholders (cube, cylinder, prism, floor-like)\nAdded a grouping system that gives the user full control over which models are exported as one STL\nAdded a group linking system that expands the grouping functionality to allow for multiple floors to be linked together for export\nAdded Building Blocks, a way of saving and importing whole buildings into your workspace, enabling creative users to fully modularize their building process\nAdded animations to different elements\nReworked the entire GUI making it responsive on smaller and larger monitors.\nCreated the Signbuilder, a sub-application for the Townbuilder, with which you can create signs with custom text and logos that can be used in the Townbuilder\nFixed 500+ bugs\nHad the servers burn down 3 times\nWIP on (semi-)automatic mesh repair using Netfabb so models can be used in all slicers (Simplify3D users rejoice!)\nWIP on a link sharing system, that allows users to share their builds via unique URLs\nWIP on creative mode that allows users to build with all existing assets, save and share the building, but not export it as an STL\nWIP on on-click merchant integration that will allow users to send out print-commission request to our licensed merchants directly from the Townbuilder\n\nWe will also post this in the FAQ, but just to be clear:\nDoes the subscription include access to the software?\nNO, IT DOESN'T. THIS KICKSTARTER IS JUST ABOUT A MONTHLY EXPANSION OF MODELS AND PRINT-READY BUILDINGS!\n\nIf you backed our last Kickstarter, you already got a lifetime license to the Townbuilder.\nThis system will not change and will remain as it is for the foreseeable future. We do not charge you extra, nor do we give new people cheaper options to get the Townbuilder.\n\nYou can back this Kickstarter without owning the Townbuilder and you will still get all the STLs for the buildings. However, you will not be able to customize them unless you backed our last Kickstarter or you specifically backed one of the following reward tiers:\nTownbuilder Advanced + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder Pro + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder All In\n\nWith this Kickstarter, our stretch goals will depend on the number of backers, NOT on the money raised. That is because this number gives us a rough estimate of how many subscribers we will have in any given month.\nSince you can back for just three or for six months, or for a pledge level that includes both the Townbuilder and a subscription, each individual backer will contribute different amounts of money. This means we use the backer number as a rough estimate of our monthly subscriber count, which in return allows us to determine the variety and detail level of a monthly release.\nBelow you can see the different detail levels that can be unlocked on some example buildings from the Draconic and Aztec theme. \nThe roadmap also includes print-ready, support free buildings of all previously created sets. These will be built once, not on a monthly basis, and will be made available to all backers in the same way as the ones from the monthly releases. If you have access to the sets these buildings were built with, you will be able to customize them in the Townbuilder, otherwise, you will only have access to the print-ready version.\n\n\nOur current Merchant License System is really really simple. You pay 35\u20ac per month and you can sell as many prints of Townbuilder buildings as you want.\nThis does include all the print-ready buildings that we will create with this Kickstarter.\nFor more information, check out our License Agreement.\nIf you want to become a Townbuilder Merchant, check out our store!\n\nAs you may know, we have opened the Townbuilder up to external content. This means that we implement models by other creators as well as our users into the Townbuilder.\nIf you want to know more about this, and want to suggest a creator to us, or get your models into the Townbuilder, send us a message via partners@townsmith.de.\n\nWe are Townsmith. This sentence meant a lot to us when we launched our very first Kickstarter over a year ago. And it only continued to grow in meaning when the Kickstarter exploded beyond all expectations on the second attempt. Since then, our team has grown, and so has the responsibility of all of us.\nWe are very happy to say that we still have the same spirit that originally brought us to this.\nWe are just a group of nerds who love DnD and 3D printing and creating cool tools for our hobby!\n\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us, the best way is via Discord. We have a very active server with over 1800 users. Feel free to join our community, we are always happy to help you out!\nWe also post regular updates on Instagram and Facebook.\nAnd then, of course, you should subscribe to our Youtube Channel if you want to get notified whenever we make more user guides.\nIf you have business-inquiries or want to talk about collaborations in general, please send us an email at business@townsmith.de\nIf you are interested in becoming a partner and getting your models in the Townbuilder, please contact us via partners@townsmith.de", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have now almost fulfilled one of the biggest digital Kickstarters in the 3D printing scene.\nWe have gone through the insane challenge of getting a company of 10 people up and running. And it has been running cleanly for about 4 months now (Our initial Kickstarter launched 7 months ago).\n\nWe have a team of 5 artists and 1 technician working on getting hundreds of models in the Townbuilder and Tom and I are always available to fix any technical issues that might come up.\nAnd we are ready to expand our team if we reach higher stretch goals and the funding is there. If this system makes 50k a month, rest assured that most of it will directly influence the amount and quality of the models we make, while the rest will go into research and development for the next builder. Wait did I just spoil that we are coding another custom builder? No one reads this section anyway, won't do any harm. For the few of you that do keep posted and look for some green in the wild of our website, you might find some hints soon ;)\n\nStill, there are some risks we simply cannot account for:\nA) Longevity. We survived the 'valley of death', that destroys so many start-ups. However, we still cannot guarantee how long the service will live. This Kickstarter is meant to provide us much more safe planning for the next 6 months, but who knows how much money we will make with this system afterward. And if it doesn't pay for the artists, we will not be able to continue the subscriptions.\n\nB) Times of uncertainty. We all know that 2020 just ended, and it taught us, that it can always get worse. So if the world collapses into an economic crisis, a war breaks out or half of our team dies, we will simply not be able to recover. Stuff like this will cause this project to fail since we just don't have millions on the side or 200 employees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nPure Digital Shipping", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "3 Monthly Releases", "descp": "10% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 3-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nThis means you will get access to 3 monthly model releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "33% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 6-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nYou can activate this code at any time, so feel free to skip the months that don't interest you!\nThis means you will get access to 6 monthly releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["188 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Advanced+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Advanced Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Advanced Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac100 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Pro+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Pro Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Pro Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac200 or more", "title": "Townbuilder All In", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND WANT EVERYTHING FROM THERE AS WELL!!!\nYou will get a total value of 291\u20ac at 31% off for only 200\u20ac.

It has since appeared in store shelves in a shortened form courtesy of independent publishing company Antarctic Press.\nWhen we last left off in Volume 2, the Kamen Corps was squaring away with the triple threat of Machiavellian agent Niro Lansky, the mud-manipulating Vermillion Masquerade, and the arrogant, armored Kamen U.N.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Escape from the pessimism and propaganda of modern fiction, and take a journey through a mythic America that might have been.\nIn PIRATES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, twelve-year-old Philo starts a pirate radio station with his friends in the mountains of Virginia, and learns that the world is a stranger place than he ever imagined. The Ancient Marauder, the Bright and Terrible Birds, the Mishipeshu, and other creatures of myth and legend populate this enchanting mixture of science and fantasy.\nIn FIVE MILLION WATTS, Philo takes a job at the most powerful radio station in the world, meets a mysterious old man who claims to be a Neolithic god, and learns the story of a genius inventor who built an experimental transmitter to communicate with aetheric life forms.\nIn THE TOWER OF THE BEAR, Philo travels from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, to the forbidden lands west of the Mississippi, to the shores of a prehistoric inland sea, enlisting the aid of scientists, kings, ancient gods, and mythological beasts, in a search for a super-metal from another universe.\nIn THE CITY OF ILLUSIONS, Philo battles prehistoric sea monsters, meets the Bear who guards the hub of the universe, journeys into ancestral memories to confront the Ancient Marauder, travels a mythic river in a dugout canoe, crosses the last of all deserts and learns the fate of the Tyrant, befriends a cybernetic teddy bear with strange abilities, escapes from the clutches of the Bone Demon and the Electrical People, and infiltrates a futuristic amusement park in search of the legendary Bullet Train.\nIn THE EARTH A MACHINE TO SPEAK, Philo builds an impossible transmitter on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, learns the truth about a mythical subterranean race, and discovers a mysterious neutron star on the edge of the Solar System, bringing his epic journey to a spectacular conclusion.\nThis odd, quirky, fun, and wildly imaginative series has gotten rave reviews from indy SF authors and readers. \n\"Pirates of the Electromagnetic Waves is an amazing young adult techno-adventure reminiscent of Bertrand R. Brinley\u2019s classic Mad Scientists Club. Set in an alternate universe nostalgically reminiscent of mid-century America, Wood tells the story of a boy and his young friends as they struggle to build and operate a radio station. I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to more Yankee Republic tales.\" - Hans G. Schantz, The Hidden Truth, scientific advisor for the Yankee Republic series\n\"Fenton Wood\u2019s debut novel does so many things right that it\u2019s hard to knowing where to start a proper review.  The basic plot... is actually a narrative device, a central structure on which Woods hangs all sorts of interludes and vignettes that run the gamut from frontier ghost stories, to Old Country goblin tales, to cloak and dagger games of cat and mouse, to diamond hard sci-fi, and along the way, each little morsel provides a broader glimpse into the wider world of a world that might be a long time after the apocalypse, might be a fairy-tale inversion of our world, or might be its own thing altogether.\" - Jon Mollison, Barbarian Emperor, Neon Harvest\n\"This is an utterly charming short novel which, on the surface, reads like a young adult adventure from the golden age, along the lines of the original Tom Swift or Hardy Boys series. But as you get deeper into the story, you discover clues there is much more going on than you first suspected, and that this may be the beginning of a wonderful exploration of an alternative reality which is a delight to visit and you may wish were your home.\" - John Walker, co-founder of Autodesk, Inc.\n\"This is the kind of book that having read it makes you feel like you have a fun, exciting secret, and saying too much would give it away and spoil it for those who follow after.\" - Neovictorian, Sanity\n\"Zowie, what a read! I thoroughly enjoyed Fenton Wood's Pirates of the Electromagnetic waves and I CAN'T WAIT for the sequel. This is the sort of book I've always wanted but didn't imagine could exist.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter. \n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that. \n\nDIGITAL MEDIA: We strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled. \n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com \n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce. \n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round. \n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible. \n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print. All the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk. \n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer. \n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this. \n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user. \n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how. \n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary. \n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

We celebrate simplicity and smart design. After 3 successful 30\u00b0 ruler Kickstarters, \u00a390k+ in funding, and delivering 10,000+ products, we\u2019re back and better with the 30\u00b0 ruler 4.0! \nWhat makes 30\u00b0 ruler different?\nThe key change we've added is a 30\u00b0 slope on the ruler's face. It's a simple, yet incredibly effective, update and it makes the 30\u00b0 Ruler so much easier to use.\nInstead of a flat ruler, this one is angled at a 30\u00b0 slope. You can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over (improving your already questionable posture).  And also you can easily grab it without having to drag it towards the edge of the table.  Finally, the angled nature of the ruler makes it safe for cutting.\n Apart from its signature sloped design, the 30\u00b0 Ruler also has a couple of new features. \nFor starters, the new ruler starts at zero; meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.\nThis 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, inches on the reverse. Inch and centimetres are labelled in the same direction allowing for easy conversions. \nThe 30\u00b0 Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler with every tick mark labelled. On the English side, all hash marks are labelled to eliminate guessing and counting of lines. On the Metric side, both the millimetres and centimetres are numbered and the hash marks rise and fall making it easy to identify specific millimetre measurements.\nThe ruler itself is made from Aerospace grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the materials used also make the 30\u00b0 Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant. \nScratch-resistant\nWhat\u2019s New\uff1f\n30\u00b0 Ruler 4.0 is made with the same high-quality Aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted as the original, but there are a few new things to make it even better:\nNew wider design for better grip and easier to read.\nLarger font size and non-glare surface makes reading quicker and easier in any environment\nNew colour: vivid white markings with a classic black background.\nTwo Colors, Three Sizes.\nWhile not all rulers don\u2019t have it (which they definitely should), the 30\u00b0 Ruler has two different measurements etched on both sides. The ruler also comes in 3 sizes of 6, 8, and 12 inches, so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you\u2019re measuring. \n\nThank you\nWe are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure. Kickstarter is an amazing platform that empowers us to give you, our supporters, a great price, and value.

Character Keychains are the most durable Keychain Minis and are designed to be both  5E and Pathfinder Compatible. With your mini on hand you can have a game anytime you had a opportunity! The best part is that the metal just gets better with time and wear. Every scratch and scuff adds to the story of your mini.\n\nYour Choice of metals!\nBrass Mini\nYou have your choice from three awesome metals that we found work well for our key chains. From left to right - Brass - Stainless Steel -  Aluminum. Once our kickstarter closes you be sent a survey to pick your metal and artwork. \n\nAntimicrobial Brass\nBrass Minis\nCopper containing alloys like brass rapidly kill bacteria and viruses  on their surface. We all can benefit from a little safer gaming. Brass  also wears wonderfully over time, maintaining its brightness with normal  day to day use. You can always clean it with a little vinegar to make  it look like new again. Brass is a heavier metal, at close to 15 grams. A  typical Key weighing in at 7.5 grams as a comparison.\n\nStainless Steel\nStainless Steel Minis\nStainless steel is very strong and is the most durable of the metals  that we are offering. It requires no maintenance to upkeep a nice  appearance. It is as strong as the keys in your pocket, since most keys  are made of stainless steel. Stainless steel is a moderately heavy  metal, at close to 12 grams.\n\nAircraft Grade Aluminum\nAluminum Minis\nAircraft grade aluminum is both strong and lightweight. Aluminum  wears very well and requires no maintenance to upkeep a nice appearance.  If you are looking to have a handful of minis on the same ring,  aluminum\u2019s lightness is the way to go. Aluminum is a third of the weight  of brass, at close to 4.5 grams.\n\nArtwork options\nLaser Engraved Minis\n\nWe are working directly with some wonderfully talented artists for  our artwork. This is one of the most expensive components of our  Kickstarter. We believe in paying a fair price for the art we source and  we strive for each piece to be unique. You will select the art for your  purchases closer to the shipping date when it is fully available.\nWe have grouped the artwork into tiers based on a report of the most  commonly created characters on the D&D Beyond website. We wanted to  offer the most popular options and create a plan for our artists. If you  don't see the mini style you would like feel free to use our design a  custom mini option!\n\nEach order will include: \nKeychain Minis\nEach miniature will be manufactured from your choice of metal etched  with your selected art, one key ring, one quick clasp and one ABS mini  base. These minis are all tumble polished but may have fine scratches  from the manufacturing processes. This is how the product is intended as  the first day on your keychain will start adding character in the form  of wear and tear.\n\nHow we make these:\nPLAY\n\n\n\nTier 1: Artwork available for launch\nMini Artwork\nHuman - Female - Paladin\nHuman - Male - Fighter\nHuman - Male - Barbarian\nHuman - Male - Wizard\nElf - Male - Ranger\nHuman - Female - Cleric\nHuman - Female - Rogue\nHalfling - Male - Rogue\nTiefling - Female - Sorcerer\nHalf elf - Female - Warlock\nHalf orc - Male - Barbarian\nDwarf - Male - Paladin\nStretch Goal of $3000.00 character Art Tier 2:\nMini Art Set 2\nHuman - Female- Ranger\nHuman - Male - Bard\nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nStretch Goal of $5000.00 character Art Tier 3:\nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nStretch Goal of $7000.00 character Art Tier 4:\nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nOur Relaunch:\nAfter hitting 15 days of our previous campaign and not hitting half of our funding goal we decided to cancel the campaign and relaunch with a diminished goal on retail launch so we can focus more on our kickstarter community.

The goal in placing habitat tiles is to create contiguous corridors by matching rivers, prairies, wetlands, forests, and mountains. Once habitats are placed, players populate them with the wildlife species that each habitat supports. Each species has their own spatial requirements and connections to one another and their ecosystem! \nCascadia is a modular, dual-layer puzzle, with variable scoring conditions that is simple to learn, but challenging to master!\nCascadia comes with a variety of spatial wildlife goals allowing you to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are hundreds of unique puzzles to explore! Create stunningly beautiful terrain maps as you build your own personal environment, while competing with others for the habitats and wildlife you desire!\nKickstarter backers of Cascadia receive a set of 5 Tarot-sized Promo Wildlife Scoring Cards FREE! With the addition of these cards, players will be able to mix and match even more goals. These promo cards are a special THANK YOU to all backers for being early supporters, and will not be included with future copies of the game!\nWant to learn about Cascadia in just 1 minute? Check out Board Games In A Minute's quick overview!\nCheck out this How-to-play video by AnnaMaria of Girl's Game Shelf!\nLearn all about Cascadia with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCascadia can be played solo! The solo mode elegantly simulates a 2-player game experience by turning the tile and token drafting into a cascading market. Players must make difficult decisions about which tiles and tokens to take, as each turn brings changes to what is available. The solo mode is a quick and relaxing experience that is simple to learn, and does not require the upkeep of an AI player, while still offering interesting puzzly choices and challenging thresholds to overcome.\nGavin McGruddy of MyAutoma has uploaded a great browser-based demo of the Cascadia Solo Mode, so that you can try it out for yourself! This demo will let you play the recommended starting group of Wildlife Scoring Cards! Challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score! Try it out here!\nCascadia also has a Family Variant! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you can play with the included Family Variant Wildlife Scoring Card. This streamlines the wildlife scoring so that each animal scores in a similar way, reducing the number of different scoring conditions to learn, while still offering challenging puzzly gameplay. In addition to the Family Variant, the Wildlife Scoring Card features a flip side with an Intermediate Variant. This mode increases the challenge of the spatial puzzle a bit, without adding more complex scoring conditions. \nWith this range of gameplay modes, Cascadia can be tuned to offer different game experiences to different players, depending on experience level.\nCascadia provides a fantastic mix of approachable game play with strategic depth. It is a natural follow-up to our wildly successful first publication, Calico! We wanted to provide fans of gorgeous puzzly games another easy-to-teach, yet challenging-to-master game. Our collaborative team has worked hard to make Cascadia an accessible and exciting game for a range of audiences.\nWhile it can be a fun gateway experience for new gamers, it provides more experienced players with variable goals, tension of managing habitats and wildlife simultaneously, and a great mix of long-term strategy and short-term tactics. This makes the challenge and reward of each puzzle extremely satisfying! We are very proud of the gameplay and quality of the product.\nWe know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Cascadia is the perfect game to do just that!\nThe members of our team have years of experience working on a number of successful projects, from Point Salad to Overlord! What we think these games all have in common is their attention to detail and focus on great gameplay and amazing product quality.\nLast year, 6,724 backers joined us on the journey that made Calico possible. Since then, the game has received various accolades - from being one of the most anticipated abstract games of 2020 on Boardgamegeek.com, to praise from countless reviewers.\nThe Dice Tower gave our first game, Calico, their prestigious Seal of Approval!\nSince this is only our second published game, Cascadia does not currently have access to broad distribution in order to be available in retail stores. This means Kickstarter is your first and best opportunity to bring Cascadia home! The Kickstarter Edition comes with free promo cards that will not be part of a standard retail edition, even if the game does make it into distribution.\nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support. The pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value, as well as subsidized shipping, as our way of saying thank you for your support. You are all special, and have a big hand in the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without all of you, and we appreciate that! \nWe also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. We are focused on you and anything we can do to improve the backer experience!\nRetailers\nCertified brick-and-mortar retailers interested in backing can reach out through our website form (www.flatout.games/cascadia-retailer). Interested retailers will be invited to our pledge manager after the campaign has ended. Retailers are encouraged to back the project for any amount in order to stay up-to-date with the project.\n Interested in seeing Cascadia in action?

We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is fantastic, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that simply will not be possible without a larger initial print run. \nAs we get funding, we\u2019ll be going on a trek together! As our numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and finding fun bonuses along the trail!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the game \u2018to the peak\u2019! \nWE DID IT!\nThanks to all of our amazing backers, we have reached the peak and the game has been fully upgraded with all of these fantastic extras!  \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts on Cascadia!\n Check out Jeremy's Final Thoughts of Cascadia on Man vs Meeple! \nCheck out Fiona and Amy's Review at The Game Shelf!\n Check out Eric's Review at What's Eric Playing!\nSee why Cascadia earn's Steph's Super Rainbow in her review!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Overview Video with Shantelle and Sara!\nCheck out Slickerdrip's First Impressions of Cascadia!\nWatch Theo's Overview of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Our Family Plays Games has to say about Cascadia!\n Check out The Cardboard Kid's Review of Cascadia!\n Check out Eric's Cascadia Review at The Cardboard Hoard!\nCheck out Marti and Sarah's Review of Cascadia at Open Seat Gaming!\n Check out Brian's review of Cascadia at Colorblind Games!\n Check out Jonathan Liu's Review at GeekDad!\nCheck out Plumpy Thimble's Review of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Ruel had to say about Cascadia on the Projects We Love Video! \nCheck out Andy's Review at Meeple Mountain!\nCheck out Jess's preview on Gameosity!\n Check out Ken's Review at Geek-Craft!\nCheck out BJ's interview with Molly and Shawn on Board Game Gumbo!\n\n\n We know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nDuring our last campaign for Calico, we subsidized over $20,000 in backer shipping charges to help pitch in, and we're continuing with that trend here.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. The game will ship in 2021 and there is some uncertainty about how much global shipping will rise over the next year. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. \nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\n\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the 2019 Dice Tower Family Game of the year, Point Salad (2019, AEG); Truffle Shuffle (2020, AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2021 from Crafty Games).\nWhat's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome established and emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. In 2019, the CoLab brought you Calico, which had over 6,000 backers on Kickstarter, and our team is back together, with our new member, Randy Flynn on board!\nOur approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This publication of Cascadia is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's Meet the Cascadia Team!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Cascadia! You can check out her work here!\nDylan Mangini, our graphic designer makes amazing board game apparel as well. If you're looking for some sweet new threads, check out www.teebletop.com!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to people who have helped make Cascadia the amazing game that it is today! We could not have done it without the help of these amazing supporters:\nKalil Alobaidi, Julie Arenivar, Marleen Arenivar, Haley Shae Brown, Brian Chandler, Joseph Z.

We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our second crowdfunding campaign, we have the experience of a successful campaign under our belt. We have also done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are Superbackers ourselves, proving our commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter, and we have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, the members of our CoLab have been involved with a number of successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it. We want you along for the ride and will keep you up-to-date as new developments emerge.

We strive to build our products to last - so that you can rest assured that you won't need to replace your game over time, with many uses. We take great pride in the quality of our games, since we know that a well-made game is one that will stay on your shelf and provide many hours of enjoyment without becoming dated and ending up as waste.\nReusability and recyclability\nAt Flatout Games, we strive to use reusable and recyclable materials whenever possible. This production of Cascadia uses cardboard and wooden components that not only look and feel great, but are easier to recycle. We also try to avoid the use of plastics in packaging and shipping materials in order to reduce our impact.\nSustainable materials\nFor the production of Cascadia we chose to go with simple materials (cardboard and wood) because they are relatively easy to source and they can be produced with very little waste byproduct. Avoiding using plastics that consume fossil fuels and focusing on renewable resources like forestry products helps us to reduce our impact.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe shipping and fulfillment of this project will be carried out by multiple regional fulfillment centers around the world to reduce the overall energy expended to get games to backers.

With that background, I am always coming up with new ideas to make gaming more accessible and engaging. \n\n I wanted to make a mini you could have it with you anytime you had a opportunity for a little game time. The design I have come up with is so durable the game pieces will out live me. The best part is that the metal just gets better with time and wear. Every scratch and scuff adds to the story.\n Introducing the first table top mini with the portability of a key chain.\n\nYour Choice of metals!\nYou have your choice from three awesome metals that we found work well for our key chains. From left to right - Brass - Stainless Steel - Aluminum.\n\nAntimicrobial Brass\nCopper containing alloys like brass rapidly kill bacteria and viruses on their surface. We all can benefit from a little safer gaming. Brass also wears wonderfully over time, maintaining its brightness with normal day to day use. You can always clean it with a little vinegar to make it look like new again. Brass is a heavier metal, at close to 15 grams. A typical Key weighing in at 7.5 grams as a comparison.\n\nStainless Steel\nStainless steel is very strong and is the most durable of the metals that we are offering. It requires no maintenance to upkeep a nice appearance. It is as strong as the keys in your pocket, since most keys are made of stainless steel. Stainless steel is a moderately heavy metal, at close to 12 grams.\n\nAircraft Grade Aluminum\nAircraft grade aluminum is both strong and lightweight. Aluminum wears very well and requires no maintenance to upkeep a nice appearance. If you are looking to have a handful of minis on the same ring, aluminum\u2019s lightness is the way to go. Aluminum is a third of the weight of brass, at close to 4.5 grams.\n\nArtwork options\nWe are working directly with some wonderfully talented artists for our artwork. This is one of the most expensive components of our Kickstarter. We believe in paying a fair price for the art we source and we strive for each piece to be unique. You will select the art for your purchases closer to the shipping date when it is fully available.\nWe have grouped the artwork into tiers based on a report of the most commonly created characters on the D&D Beyond website. We wanted to offer the most popular options and create a plan for our artists. If you don't see the mini style you would like feel free to use our design a custom mini option!\n\nTier 1: Artwork available for launch\nHuman - Female - Paladin\nHuman - Male - Fighter\nHuman - Male - Barbarian\nHuman - Male - Wizard\nElf - Male - Ranger\nHuman - Female - Cleric\nHuman - Female - Rogue\nHalfling - Male - Rogue\nTiefling - Female - Sorcerer\nHalf elf - Female - Warlock\nHalf orc - Male - Barbarian\nDwarf - Male - Paladin\n\nStretch Goal of $8000.00 character Art Tier 2: \nHuman - Female- Ranger\nHuman - Male - Bard\nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nStretch Goal of $10000.00 character Art Tier 3: \nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nStretch Goal of $12000.00 character Art Tier 4: \nUnlock To see more artwork options\n\nEach order will include:\nEach miniature will be manufactured from your choice of metal etched with your selected art, one key ring, one quick clasp and one ABS mini base. These minis are all tumble polished but may have fine scratches from the manufacturing processes. This is how the product is intended as the first day on your keychain will start adding character in the form of wear and tear.\n\nThank you for your support! \nLets get this new adventure underway!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have built relationships with two local vendors for part production and we have sourced our own laser engravers to ensure that the manufacturing process has little to no risks involved.

Because who doesn't want ice that are dice!!\nOur polypropylene/silicone based four-piece ice tray comes with a built-in water funnel for easy filling. This is a simple solution to the age-old question of \u201cHow do I make my ice cubes look like dice?\u201d\nThe Ice Dice tray will comprise of two materials. The top and bottom outer frames will be solid polypropylene while each individual dice chamber will be made from soft silicone allowing for easy removal of the frozen dice. \nThis engineering render shows more clearly the make up of the two materials, however, for the final design, the Polypropylene outer will be white.\nEach tray has seven individual chambers which produce a dice shaped ice cube approximately 1 \u00bd inches in dimeter. Each of the dice contained in the Ice Dice tray are easily recognisable to any RPG player.\n A standard set of polyhedral ice dice has 7 individually shaped dice\n  So How Does It Work?\nPLAY\n\nWe are projecting delivery to begin February 2021, so keep an eye out for news and progress by way of the 'updates' tab, here on the Kickstarter page.\nWe love reading the comments section but can't always catch each and every question on such a fast-moving space, so if you have a burning question regarding the project, you can message us directly.

We are ready to begin the production of the Ice Dice tray, all we need now is you to help us make this concept a real success.\n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur, IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control. Industrial action, acts of God, fire and flood, ash clouds from volcanoes, global pandemics as well as plague and pestilence are just some of the issues and problems that might occur that we have no control over. \n\nWe have, however, already added in \u2018stretch\u2019 room, additional time for each section of the project to be completed and will keep the delivery dates and other deadlines updated on the KS page as well as through our social media channels.

An unexpected sleeper hit that debuted in the spring of 2020, KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 1 raised more than 900% over its initial funding goal between Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and is slated to debut in retail stores (in a shortened format) courtesy of Antarctic Press this fall.\nKAMEN AMERICA, Volume 2: The Founding Fighters takes place almost a year after the events of the first volume and months after the tie-in story featured in BLACK HOPS, Volume 3: Hopocalypse Now.\nAfter turning down her future prospects with her media rep, Carly is working tirelessly to promote herself while suffering a daily barrage of media smear pieces. Monster appearances have not ended and the mystery of who's behind all of it still remains. Fortunately, this time she's joined by former foe Misha Lovacova, who now goes by the name Kamen Comet. Things get complicated really quickly when Carly's former agent, Niro Lansky, joins forces the mysterious woman behind the monster attacks: Vermillion Masquerade! And if that wasn't enough, a rival from Carly's past shows up to complicate things even further!\nA few twists and turns present themselves as the cast and world of KAMEN AMERICA continues to expand!

However, the unique system by which Kickstarter operates necessitates some personal policies to protect both you, the reader, and us the creators:\nDigital PDFs are sent within 24 hours of receiving funding from Kickstarter, which is usually 14-17 days after the campaign ends. These files are sent via WeTransfer links, which expire after 7 days. Due to our busy schedules, we will honor the re-sending of links for up to 31 days after the first time the link is sent out. After 31 days, we are not responsible for backers who do not download our files: we have to be able to focus on other work without taking time out of our day to resend huge files to delinquent backers.\nPhysical books will be replaced if our tracking data shows that the parcel has not arrived within a reasonable period of time, or if significant damage was done to the books in transit. However, we are not responsible for book inquiries 3 months after the ship date. After 3 months, USPS will typically scrub tracking data. We cannot be dealing with shipping inquiries 6 months, a year, 2 years after the shipping date: that is not fair to us, nor is it fair to backers who have been monitoring the status of their orders. The onus of responsibility must fall on the customer to keep up with our updates regarding shipping schedules and other inquiries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith 2 years of successful, on-time crowdfunding under our belt, we can guarantee a Fall 2020 fulfillment on or ahead of time.

Whether you use metric or imperial units, we constantly compare objects using measurement standards every day. Although carrying a ruler or tape measure with you is extremely useful, it's not very convenient due to their size and/or weight. But exactly why would you want to carry a measuring device? Think about your typical day, and consider how many times a tape measure might have come in handy.\nThere are countless examples, especially in various professions, where having a tape measure is almost a necessity. In fact, many of you probably already carry a small tape measure in your car, purse, or backpack. But they all have their drawbacks. The cheap plastic models can easily break when dropped. The more durable ones are made with a steel housing which unfortunately makes their weight less than desirable. And if you inspect them closely, they are larger in size than they need to be. And what happens when you eventually pull the tape out too far? Well, you end up buying a new one.\nWe searched high and low, and were not pleased with any of the small tape measures we found. We purchased a low priced 20-pack of plastic tape measures listed on Amazon, and discovered why you would need 20 of them. You could actually pull them apart by hand without any tools. We bought a 3 foot stainless steel model, and it only measured up to 31 inches. Among all the tape measures we purchased, we saw a lot of room for improvement in the three necessary features we were looking for, small size, durability and light weight. So we set up a project to develop a better tape measure, and after months of design and prototyping we are now launching this Kickstarter campaign. Introducing the Ti-Tape. The world's smallest titanium tape measure in the world, with a user-replaceable measuring tape:\nSlightly larger than a US Quarter, the Ti-Tape is the perfect tape measure for everyday carry. Why? Because it is super TINY, ultra-durable, and extremely lightweight. It also includes a removable keychain clip, so you can attach it anywhere to keep it with you at all times. As if that wasn't enough, the user-replaceable tape ensures you will never have to buy another portable tape measure again. Ever. \nShown with included keychain attachment clip (split ring and gate clip not included)\nThe Ti-Tape is the only tape measure in the world with a user-replaceable measuring tape. This unique feature, and the integration of a durable titanium housing ensures a lifetime of service.\nGrade 5 titanium housing is virtually indestructible\nHousing is non-corrosive and hypoallergenic\nUltra-compact size\n3 foot (1 meter) measuring length\nTape is marked with both imperial and metric units\nBlack on white markings, with red highlights every foot and 10 cm\nHigh quality spring steel tape (user-replaceable)\nRemovable keychain clip\nSpare tapes available (1 extra tape is included with every reward)\nThe following dimensions are in millimeters [inches]:\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nWeight (tape measure assembly): 20 grams [0.70 oz]\n Weight (keychain clip): 2 grams [0.06 oz]\nSize: See diagram above\nHousing material: 6Al-4V titanium (grade 5)\nKeychain clip material: 304 stainless steel\nMeasuring tape material: Stainless spring steel\nAvailable finishes: Stonewashed, bead-blasted matte, or custom splash anodized\nAvailable in bead blasted matte, splash anodized and stonewashed finish\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:\nMaterial: While evaluating the requirements for the Ti-Tape, a fundamental necessity was to fabricate the housing from titanium. This allowed us to keep the size as small as possible by making the wall thickness extremely thin, yet maintaining the required strength for long term durability. It also provided the light weight we desired to make this as convenient to carry as possible. But this also created a number of challenges. Typical machining processes could not be used due to the material hardness, and since we were not making this from plastic, standard molding processes were also not possible. As a result, we had to come up with a creative way to not only hold the measuring tape in place, but to also make it easy and safe for the user to replace the tape. Our custom retention clip design allows for cost effective machining of the housing, and also provides safe replacement of the tape. \nRetention Clip\nSize: One of the most difficult criteria to resolve was the size. A standard 3 foot (1 meter) measuring tape requires a specific volume of space to operate correctly. If the inside diameter of the housing was too small, you will not get the full measuring length from the tape. If the diameter is too large, the entire design is larger than it needs to be. Through calculations, physical testing, and tight machining tolerances, we determined the smallest possible size that will ensure full measuring length on a consistent and reliable basis.\nCarry Method: Always having a super small tape measure with you is pretty awesome, but how do you carry it? You could simply just drop it in your pocket, bag or purse. But what if you want to attach it to your keychain, belt loop, or on the outside of your bag? There was no way to attach the Ti-Tape to anything because we wanted to make it as small as possible. So the challenge was to design a clip for the Ti-Tape that would not increase the size significantly, and also make it easy to install or remove so it was only there if you needed it. So we came up with a C-clip design that fits in the groove between the housing and the cap. All you need to do it back off the center screw just enough to slide the clip into the groove, then tighten the screw.  Done.\nInstallation of Keychain Clip\nSELECTION OF FINISH: The Ti-Tape titanium housing is available in 3 distinct finishes:\n Semi-stonewashed finish: A tumbled surface finish with an irregular pattern that eliminates sharp edges and reduces the appearance of machining marks\n Bead-blasted matte finish: The parts are first tumbled to eliminate sharp edges, then bead blasted for a uniform, matte surface finish\n Splash anodized finish: This premium finish requires the parts to be tumbled to eliminate sharp edges, then polished to create vibrant colors during the anodizing process. The anodizing is performed by hand, in multiple steps, to achieve a one-of-a-kind appearance. Each piece is unique, no two are exactly alike.\nSemi-stonewashed finish\nBead blasted matte finish\nSplash anodized finish\nWHAT YOU GET:\nEach Ti-Tape reward includes everything you need, there is no need to make a separate purchase or to pledge for any additional parts: \nOne Ti-Tape, in the finish of your choice\nOne keychain attachment C-clip\nOne spare measuring tape\nOne Allen wrench for C-clip attachment and measuring tape replacement\nItems included with each reward\nREPLACING THE MEASURING TAPE:\nWe have all done it. You grab your tape measure, pull the tape out, and the next thing you know it sits there, looking at you with the tape hanging out. Yes, you overextended the tape. As you try to shove it back into the housing, you realize it's too late. There is no way that is going to work. So you throw it in the trash and vow to buy a better one next time. Well now is the time, because if that ever happens with the Ti-Tape, you are a few steps away from having a brand new tape installed. And YOU can do it!\nThere are several reasons why you might want to replace the tape. It could be from overextending it, thereby making it useless. Or the markings may begin to fade due to heavy use over time. Or perhaps you inadvertently bent the tape during use and it has a permanent kink in it, making it difficult to retract back into the housing. But regardless of the problem, the Ti-Tape provides a lifetime of service due to the replaceable tape feature. Using inexpensive replacement tapes (one is included with every pledge) the installation procedure is extremely easy.\nREMOVING THE OLD TAPE:\nRemove the cover screw and the cover\nInstall the screw back into the threaded hole in the hub, securing the tape retention clip. This will prevent the tape from inadvertently popping out of the housing\nCarefully unwind the tape, out from the top of the housing\nThen remove the screw and the retention clip, and remove the old tape\n\nINSTALLING THE NEW TAPE:\nPosition the tape over the hub\nInstall the retention clip and screw\nCarefully remove the wire tie from the tape\nRoute the end of the tape through the open slot in the housing\nRemove the screw, replace the cover and reinstall the screw\nNOTE: Detailed instructions and photos for replacing the measuring tape will be posted on our website upon product release. But the tape replacement is as easy as the instructions above indicate.\n MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY:\nWe are currently working with a trusted US-based manufacturer to produce the parts for the Ti-Tape. The keychain C-clip and the internal tape retention clip will require tooling to be manufactured prior to production. We can initiate the order for the tooling once we successfully reach our funding goal in order to expedite the delivery schedule.\nTEC Accessories is capable of managing in-house QA, testing and assembly of the Ti-Tape. Our entire current product line is processed and assembled in-house, and we have the additional space and manpower resources to manage this product in addition to our current day-to-day activities. Shipping and fulfillment of orders is a stumbling block for many new Kickstarter designers. We already perform order fulfillment and shipping duties on a daily basis, for both retail orders as well as for our reseller network. TEC Accessories is equipped and experienced to fulfill this campaign on-schedule.  We plan to process all Kickstarter orders in-house in order to leverage our experience with order fulfillment as we did in prior Kickstarter campaigns.\nPROTOTYPING:\nWith the convenience and rapid iteration of 3D printing technology, we were able to test a number of different concepts and optimize many design parameters quickly and efficiently before manufacturing the functional prototypes shown in our product images. In particular, determining the smallest possible product size while still being functional was one of the biggest challenges we had to overcome. The following images will give you some idea of the concepts and spatial tests we developed in order to reach the final design. But even with the advantage of 3D printing, we still had to machine a number of prototype parts until we settled on the final version suitable for large scale production.\nA small sample of many prototype parts\n Download the Press Kit here\nFor PR inquiries, please email sales@tecaccessories.com\n The timeline below reflects our immediate release of parts procurement when the campaign is successfully funded. To ensure you receive your Ti-Tape order as soon as humanly possible, we will not wait for receipt of Kickstarter funding (approximate 2 week delay) to initiate production.\nIf we reach our funding goal before the campaign ends, we will immediately initiate the order for tooling and production parts so we can begin fulfilling rewards sooner than what is shown in the timeline.\nWe are offering the Ti-Tape on Kickstarter at a discounted price, in the effort to get the necessary funding required to place the production order and pay for the manufacturing tooling. Based on the planned retail price, we are offering a 32% discount on early bird pledges and 25% discount on all other pledges. The value of each reward includes the Ti-Tape of your choice plus one extra measuring tape.\nPlanned MSRP prices:\nTi-Tape  in stonewashed or bead blasted finish: $44.95\nTi-Tape in splash anodized finish: $62.95\nSpare measuring tape: $6.95\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, backing our project is easy! Doing so will help us reach our funding goal and bring the Ti-Tape to life. This will enable you to be part of the first group of customers to receive the finished product. When you pledge for one of our listed rewards, you will only be charged at the end of the campaign if we reach our designated funding goal. Making a pledge is a very simple process:\nIf you do not have a valid Kickstarter account yet,  sign up and create one.\n  Scroll to the top of this project, and click the \"Back this project\" button\n  Select your desired Reward level and continue through the checkout process\n  If we reach our funding goal by the end of the campaign, we will begin production of the Ti-Tape and you will receive all updates and notifications regarding the status of the project\n  Before shipping the rewards, we will send out a survey to confirm your Ti-Tape surface finish choices and also to verify your shipping address.\nTEC Accessories has been developing distinctive, personal accessories since 2004. We have established a reputation for high quality, value, and excellent customer service, and that is reflected in every way that we run our business. Our Kickstarter campaigns are no exception.\nQueen Creek, Arizona Office\nOur new Queen Creek, Arizona office (above) manages our corporate operations and product development, in addition to performing all production and order fulfillment. We process orders from our web site and our reseller network on a daily basis, typically within one working day. We have existing trained staff to accommodate this campaign. We will not hire short-term, inexperienced workers to assemble and ship your order. You can be assured that your Kickstarter rewards will be packaged, processed and shipped using the same care and attention we have been performing at TEC Accessories every work day for the last 16 years.\nThe front showroom (below) provides local customers the ability to come in and see our entire product line in-person.\nQueen Creek, Arizona Showroom\nWe are proud to say we have previously completed highly successful Kickstarter campaigns, in which we fulfilled all of our shipping commitments and held to our stringent quality standards. It is equally important to know that we've also run Kickstarter campaigns that did not reach our funding goal. Discouraged but not defeated, we went on to self-fund and launch one of the products anyway. At the announcement of the product launch, we allowed those who pledged during the campaign a discount to receive their product at the deeply discounted Kickstarter price to show our gratitude for supporting us. From this we have learned lessons that we will carry with us to all future Kickstarter campaigns.\nWe take our commitment to deliver your Kickstarter pledge very seriously. Once we launch a campaign, we respect and honor the obligation to ship you your purchase and in the time frame we have promised. In addition, we guarantee that you will receive your purchase before the Ti-Tape is sold to anyone on the open market. The purpose of a crowdfunding campaign is to bring a product to market with the support and cooperation of an incredibly special group of investors. We are humbled by your faith in us and we hope to bring you many more products in the future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTEC Accessories is experienced in developing, manufacturing and delivering quality personal accessories. We are fully prepared to release production at the end of the campaign and are confident in our ability to deliver.\n\nThe Ti-Tape design is complete, prototypes have been fabricated and tested and packaging has been finalized. Since we do all the inspection, packaging and fulfillment in-house, we have a lot of control over the schedule. However, this requires that the parts arrive on time. Therefore, there is always the possibility that problems may arise that are out of our control. This is especially true with respect to potential delays with shipping carriers and shutdowns related to COVID-19. We do find these delays unlikely, however we will do our best to ensure adherence to schedule and advise backers immediately if there are any issues that may affect delivery.

This ensures that it will not accidentally come loose. The included wrench can be used to remove the cover screw, however due to the small size of the hex screw it does require some attention to detail if you are not used to working with machine fasteners. The best way is to insert the long end of the wrench into the screw head ensuring it is straight and push down with reasonable force while unscrewing the fastener with a counterclockwise rotation.

She can take on a bolt of lightning, end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and finally land herself in a bizarre jungle adventure.  Welcome to The Way-Out Life of Riley, where she confronts them all in the goofiest and most heroic, Riley sort of way. \nOne of the many promotional sketches by Jeff Shultz\nJeffs pencils from an upcoming story\n\n\n\n WHO WE ARE: THE CREATORS \nJeff Shultz is well known for his incredible volume of work on Archie\u2019s Betty and Veronica, along with others, including Peanuts, Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry.\nRich Maurizio has been involved with an assortment of classic characters, including Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, Animaniacs and Underdog, as well as producing comics based on classic TV shows: The Munsters, I Dream of Jeannie and Mister Magoo\u2019s Christmas Carol.\nBoth Jeff and Rich realized they wanted to develop their own creator owned projects. Jeff said \u201cI have these ten pages of a story I did about a girl named Riley. Rich looked at the pages, thought they were great, and said \u201d Okay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll share the writing and art. Jeff does pencils and Rich will do most of the inks.\nWith both being huge fans of the silver age teen humor books, we thought the best way to approach this was to write the series in that style\nWe wanted to take the characters on unusual adventures. We're writing our stories where the characters could be old-time detectives in one story, and in the next be something from mythology. \nWe then brought on Glenn Whitmore to color the covers and stories. Glenn has contributed colors to DC\u2019s Superman and the infamous Death of Superman series, along with Archie, Super Suckers and others for Sitcomics, and Die Kitty Die for Astro Comics. \nOUR CAST OF CHARACTERS\n OUR GOAL  \nOur goal is to produce the series through the imprint Funny Book Institute (FBI) and then compile the first three 32 pg issues into a trade paperback with an all new story.  We believe we can  meet and surpass this realistic goal, with remaining funds put towards covering production costs and funding of the book. We'll be introducing some exciting stretch goals once we meet our initial objective. \n We intend on launching another campaign for the Way Out Life of Riley after the first issue. We\u2019ll keep producing Riley books and other creative titles as long as we meet our goals.\nCONTRIBUTOR \nAnd speaking of being a  contributor, you will receive a book along with some incredible perks, including original Archie covers from Jeff\u2019s personal collection. We\u2019ll be doing limited art pieces, sketch covers, signed editions, and will offer a stunning set of Space Girl prints signed by Jeff. We are firm believers in all ages comics, and we love and believe that there can be all forms of genres in this industry.  \nSet of two very familiar space girls by Jeff Shultz. These two prints measure 11 x 17 and come signed. This is one of the many perks for this campaign.\nArt by Jeff Shultz\nOriginal art covers signed and illustrated by Jeff Shultz for the low price of $200 each.\n          Covers listed in rewards  Betty &  Archie, Pizza Delivery\n.  \n   Covers listed in rewards Betty Running, Jughead bowling.\nArt by Rich Maurizio\nWAYS YOU CAN HELP\nIf you can\u2019t make a contribution, please share this campaign on social media and let people know about our venture. \nThank you and let the fun begin!\nWERE FUNDED!!!! THANK YOU ONTO STRETCH GOALS\nOur 5K stretch goal: a stunning print of ? and Riley for everyone and it will ship with the book. The print will be signed by both Jeff and Rich.

There was meant to be a full ship's complement of crew.  There was no-one.  Scans reported sufficient oxygen to find out what went wrong.  It was larger than I'd thought it would be from the schematics in the briefing.  We just needed the time to re-initialize systems and the mission could be recovered.\n\"Sir, you need to check the view-screens.\"\nSomething that wasn't there before began to flicker into vision, and that's when everything went wrong.\nSSO is a card driven game of co-ordination, planning and action management in a world of brutal sci-fi survival.  It will place from one to six players into a narrative driven world of tension and desperation telling stories of knife-edge escapes pulled from sources ranging from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.\nSSO tells the continuing story of the S.S. Omega, a space ship tasked with a mission vital to the survival of humanity, a ship with a mysteriously absent crew.  Players take the part of a rescue team that must guide the Omega to the completion of its mission. Players will investigate the deserted ship, uncover the catastrophic events which befell it and pilot the ship to its destiny.\nPlayers win or lose independently, but if the ship shuts down or runs out of oxygen all crew will die and all players fail.  Players can work together to increase the ship's oxygen supply, repair its failing systems and complete missions triggered by the Challenge Deck.  Of course, limited oxygen is only a problem if there are too many people breathing, and players are free to conclude that death of the many can mean survival for the few, or the one.\n Co-op play but separate winners, sacrifice yourself for the good of the group, or betray them in your best interests.\n1-6 players, but only one set of rules whether the player count is 1 or 6.\nModular stories with non-set paths for huge replay value but a deeply emergently narrative game. \n\"SSO: Rage of Montalbano\" is a deluxe expansion of our popular SSO base set, which successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2018.  Its tight decision making and tough gameplay were a hit with fans, but the small budget and tiny box meant minimal components.  The \u00a312 \"Rage of Montalbano\" reward level includes the expansion alone, but all tiers from \"Entry Level\" upwards include a copy of the base set.\nThe SSO: Rage of Montalbano deluxe expansion adds a whole host of features to the high on gameplay, minimal components action of the SSO base set.\nCustom Meeples to represent your crew.\nDials to measure Oxygen and Morale levels.\nExpanded and extended rulebook with examples and diagrams.\nPlastic voting tokens.\nStorage box capable of holding the full SSO range fully sleeved.\nNew \"Shuttle\" ship location.\nNew \"Space Walk Specialist\" crew.\nNew \"Rage of Montalbano\" challenge deck.\nIn addition, this campaign will feature the first chance to obtain the new Challenge Deck, \"Temporal Anomaly\", the first challenge deck selected by backers of SSO during our original Kickstarter. \nSSO's base set builds a ship and provides players with the crew to investigate it, but its story is driven by the game's \"Challenge Deck\".  Each Challenge Deck consists of a series of cards, built and balanced to tell a specific narrative of terror and survival aboard the Omega.  The Challenge Deck is entirely modular and can be slotted out and replaced for endless replayability, depending on whether players wish to be wiped out by a malicious computer, hunted by a former crew mate or suffer the brutal assault of an unknown life form.  In fact, game play tension can be vastly increased by using the random Challenge Deck selection process such that players never know which death will befall them until it strikes.\nSSO's Challenge Deck represents any of a range of vicious, aggressive, deadly threats to the players. It will shut off locations when they are their most crowded, vent oxygen when it is most precious, attack the morale of the crew when they are at their lowest ebb, and pick off members of the team when they are at their weakest. Players will unite as a team against this seemingly conscious enemy or be torn apart to attempt piecemeal survival in the face of its terrors.\nSSO is a game for 1-6 players; all rules are the same for solo play as for multi-player games. A game will last 45-90 minutes depending on player experience and decisiveness. \nWe've taken player feedback on the rules for the SSO base set and have created the Rage of Montalbano extended rule book based on that feedback.  It has more examples, diagrams and explanations for increased clarity, we're very proud of it, but are always open to further feedback from backers.  To keep up to date with any changes, check out the current raw text version and give us your feedback.   \nThe game ends when either no crew remain alive or the Challenge Deck is exhausted. If no crew remain the mission has failed, all players have lost and humanity is doomed. If the Challenge Deck is exhausted all players with remaining crew are glorious heroes apt to have statues raised in their honour, they also win.  \nAll backers will receive access to STL files of the Omega to 3D print their own copy of the ship.  Use it to mark your ranking officer during play or deploy it as a mini for use in space fleet battles during games of A Billion Suns.\nAll of our reviews are unpaid, except for (in some cases) a free copy of the game. \n Podcast on Spotify \nThis print review is also available in Polish here.\nSSO is available to play on Tabletop Simulator through Steam so you can try before you back.  Just click the banner below and subscribe to the workshop to try it out.\nIn this three part playthrough Designer Glenn Ford, Lead Playtester Philip Hawtin and communications officer Jennifer Ford play a full three player game of SSO.\nWe have written a digital branching adventure using Twine set during the events of the Temporal Anomaly Challenge Deck.   Each branch of the adventure will lead to a separate part of a three letter code which when complete may be used as a password to a locked page on the Man O' Kent website, which will count unique visitors, as well as providing a further section of narrative adventure, just for fun.  If the page counter reaches 100 we will unlock the additional achievements card, featuring new achievements for challenge decks past and future.\nStart your search for the code by clicking the banner below.\nOnce you think you have the answer, click the banner below, and enter it as the page password to add your answer to the count.\nMan O' Kent games is a tiny independent games publishers.  What this means for us is that without the up-front funds of a Kickstarter we will be unlikely to justify the costs of an expansion of this level, so the first reason to back now is that without your backing Rage of Montalbano is unlikely to exist.  The other thing that being such a small company means is that we struggle to achieve distribution or retail placement, so while our projects are not Kickstarter exclusives you are unlikely to see them in general retail even if we succeed.  Unless you're lucky enough to catch us live at a convention this will be the best shipping price and lowest cost version of our games you'll ever see, so waiting for retail is unlikely to be an option.\nWe have completed and fulfilled previous Kickstarter projects, we're here for the long haul and are committed to supporting everything we do into the future.  You can rely on us to hold up our end of the bargain, but we can't do it without you.  This isn't a pre-order that you can just get onto the standard delivery version of later, this is for real.\nShipping will be charged during the campaign.  All UK delivery costs are included in the pledge levels.  For backers in the rest of the world shipping is \u00a36.\nOur shipping is UK based and will be taking place most likely post official Brexit, as such we are not certain of being able to offer EU friendly shipping.\nFrom initial development onwards SSO has been through around three years of development and playtesting including feedback from the initial release of the base set.  Kickstarter timelines are notoriously difficult to judge, post Kickstarter we may have to alter files depending on stretch goals or feedback from backers and will ultimately be at the mercy of manufacture, shipping and customs.  However, our expected timeline looks like this: \nOur Funding Goal is set at a level to cover printing and fulfillment of the deluxe expansion, which is to say manufacturing costs with Long Pack, import taxes, Kickstarter charges and shipping fees from China.  We make profit if the project over-backs and from sales post-Kickstarter.  The Kickstarter goal is designed only to ensure that from launch of the project to fulfillment that we do not end up out of pocket.  Illustration and graphic design costs have already been covered and completed during development.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, the simplest way to back is to find the pledge level that suits you from the 'Pledge Levels' section.  If you're unsure, we suggest the 'Entry Level' pledge as a great starting point in the world of SSO.  Once you've chosen your level simply find it in the list of pledge levels on the right towards the top of the page.  When you hover your mouse on it it'll turn blue/green with the words \"Select this reward\" in white, click on it.  The correct pledge amount will be entered automatically just click the \"Continue\" button.  Fill out your payment details and click the \"Pledge\" button on the next page and you're in, should we reach our goal we'll contact you later about shipping details and any options, but that's all there is to it.\nWe are Man O' Kent Games, an independent games designer and publisher.  SSO:  The Rage of Montalbano is our third Kickstarter project following successful backing and fulfillment on the original SSO and our Deck Unbuilder, Moonflight. We are led by Glenn Ford, previously Games Developer on Osprey Games' Gaslands (winner of the People's and Judge's Choice Award at UKGE 2018) and A Billion Suns. Artwork is supplied by Henry Peters and Bluepepper Designs, and we'll be printing with Long Pack Games.\nAvailable on the \"Full Man O' Kent Package' pledge level, Moonflight, the Deck Un-Builder is our previous Kickstarter project, which can be viewed here, with further details on our website, BGG and facebook.  It is a 1-4 player deck builder set in the weird and fae twilight world of Moonflight, but is something more, a new concept of the deck Un-builder.\nPlayers take the part of one of the strange and changeable Jacks of Moonflight, building their deck and their power for the first half of the game.  But when the game turns all cards spin to their alternate deck unbuilding side, unlocking trashing abilities and requiring players to thin out their decks back down to a single scoring hand to win.  Build elegantly and unbuild efficiently to score the perfect hand when the Moonfalls.\nThe Moon is Full, The Flight is On.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Rage of Montalbano is our third Kickstarter, we have shown ourselves to be capable of manufacturing and delivery, fulfilling successfully on both of our first two kickstarters. This is our first campaign primarily for an expansion so our biggest challenge is based on having enough of a returning audience for SSO to achieve our goal. We included an expansion for SSO with our last campaign and had a solid number of returning backers so we are reasonably confident of having a sufficient audience to see this campaign to its goal.\nThere will always be unexpected events and timelines on Kickstarter are rarely accurate to the day or even week.

All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nThe man known only as Berzerker is half-mortal and half-God, cursed and compelled to violence...even at the sacrifice of his sanity. But after wandering the world for centuries, Berzerker may have finally found a refuge \u2013 working for the U.S. government to fight the battles too violent and too dangerous for anyone else. In exchange, Berzerker will be granted the one thing he desires \u2013 the truth about his endless blood-soaked existence\u2026and how to end it.\nCover art by Rafael Gramp\u00e1. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nIf you love intense, savage characters with mysterious pasts like Wolverine and John Wick, Berzerker is sure to be your next favorite warrior! \nPlease note: BRZRKR is an action-packed, high octane comic book series with depictions of graphic violence, blood, and gore.\nTimeline\nBRZRKR will be released in 12 epic comic book chapters and collected in 3 beautiful graphic novel volumes, each containing 4 comic book chapters (issues). Each graphic novel is a 7\u201dx10\u201d, 128 page full color book. Through this Kickstarter, we are offering the opportunity to pre-order all 3 graphic novels (384 pages total!) and receive them directly to your home as they are released in September 2021 (Volume 1), April 2022 (Volume 2), and September 2022 (Volume 3).\nSoftcover set shown. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nKickstarter allows fans to pre-order all 3 books with a single purchase and allows us to fulfill them as they are produced and released to the public. When you pre-order on Kickstarter, you can rest assured you will receive the complete story of BRZRKR direct to your door. \n At BOOM! Studios, we believe comic books and graphic novels are the greatest form of storytelling in the world! We\u2019re passionate about helping new fans and potential readers discover their first comic book or graphic novel.\nWhen we partnered with Keanu Reeves on his first comic book, we knew we had an amazing opportunity to reach new audiences. We\u2019re excited to join forces with Kickstarter to introduce people who have never read a comic book or bought a graphic novel to the endless world of storytelling possibilities of comics.\nCover art by Mark Brooks. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nAnd for the superfans, we\u2019re also offering the opportunity to pre-order premium and limited edition versions of the graphic novel collections, including a number of versions exclusive to Kickstarter!\nGunmetal edition shown. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nFor those of you that love having a super premium, limited edition version to fully celebrate your fandom, Kickstarter gives us the opportunity to offer beautiful deluxe editions that traditionally might only be available as exclusives at comic conventions. \n Most importantly, we can\u2019t wait to share our excitement for BRZRKR, the storytelling art form of comic books, and our love of the comics community through updates in Kickstarter. We hope that by pre-ordering BRZRKR and participating in this campaign, you\u2019ll (a) have a lot of fun and (b) fall in love with the limitless world of comic books and graphic novels.  \n\n\n We\u2019ve prepared eight stretch goals to make the shared experience of pre-ordering BRZRKR more exciting and fun, but also as a way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d to the fans. Each time we unlock a stretch goal by meeting a certain pre-order goal, new features will be added to various tiers or release a shared reward for the fans who have pre-ordered through Kickstarter.\nCover art by Rafael Gramp\u00e1. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nThe basic graphic novel set will remain the same throughout the campaign, so if you want to capture any of the stretch goals make sure to check out the other pre-order options.\nThe stretch goals will be hidden until the campaign goal is reached, and we'll start revealing them as the campaign progresses. You can help us unlock additional goals by sharing a link from our Kickstarter page to your website, blog, or social media page. Sharing this pre-order campaign with others will ensure that more people have an opportunity to pre-order and everyone will benefit with new rewards. We hope to unlock all of the goals by the end of the campaign so we can make all of our wild ideas happen!  \n\n Anyone who pre-orders through the Kickstarter campaign will have an opportunity to add-on additional items through CrowdOx after the end of the campaign.\nFor example: if you pre-order the limited edition softcover set, but you also want a copy of the limited edition hardcover set, you\u2019ll be able to add that to your pre-order after the campaign ends.\nAnother example: if you preorder the limited edition hardcover set, but want to pre-order an additional copy as a gift for a friend, you\u2019ll be able to add that on to your pre-order after the campaign ends. \n After the campaign ends, your shipping will be calculated based on your pre-order and shipping address. Shipping fees are not included in your pre-order. Rather, all shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, just before each graphic novel ships.This will allow us to charge the lowest possible shipping fees based on where and when the graphic novel ships.\nEach graphic novel will ship separately as it is released to ensure you receive it as early as possible. Because of this we cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach to shipping and pre-orders will be sent out in waves (more on that below), and shipping will be charged to you based on how many packages you receive and the total weight in each package.\nInterior art by Ron Garney & Bill Crabtree. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\n We\u2019ve included some estimated shipping costs below for many parts of the world, so that you have a sense of what the shipping costs may be when they are charged. These are only estimates and shipping costs may go up or down before the actual shipping occurs.\nPlease note that Total Shipping costs reflect the total you will pay for shipping and handling for your pre-order. For international orders, please note that your country might have additional customs fees. We do not collect those. Please check your local regulations for that information.\nWe will do our best to minimize shipping costs!\n\nWave 1\nWhen BRZRKR Volume 1 graphic novel is finished, we will verify all backers\u2019 addresses \u2013 including addresses outside of the United States \u2013 then provide this information to our fulfillment partner who will ship your books packaged in a box directly to you.

That boldness is no accident, it\u2019s embedded in the DNA of who we are.\nWe love comic books. We believe comics are capable of telling any kind of story. We are storytellers. We believe that the medium of comic books is the greatest way to tell our stories.\nWe were founded by Ross Richie in 2005 with the singular focus of creating world-class comic book and graphic novel storytelling for all audiences. Through the development of four distinct imprints\u2014BOOM! Studios, BOOM! Box, KaBOOM!, and Archaia\u2014BOOM! has produced award-winning original work, including Lumberjanes, Once & Future, Something is Killing The Children, Giant Days, and Mouse Guard, while also breaking new ground with established licenses such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Firefly, WWE, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Dune, and The Jim Henson Company properties.\nWe get up every day excited to create new fans, readers, and customers for comic book stories.\nWe all need stories. Stories that help us reconnect with our humanity, that capture our imaginations, that help us make sense of the world around us, stories that allow us to escape, and stories that inspire us.\nWe believe that the stories we tell matter and we want as many people to read them as possible. Whether you are one of the millions of people who have never read a comic book or are looking for that first comic to share with someone in your life, we want to help you Discover Yours.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBOOM! Studios has been publishing comic books and graphic novels for over 15 years, so we\u2019re very experienced in the production and timely release of books and limited editions. As a matter of fact, in 2019, 98% of everything we published was released on time! BRZRKR the series is in active production already with scripts, line art, colored art, covers, and lettering complete. \n\nWe\u2019re confident that the creative work, printing, and design on these graphic novels will be of the highest quality. The highest quality in storytelling requires careful craftsmanship, from writing the stories to hand illustrating them, bringing them to vivid life with color, and making sure they\u2019re lettered properly for a great reading experience. Our printing partner and our fulfillment partner are top notch and both organizations we\u2019ve worked with for years. Our delivery dates may seem far off in the future, but they reflect the realities of producing the content and delivering it to everyone on time. \n\nThat being said, as we\u2019ve seen from world events this year, it has become increasingly difficult to predict larger disruptions to our supply chain. If we have to delay or hit pause on our production timeline in order to keep people safe, we will do so, in an effort to stay safe and keep others safe.

Upon completion, each coin is also individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\n Antiqued Silver - Nickel Silver  - These coins are made from the same heavyweight Nickel-Silver alloy as our Silver coins (scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable) then chemically aged to build up a rich oxidized coating giving it it's antiqued finish. Upon completion, each coin is also individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing and prevent getting a natural patina.\n Silver - Nickel Silver  - Nickel-Silver is a heavyweight alloy that is is bright silver in color, scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.\nThank You!\nAs you know, we don't give a fuck about much...

Corey?\nDo you like dice?\nThen you have docked at the right station!\nLast year Green Ronin published The Expanse RPG and this Kickstarter is to fund dice sets for the game. Sure, you can play The Expanse with any old six-sided dice, but now you can declare your allegiance to Earth, Mars, or the Belt with these Expanse dice! If the campaign does well, we\u2019ll offer exclusive Protomolecule dice as well!\nWe have once again partnered with Q Workshop, who previously produced our Dragon Age and Blue Rose Dice Sets. They make beautiful dice and we know their work will be stellar. \nAs you can see, the dice have already been designed. Earth, Mars, and the Belt each have their own set. We just need to fund the production and determine how many of each set to make. This is where you come in! We don\u2019t know if we should produce an equal number of each set or not. If OPA ranks are strong, we\u2019ll need more Belter dice. If a lot of you believe in the dream of the red planet, we\u2019ll need more Martian dice.\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out The Expanse RPG, you can download a free Quickstart here. You can also purchase PDFs of the game and its supplements as add-ons to this campaign. If you want print books, you can get those from the Green Ronin Online Store or your friendly neighborhood retailers.\nDice in the RPG\nThe Expanse RPG uses the Adventure Game Engine (AGE), which also powers our Blue Rose, Fantasy AGE, and Modern AGE RPGs. In AGE games, you roll three d6s when taking tests. Two of these dice are one color, and the third a different color. In The Expanse RPG that third one is known as the Drama Die and its results let you pull off cool stunts in play.\nYou\u2019ll note that each dice set has two different styles of dice. This allows you to make two complete sets of dice from each set, each with two dice of one color and a Drama Die in a different color. \nStretch Goal: Protomolecule Dice! Unlocked!\nUpdate: Our stretch goal has been unlocked! You can now get the Protogen dice as a $12 add-on!\nThere is only one stretch goal for this campaign but it's a good one! If we hit $30,000, we will also produce a set of Kickstarter exclusive Protomolecule dice that you can get as an add-on. These will come in a plastic bag (so no box) and cost $12. \nThese dice have the Protogen logo on them. Just some scientists on a hidden space station doing nothing sinister at all! \nImportant Note: Shipping!\nWe will be charging shipping on this project after the campaign ends through a pledge manager. We charge the actual amount the shipping costs and remember, game companies don't set shipping rates! \nAdd-ons\nYou can complete your pledge with PDFs from The Expanse RPG if you aren't already a player of the game. To purchase an add-on, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost for all the add-ons you want. After the campaign is finished, there will be a pledge manager in which you can make a final decision on what add-ons you want (and you can add even more dice then if you want!). Note that all these PDFs are currently available on the Green Ronin Online Store and DriveThruRPG, so if you want to get them today, you can do so directly. If you choose to buy them through this campaign, you won't get them until after it ends, but as recompense they are at a discount here. \nThe Expanse RPG PDF: $25\nThis is the core rulebook for The Expanse RPG. Its 224 pages include everything you need to play except dice, but hey, you should have that covered! The Expanse RPG applies the fast-playing, stunt-powered AGE system to spaceships, solar colonies, adventure, and intrigue in the far-future. Blast off to adventure!\nAbzu's Bounty PDF: $17\nAbzu\u2019s Bounty presents six full-length scenarios designed for a new crew of characters in The Expanse Roleplaying Game. They embark on a series of adventures, from a fateful discovery in the rings of Saturn to acquiring their own ship to a deadly confrontation that could change the course of history for the entire solar system.\nGM's Kit PDF: $9\nThe Expanse RPG GM's Kit provides full-color, printable GM screen inserts with essential tables and references for game-play, as well as evocative artwork. It also includes printable color quick reference sheets that put the stunts and actions at your fingertips, a combat tracker, a set of pre-generated Player Characters, and a complete adventure to launch your crew right into the exciting universe of The Expanse!\nLegal\nThe Expanse Roleplaying Game is \u00a92019 Green Ronin Publishing, LLC.

I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll last that long.\nA classic roleplaying game returns. The new retro-apocalypotic edition of Twilight: 2000, published in partnership with Game Designers' Workshop, goes back to the roots of the franchise with a boxed set for sandbox roleplaying in the devastation of World War III. The new edition will be the fourth in the series, the first being released by GDW in 1984. Just like the original version, the new edition is set in a year 2000 devastated by war \u2013 now in an alternate timeline where the Moscow Coup of 1991 succeeded and the Soviet Union never collapsed.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\n\"The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was an iconic game for me back in the '80s, and we are humbled and honored to work with Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop to bring a new edition to life. The original game was really ahead of its time. Our goal is to build on the amazing sandbox survival gameplay and develop it further, making it more accessible using the tools of modern game design,\" says lead game designer Tomas H\u00e4renstam.\n\"When I saw this proposal to revisit the Twilight universe, I signed on immediately. As I have seen the work proceed, I have not been disappointed, and I look forward to seeing this project become reality,\" says Marc Miller of Far Future Enterprises and co-founder of Game Designers' Workshop.\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nAlso part of the project are Amargosa Press (who have recently announced the new Dark Conspiracy 4th Edition RPG), Polish RPG publisher Black Monk Games (who will act as a consultant on the Poland in 2000 AD game setting as well as publish a Polish edition of the game later on), and Far Future Enterprises (who publishes the fifth edition of the Traveller science-fiction roleplaying game). \nThe Twilight: 2000 Boxed Set\nMaking RPGs in boxed sets is expensive, but we really feel it's right way to go for Twilight: 2000, bringing back the feel of the first edition of the game with that iconic Poland map.\nIf we reach our base funding goal, the boxed set will at the very least include two beautifully illustrated full color books \u2013 a Players' Manual and a Referee's Manual, each of about 100 pages detailing rules, setting, gear and scenarios \u2013 as well as several empty character sheets and a huge, full color travel map (format 864x558mm) of central Poland on one side and southern Sweden on the other.\nIf we exceed our base goal, we will add more content to the boxed set as stretch goals. These include combat maps and tokens, cards for initiative and encounters, custom dice, additional content in the books, and more. Read more under Stretch Goals, below.\nLIMITED EDITION METAL BOX: As a exclusive to this Kickstarter, you can even get your copy of Twilight: 2000 in a limited edition metal box. The inside of the box will have a plastic insert (not seen on the mockup image below) to keep all of the game components in place and make sure they are kept in pristine condition. This deluxe edition of the game will only be available via this Kickstarter and will not be produced again. To get your game in the metal box, choose the LIMITED EDITION reward. All backers of the limited edition will also get an honorable mention in the rulebook.\nMetal Box Design (Work in Progress)\nA Referee's Screen will not be included in the boxed set, but can be added to your pledge \u2013 see the Addons section below.\nReferee's Screen \u2013 Work in Progress\nSome say it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Some say history could have taken a different turn. If the Soviet Union had collapsed back in \u201891 when it was on the ropes. If the Gang of Eight military coup against Gorbachev had failed, the world would have looked very different today. Some say. I think it\u2019s bullshit. This storm was always coming, sooner or later.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, anyway. Now, all that matters is to survive each day.\nIt\u2019s all up to us now. Our squad. Jonesy. Diaz, manning the M113. That Polish girl Kasia. The men and women around me. No one else will come to our rescue. The final words from division HQ, before they signed off for good, left little doubt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on your own now.\u201d\nJust like the original game, the new edition of Twilight: 2000 is set in Poland, but the game also offers an alternative Swedish setting, as well as advice on how to place the game anywhere in the world. In the game, players take roles of survivors in the aftermath of World War III \u2013 soldiers or civilians. Their goal, beyond surviving for another day, can be to find a way back home, to carve out their own fiefdom where they are, to find out more about the mysterious Operation Reset, and maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit better again.\nThe core gameplay builds on the hexcrawling system established in Mutant: Year Zero and Forbidden Lands RPGs (both Silver ENnie winners for Best Rules, in 2015 and 2019), developing it further to fit the gritty world of Twilight: 2000. The characters explore the devastated lands using a large hexagon map of Poland or Sweden \u2013 or wherever in the world you wish to place your campaign.\nPoland Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nSweden Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nMap Detail \u2013 Work in Progress\nRonson carries the SAW. Diaz is like the Professor on Gilligan\u2019s Island, he can build a new carburetor out of a pair of coconuts and some dental floss. Kasia, all of 17, is the closest thing we have to a medic since we lost Doc. Jonesy is a ginger who Diaz says looks like the cat in Aliens which is how a German intel officer got a name like Jonesy. Top\u2019s been in the Marines long enough to have fought in the Tet Offensive\u2026 and me? I\u2019m just a grunt. We\u2019re all trying to get by. Top once called us \u201cthe last family.\u201d He might be right. Kasia made a gagging gesture when he did. But none of us expect to see our actual families again.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nThe core rules of the game build on the Year Zero Engine (used in award-winning RPGs such as ALIEN, Tales From the Loop, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), but heavily adapted to fit Twilight: 2000 and its focus on gear and gritty realism.\nTwilight: 2000 will be crunchier and have less random elements than other YZE games. Twilight: 2000 will get a solid ruleset that captures the gritty, realistic feel of the original, but in a more accessible way and that fully realizes the potential for sandbox gameplay. We aim for a system that retains depth and complexity, but that is less granular and easier to use.\nInstead of a dice pool as in other YZE games, Twilight: 2000 uses a two-dice system. You'll roll one base die for your skill and one base die for the attribute connected to that skill. Base dice range from D6s to D12s. Skills and attributes are rated from A to D, with a better score giving you a better die to roll. Attributes and skills are fairly broad, with specialties used to fine-tune your character. Combat uses battlemaps with 10-meter hexes to regulate movement and ranged attacks. Extensive systems for critical injuries as well as component damage to vehicles give crunch to the system, while keeping it fast and playable.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nTwilight: 2000 is a game with a large and proud community. We want to extend a big thank you to everyone, for your warm welcome to us and the upcoming game since the project was announce a few months back.\nBeside the comments field here on the Kickstarter, we have opened a section dedicated to Twilight: 2000 at our forums, and you're very welcome to join the discussions there. Also, of course you have the pre-existing Twilight: 2000 Facebook group which is an amazing resource and community hub, and the new Facebook group Twilight: 2000 by Free League, created specifically for the new edition.\nWe are very eager to hear your questions, thoughts and requests for the new edition. Even if we might not be able to fulfill every wish, we certainly want to listen to your advice and feedback.\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, later in the fall, we will share a full Alpha PDF of the game to all backers, so you will be able to playtest the game and  give your feedback on it before it goes to print.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies of the Twilight: 2000 boxed set (including printed stretch goals), at a heavily discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the games on time for the official release next year, and you get them at a lower cost than through normal distribution channels. As an added bonus, your pledges will contribute to unlocking stretch goals, and you get access to all updates and sneak peeks of Twilight: 2000 here on the Kickstarter.\nFor more information about how we work with retailers, and to get early information about our upcoming releases, sign up to our monthly retailer newsletter!\nPlease note that retailer pledges are only available to actual retailers.

Several active and retired servicemen from the U.S. military are assigned to the project as consultants.\nTomas H\u00e4renstam has been a roleplayer since his 11th birthday way back in 1985. The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was one of the first RPGs he played and it has stayed with him ever since. In the mid '90s, Tomas spent his one-year mandatory military service as an intelligence officer in the Swedish army. Later, he pursued a career in journalism and worked for over a decade as a foreign news reporter and Middle East correspondent, reporting from places like Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\nChris Lites first encountered Twilight: 2000 in a bookstore, prior to having ever played an RPG. A Cold War kid, he was obsessed with all things military and, in particular, WW III. Within the year, he\u2019d played D&D for the first time and soon bought Twilight: 2000 at his local game store. There started a fascination with this game that\u2019s lasted his whole life. Twilight: 2000 is, to Chris, as relevant as ever. Because any way you slice it, the world painted by GDW back in 1984 doesn\u2019t look all that different from what might lay ahead of us in a worst-case scenario. The old is new again.\nAngus Abranson spent many a school lunch hour, back in the '80s, traversing the ruins of Europe trying to make it home.  Since then he has battled dragons, flown battleships, lived, loved and died in countless realities and realms \u2013 only to land back in a wartorn Europe looking, once again, for a way home.

When defied, creates a shift in our perception that transcends the impossible. Perhaps this is why we are so captivated when something disobeys it.\nThis is PARADOX. \nA device that contends the all-pervasive attraction force conveyed through everything from infinitesimal particles in an atom to colossal galaxies slinging a trillion stars in the orbit of a supermassive black hole.\nAt Matter Collection we feel a ceaseless urge to redefine what is possible. To challenge a reality constructed by the observable, the felt and heard. The future is a notion of the imaginable \u2014 or reality left to the designs of time as we shape it by will. It is the closest we can get to stopping time. PARADOX compels to be truly present by grabbing your attention as we envision tomorrow.\n Perpetual Design\nAlways spinning when needed. PARADOX design defies not only gravity but time, no era is exclusive to its shapes and materials, it becomes a perpetual keepsake that will persist in its spellbinding maneuvers even as it is passed down through generations. \nGlass\nThe heart and soul of PARADOX. This high-transparency glass precisely unifies the ring and axis to provide impressively-long spinning duration.\nBrushed-finish components and the clearest possible glass reflect a lucent halo under the ellipse and radiate a soothing glow while creating the one-of-a-kind levitating illusion among the ring and axis.\n Cutting Edge Manufacturing \nOnly the purest and highest-grade materials are selected in the manufacturing process of PARADOX- in combination with top-precision turning techniques to metamorphose solid blocks of metal into the body and deliver a perfect weight and size ratio essential to pull off a perfectly balanced shape, mesmerizing performance and outstanding durability. \nPARADOX was created by turning blocks of metal to form the ring and axis. This way the top has a perfect balance to get long spins. It is also essential for accomplishing its smooth and shiny finish.\nRound flawless glass discs are accomplished by accurately cutting them. Only this process can reach the strict level of precision necessary to press-fit the glass with the metal pieces and merge them into a single gravity-defying item designed to persist time for years to come.\nBreathtaking finishes\nEach material is protected by an invisible coating that allows the metal to retain its original finish over a very long period of time.\nBrass\nBrass is a functional metal, it features mechanical properties that make it a great choice for many applications, and yet, it produces an exquisite tonality that ages beautifully, making it a great choice for aesthetic reasons alone. It's not surprising that it has captivated eyes for millennia. \nA classic spin on a timeless design.\n Stainless Steel  \nThe most reflective of the set. Stainless steel provides a beautiful dark grey color that is paradoxically radiant as it casts off light from its industrial-looking surface. Rust-proof, durable, and high-performance, this piece will maintain a lengthy and powerful spin as you practice fearless maneuvers, tricks, and techniques.\nRock solid.\nCopper\nResonating with ancient-artifact vibes, the copper PARADOX's one-of-a-kind pinkish brown tone reflects light unlike any other metal and is the perfect complement to an already mysterious-looking object. Finished with our special coating meant to preserve its immaculate shine for ages, this piece has all the elements to become a fine relic of the present when discovered in the distant future.\nA beauty no words can describe.\nAluminum\nA sleek and refined finish, aluminum has a beautiful silver color that creates a bright-yet-cold reflection and warrants a drawn-out gaze as it spins. This one is the lightest PARADOX and achieves agile spinning speeds without compromising stability or smoothness. Aluminum is a sustainable material that can be melted down in its entirety and reused without harmful effects on the environment.\nModern and agile.\n PARADOX Maneuvers\nOnly a couple throws are necessary for you to understand how you have control over PARADOX. Experiment with different launching techniques and discover all the maneuvers it can perform.\n\nMake its axis draw long wobbles, create ellipses of different sizes or leave it spinning in a static position for longer than you ever thought possible. it\u2019s all up to you\nStatic\nWide wobbles\nTight Wobbles\nFlower ellipses\n Design Process\nTo get to PARADOX maximum simplicity, our design team went through an intense and thoughtful process in order to abstract our vision as much as possible to reach the shapes necessary. To create a timeless design that can reach an astonishing spin velocity and duration, our design team went through an intense thoughtful process to give our tops high spin velocity and duration, while maintaining a simple, timeless design.\n Many configurations and materials passed through our hands until we found the best blend between design and feel to complete the PARADOX experience. \n The team \nA perfect balance between design and engineering talent, the team behind PARADOX shares a passion for creating totally unique and valuable objects with inherent quality. With the goal of producing unparalleled and repeatable results, we seek to create a delightful experience for the PARADOX owner through a superb, classic design. Every millimeter of PARADOX is thought to perfection, and it\u2019s our dream to make this flawless top spin for you! \nWe are incredibly grateful to our loyal backers and looking forward to hear and welcome the new ones. This is our third successful campaign on kickstarter and every single time we learn a lot. We use this knowledge to deliver the best designs and experiences we can deliver, every time improving ourselves.\nIn our last campaign we learnt to deal with a global pandemic and how to overcome this to respond and ship efficiently to you no matter the circumstances. Please feel free to back this project, and we promise you\u2019ll love spinning PARADOX as much as we love making it!\nSpecs\nSpinning time varies depending on the weight of the top, lighter tops are easier to spin, and heavier tops spin longer. Here's an average of the spinning time of each metal, of course, these times can improve with practice.\nAluminum= 3:00 min \nStainless Steel= 4:00 min\nBrass= 4:20 min\nCopper= 4:40 min\nRewards\nIf you would like to get more than one PARADOX TOP, just increase your pledge by the price of each reward, and you'll be able to specify what you want to get in the post-campaign survey. \nFor example, if you would like to order 1 stainless steel and 1 copper piece, your total pledge should be 74 USD (35USD + 39USD).\nTimeline \nShipping\nWe believe in offering a world-class shipping service founded on quick delivery at the lowest possible rates. So we decided to charge the shipping in the post-campaign survey. This way, you'll always receive a fair and calculated personalized price based on your geographic location and regional shipping rates, so you don't have to worry about overpaying and getting stuck with an excessive one-size-fits-all delivery fee. With this strategy, we can offer you shipping at cost, and you won't have to pay for extra commissions. \nAt the completion of our project, you will receive a survey link in your email, there you can buy more PARADOX, confirm your address and get your personalized shipping price. Thanks to the post-campaign survey, you can order exactly what you want and choose where you want to receive it. \nDepending on your country, there might be importing taxes charged the moment you receive your piece by the courier or the National Postal Service. \nHere's a list of an estimation of the shipping prices. If you don't find your country, please send us a message, and we'll be glad to help you!\nDue to Covid-19 shipping prices are changing every day, so these prices may vary.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPARADOX is currently in its 5th month of development, and we\u2019ve been busy ensuring that the highest-quality suppliers, materials and manufacturing processes will always form the basis of this premium design.

Their mission: to thwart an evil organization that specializes in the creation, capture, and weaponization of cryptids of their own. First published in 2018 by Antarctic Press, the characters in BLACK HOPS have gone on to cameo in other comics, such as Punchline and RAGS.\nTASK FORCE 22114: \"BLACK HOPS\"\nU.S.A.-*-G.I: After surviving an atomic bomb in the 1940's, the rabbit known as U.S.A.-*-G.I. displayed heightened intelligence and other skills, including optic camouflage, prolonged longevity, and the ability to communicate selectively with other creatures using an indecipherable carrier frequency. He has lived for generations with the Frelings, a career military family.\n PATRIOT-R: In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima reactor meltdown, an irradiated otter was found by United States cleanup personnel. He manifested the same heightened intelligence as U.S.A.-*-G.I. but is much more unpredictable and violent by nature.\n RIGOR TORTOISE: A multi-billion dollar experiment to artificially create the same set of skills displayed by U.S.A.-*-G.I. Ultimately the money was spent to augment a naturally intelligent terrapin with bionic enhancements and neural implants to be used as a trainable, walking weapon.\n Penelope Freling: The current owner of U.S.A.-*-G.I. and descendant of the man who first discovered him, she is bonded to him and is the only person capable of understanding his communication frequency. She has reluctantly joined BLACK HOPS and undergone training to be an independent contractor, serving as a translator and necessary backup.\nArt by CuteSexyRobutts\nPenelope Photoshoot by Weapon Outfitters and River Breann\nCRYTIQ HIGH COMMAND\nAPEX MOTH: The enigmatic leader and creator of CRYPTIQ, he was a scientist commissioned in 1966 to study and recreate the same conditions that made U.S.A.-*-G.I. A freak accident at his lab in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, turned him into an abomination. He wears a helmet to hide his visage. The leading expert on cryptids, his goal is to find, create, and bio-weaponize them for sinister purposes.\nHARE TRIGGER: Kanina Lovacova, CEO of the internationally renowned private military company NINGEN. Her company was responsible for keeping watch over Apex Moth while he was in captivity, but he successfully bribed her to join him and use NINGEN as CRYPTIQ's private army. Wanted by the United States for treason, she is currently traversing Europe as she avoids extradition.\nBLACK HOPS Volume 3 Cover\nCharacter Model Sheet--Penelope and Hare Trigger\nBLACK HOPS VOLUME 3\nThis campaign is the debut of the 3rd installment of the BLACK HOPS saga: taking place almost a year after the events of BLACK HOPS VOLUME 2: HARE TRIGGER and serving as an interquel and bridge between KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 1 and KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 2, the team is joined permanently by Penelope as the translator and backup for the team. They must infiltrate a castle in Europe to rescue a defector to the United States with critical information on CRYPTIQ. Unfortunately for them, CRYPTIQ is gunning for this asset as well and it's a race against time to see who gets the target first!\nAlong the way, the team will pick up new members -- including the highly trained COMMANDO-G -- as the stakes are raised between both sides!\nMany of our recent readers have discovered BLACK HOPS for the first time thanks to the revealed tie-in from the epilogue of KAMEN AMERICA, VOLUME 1.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances. \nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 43rd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n \nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

My first 2 projects have been critical in deciding whether the business would be a viable venture, I am very pleased to say that I will continue to chip away at my own tiny little corner of the miniature market. \nSuccess with this project will set me up to continue to produce more and more fine scale miniatures for gamers and collectors, as a quite new small business I am heavily dependent on your support to continue forward, I am not a long established business with financial backing, when you back me on Kickstarter you are literally the life blood of Throne Down Games and I cannot express in words what it means to me as a small business, as an artist, as an individual, that you offer me your support. \nIn this project you will find a selection of miniatures for your tabletop gaming, painting and collecting. The miniatures are 32mm fine scale resin with the option to pick them up in the larger scales of 54mm and a select few in 75mm, perfect for those who collect to paint and/or diorama build!\nGoing forward a select few will be available in 54mm and 75mm for retail along side the 32mm range.\nI have a huge passion not only for miniatures but high fantasy, I hope you find something you like and perhaps a little bit different in my work than what you typically find in the miniature market!

Designed to lower our stress levels, Buda Ball floats and rotates hypnotically in an invisible magnetic field, creating a soothing, time-stopping visual experience: a reminder to live in the present moment. \nThese days we're stressed more than ever. Our senses are often overwhelmed by the noise of information. Buda Ball is a reminder to take a deep breath and to slow down.\nBuda Ball seems to defy the laws of gravity, floating freely in the air through a magnetic field. \nHere's what our backers are saying about Buda Ball\nBackers survey\n Buda Ball levitates both vertically AND horizontally thanks to our carefully crafted magnetic levitation technology.\nHovering in mid-air, Buda Ball is designed to lower our stress levels: a positive reminder to stay centered during turbulent times. Combining both art and science, Buda ball is a unique design object for the modern Zen home or office. \n\nPLAY\n\nSuspended in the air like a drop of water frozen in time, Buda Ball hovers and rotates in mid-air giving us that time-stopping illusion: a reminder to slow down and be mindful of the present moment. \nDesigned to remain balanced in perfect equilibrium, Buda Ball finds its center resisting the forces of gravity. \nWorking from home?  Get a little OM. \nBuda Ball is perfect for your desk. It's a mini-art installation that combines science with design providing a gentle reminder of how to find your center of gravity during turbulent times. Minimalistic design combined with mind-boggling magnetic levitation technology, makes Buda Ball the ultimate conversation piece. \nHovering and rotating in mid-air, Buda Ball appears weightless, suspended inside a magnetic field. \nGently lower the ball down with two hands at a distance of 6 inches/ 15cm.\nAim for the exact center point of the base.\nWhen you feel the ball push up, gently let go.\nSince we launched Flyte, the levitating light on Kickstarter in 2015, we've been amazed by the reactions of thousands of peoples\u2019 faces light up as they experience levitation for the first time.  \nWe're back on Kickstarter because we love levitation and we want to share the magic with more people all over the world.\nAt FLYTE, the components used to assemble our products are sourced from the best quality suppliers all around the world. Assembling is done by hand because all components need to be calibrated correctly. \nOur products undergo rigorous testing before shipping in order to ensure that you only receive a 100% working FLYTE product in perfect condition. Any imperfections will be rejected and not shipped. We do this to ensure the absolute highest quality of our products.\nWith every FLYTE product, you know you are getting the original high-quality designs that people all over the world have known to love. \nWe have dedicated customer support so you also can be assured that there is a real person on the other end to help you should you need any assistance. \nWhen you purchase a Flyte product, you are supporting the original creators of the design.  \nThe concept of Buda Ball can be traced back to an earlier question:\nWhat if the mind is powerful enough to change our reality?\nWe decided to put the question to the test and see if our brainwaves could be used to control the levitation of a floating chrome sphere.\nUsing EEG headsets, we measured brainwave activity and mapped them to our levitation controller.  \nIn a relaxed state, the breath begins to lengthen and the brain waves begin to slow down. The ratio between Alpha and Beta signals and Theta and Delta signals change.\n\u201cYou are the placebo \u201c Joe Dispenza\n\nUsing a customized algorithm, brainwave signals are processed to detect the \"meditative\" state of our brain. These signals are programmed to drive a custom-built motorized levitation controller up and down, causing the ball to rise according to our meditative state.  The higher the meditative state, the higher the levitation.  \nPLAY\n\nOne lucky backer will have the chance to receive the world's first brainwave controlled levitation art installation as featured in the film.  \nThe Buda Box is one-of-a-kind device that uses brainwaves and an EEG headset to levitate a floating sphere.\nWe're excited to offer the Buda Box pledge on Kickstarter only. \nBuda Box Dimensions:\nLength: 59cm / 13 inches,  Width: 33cm / 13 inches,  Height: 59mm / 23.23 inches\nSphere: 130mm / 5.11 inches diameter \nBuda Ball Dimensions:\nLength: 110mm / 4.3 inches, Width: 110mm / 4.3 inches, Height: 23mm / 0.9 inches\nSphere: 20mm / 0.70 inches diameter\nWith our manufacturing partners ready to ship, we will begin shipping to North American backers beginning of July 2020.

A few years later in 1995, the first Spawn action figure was released to retail and critical acclaim helping to usher in a whole new way of giving you much detailed and \u2018art\u2019 to your action figures. Now, twenty-five years later, Todd McFarlane is joining forces with Kickstarter to help deliver an updated version of that original 1995 toy & comic release. \nABOUT THE FIGURE\nThis figure will be 7 inches tall and come with a huge folding cape and weapon. The articulation in this version will be more than double what the original toy had, and the included comic cover will be re-drawn by the international award-winning artist and creator of the Spawn character, Todd McFarlane.  \nPLAY\n\n As well, this new remastered version will come in its own box with slipcover to help preserve the condition of the figure, comic and packaging. And speaking of the actual blister packaging, it will mimic the original design from the classic toy of 1995, though upgrades will be all across the final product.\nPLAY\n\n A new re-sealable clamshell  package will be used so you may take out your figure and comic for display, but also be able to return them both into their packaging like you have never opened it in the first place!\nTo simplify this offering, there will be only four levels: A CLASSIC costume version. A MODERN costume version (with new head), an ARTIST PROOF (what we\u2019re calling the \u2018black & white) and lastly the 3-PACK bundle which will include a Classic, Modern and Black & White figure. The latter two figures getting new head sculpts!)\nTODD MCFARLANE'S AUTOGRAPH\nIf you choose, you can also get an autograph by the creator and artist of Spawn, Todd McFarlane himself. Todd will be personally signing a name plate that can be used for display with your comic and toy. And each autographed item will also come with a bonus weapon: A re-imagining of the wooden plank weapon from that original Spawn figure from 1995.\n\n3-PACK SPAWN TRILOGY: TWO NEW HEADS\n The 3-pack Spawn Trilogy will only be offered with an autograph and include the CLASSIC SPAWN, MODERN SPAWN with a unique AL SIMMONS HUMAN HEAD, and ARTIST PROOF SPAWN (black & white) with a unique SCREAMING HEAD. Each figure included in the 3- pack comes with an original comic book. \n This is your chance to get in on history as it repeats itself in this remastered version of the character and toy that helped change the industry of how visual and detailed action figures could look.\nFREE BONUS head for 3-Pack and CLASSIC SPAWN pledges.\nHeads and Weapons (check your level to see if your item qualifies for these)\nMODERN SPAWN 3-PACK work-in-progress\nNECRO-ENERGY BURST (all Classic Spawn will come with one)\nColor scheme for LAUNCHER-GUN Weapon for Modern Spawn\n\nNECRO-SWORD weapon (included with all ARTIST PROOF Spawn pledges)\nSHIPPING COSTS\nFigures will be shipped anywhere in the world, but ALL backers are responsible for shipping. All shipping costs are ESTIMATED.\n***Your SHIPPING DESTINATION COST does NOT include any additional charges (i.e. any regional taxes or customs add-ons). Those will be additional charges depending on where you live in the world.***", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now, we have no risks or challenges, but we will communicate with our Kickstarter community if anything arises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "CLASSIC SPAWN", "descp": "A 7-inch action figure with CLASSIC COSTUME IN MASK, folding cape, weapon(s), base and over 20 moving parts.

I have a studio and blacksmith's shop on my farm, Ravenstead.\nRavenstead is my home and family business, with smithing and metal work becoming a bigger part of what I do to provide. This current project will help better establish the workshop at Ravenstead.\nWhen I'm not working on the farm or smithing, I'm thinking about games and gaming. I love classic tabletop role-playing games. I'm excited to share my new project with you!\nTyr's Treasure: A Tabletop RPG Game of Chance\u2122\nTyr's Treasure is a combination of my two favorite things, gaming and metalsmithing. I am presenting the game in a fantasy setting here, but I already have plans to use this in a Sci-Fi Campaign taking place in an isolated back-world cantina. Tyr's Treasure truly fits into any RPG!\nTyr's Treasure is a game of chance for use with any Role Playing Game System. The rules are straightforward and designed for 1-6 players. The game is played with two brass dice marked with the rune of Tyr (Tiwaz) and the rune of Inspiration (Ansuz). The runes represent the number one on a standard numeric D6. \nThe Rules:\nA Game for 1-6 Players\nThe Game Master gives each player one of the pewter coins provided with the game and places the remaining coins in the treasure pile at the center of the table. Each player places a wager of one coin in front of them. The players then roll the custom dice and consult the provided rules for a result. As the game progresses player's coins move in and out of the central treasure pile. If a player runs out of coins they are knocked out of the game. The last player remaining wins the treasure pile.\nWe will be discussing the rules in greater depth as the project moves forward and I will also be selecting a few of my backers from previous projects to play test the rules! A PDF version of the rules will be provided with the reward. I will also be posting a \"Lets Play\" video after the rewards have shipped.\nI am offering Tyr's Treasure with solid brass dice in bright finish or a blue-green patina. The game also includes 12 hand-struck pewter coins, a cloth drawstring bag, and a PDF copy of the rules.\nChoose a Bright Finish or Patina\nEach brass die is cut from 5/8\" stock then carefully ground, stamped, and finished either bright or with a fine blue-green patina. The runes used in Tyr's Treasure represent the number one position on a standard numeric D6.\nUsable as Standard D6's\n You can get as many dice as you would like! At the first backer level you can get a D6 with your choice of Elder Futhark Rune in the one's position. If you want one die the pledge is $12 if you want 4 dice the pledge would be $48 and so on. You can add dice to your original pledge! If the shipping weight goes over 13 oz we will switch from first class to a flat rate for only $3 more!\nTreasure and Dice!\nRune Dice!\nBacking as \"The Rune Collector\" will get you 24 brass D6's each with an Elder Futhark Rune stamped in the one's place and a cloth drawstring dice bag. That's a full set of 24 rune dice! You can pick your between a bright finish or patina.\nThe Rune Collector (Twenty-four Brass Rune Dice)\nThe Rune Collector\nThere will be some great add-ons coming to this project as we go! You can expect extras from the forge like iron runes, custom leather dice bags, and piles of pewter coins to add to your hoard! You can also add as many dice to your original pledge as you wish!\nAdd-Ons now Available!\nHere are a few extras you can add on to your original pledge!\nTreasure Coins $14 (Set of Twelve)\nYou will receive 12 hand forged and hand struck pewter coins. Each coin has a raised design on one side and is smooth on the other. The coins come with an antique silver patina, giving them an old world look and feel.\nHand Struck Pewter Coins!\nExtras and Adding on to your Pledge:\nHere's how to change or add on to your original pledge. This will come in handy if you decide you need a few extra dice or want to mix and match rewards.\n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to cover extra dice or runes.\n3. Save your pledge. You don't need to change the tier of your original pledge.\nOnce this is done, just message me so I can keep track of anything extra on your pledge. I will confirm via the reward survey at the end of the project. We may have to adjust the shipping if you get crazy!\nHow the funds you provide will be used:\nThe money I earn with this project will go towards improving my blacksmith shop, studio, and developing my Etsy Store. In terms of shop improvements, we are looking at building a larger work space here at Ravenstead. This would involve pouring a concrete slab, construction of a building, running power to the building, and the monumental task of equipping the shop with forges and other heavy equipment. It will be a long process and the first step will be site planning, surveys, and drafting of plans. If you're anything like me, you like to know the behind-the-scenes details of a project like this. I would like to share this process with you, so some of the funds from this project will go towards establishing a stronger presence on YouTube and towards developing the Patreon Page. Anything left over will go towards coal for the ever-hungry forge, and other consumables such as metal files, wire brushes, and metal stock.\nShipping:\nI will be using USPS to ship all rewards via First Class Package service or Priority Flat Rate. Should the shipping weight increase above 12 oz. with the purchase of extras or add-ons, an additional fee may be required to cover the postage increase to a Flat Rate service. I do not charge extra for packaging and handling, that's on me.\n(c) 2018 - 2020 David Savedge", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet's go ahead and get it out of the way and talk about Covid-19.

There are a few minor concerns outside of our control such as shipping and purchasing supplies. I have contacted my various suppliers and they assure me that there are no expected delays in shipping materials to Ravenstead. I have given myself a generous window for delivery of this project but I anticipate an early delivery as with all of my previous projects.\n\nI have carefully estimated my time and available resources; i.e. coal, metal, tools, and the occasional cup of mead.

LOOTgames provides 3d printable terrain and scatter models to help you make your wargaming tables look their best. This project however is our first attempt to delve a bit deeper into the wargaming world and explore our passion even further... So it is without further ado, we present to you our first effort of writing a narrative campaign for all fellow wargamers to enjoy with their favorite skirmish wargames.\npdf cover art\n\n\"The Drifter\" narrative campaign is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, free to be interpreted as you find most fitting for your preferred game and  follows our main character and his crew through their adventures in the wastelands. We are not providing a rule-set nor a very specific setting ; instead we provide players with an interesting and intriguing story driven campaign able to be enjoyed even in solo mode, a story where players will be called to choose their own path and make decisions that will consequently affect the campaign's second and third acts  and take them down three unique story branches. \nThe campaign will include 19 standard missions (each branch is 10 or 11 missions long  depending on the path you choose, as seen in the diagram above) and 4 side-missions to choose from between your main missions. Goal is to not only have missions that feel satisfying, but a story and a character that make you want to play the whole campaign over and over again and discover all possible endings; we will be extensively working on all the narrative parts of the campaign and the main character's portrait during this campaign. \nYou will be faced with practical and/or ethical dilemmas arising in the narrative of certain missions, taking your character's fate in your own hands with your every decision during the campaign. \nBy clicking on the image below you can download the first mission, meet the protagonist and play it through for free. See by your own how we are setting up each mission so it can be easily interpreted and played with any game/rule system you want. \nclick on the image to download the first mission of the campaign\nKeeping it simple and straightforward with our Pledge Levels, Basic Pledge will give you the digital pdf of the campaign whereas the VIP LOOTer pledge will give you the digital pdf + two 3d printable models from LOOTgames' \"Warmachines for Survival\" kickstarter campaign(SchoolBus+Reactor, click here to see the models) + your name in the Special Thanks and Credits section at the end of the campaign pdf.\nWHAT WE WILL DO\n-we will provide a well written and laid-out 70page (approx) pdf containing missions, backstory, setting.\n-we will continue supporting this campaign through errata and/or balancing documents after the Kickstarter ends\n-we will offer a free pdf of the first mission for you to download and see how you like it\n-we will offer suggestions on how to set-up your boards for each mission. We do provide all of the models necessary for 3d printing at our shop, or you can use any model you like.\n-we will write 4 more side missions if we hit 800euros.\n-we will write 4 more, for a total of 16 side missions if we hit 1500euros.\n\nWHAT WE WILL NOT DO\n-we will not make the campaign a hard copy version - digital pdf only.\n-we will not provide any documents of how to adapt this campaign to existing rules and//or games. We are simply providing a story for you to play out.\nThis is an extended -spoiler free- overview of our campaign and a work in progress document for us to ensure every thought and idea we have and work into the campaign fits well together and creates a coherent and interesting story to unfold on your gaming tables.\n\nOne of two models included in the VIP LOOTer Pledge\nOne of two models included in the VIP LOOTer Pledge", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are well underway writing and designing the campaign, we have most part of the story drawn out and major plot twists and crucial points in the campaign.

A tv series adaptation of Tales From the Loop was launched just a few days  ago on Amazon Prime Video.\nNow, you can take another step into the amazing world of the Loop. In Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame, 1-5 players take the roles of teenagers who investigate the mysteries originating from the Loop, a huge underground science facility with strange effects on the suburban landscapes around it \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner!\nTales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame is designed by Martin Takaichi and includes high-quality miniatures by Paolo Parente's Dust Studio.\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nArt by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nIn 1954, the government ordered the construction of the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator. The facility was completed in 1969, located deep below the pastoral suburban countryside, outside of the big city. The local population called this marvel of technology the Loop. Over the years since it was built, strange phenomena have started to appear in the area - mysterious creatures stalking the land, machines malfunctioning in inexplicable ways.\nIn the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there\u2019s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don\u2019t have to plan it all out from the start.\nAt least four scenarios will be included in the base game (more can be unlocked as stretch goals), and each scenario takes approximately 90-150 minutes to complete.\nFull Setup of Prototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nAll the components of the core game are listed below. More components can be added if stretch goals are unlocked:\nMiniature produced by Dust Studios based on Simon St\u00e5lenhag's design\nThe Loop isn\u2019t the only technological achievement in the \u201880s that never was. Advanced AI, robotics and magnetrine development are highly advanced as well. Riksenergi, the governmental agency tasked with running The Loop, employs different machines to automate a large number of functions on the islands. While some have drivers or handlers, most are running on their internal AI code.\nIn Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, these machines are represented by beautiful miniatures sculpted by Yannick Hennebo based on St\u00e5lenhag's original designs and manufactured by Dust Studios. They are molded in high-quality PVC plastic and are between 25 and 40mm tall. You can buy extra minis as addons, check the Addons section below.\nIn the STANDARD EDITION, the miniatures are delivered unpainted. In the DELUXE EDITION, the miniatures are delivered PRE-PAINTED by Dust Studio.\nMiniature prototypes by Dust Studio - not final product\nADDON MINIATURE SCENARIO PACKS\nIn addition to the machine minis included in the core set, you can add models of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur and the \"Visitor\" robot, along with scenarios to use them with, Addons to your order - check the Addons section below. Each pack includes a model and 20-30 Scenario Cards. The Gorgosaurus and the Visitor are available unpainted or pre-painted by Dust Studio.\nBelow is a video demonstration showing what a turn can look like in the game, by lead designer Martin Takaichi. It doesn\u2019t go into detail about every rule (there\u2019s the downloadable rulebook for that, see below) but gives you a good sense about how the game flows and general gameplay.\nTo let you to try out Tales from the Loop \u2013 The Board Game for yourself, we\u2019ve decided to provide a Print & Play kit for download. It doesn\u2019t contain everything that will be in the final game, but four characters and one scenario is enough to play the game with three other friends! If you just want to read the beta rules the rulebook is available for download.\nDo keep in mind that this is in only a prototype in Alpha state \u2013 things can and will change from the P&P version to the final version. In fact, that\u2019s another reason we wanted to do this, to get feedback from you so we can make the game the best it can be. Use this survey to provide feedback and report on errors.\nLINK TO THE PRINT AND PLAY FILES\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nIn addition, backer Timothy Clark has made two excellent videos that go through how to set up the Alpha and pretty much all the rules for the game in a clear and engaging way.

His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian and American landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. Tales from the Loop was ranked one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias\u201d by The Guardian, along with such works as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nMartin Takaichi has been a board game enthusiast since first discovering Drakborgen (aka DungeonQuest) in 1985. Over the years he made a slow transition from not only playing games but first modifying them and then designing them as well. The first published game where he was part of the design team was Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nThe design team beyond Simon and Martin consists of project manager Tomas H\u00e4renstam (lead designer of Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game and roleplaying games ALIEN, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), map artist Reine Rosenberg, graphic designer Christian Granath, co-designer Nils Karl\u00e9n, and last but not least Paolo Parente and his Dust Studio who produce the miniatures as well as all physical components of the game.  Dust is an acclaimed manufacturer of quality miniatures since 2005, producing their own Dust 1947 line as well as miniatures for board game companies like CMON, Monolith and Mythic Games.\nFree League Publishing is a Swedish publisher dedicated to speculative fiction. We have published a range of award-winning and critically acclaimed tabletop roleplaying games, board games and art books set in strange and wondrous worlds.\nOur game range include the recently launched official ALIEN RPG, the Tales from the Loop RPG (winner of five ENnie Awards 2017, including Best Game), sandbox retro fantasy Forbidden Lands (winner of four ENnie Awards 2019), postapocalyptic Mutant: Year Zero (Silver ENnie for Best Rules 2015), space opera Coriolis - The Third Horizon (Judge's Spotlight Award 2017), dark fantasy Symbaroum, and Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nWe have also published the art books Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood  by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, as well as the illustrated edition of the Lovecraft classic The Call of Cthulhu by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Baranger.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you pledge on Kickstarter you put your trust in a project before it is completed and you contribute, with this trust, to making Tales From the Loop - The Board Game a reality.

These are difficult and uncertain times, and at present, our international distribution of physical products has been temporarily suspended due to restrictions following the outbreak of the Corona virus.

THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO SHARED THE LINK!\nSocial Media stretch goals work very similarly to normal stretchgoals, the only difference is that we do not count the total money raised but instead how many people backed the campaign using the link below:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/townsmith/townbuilder-unlimited?ref=c5kajm\nThe Social Media Stretchgoals will be added to every pledge (even the Apprentice) FOR FREE. So if you guys share the link on your social media, post it into groups and send it to people that might be interested in the project, everyone gets something out of it! So please help up reach more people by sharing the link above!\n\n\n\n\nWe heard your feedback and we went back to the drawing board. Townbuilder Unlimited is what we came up with.\nThe Townbuilder is a web application with which you can create custom 3D printable buildings for Tabletop Games. We provide detailed 3D models in the form of small building blocks that you can then use to create the perfect building for your table. All of our buildings can be printed support free and feature playable interior.\nYou can either start from scratch or modify one of our many prepared templates to fit your needs.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you back this campaign, you will get unlimited access to the Townbuilder, meaning you can build, download and print as many buildings as you want... forever. Depending on the reward tier you back at, you will gain access to different themes, which will be available to you in the Townbuilder.\n\nWe are working with  2nd Dynasty to bring SciFi into the Townbuilder! These tiles ARE NOT PART OF THE CAMPAIGN PLEDGES and will cost you 15\u20ac as an addon. For a lot more info check our update on this.\nWe have partnered up with the awesome folk from Arcane Minis who just ran the Skies of Sordane campaign.\nThrough this collab every backer that gets access to Premium Set II: Steampunk will get Steampunk themed airports added to their pledge for FREE. These will be modular as everything in the Townbuilder, allowing you to go for any width and lenght.\nBenny and his team at Arcane Minis will also create interchangeable stands that will allow the ships to dock to our buildings, raising and lowering them to fit with our 50mm height system!\nTheir Kickstarter special prices and exclusive Arcane Dragon Mini are only available until May 1st, so head on over and show them some love from us!\nCHECK OUT THE SKIES OF SORDANE LATE PLEDGES HERE\nThe usefulness of our tool relies upon a large selection of themes to choose from. There are only so many classical medieval buildings one can print before being fed up.\nThat is why our main focus for the future is expanding our themes. As a proof of concept that the Townbuilder has potential, we chose very classical themes. These are represented by our \"Basic Sets\", which are included in every pledge level and also in the free version of the Townbuilder.\nThe Basic Themes include Stone, Fachwerk, some Miscellaneous Items, and corresponding Medieval Roofs.\nCheck out our showcases below but note that they do not display all models individually as this would simply take up to much time and work.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premium Sets will be the two choices of the community and will be modeled as soon as the Kickstarter closes. If you are a backer, you can find the link to the poll in their respective update posts or on the top of the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe don't have any 3D models to show so far since they will be modeled after... well we know what they will be.\nPremium Set I has officially been decided: It will be Sewers and Caves, for which we have some concept art below.\nPremium Set II has also been decided: It will be Steampunk, check it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownbuilder Basic\nThe Basic is free for everyone. As soon as you sign up for a free account after the Kickstarter you can try out the Townbuilder and even testprint some buildings. Obviously we want to encourage buying the Townbuilder, therefore the functionality of the Basic version is... well pretty basic.\nTownbuilder Unlimited\nThe Unlimited Version has everything you need to build hundreds of custom houses. Every functionality we think makes using the Townbuilder easier will be included here.\nTownbuilder Infinite\nThe Infinite Version adds nothing you need... but a lot of things you want. Want a 20 story high wizard tower? If your PC can handle it, knock yourself out. Want to create nice rendered pictures of your building while exploring them in first person perspective, seeing through the eyes of a miniature, here you go!  Want to create a custom sign for each guild of your world, with their custom logo and name... guess what? Townbuilder Infinite is for you.\n\n\n\n\nApprentice\nThe \"Apprentice Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition and all Basic sets. This tier allows you to create an endless number of buildings in the classical medieval fantasy style. Perfect for people that want to get started in the hobby or that just want to test out the tool for a low price.\nJourneyman\nThe \"Journeyman Townbuilder\" also includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition but a lot more models. Two additional sets are included here, which will be based on community decision so you can influence what you get. And then all Stretchgoals that will be unlocked are also included here. So if the Kickstarter takes off, you will get a lot of different models for your money, enabling you to build all kinds of different buildings.\nMaster\nThe \"Master Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Infinite\". In this premium Townbuilder Version, you will find loads of cool features that let you enhance your gameplay. These range from a rendering studio that allows you to walk around in and outside your building and take screenshots of it, to a custom logo and text tool, which will allow you to upload your own custom logos and add them to banners and signs inside the Townbuilder. We have a lot of plans for these cool gadgety features and we already started working on some of them as the development of all basic features comes to a close.\nGuild Head\nThe \"Smith's guild head\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one additional feature: You get to decide two 100% custom models that we will sculpt for you and add to the Townbuilder. This can be anything you want, from a vegetable garden for your farm village to the symbol of your game's largest Kingdom as a banner to be affixed to your buildings. This allows for a whole new level of customization. Just an idea though, choose something that you want to use a lot, something that we don't feature yet and that will be a common feature for your buildings. \nSyndicate Leader\nThe \"Smith's syndicate leader\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one teeny tiny additional feature... You are playing a Steampunk game but the community didn't vote for the steampunk stretchgoal? Boy, do I have something for you.\nYOU GET TO COMMISSION A SET !!!!\nYes you can trust your eyes, this is an actual tier we offer. We will create a custom set for you and do our best to make it as close to your wishes as possible while still having it fit with our system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach the 1000\u20ac that are necessary to keep the servers running for the coming years, the real fun begins. If you are unfamiliar with the way stretch goals work, here is a quick introduction: Whenever the campaign's funding reaches a certain threshold a stretch goal is unlocked. If we raise enough money to keep the office running for a full month, we can release an additional set at no cost, that's the basic idea.\nEach stretch goal unlocked means you get more bang for your buck and we get to do what we love as a job, win-win!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have partnered with the awesome folks of OTP Miniatures and Scenery to offer you guys the option to get your buildings printed!\nThough we don't offer printed Kickstarter tiers this time around, every backer of the Kickstarter will receive 10% off their first order for a building created in the Townbuilder at OTP's shop. This way you get your print at the same discount as if it was bought during the Kickstarter.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will also offer seller licenses. If you own a print shop or offer a printing service, feel free to reach out to us via info@townsmith.de .\n\n\n\n\nWe are a small company from Saarland, Germany. Our team consists of (currently four) tabletop enthusiasts, who love nerdy shit and who enhance tabletop games with 3D printing! Tom, Christopher, and Monika are computer scientists and Leevke is our intermedia designer.\nChristopher \"Korson\" Adam - PM, CEO, 3D Dev, 3D printing Enthusiast, DM\n\"Greetings! I'm the guy, who brought 3D printing to Townsmith. I've been playing tabletop games, namely Dungeons and Dragons, for just about 4 years now. I found out very early that being the game master was perfect for me and I've GMd ever since.\nI soon developed a need for something more than just a piece of paper when designing my encounters. Equipped with a cheap Anet A8, I began to delve deep into 3D printing for tabletop games. From then on, my arsenal of both models and printers started growing until I got frustrated with the limited customization options for the terrain that is out there.\nFor Townsmith, I take on the role of the project manager, 3D programmer, and CEO. If anything weird happens in the Townbuilder, yeah that's most likely my fault.\"\nTom \"Zatho\" Zahlbach, CTO, Webdeveloper - Fullstack, DM, Player, Documentation Enthusiast\n\"Hey, I'm Tom. I'm the guy that had to read around 300 pages of Amazon Web Services documentation to get this project hosted for all of you. So yeah, I am somewhat of a masochist ... but, I also got to code a bunch which, if anything in this world, I adore. Everything website-related and invisible to you, as well as all the things behind the website, are written mostly by me. Additionally, I also take care of our AWS infrastructure. In my free time, I play D&D 5e with my friends both as a player and as a DM\nFor Townsmith I take on the role of CTO. Which... well, says not much since I get to help with everything that needs to be worked on.\"\nMonika \"Her Smolness\" Unruh - Lead 3D Artist, Dice Enthusiast, Player\n\"Hey I'm Monika, I'm a Scorpio and 1,62 m tall, whatever you want to do with that information. I've known Tom and Christopher since school and started playing DnD with them in 2017, which made me become a dice-hoarder. When the two of them came up with the idea of Townsmith I was really hyped about it. Half-jokingly I asked them if they needed someone to help with the 3D modeling since I'm somewhat of an artistic person and was interested in trying digital art and 3D modeling.\nTo my surprise, they said yes and so I came on board and am now a 3D modeler for Townsmith, but I'm still learning, so if the models start floating randomly that's probably on me.\"\nOliver \"Ore\" Inglen - Master of the positive aura\n\"Hello, my name is Oliver. I am new to the world of tabletops, dungeons and dragons, but have been working in 3D and modeling for many years. Actually, I was working in the field of architectural modeling and visualizations until a mutual friend brought me to Christopher. Since then I have been working on my sculpturing techniques for modeling your feature blocks and will also do some concept art! I am really happy to be able to support the Townsmith team while doing fun work. If you have any suggestions for details, get in touch with me. Can\u00b4t wait to model all this!\"\nLeevke \"Insomnyu\" Reher - Concept Artist, Supporting 3D Artist, Meme Enthusiast\n\"Ahoy! I'm Leev! My full name is Leevke Fee Thordis Reher but that's kinda overkill, so call me Leev. I've been playing lots of Pen&Paper in my early childhood but couldn't seem to find a fitting group when I got older. But in 2018, I was introduced to Christopher and his great dedication to Dungeons and Dragons. Since I'm currently studying InterMedia Design, the opportunity to do my internship at Townsmith presented itself.\nI joined shortly before the Kickstarter launched, so until now I did some of the concept art. Later I'll dive into some of the 3D Modeling and digital design for the community voted themes. So if there's anything wrong, blame the others, I'm innocent.\"\nIf you have any questions about us or what we do, feel free to join our Discord Server and get in touch with us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can clearly see, we are a very young team.\nThis is our first project though not our first Kickstarter campaign. A few months ago we already launched a Kickstarter with a different business model. We have learned a lot since then and we also improved the Townbuilder.\n\nStill, we are inexperienced by industry standards (Printable Scenery, Heroforge, Fat Dragon Games, etc.). Though we do our best to be responsive and professional, but our lack of experience will be visible when it comes to some aspects.\nWill the site be up 100% of the time? I doubt it.\nWill we fix it as soon as it goes down? Yes, we will.\nWill the range of themes increase as fast as heroforge's does? Well, it depends. It took us about three months to get the current models going, but we have gotten a lot faster at it and we will have more time to invest into modeling since there will be less programming work to do.\n\nMost importantly: The Townbuilder is basically ready for release weeks before the launch of the Kickstarter and we only need to polish up a few things, including the UX. There is little risk that you will not be able to create and download buildings after the Kickstarter closes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe sell software which is about as resistant to wear and tear as it gets.\nReusability and recyclability\nPLA, which is the main material used in home 3D printing, is bio-degradable.

Towers above 7\" (about 177mm) tall will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers.\n_______________________________________________________________\nThese towers will be design to print well on smaller FDM Printers! The towers will be designed to be between 177 - 228 mm (7-9 inches) high, the taller towers will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers. Being 3D models, they can be any size that your printer can support, so you can print them smaller (if you have a small printer) or larger (for large dice) if desired.\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a tower? I Although we won\u2019t be selling physical towers through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 14 towers, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We\u2019ve been contacted by several makers who are excited about selling these towers, so we believe we will have a network of amazing makers who will offer printed products! We plan on listing all (opted in) Merchant info (location, url, contact info, etc.) on the campaign page (after funding) so everyone can find a maker to order printed towers.\n_______________________________________________________________\nWhy Dice Towers? Dice towers help to prevent cheating - and allow Fate do her job! Dice Towers also add an extra level of character to your game! Each tower will include a dice tray to help protect fancy pants tables from heavy metal dice damage.

I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill.

THEY are the ones in control of the signal, and it\u2019s your mission to take them down!\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a game if it were that easy...\nThere are enemies hiding in your midst attempting to sabotage your progress, and even some of your own team may not be who they say they are. As a member of the resistance, it\u2019s your job to weed out the traitors and take them down before it\u2019s too late.\nLucky for you\u2026 you have these! Now put them on, or start eating that trash can. \nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 is directly inspired by the themes of the movie; it's rich and poor divide and the battle to control the system. The game involves collecting resources and banking them for use in the final assault, just like the end of the film.\nYour role will vary depending on if you\u2019re playing as a Human or an Invader. One will have you attempting to save humanity, the other will have you fighting to maintain your position as their overlords.\nBelow is a basic breakdown of the roles you fill to complete your mission.  \nHuman or Invader - either way, you\u2019re going to need your cunning, reasoning, and a trusty pair of Hoffman Lenses to win! \n\u201cI take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.\u201d\nThis is the exciting bit\u2026\nThe Hoffman Lenses have no need for apps, phones or a computer. Just like the movie, simply put them over your eyes to see the truth!! We\u2019ve worked closely with our production team to ensure that our art and design aesthetic works in a simple, real-world way.\nPlayers can use the lenses to inspect and uncover Invader interference in three ways:\n Uncovering hidden enemy players - Players will be able to risk their glasses and enter a PVP encounter. If successful, the winner will be able to look at the losing player\u2019s character card and see their true identity. The question is, will the others believe you?\n Uncovering enemy sabotage - Before assets enter the final assault stash, they will need to be deposited at resistance locations. As a human, it\u2019s your responsibility to check items with the glasses before they go to the stash. This will allow you to identify and discard any sabotaged cards! As an Invader, you\u2019ll need to identify the sabotaged items and sneak them into the stash- ready to thwart the final assault.\n Checking the billboards - Resistance hideouts have billboards (cards) to identify them. Each contains hidden messages from Invaders that they use to coordinate their raids. It\u2019s important to know where your items are and understand the risk of potential raids, otherwise, they may get confiscated.\nThe Hoffman Lenses are one of the most unique and exciting parts of the game. They are also one of your most valuable assets in preparing for your assault on Cable 54! Limited tokens dictate the number of times you can use the glasses, so you will need to be tactical with how and when you choose to put them on. Get it wrong, and you could be left unprepared for an emergency situation!\n Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against the Invaders?\nCan a corrupt politician find redemption?\nCan a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer?\nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 allows you to play as new and exciting original characters, as well as iconic ones from the movie, in a dynamic narrative-driven board game that is full of twists and turns. Each character is fully fleshed out with their own personal adventure that fits into the world of They Live.\nThese stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomized, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play.\nThese carefully constructed stories have different endings depending on if you\u2019re playing as a human or an invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the invaders, or sabotaging the resistance!\nHow your personal story works:\nEach player will start with an Awakening Card at the beginning of the game. This will set the scene, explain who you are, and tell the story of how you came to know about the Invaders (although... this may be a cover story). After the Awakening Card, it\u2019s completely up to you how, when and if you uncover the next part of your adventure.\nYou must successfully complete four randomized cards from your personal story deck to experience the ending and unlock your unique character item. However, just like in real life, if you mess things up you can't go back and change it.\n Each turn is split into 4 phases. The following diagram explains how each phase works: \nThe main game will involve the players looking at their cards and knowing if they are a Human or an Invader to assume the correct role. For obvious reasons, this doesn\u2019t really work for 1 player and could even mean outnumbered play for lower player counts.\n\u2018Blind Play\u2019 will involve the player or players controlling multiple characters. All taking part in the adventure without knowing their character\u2019s allegiance. You can enter PVP and engage your own characters, using the glasses to uncover the possible enemy within. If you do find a traitor in your midst, the game will take over control of the uncovered Invader and activate a separate Invader behavior deck.\nIf Invaders in your party make it all the way to the \u2018Final Assault\u2019 they will become active and produce significant debuffs to your character and engage with you in combat.\nThis mode is currently in the testing phase with additional behavior card art in development. \nTonight is the last stand for the resistance - the enemy strikes at dawn!\nThe game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the 'Final Assault' before the clock hits midnight.\nThe 'Final Assault' contains three story-based trials that will need to be overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level players that have been developed throughout the game. You will also need a good stash of weapons, items, and allies to be victorious.\nEach of the three trials will test your skills and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It\u2019s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.\nWith the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history.\nIf you fail, well, things will be a lot worse\u2026\n All of the other core rules are in our attached rulebook below. This includes details on combat (PVE and PVP), actions, stats, skills and more.\nThis is a continually evolving process in terms of explaining the game in a way that is suitable for public consumption. You will see this updated throughout the campaign, and after, concluding with the finished document before release and print. \nBase game components for the standard edition of the game.\n*Please note this does not include stretch goals unless stated, all numbers could increase through through further development*\n\nAdditional cards may be added for the 1-3 player \u2018Blind Play\u2019 mode. \nAndrew Aitcheson - Co-Creator\nMovie geek and game enthusiast, who has previously worked in the education field and has designed a number of teaching aids and games for adult learning.

If the delays that we have allowed for do not materialize then shipping will occur much earlier than the specified dates.\n\nRisk \u2013 The technology we are using for the glasses has not been used in board games ever before, does it work?\n\nAction Taken \u2013 The polarisation technology that we are employing is one that is currently in use in sunglasses already, it just has never been deployed for the purpose of identifying Invaders among us. We work directly with our factory (and not via a trading partner) which results in much stricter control for production. We have worked closely with the production team to develop the game technology and ensure that everything works as it needs to before getting to the point of Kickstarter.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed and updated as the project develops, highlighting any potential issues, but also keeping you up to date with the first looks and latest progress.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the factory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the factory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via your credit card.\n\nThis project is funded in the UK. All refunds will be issued in \u00a3 in the exact amount of \u00a3 received, minus applicable Kickstarter and payment processing fees depending on the time of your refund request.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe game has been designed in a way that does not require any external computers, phones or apps.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\n\nCharity information:\n* We will be donating up to $15,000 to Direct Relief.  \nPer Kickstarter rules, no money collected for this campaign will go towards any donations.  All proceeds for charity will be donated from our own funds outside this campaign.  The charity we are donating to is Direct Relief.  Direct Relief works in the U.S. and internationally to equip doctors and nurses with life-saving medical resources to care for the world's most vulnerable people.

Let\u2019s take a brief look at setup and each of the four pillars now.  \nSetup\nIf this is your first time playing, open the scenario book and follow the directions to setup your first pilot and ship. Take a player board, Modifier deck, Pilot mat, progression sheet, Ship mat, and both pilot and ship miniatures. Choose your starting equipment from you current unlocked equipment. You are now ready for your next mission!\nSpace Exploration\nThe Sparrow travels across the Draconian System in search of a home. Manage your ship\u2019s resources as you explore new regions of space and embark on missions fighting to survive through the unknown. Even if you are out of resources you can continue exploring, but you risk starting your next encounter at a disadvantage.\n  Space Combat\nYou and your squad will launch from the hangars of The Sparrow to battle against various enemies throughout your journey in Stars of Akarios. Thankfully you are equipped with the latest ships powered by modern thrusters and advanced weaponry. Assign your action dice to various attacks and maneuvers as you fight your way to victory. Space Combat is the main component of Stars of Akarios gameplay.\n  World Exploration\nDuring your adventures across the Draconian system in Stars of Akarios, you will need to leave your fighters to explore hostile worlds and ships. World Exploration is discovery-focused, putting your cunning to the test as you seek new home for your civilization. Use your pilots skills to complete the challenges you encounter in the limited time available,\n  Pilot & Ship Customization\nYour Pilot's skills will grow as you test your grit against the enemies in Stars of Akarios. Upgrade you characters unique abilities and skill trees, allowing you to customize your play experience. But what\u2019s a pilot without a ship? Equip your ship with various engine, weapons and technology components for virtually limitless combinations. Re-equip your ships before missions, choosing the best weapon and thruster upgrades for each mission.\n                  Unique End-Game Raid System\nIn each act of the game there is a high-level scenario which combines space combat and world exploration to create a unique experience. These raids require a dedicated squad equipped with the best tech. While a typical scenario would last between 30-60 minutes, raids require 1-2 hours to complete. But it is only in raids that you can find the best equipment and gear for your pilot and ship. These raids are designed to be highly-repayable and are perfect for the squads who want to dig deep in Stars of Akarios. \nEvolving storyline\nThe Story of Stars of Akarios is an evolving narrative which will be shaped by your decisions. Early on in the story you will be faced with decisions which will impact the remainder of your campaign. Each playthrough of Stars of Akarios will feel unique as your choices and squad morality will open/close potential story paths and create unique endings for your group.\nDual-Layered Goodness\nWe have taken cues from the video game world and designed intuitive user-interfaces for the players and enemies. The player boards and enemy card holders allow you to see the status of ships, combat effects and special abilities without flipping through a rulebook. Each of these boards are dual-layered to provide great functionality while guarding against those erratic table-knockers!\nEasy Setup and Teardown\nYour time is valuable and we want to honor it. We are working closely with Game Trayz to provide an optimal storage solution for quick setup and tear-down. Probably the single greatest factor to creating ease of setup is our dedication to removing unnecessary tokens. You will have noticed that we do not advertise \u201c300+ tokens\u201d with Stars of Akarios. It\u2019s not because our game does not have complexity or status effects, we have just found a way to track all of that with our dual-layered boards using universal cubes. No more digging into the bottom of your box to find that one \u201cstun\u201d token.\nDirection-Based Space Combat\nTaking cues from great games such as X-Wing, Stars of Akarios strives to create intense \u201cdog-fights\u201d in space. Enemies respond dynamically to your actions and you must always be thinking about the direction your ship faces. All movement in Stars of Akarios is direction-based and most of your attacks will be too! This means you are going to have to plan how to flank your enemies to get an advantaged attack from behind.\nLeave Your Ship and Explore New Worlds\nOne of our team\u2019s favorite parts of Stars of Akarios is the ability to step off of our ships and explore new worlds in what we call \u201cWorld Exploration\u201d (AKA away missions). The blending of dungeon-crawling esque game-play mechanics in Space Combat with exploration and discovery-focused in World Exploration is an ambitious next-step for what a board game can be. Tie this all together with the meta-experience of controlling The Sparrow in the quest for a new home and you have an epic sci-fi experience.\n                    This project is promoted by Green Inbox\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFUNDING: We need your help to make Starlight a reality! Only if we hit our funding goal by the end of the campaign will we be able to do this!\n\nSHIPPING: Shipping is charged after the campaign in our Pledgemanager. Shipping will need to be paid in full prior to the close of our Pledgemager. We will be keeping the Pledgemanager open for an extended period to assist those who may need more time to pay the shipping.\n\nDESIGN: While the core mechanics are set and the campaign planned out, there is still a lot of writing and final balancing to occur. How much is based on what all will be included in the final game.\n\nMANUFACTURE: is being handled by Longpack Games, but international shipping always has the potential for delays and complications. Unexpected delays often happen due to; Production delays, Shipping delays, or Customs delays.\n\nCOMMUNICATION: Inevitably, something will occur during the entire process that we were unable to foresee. If things run behind schedule, we think the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers. It's our goal to make post-campaign updates part of this experience and we plan to update bi-weekly until production has begun in order to keep backers informed of the progress. We're going to do our best to keep these updates fun for everyone, so join us to follow along!\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is August 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of refunding no questions asked minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back after 14 days). If however we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in CAD and any refunds processed will be in CAD for the exact amount received in CAD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nThis campaign occurs using Canadian currency (CAD). Any other currency values shown throughout the campaign are estimates at the time of campaigns launch. Other currency values may differ at the conclusion of the Kickstarter based on market fluctuation. Final charges will be based on each currencies exchange rate to CAD at the time of payment processing.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 12 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow Along & Retailer Pledge", "descp": "Follow along with the Starlight Campaign!

As soon as we get inventory we sell out within a month or two..\n(Our machinists can't keep up with the demand!) \n-- Don't worry we let them sleep a full night, and give them plenty of breaks (QA is very important to us!)\nOver the past 4 years we've launched multiple versions in different sizes, with an assortment of different improvements. (Some of which were recommendations from our very own backers!)\nWe've taken all these recommendations, and what we've learned from our other toothpicks and we are putting together what we think is the best toothpick we've ever produced! \nAfter 4 years of refinement we are super excited to announce..\nThe TiPick 2.0. \nFrom left to right: TiPick 1.0 (2016) - Xtal 1.0 (2019) - MiPick 1.0 (2019) - TiPick 2.0 (2020)\nThe TiPick 2.0\u2122  is precision CNC machined from solid billets of Grade 5 Titanium.\nSome of the key improvements with TiPick 2.0 VS 1.0\n Improved Keyhook (The keyhook is sleeker which looks better, but it's new design is much easier to use)\n Improved Knurls (This allows for easier and quicker access to your toothpick, even with wet or slippery hands)\n Improved O-ring (The new body design allows for a tighter o-ring fit, so you won't ever lose your toothpick)\n\n Nerdy Spec Stuff \ud83e\udd13\nWeight :: 2.8grams\nLength :: 35mm Closed; 56mm Open\nThickness :: 6mm\nMaterial :: Grade 5 Titanium\nWarranty :: Lifetime (Just don't lose it..that's not covered under the warranty)\nPolished Finish\nTruth be told\u2026\nThe TiPick 2.0 isn\u2019t just a toothpick.

Here are just a few messages and comments we have received over the years. \nOk.. Let's talk about rewards...\nIn order for me to get the TiPick 2.0 into your sweaty palms... is by ensuring I can get my minimum quantity produced.\nThe actual cost for me to produce each toothpick is pretty high for these reasons:\n1. The Quality of Material I use (The Very Best)\n2. The time it takes to build each one of these little suckers (Very Time Intensive)\n3. Current lack of quality machinists available (I only hire the best of the best)\nBut here's why it get's good for you:\nMe and the team have put together some EXCLUSIVE Kickstarter rewards. \nTake a look and decide which rewards work best for you.\nOnce you've decided on the reward you want.. just scroll to the top of this page and click on the corresponding Reward you desire.\nThis will \"lock in\" this EXCLUSIVE pricing, RIGHT NOW.\nOne more thing I wanted to mention:\nBacking this project is the ONLY way you will be able to guarantee this exclusive pricing for the TiPick 2.0\nP.S. TiPick 2.0 will retail for $39.99. (After Kickstarter).\nTo products that last a lifetime,\nKendell\nTiPick 2.0 has an unconditional money back guarantee\nWe take pride in ALL the products that we create and sell. The TiPick 2.0 is no exception to that rule either.\nIf you are not satisfied with the TiPick 2.0 for any reason, we have a 100% money back guarantee.\nThe TiPick 2.0 also has a lifetime guarantee, if for any reason you break your toothpick, we will replace it no questions asked!\n(Like we've said before..just don't lose it..that's not covered!\nMost titanium products are CRAZY expensive because they last forever.\nSo who cares.. And why is this so great..\nWell for starters the process for any titanium based alloy product to be made is extremely detailed. The process starts with a process known as the Kroll Process. During this process the main ore is treated with a gas called chlorine gas in order to produce titanium tetrachloride. This is then taken through a process of purification, and is then reduced into a metallic titanium sponge which happens from a reaction with sodium. After this the alloying process takes place to the titanium sponge. This process is very labor intensive and this is why titanium products are always more expensive to the \u201clesser metals\u201d like steel and aluminum.\nTruth be told\u2026\nThe TiPick 2.0 isn\u2019t just a toothpick.

A descriptor-based game prioritizes the descriptor over the effects. An effect-based game prioritizes the effects over the descriptor.\nAscendant strives to be neither a descriptor-based nor effect-based game. It is, rather, a physics-based game. The game mechanics are intended to be the physics engine of the game world. Powers have both descriptors and effects. Some effects are precluded by the logic of the descriptor, and some descriptors inevitably entail certain effects. The mechanics are elaborate and detailed (as in an effect-based game) but they are also broad and universalized (as in a descriptor-based game). Players are expected and encouraged to use their powers in whatever manner makes sense within the physics of a comic-book world, but not in ways that don\u2019t make sense.\nIf a descriptor-based system aims to let players experience a comic-book story, and an effect-based system aims to let players play a superhero game, our physics-based system aims to let players simulate a comic book world. To do so, we have created logarithmic chart-based universal mechanics, a style of design that has not been widely used in the last two decades, but which will be instantly familiar to fans of the classic FASERIP and MEGS RPGs from the 1980s.  \nLearning the Game  \nThe easiest way to learn about Ascendant is to get walked through a character stat block. Below is the stat block for Aurora. Previously a D-grade celebrity from a TV  reality show, her ambition to be a dazzling star in the spotlight was granted\u2026sort of\u2026 when she manifested the ability to control and generate light. Now she is one of the most famous ascendants in the world, with brand sponsorships from beauty and fashion companies, her own press team, and a prestigious membership in the Star-Spangled Squadron, America\u2019s premier team of crimefighting ascendants.   \nUp at the top you can see Aurora's Character Points, Power Limit, and Challenge Rating. Character Points (CP) are used to construct characters. An average human has 200 CP. A trained soldier has 240 CP. An exceptionally impressive, formidable and renowned human in the real world has 400 CP.  Every 80 CP represents an approximate doubling of the character\u2019s competency across all capabilities. With 940 Character Points, Aurora is one of the 20 most powerful superhumans in the world. Power Limit constrains how  characters can allocate their CP and is analogous to class level in a D20 RPG. Challenge Rating shows how powerful a character is relative to a trained soldier. Aurora can defeat 500 US infantry simultaneously - she's a tough woman.  \nOver on the right, below her image, you'll see Aurora's Primary Attributes: Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Valor (VAL), Resolve (RES), Insight (INS), and Charisma (CHA). Each of these Primary Attributes are rated in Supermetric Points (SP). SP are logarithmic; each additional one SP has a value equal to double the amount of the previous SP.  Ordinary people have 3 SPs in each of their Primary Attributes, and the most impressive humans typically have no more than 5 SP in any Primary Attribute. With 7 SPs of Agility, Aurora is four times more agile than an Olympic athlete. With 12 SPs of Charisma, Aurora is 500 times more magnetic and alluring than any ordinary person.\nTo the left of the Primary Attributes are Aurora's Secondary Attributes, which rate factors like Initiative, Passive Spotting Range, Height, Income, and more. With a Flight Speed of 14 SPs, Aurora can fly at Mach 24!\nBelow the Variable Attributes we list Aurora's Powers. Her most important Power is Agile Light Control. Light Control is a pre-defined Power Set that allows her to emulate many other powers.  (The rules let you build your own power sets if you want, yes!)   \nThe word Agile in front of Light Control is a modifier that changes how the power works. In this case, it means that Aurora uses her Light Control in conjunction with her Agility rather than her Insight. Between Powers, Power Sets, and Modifiers, there are infinite possibilities available to make virtually any character you can imagine.\nBelow Powers we've listed Aurora's Skills. Skills can be substituted for Primary Attributes for specific purposes. For instance, Aurora has 14 SPs of Aerial Combat. If she's the target of a ranged attack while she's flying, she can substitute her Aerial Combat score for her Agility score, making her much harder to hit. \nBelow the Primary Attributes, you can see Aurora's Perks and Drawbacks. Perks function similarly to Feats in a D20 RPG. Some of the most important Perks are the Combat Maneuvers, which allow you to trade damage for accuracy and vice versa. Aurora's got two Combat Maneuvers as well as a host of other Perks related to her status as a celebrity member of the elite Star-Spangled Squadron.\nAurora has a number of minor Drawbacks such as her Code of Honor (\"always be fabulous\") as well as one very serious Drawback called a Vulnerable State. A Vulnerable State models all the situations that can result in heroes becoming weaker or losing their powers. Exposed to meteorites from your homeworld? Caught out of your powered armor? Forgot to recharge your power ring? Not angry enough to turn green? All modeled with Vulnerable State. Aurora's Vulnerable State is that all of her powers are based on her egoistic desire to be a star; if she's ever reduced to 0 Determination, she gets depressed, loses her superpowers, and acquires a host of flaws. \nSpeaking of Determination, that's one of the game's Variable Attributes. The other one is Health, and both are listed near the top of the sheet. These are like Hit Points in a D20 Game. Unlike the other Attributes, Variable Attributes aren't rated in SP, just in raw numbers, so that when you deal and take damage it's all scaled correctly.\nAs for how the game itself works, it's so easy even a 200-CP ordinary human can play it! Anytime you want to make an Action, you choose your Action Value (AV) and then subtract the Difficulty Value (DV) to yield a Resolution Value (RV). You then roll 1d100 on the Challenge Action Resolution Table, or CHART, to see your Color Result. The CHART is carefully structured so that the expected values for any AV versus any RV are exactly what they ought to be, given the logarithmic nature of the Attributes.  (It's pretty slick if you like math and we'll update on this in more detail later.)   \nLet's simulate Aurora shooting a Thermal Blast at the blindsighted assassin Helen Killer. Down at the bottom of her sheet, we've listed Aurora's Attacks. Each Attack has an Action Value and a Base Damage. If Aurora fires a Thermal Blast at Helen Killer, her AV for the Attack is 14 SPs and her Base Damage is 256. Her DV for the Attack is Helen's Combat Sense, which happens to be 13 SPs. That gives Aurora an RV of 14 - 13 = +1 on the CHART. Let's say her player rolls a 32. Scanning across the \"1\" row of the RV (Attack) column, we see that 32 falls into the Yellow range, so Aurora has scored a Yellow result on her Attack. \nWhen you score a Green result when making an Attack, you deal Base Damage, while Yellow, Orange, and Red results increase damage by a factor of 2, 4, or 8. Since Aurora scored a Yellow result she deals 512 points of Damage to Helen Killer. Helen now gets to  apply Protection like Forcefield or Invulnerability, then Roll With the Attack to reduce Damage in exchange for taking on various Conditions like \"Dazed\" or \"Staggered\".\nWe'll discuss the rules more in future updates but if you want more details, be sure to check out the sneak preview of the game\u2019s first two chapters at the link below!   \nWhat if Superhumans Had Just Emerged?\nEnough about rules. Let's talk about setting! Ascendant includes an optional campaign setting inspired by comics like Watchmen, The Boys, Squadron Supreme, The Authority, and Invincible. The world of Ascendant  doesn't begin to diverge from that of our real world until 2012, and the first superheroes don't go public until the Battle of Atlanta in 2018, meaning your player characters will be among the first superhumans to ever don tights and fight crime.  The setting is presented as an epistolary novel made up of leaked documents, transcripts, newspaper clippings, and emails that you can print out and give to your players - like this one.   \nOf course, we also include statistics for all of the major characters and organizations presented in the backstory, too. If you're intrigued, be sure to download the sneak preview of the campaign setting by clicking on the image below.  (Art and layout not yet final!)   \nThe Art of Ascendant  \nComics are a visual medium and no comic book game should be without amazing illustrations. We\u2019ve secured a team of top comic book artists to bring the world of Ascendant to life. Here's some samples of the artwork we've already commissioned. With your support, there'll be lots more!   \nAIRBORNE faces STILETTO in a rooftop battle between hero and anti-hero\nHyperkinetic teleporter WARP confronts blindsighted assassin HELEN KILLER\nThe world's first (and only) ascended manatee, LEVITEE, visits NYC on his Goodwill Tour\nAURORA of the Star-Spangled Squadron is greeted by adoring fans\nPledge Levels  \nAre you ready to pledge?

In addition all reward levels above that will get all stretch goals in PDF, too.*\nPLEASE NOTE  your pledge does NOT include the cost of shipping.

However, in our last Kickstarter, we suffered a six-month delay. The causes of the delay were twofold. First, we added some additional material via stretch goals that took time to write. Second, we committed to full color art but only had one artist. For this Kickstarter, none of our stretch goals will require delays for writing, and we've got a team of five artists on tap to handle the illustrations. \n\nMost of the rewards are digital and will be delivered via DriveThruRPG. For printed material, we use McNaughton & Gunn, a US-based publishing house, so the current disruptions to the global supply chain shouldn't have any effect on us. \n\nWe're grateful for your interest, and hope to see you as a backer!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Vigilante", "descp": "Be one of the first to receive a PDF copy of the Ascendant core rules.\nINCLUDES:\nAscendant PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["109 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Vigilante + Sidekick", "descp": "Be one of the first to receive a PDF copy of the Ascendant core rules *and* get a PDF version of all the stretch goals that unlock.\nINCLUDES:\nAscendant PDF\nAll Stretch Goal Products in PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["115 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Crimefighter", "descp": "Be one of the first to receive a softcover copy of the Ascendant core rules.

Our books are also available from your FLGS or favourite online retailer. \nOptional purchases will not increase shipping costs which we are setting based on your selected pledge level (excluding digital) So you will not pay any extra shipping if you add on more books!\nTowns & Taverns Books of Battle Mats are compatible with our existing library which is available NOW from your FLGS! - We'll also make them available as optional buys in the pledge manager.\n - Our Map Book Library is Available NOW from your FLGS - \nWe are Matt Henderson (designer & production director) and Tam Henderson (everything else). We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 5 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe Released our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be releasing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books around Easter 2020, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 6th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our 3rd focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators\nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Towns & Taverns books and Slip Case. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Coronavirus\nAt time of writing Coronavirus is prevalent in China. We have worked closely with our manufacturers to understand the likely effect, and we have built extra time into our schedule to allow extra manufacturing time. At time of writing we are advised that our factory is up and running as normal however we may experience delays in other areas, for example buy in paper. We are working now to mitigate the impact of this on our business in general and this kickstarter in particular.\n\n- Brexit\nBrexit - Currently the UK is in the process of leaving the European Union. We are in a transition period until the end of December 2020, and during this period fulfilment from the UK would be EU friendly. So business as usual.\nShould we experience delays which push fulfilment outside of this transition period We will (via GamesQuest) ensure we remain EU friendly regardless of what the future relationship between the UK & EU looks like, potentially this could involve adding an EU hub to our fulfilment schedule.\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 5 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\nWe produced and delivered over 7500 book sets for our previous KickStarter - The Dungeon - and we are delighted to say we had very few production issues (we sent out less than 20 replacements). However we know this doesn't help is your book isn't perfect so we work hard to fix any issues so you're happy!\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund all our previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Digital Towns & Taverns", "descp": "Receive The designs from Towns & Taverns in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Towns & Taverns - All map designs in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nTowns & Taverns One shot 5e adventure (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}], "stat": ["614 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Towns & Taverns", "descp": "Get one copy of Towns & Taverns.\nTowns & Taverns is Two Modular 12\"x12\" Hardcover Books of RPG Encounter Maps presented in a slip case.\n*SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED.\nShipping charged at rate listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.\nINCLUDES:\nOne copy of Towns & Taverns (two Books presented as a set)\nDigital Towns & Taverns - All map designs in digital format\nAll Unlocked Physical Stretch Goals\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nTowns & Taverns One shot 5e adventure (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["523 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a335 or more", "title": "Towns & Taverns Plus", "descp": "Get one copy of Towns & Taverns PLUS a copy of the Little Book of Battle Mats - Towns & Taverns Edition\nTowns & Taverns is Two Modular 12\"x12\" Hardcover Books of RPG Encounter Maps presented in a slip case.

All games have been created along Italian authors and the illustrators that you have already seen in our previous titles. Each game has its own identity and the boxes are as small as 12x8 cm. You can carry them with you, slide the matchbox and play in just 20 minutes with cards and small bits that will make the whole experience so satisfying!\nNatural phenomena have had an odd behaviour lately, seasons seem to have been disrupted and animals are migrating in the wrong direction. The 24 East Asian traditional solar terms are out of sync. Your seasons must find their alignment so the sun can find its route again and set the order right among all living things.\nIn 15 days, players will take alternating turns. Each turn choose 2 out of 4 possible actions, trying to receive the  animals pawns for special abilities and completing sets of Season cards for the most points at the end of the game.\nMenace is approaching you. There seems to be a way out, but as a Samurai your first move is to reach for your weapons. Your basic instincts to run and hide have dissolved since the only option left is to fight for your honour. You are a rock and will hold tight, fighting the opponents face to face, using your weapons until the the very end.\nEiyo is a fast paced game where you need to strategically manage your weapons to defeat hordes of enemies. You will need to survive the attacks while gaining honour points that will be crucial at the end of the game.\nAfter relentless days spent diluting solvents and heating liquid mixtures in vials, the air is damp, while the old and overused books stored in the library of your laboratory smell of humidity and dust. The end of the day is approaching and you have just found the perfect transmutation. You decide to stay a little longer, but you know the candles will stay on until they consume completely.\nRebis is a 1\u20134 player game. To win, you have to play your alchemistic ingredients wisely in order to brew the best elixirs and find the right time to brew them to get the most points.\nThe multiverse has spoiled you given the vastness of incredible places and creatures to meet and observe. You smell spices from miles away, your pores dilate, your gills tickle and your three stomachs are growling like an echoing symphony. You get to the source of the tasty fumes faster than a ray of light, your taste buds start working as a glowing sign shows up on the horizon: \u201cServing succulent food and spicy, quenching potions during satellite setting hours.\u201d\nSpace Lunch is a 1-2 players, short, set-collection game. To win, you need to grab your preferred dishes before it\u2019s too late by choosing Food cards from the table. However, beware! Your opponent might interfere with your plans.\nThe new surface of Earth is at its most bleak appearance. It may seem completely infertile and arid, but on the horizon promising mountains of mud and clay arise higher and higher. Golems, the magical mutable creatures, are being summoned with synergies among the resources of the earth.\nGolems is a card collection game where you can use every card in two different ways. You have to decide whether you want to boost your Golem for victory points or save the resource to summon further Golems. With the use of Gems and special Runes you will be able to maximize your strategy to become the best Golem summoner.\nWe have always created games that we really enjoy playing and the Matchbox Collection is no exception, but every time we launch a new line of games, it is fundamental for us to understand if our vision resonates with you.\nAfter a year since our last campaign, we are very excited to share a brief moment with you to shape this new creation together; and this is among the most interesting and rewarding moments for us.\nKickstarter and retail are two very different worlds and both of them are extremely important for us, but sometimes you want to create something regardless of the production boundaries, and Kickstarter is the best place to shape the games we dreamt of exactly the way we envisioned them.\nThundergryph exclusive is a new way for us to experiment, understand the product better and find the best way to make it work; and while we are not offering a retail option, it doesn\u2019t mean that this line won\u2019t have a possibility of hitting retail.\nThese games might become a collectible exclusive to this campaign, but they could reach more players in the future as well. For now, this campaign is the best chance we have to offer them to you directly at an honest price and make these games happen.\nWe really appreciate your support and we thank you for being the foundation of our imagination.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is our 7th campaign, we feel that it is important for us as creators to share with you what we have learnt throughout all the other campaigns and during 2019.\n\nTIMELINE IS EVERYTHING.\n\nWhile we always set important goals for the year, revising the timeline is something we have been doing for the past 3 years, and it was not a surprise for us that Tang Garden was about to create an important change in our timeline for 2019. \nShaping the games together with our backers is one of the most interesting things of being a Kickstarter creator, but all of this additional content needs to be meticulously calculated before the campaign starts to add enough buffer time to the communicated timeline, while still being unaware of how successful a project will be.\n\nRevising the timeline affects your perception towards us and affects the company stability by postponing future releases.\n\nNEW WORKFLOW AND KICKSTARTER.\n\nWhen you back one of our campaigns, you are not pre-ordering a product, you are really helping us make the game happen. This is a feeling we don\u2019t want to lose, but we also understand that a game needs to be fulfilled at the right pace.\n\nFor the Matchbox Collection, we segmented the potential success of the project into four different outcomes and we have decided to establish the proper buffer based on the best-case scenario. This gives us room to listen to our community without compromising what we love the most about launching on Kickstarter: shaping a game together.\n\n**Please refer to our timeline section on Kickstarter, where we show how we have organized the production and freight for the Matchbox Collection.**\n\nA SETTLED PIPELINE IS MANDATORY.\n\nStarting 2019, we decided to split our team into groups. We would be working at the same time on different projects and we would request help from freelancers if needed, without compromising our main tasks as a team.\n\nToday, we are much more solid as a team, having a greater confidence on facing the challenges that the future holds, and we owe all of this to you and your support towards our projects.\nWe will always be grateful and we will always be prepared to listen and learn from your advice.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "The Matchbox Collection", "descp": "The complete collection of all five Matchbox games and all unlocked stretch goals.\nAfter the campaign, shipping costs will be collected at Backerkit, our pledge manager.

No wonder it\u2019s the 21st century and the most widely-used writing surface can\u2019t connect to the digital universe and is a doomsday device for trees. \nLegal pad users everywhere should be held in contempt! Until now. The Rocketbook Orbit is an endlessly reusable, customizable, cloud-connected pen and paper notepad.  \nMagnets + Modularity = Magic! The Orbit utilizes customized \u201cPage Packs\u201d that can be removed from the pad! Our new technology uses a magnetic base and has stainless steel rings attached to every pack of Rocketbook pages that can be lifted off the Orbit, flipped 360 degrees, and changed out for a brand new mission.    \nFor your core mission, we\u2019ll equip you with a Page Pack so you can write and sketch at the speed of light, then flip the page for your next objective. A standard lined / dot-grid combo Page Pack is included! But what about other page templates to fulfill all your handwritten needs, like planning the future, conquering your tasks, or writing a fierce space ballad? We\u2019ve got you covered at every phase.\nThe Orbit uses patented Rocketbook reusable pen and paper technology and is forged with a hard plastic composite with a textured synthetic outer layer so the vessel that protects your notes will last for lightyears to come.     \nWhat is your favorite force in the Universe? Ours is magnetism, which is why we designed the world\u2019s first magnetic binding system. Orbit \u201cPage Packs\u201d are bound with ferrous metal rings and stick to a magnetic pad. That also means the entire Orbit happens to stick to your fridge. \nRocketbook\u2019s patented technology means the Rocketbook Orbit is designed for endless reusability. First, use any Pilot FriXion product on your Rocketbook Orbit pages for a traditional handwriting experience. Then, simply use a damp cloth to wipe your pages clean again and again! We\u2019re including a Rocketbook microfiber towel for truly advanced erasing capabilities.   \nDid you know you will consume an entire tree with an average lifetime use of legal pads? Don\u2019t be a weapon of mass tree destruction. It\u2019s not cool for our planet \u2026 not to mention that ordinary, one-use legal pads just don\u2019t look cool. Rocketbook\u2019s mission is to eliminate all the boring and wasteful single-use writing products from the galaxy (don\u2019t believe us? We blogged about it \u2026 so yea, it\u2019s pretty legit).      \nMake no mistake, the Rocketbook Orbit doesn\u2019t only exist in the analog world! First, use your Rocketbook Orbit and Pilot FriXion pen to jot down your notes and big ideas. Then download the free Rocketbook app. When you scan your pages with the app, the space-age machine vision will \u201csee\u201d your handwriting and quickly capture your notes from any angle.      \nThe free Rocketbook app will instantly adjust and visually enhance your notepad scans to ensure the digital version is light years ahead of the real thing.        \nIn the app, you can also assign 7 shortcut symbols to \"destinations\" in the cloud. These destinations can be a folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, an email address, and many other popular services.   \nControl the internet with your pen. Use these 7 shortcut destinations to send your notes, diagrams, and big ideas to the cloud at the speed of light! You can even send to shared folders that your teammates have access to!   \nThe Rocketbook app can even transcribe your handwriting with OCR or \u201cOptical Character Recognition\u201d technology. Transcription allows you to send a digital text version of your notes without ever having to type a single word. OCR also gives you the power to search through all your scans with keywords and phrases. You can even auto-name your files by using the special Smart Title Bar at the top of every Orbit page. Traditional legal pads just can\u2019t keep up! \nSet up the Rocketbook app to instantly beam your notes, diagrams, and big ideas.

Featuring strategic free-for-all combat, Endogenesis can be enjoyed competitively, cooperatively, or via solo play.\nIn this epic battle, you take on the role of a cosmic spirit with access to otherworldly realms. Collect Skills from the Realm of Knowledge to customize your character with different powers, and upgrade them with Shards that you earn by defeating your enemies.\nDuring your turn, you're given freedom on how you perform actions, both in their order and frequency. With careful planning and a dash of creativity, you can set up devastating turns where you wipe out your enemies... or have your master plan backfire when another player counters your strategies with their defensive Skills and Wonders!\nAlso joining the fray are vicious Monsters from the Realm of Chaos. The most powerful of these are called Legendary Monsters; killing them will reward its slayer with a Prism, a crystal needed to achieve godhood. Be the first to collect 3 Prisms and you win!\nWith the addition of the Endogenesis: Beyond expansion, the game has been greatly expanded with new Skills, mechanics and more ways to customize unique power sets. To skip ahead and learn more about the expansion, please see Section 4 below.\nYou'll love Endogenesis if...\n... you enjoy discovering new combinations of power with different themes for each playthrough.\n...you love being able to set up elaborate combos, to produce powerful and game-changing outcomes.\n...you thrive in complexity, where understanding the full potential of your abilities and the minor details of a game's mechanics can give you an edge.\n\nFor more details on these changes, please view the complete change log on BGG here.\n\nTo returning backers: If you\u2019re a returning backer who pledged for the first edition of Endogenesis, an upgrade pack is included when you pledge for the Endogenesis: Beyond expansion package. It\u2019ll have everything you\u2019ll need to update your current game to the new 2nd edition (it'll include roughly 100+ updated cards and a 32 page rulebook). In addition to this, you also get a FREE player mat with your pledge! More details under the Add-on section below.\n\n\nOriginating from a plane of raw and malleable energy, Voltaic Skills possess the unique mechanic of generating and storing Charges. These Charges can empower Skills, making them stronger the more you use them... or trigger a Discharge, where you lose all Charges but release powerful game-changing effects against your foes.\nAugments are a new type of card you can use to modify the parameters of your Skills. Their effects vary from simple damage alteration to bending the rules of the game, letting you create wild strategies with familiar Skills. With the new Skills and Augments from Endogenesis: Beyond, the possible combinations for skill loadouts have been increased by more than tenfold.\nYour arsenal has been expanded with a 5th Skill slot reserved for new Skill types: Initiative and Deathcry. Though powerful, these new Skills differ from Active and Reactions Skills in that they only trigger conditionally. Initiative Skills are armed during your turn and trigger at the start of your next turn, while Deathcry Skills trigger when a foe slays you.\nYou and your companions are not the only ones with access to these new-found planes. From the Realm of Chaos comes new threats, some of which also draw strength from the Voltaic Plane...\n\nClick here to read the rules for the Endogenesis base game!\nClick here to read the rules for the Endogenesis: Beyond expansion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to add on any of these items, simply add the item\u2019s cost to your pledge.

Shipping prices are complex and vary based on multiple factors. Therefore, charging after the campaign allows us to be fair and provide the most accurate cost for backers. Much of the shipping fees and taxes have been subsidized on our end to keep prices low. The following is a rough estimate of the remaining shipping prices you can expect to pay based on where you\u2019re from:\n For both freight and shipping, we\u2019ve partnered with Quartermaster Logistics, a popular choice for publishers due to their excellent record and commitment to customer service. With their help, we managed to ship our first campaign 3 months early, with most backers receiving their packages quickly and undamaged. We\u2019re confident that with them on board once again, we\u2019ll be able to deliver yet another efficient and painless shipping experience.\n\nTo ensure that fulfillment goes smoothly, we can only ship to 1 delivery location per backer.\nFor the purposes of shipping, EU countries include: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\nDue to international regulations and problematic delivery conditions, we cannot ship to the following countries: Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Russia, Kazakhstan.\n\n\nClick here to read the game's lore!\nEndogenesis and Endogenesis: Beyond is a passion project by David Goh (creator of Hyperlixir) with the support of The Fandom Menace, a non-profit organization based in Singapore that supports local creatives.\nDavid is a multi-disciplinary designer and gamer whose journey through the realms of passion and profession saw the creation of his inaugural game Endogenesis! A Kickstarter success and an ever-teaching experience, Endogenesis now returns with an expansion from Beyond \u2014 an opportunity to not only build a better experience for players, but also grow as a game designer.\nThe Fandom Menace is a non-profit organisation run by art and media enthusiasts dedicated to assisting Singaporean creatives with their original content. From supporting projects like Endogenesis to creating content such as Crimson Star, TFM is always keen to work with up and comers as well as industry vets!\nAvailability is limited \u2014 a wider release is not guaranteed. As a young, small publisher, our network of retailers is currently limited. As such, Kickstarter is presently our only guaranteed method of distribution.\nHelp make this the best possible version of this game. Kickstarter\u2019s platform is superb for this very purpose: by allowing us to connect directly with you, your feedback will help make Endogenesis better than we could ever do so by just ourselves.\nKickstarter exclusive stuff! Certain stretch goals and add-ons will be exclusive only to Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOUR COMMITMENTS\n-----\nAs a project that involves the manufacturing and fulfillment of a physical product, there's always a risk of things not going smoothly \u2014 be it due to oversights, delays or shipments just not arriving when they're supposed to.\n\nThis is our second Kickstarter, and we\u2019ve learnt a lot from our previous experience. With careful planning and some luck, we managed to deliver on our first campaign 3 months early! We plan to exercise the same kind of care and conscientiousness with this project to ensure that everything goes as well as before. Here are some of the biggest challenges that tabletop game Kickstarters generally face, and here's how we'll combat them:\n\n1. Production\nBefore bringing Endogenesis: Beyond to Kickstarter, we ensured that the game had been fully developed and designed. With the exception of any new content or changes that might be implemented during the campaign, all art production for the components and stretch goals you see before you now are completed and therefore will not factor into our production timelines.\n\n2. Manufacturing\nEndogenesis only uses printed parts, so the risk of production complications is expected to be minimal. As some of us are graphic designers by trade, we have significant experience with print production and file preparation. So we're confident that there'll be no delays on this front.\n\nWe've also chosen our manufacturing partners carefully. We will be returning to Bang Wee Games as our manufacturing partner. A proven name in the board games industry due to their commitment to quality and reliability, Bang Wee Games also handled manufacturing for our previous campaign, with many backers having been very satisfied with the quality.\n\n3. Stretch Goals\nThis is just our second Kickstarter. So while we have some experience, we're opting to keep things simple as much as possible so that we don't overreach. That's why our pledge tiers are simple and we don't have a complicated system for additional rewards. On top of ensuring that our stretch goals have been carefully considered, budgeted and planned, they're also kept modest so that timelines will not be adversely impacted.\n\n4. Shipping & Fulfillment\nShipping can be a huge source of frustration for Kickstarter campaigns since much of the process falls outside of our control. To mitigate this, we\u2019ve partnered with an experienced fulfillment company called Quartermaster Logistics.\n\nA popular choice for tabletop game publishers due to their excellent record and commitment to great service, their reliability was one of the reasons why we managed to deliver early on our first campaign. We\u2019re looking forward to working with them again to get your copy of Endogenesis delivered to your doorstep as smoothly and painlessly as possible.\n\n5. Situation with Covid-19 (Edit: 17-3-2020)\nOver the course of the campaign, the situation with Covid-19 has developed significantly with impacts felt around the globe. We've been keeping in touch with our manufacturer in China throughout this period, and they've relayed to us that they're well and are good to go whenever we're ready to start mass production. From our past experience with making the first edition of Endogenesis with them, they've proven to be reliable and do try their best to keep their promises. As a back-up, we've also made a new and promising manufacturing contact in Taiwan \u2014 they will be our fallback should we be unable to work with our primary manufacturer.\n\n6. Our Promise\nAbove all else, we recognize the importance of being transparent and responsive to our backers. We promise to keep you updated every step of the way, and be upfront with any issues or delays as they happen over the course of bringing Endogenesis to you.\n\nWe\u2019ll even pack every single game box by hand and send it out personally if we have to... that\u2019s our guarantee to you.\n\nYOUR COMMITMENTS\n-----\nIn short \u2014 be informed and keep your address up to date! \n-> Please visit this link to read about your commitments: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FxBrcfVHlDX9G1FvK9Kwm1U8-m3ZAPl9apfX7AY22wo\n\nREFUND POLICY\n-----\nIn short \u2014 full refund (100%) within 14 days after campaign ends, 90% refund after that until manufacturing ends... no questions asked! \n-> Please visit this link to read our full refund policy: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SVFe_9Sc0XY1_ULYdc79rRWFE_TV0oyLgQT5x8zi8nw\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-----\nIn pledging to this project, you acknowledge that certain aspects (including but not limited to the overall look, physical materials and content) of the rewards and project are subject to revision and may therefore differ significantly from what was presented while the Kickstarter project was live.\n\nAfter the campaign ends, you will be notified via email to confirm your shipping and pledge details. If you do not confirm these details within 10 weeks of the notification date, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for all payments and donations received. However, if you contact us to confirm your pledge after the 10 week window has elapsed, we may, at our discretion, process a refund or make arrangements to ship your pledge. We seek your understanding on this matter, as unconfirmed pledges cause issues with logistical planning on our end and can therefore lead to project delays.\n\nYou accept that you are responsible for any import taxes or other duties of the country you selected for delivery. This is in exception of territories that we have promised to cover under the countries that are listed to have customs-free shipping.\n\nWe cannot issue refunds for orders that could not be delivered due to unpaid import taxes on the recipient's end. In the event of a delivery failure and a reshipment is requested, you accept that we may, at our discretion, charge you for the cost of reshipment if the delivery failure was a result of the following reasons:\n\u2022 if the address provided was incorrect or out-of-date\n\u2022 if the address was of a PO box\n\u2022 if the failure was due to an absent/uncontactable recipient\n\nThe tracking information for your shipment will expire 3 months from the point of delivery. If there is an issue with your shipment, please contact us within this 3 month period. Following this, we cannot guarantee a support solution or successful refund.\n\nIf the proposed terms are not agreeable, we recommend not participating in this project.

He appeared in Weird Comics #6-8 and Blue Beetle #6-7 as backup features, before he became lost to time and forgotten by many.\nBut #1 Bestselling Author and 5-time successful crowdfunder Jon Del Arroz, in conjunction with astounding artist Donald Kent, has rescued the character from the vaults and dusted him off for this new Kickstarter. He's reimagined Dynamite Thor for modern times, honoring the history of the character by keeping him in the family, creating a new continuity and an epic superhero tale like you haven't seen in decades.  \nThe Books: \nOur team has created a premium quality 46-Page graphic novel (plus extras in the stretch goals) which will floor you with wall-to-wall action and epic superhero battles as Dynamite Thor faces the deadliest of villains.  \nWe've also taken the original Dynamite Thor stories published by Fox Comics in 1951 and restored them with vibrant digital colors for a 40-page Dynamite Thor Classic volume to go along with the new story!\nYou can back only the new material, or get both books in order to have the full Dynamite Thor experience!  \n\n Who Will Enjoy Dynamite Thor? \nJon Del Arroz's writing has often been compared to Chuck Dixon (Nightwing, Birds of Prey) and Tom DeFalco (Amazing Spider-Man, Thor, Spider-Girl). Fans of modern indie superheroes like Invincible will also love Jon's depth of characterization and development.  Fans of Del Arroz's Flying Sparks will certainly love Dynamite Thor as well.\nIf you love golden age comics or fun storytelling in general, this book will be great for you. Dynamite Thor Classic is much like old Namor, Human Torch, or Superman stories one would find in 1940s-1950s post-war comics.  \nPreview Pages:\nThe Dynamite Thor Classic book will have fully digitally restored art with beautiful, sharp colors. This is the beautiful classic work you will get to see for the first time with its elegant new look: \n\nThe Creative Team: \nWriter: Jon Del Arroz is known as The Leading Hispanic Voice in Science Fiction as a #1 Bestselling author in multiple genres with an award-winning novel and 5 successful crowdfund campaigns. He's put out 22 issues of comics in his 2 years in the business, trying to keep up with a monthly pace to compete with the mainstream industry.\nAritst: Donald Kent is a popular vlogger, musician and long-time professional artist. When not teaching art he works has worked as a freelance artist since 2003.\nColorist: Sunil Garghe is a long-time comic colorist from India, having colored dozens of books throughout his career.\nCover Artist: Ron Frenz is a legend in the comic industry, having long runs on Amazing Spider-Man, The Mighty Thor, and Spider-Girl.

We charge these costs in the Pledge Manager in addition to the Kickstarter pledge. These estimates are the maximum we will charge you for shipping.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, China, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia) \n A prediction of the timeline:\n During the campaign: Submit final files necessary to create pre-production copies.\n 27 Feb: Kickstarter campaign completes.

Most backers have their copies.\nThe reason we are sending out KS surveys BEFORE the pledge manager is that it will allow us to gather all the requested number of games to calculate how many we need for the final print run.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen.

She pursues all possible venues to make her dream come true, including joining the USO as a costume designer, dancer, and entertainer.\nIt's easier said than done, however, and Carly grows more and more frustrated as her goals become seemingly unattainable and her role remains unnoticed.\nA twist of fate occurs during a tour for the troops abroad when a freak accident from the skies turns Carly into a living battery: super-charged and able to manipulate her bio-electricity into weapons and granting her the ability to fly.\n...and she becomes a blonde. That's sort of important later.\nCharacter Sheet for Kamen America\nUnfortunately for her, a slew of monsters begin appearing at around the same time! Juggling between being a full-time monster fighter, fashionista, and famous idol is a difficult task, and Carly's principles are put to the test as she weighs her options - and frustrations - as the masked maiden known as Kamen America.\nShe'll also have to contend with a familiar foe from a foreign land, as she discovers that maybe lightning does strike twice!\nWe are thrilled to offer you an outstanding, 56 page square bound book that is 100% finished!

A ring of light flashed in front of everyone's eyes and she was gone.\nShe reappeared at the back of the building, and quickly realized her life was about to change forever.\nThe media ran nuts with the story.

It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories in retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete.\n\nKickstarter Video Credits:\nVideo Production: Brian Davis\nVideo Music: Oh, Jeremiah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project. Thank you! We are very confident that we will deliver an incredible experience. We have successfully completed six campaigns and learn more with each one. The games will be ready to go to pre-production before Q2 and from there, barring acts of God, we will be able to hit our September fulfillment date.\n\nOur biggest challenges are not specific to our operations, but rather the global political climate, specifically trade to and from China, Cornoavirus, UK Trade Deals, and global economic recessions.

You can increase the width of the Level Up by buying extra Centre Tiles \u2013 but make sure you buy enough extra side pieces to finish your table.  You can purchase extras by viewing the Add On Menu on the page below.  \nSome common sizes\nThe 2x4 Level Up (A 24 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 3x3 Level Up (A 36 inch square)\nThe 3x4 Level Up (A 36 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 4x6 Level Up (A 48 inch by 72 inch rectangle \u2013 for wargamers)\nReady To Level Up Your Game Night?\nAs fans of board, card and role-playing games, we often struggled on game nights to fit everything we needed onto our table. How do you fit character sheets, game cards, the main board, figures, dice and tokens on to a table that is also playing host to drinks, snacks, the compulsory game night pizza and a myriad of other items?\nWe have found the solution to your board game frustrations... the Level Up - a lightweight, portable, tabletop extension that raises the main playing surface, whilst still allowing plenty of space underneath for all your game night necessities!\nDimensions\nLevel Up is made up of 6 tiles which each measure 12\" square (30.48cm). The whole platform, when constructed, measures 24\" (60.96 cm) by 36\" (91.44cm) and stands at just over 6 inches from the table (16cm) \u2013 when complete, the playing area is just a little over A1 in size - further extension pieces are available in the stretch goals.\nEach 12\" square tile has been designed with reinforced rib supports to enable the level up to carry weight up to even the heaviest game pieces or the odd rogue cat. The Level Up has been tested by our engineers to 5kg (11lbs).\n\nWe have chosen metal for the legs for durability and strength but also so that they can be made as thin as possible, so as not to interrupt your view of the items underneath the Level Up. To ensure durability, threaded metal inserts have been added to the underside of each tile to provide proper thread engagement for the legs to be inserted into.\nThe design of the Level Up allows for the legs to be attached as close to the center of the surface as possible. This clears the underneath space for your character sheets and attached cards, dice, pencils as well as the ever-present danger of drinks. If stability is a worry, each tile will have three threaded metal inserts so that the legs can be attached as close in or as far out as you require.\n\nHow Sturdy Is It?\nThere have been a lot of questions regarding the question of stability of the Level Up.  We're pleased to say it's been tested to hold 5kg (11lbs)!  If you want to make it even sturdier you can add extra legs by adding to your pledge.  Please see the \"Add On Menu\" below!  \nPLAY\n\n\n  Every Level Up Comes With: \n(6) Board Tiles \n(6) Legs \n(1) Canvas Tote bag\nWhere table space is at a real premium and the games are competing for the same space with all the yummy fare that you are selling. Well, now your customers can have their cake and eat it whilst still playing their favorite game (other food items are available).\nWhether you are interested in level Up to use in the cafe or for your shop, please get in touch and we will send you a retail price list.\nAs well as creating the Level Up as a 6-piece, standalone product, we have some great add ons that will enhance the product.  Most came about as a direct response to suggestions supplied by you during our pre-launch campaign so thank you for that!\n\n Here's how add ons work.  Pick out your add on below.  Add that amount to your pledge.  For example.  Let's say you want the map clips and the upgraded bag.  Before we ship the product we will email you a survey and confirm your add ons and give you the opportunity to add more if you like.  \nAdd \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and get a set of 6 plastic board clips.  Perfect for anyone using a battle mat or any rolled up surface.  Say goodbye to the days of having to weigh down the edges for a flat and smooth playing surface.\n Add \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and receive a set of 6 extra legs.  Perfect for those who want to add extra stability to their board.  \nAdd \u00a312 / $15 to your pledge and get a set of 2 middle extension pieces and 2 extra legs. Perfect for those long gaming nights.  No pun intended.\nMaking a Custom Sized Level Up\nWhen you buy a level up, it will come with four corner pieces and two side pieces.  You can increase the width of the Level Up by buying extra Centre Tiles \u2013 but make sure you buy enough extra side pieces to finish your table.\nSome common sizes\nThe 2x4 Level Up (A 24 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nBuy one Level Up (with any Pledge), and then add on 2x Middle Tiles.  Total extra cost: \u00a312\nThe 3x3 Level Up (A 36 inch square)\nBuy one Level Up (with any Pledge), and then add on 1x Centre Tile, and 2x Middle Tiles.

Total extra cost:  \u00a3140\n\nShipping will be collected after the campaign and not until we send a survey to collect your shipping information.  We do ship EU friendly as well.  The $15 flat price is for one Classic Level Up.

We are ready to begin the manufacture of Level Up, all we need now is you to help us make this concept a real success.\n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control. Industrial action, acts of god, fire and flood, ash clouds from volcanoes as well as plague and pestilence are just some of the issues and problems that might occur that we have no control over. \n\nWe have, however, already added in \u2018stretch\u2019 room, additional time for each section of the project to be completed and will keep the delivery dates and other deadlines updated on the KS page as well as through our development blog and social media channels. We will work hard to ensure all your queries are answered in a timely fashion.\n\nTo be honest and upfront is at the core of our Kickstarter Project. We have chosen a superb team to support us in this project who want this game to become as much a reality as we do. This being said many of our team are sub-contractors working for several clients at the same time. Sometimes this leads to parts of our production process working slower than we had planned or forecast.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to buying our company \"team building\" yacht.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense. It's a major checkpoint, where you're likely to run into issues that need addressing.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again. To playtest, you will need access to Tabletop Simulator and an Android or iOS device to run the app. You would be able to playtest remotely, but it would be easier if you have a group that can get together in person to share the app device."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "* IMPORTANT: Mobile Devices Survey - PLEASE FILL OUT *", "update_content": "Listen, some updates are less exciting than others.

So, if inserts don't tickle your toes, you can jump straight to the end.\nBefore we get into it, the usual caveats: This is 99% final, but that means it's 1% not final, which basically means things can still change.

As most of you know, the original game from 1982 was a competitive game. Players raced to defeat the brigands in the Tower. The first one to do it won the game. Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically.

Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

Do you want great stories, characters, and a truly fun, expansive universe?  Then come on over to the Galaxy Ascendant! We have everything you could possibly need here, from complex, heroic characters (all of whom are aliens), to epic, sweeping action, a great, expansive story, and even some good old fashioned romance!  Help support the best new space opera franchise out there, and join us out here in the Galaxy Ascendant!\nThe Campaign In Brief\nWelcome to the campaign for Galaxy Ascendant book 6, An Ancient Stirring! We're nearing the conclusion of the series, and things are only ramping up!\nI\u2019m Yakov Merkin, author of the Galaxy Ascendant series, The Dragon Hand, and a few other things. I\u2019m also a recovering academic and an Israeli Defense Forces veteran.\nWhile I\u2019ve been blessed with the ability to write quite a bit during my service, this books being the fourth I\u2019ve written over my two year service, army salaries aren\u2019t anything to write home about, and I'm now having to find a \"normal\" job--and, as I\u2019m doing all of this on my own, it can be a bit difficult. My aim with this campaign is to raise the funds to be able to pay my cover artist, editor, map artist, and formatters for their excellent services and bring this next book of the Galaxy Ascendant series to life!\nAfter the fiery conclusion to the most recent book in the series, the Galaxy is trying to pick up the pieces following a massive, destructive war, but some cannot rest easy, believing that dangerous threats yet lurk, threats that must be prepared for and fought, lest they undermine everything our heroes have fought so hard for since the start of the story.\nMy ultimate goal with my writing is to make this my full time job as soon as I can, now that I've completed my army service, and one crucial stepping stone to that is being able to continue to be able to afford to get the highest quality people to work with me on this project\u2014which will not end when the series concludes with book 7. The Galaxy Ascendant is here to stay.\nThat\u2019s where you come in. By helping me cover these costs, you assure that this series, loved by its readers, can continue, and you can help ensure that in an age where so many established space opera franchises are reeling, new, fresh, and awesome stories can still be told in\u2014in my opinion\u2014the best speculative fiction genre out there.\nWhether you're new to the series and want to jump in wholesale, or just want to take your first steps, or if you're a returning reader, there are rewards perfect for you! And for those of you who want to truly play a role in this ongoing universe, there are numerous fun options as well.\nSome More Details\nAs mentioned above, I need your help to be able to promptly pay my artists, editors, and more for top-quality work.\nOf course, you will get things in return for your support. Reward tiers range from a cheap as $5, which nets you the Ebooks of book 6, up to levels that get you the entire series in ebook and print, with Galactic level reward tiers that can see you help shape this emerging universe.\nWith the Travel to the Galaxy Ascendant, A Glorious Death, and Live in the Galaxy Ascendant reward levels, you will get the opportunity to work with me to create a side character who will appear in the last two books of the series.\nWith the Ship Design reward levels, you will work with me and an artist to design ship concept art. Level 1 sees you get input into the look of ships already established in the series, while level 2 allows you to help create, from the ground up (with some limitations) designs and specs for ships mentioned but not described in detail in the series\u2014or possibly an entirely new ship type which will appear in book 6 or 7. ;)\nLastly, if you truly want to make your mark on the Galaxy Ascendant, we have a new, mega reward tier that will see you work with me to craft a Galaxy Ascendant short story which will be canon to the universe, centering on a character of your choice from the series. Apart from that, you will help determine the type of story that will be written, what will happen, etc (I get some say too, of course), and then I will write the story, which will be dedicated to you in thanks for your generous support. You will of course see it before anyone else. Additionally, when I eventually (within the next year or two most likely) put together a collection of Galaxy Ascendant short stories, yours will be included as well.\nAdditionally, for those of you who also have an interest in fantasy, or history, I will set up a BackerKit for this campaign, which will, once it concludes, allow you to add on to your pledge, either my first epic fantasy novel The Dragon Hand (whose two sequels I hope to release in 2020), or my history Master's thesis, which covers a fascinating but criminally under-studied topic--and, as it's written by a fiction writer, is an eminently readable history text.\nEven if I don't hit my goal, I will still make sure that these books, and the rest of the series, are released as planned, but being able to raise the amounts necessary to cover production costs makes all of that much easier to do in a timely manner. And, of course, if we start exceeding my goals, I do have many ideas of what additional funds can go to, apart from more books (things like audiobooks, bonus artwork, and more!)\nMany of the great sci-fi franchises we grew up with and which inspired us are not in a good state today, whether due to poor creative decisions by those overseeing them, or through simple abandonment. The Galaxy Ascendant series is my contribution to an indie space opera renaissance, a vast, expansive galactic setting in which the storytelling options are endless, and in which I intend to write for a long, long time to come. And this galaxy is growing rapidly. Book 1, A Greater Duty, was released in May 2017, and now we\u2019re nearly at the release of book 5. G-d willing, book7 will be out by next spring to bring the series to a close. In total, I\u2019ve already put out six novels, including A Greater Duty, in that time span, along with several smaller works. And as those who backed my last campaign can attest, I get the rewards out on time, and the book released promptly. I take great pride in getting my work done, on time, and getting people what they paid for. If there are any unforeseen delays, rest assured that I will be completely transparent about them.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nI knew that there are plenty of people out there for whom money is tight; I\u2019ve been there myself. However, even if you\u2019re unable to contribute at this time, you can still greatly help this campaign by sharing it out with others online, telling people you know personally about it, or even by sharing the campaign video, which is on YouTube. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much even a simple share, which takes barely a second or two to do, can do to help! It only takes the right person seeing the campaign to help ensure that it is a success.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are none for you! As I mentioned above, I pride myself on getting the work done, on time (and have repeatedly done so already), and I am easily reachable if there are any issues (due to time delay, it might take me a couple days to get back to you, but I always do.) Obviously, there are more risks & challenges here for me; I have the books to get ready and out, after all, and, as can be seen, I\u2019ve already gotten all parts of the project done so that there will be as little as possible time between the campaign\u2019s end and when rewards start shipping out. This is why it\u2019s all the more vital that I be able to raise the necessary funds via this campaign, so I can properly pay everyone on time. Whatever happens, I will make it work and get the books out, because this is what I do. This series is something I need to complete and share with the world. But it\u2019d be much better, much more pleasant, if this campaign can take care of that. Success here will better enable me to put out more, awesome products in the coming year\u2014and of do I have fun things planned!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "A Digitial Stirring", "descp": "You'll receive Galaxy Ascendant 6, An Ancient Stirring, in Ebook format (both .mobi & .epub), at least two weeks in advance of its official release.\nINCLUDES:\nAn Ancient Stirring Ebook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Digital Galaxy Bundle", "descp": "You will receive the entire Galaxy Ascendant series thus far--6 books--in Ebook format (both .mobi & .epub formats).

It's a 3D printed panoramic camera that takes 35mm film and mamiya press lenses.  It's super durable and takes great pictures, and you could print it at home for about $40 worth of materials on a sub $200 3d printer.  This kickstarter campaign is about a bit more than that.  I'll do my best to explain, and then get back to the camera.\nMy name is Ethan, I make and sell film cameras at cameradactyl.com\nI have designed a whole bunch of cameras and photographic tools that I build on 3D printers in my workshop, and ship all over the world.\nAs I have added more designs to my website, I have become busier and busier fulfilling orders for customers.  I now spend more than half of my time printing, assembling, and shipping my orders around the globe.  This is a good problem to have.  It has been very fulfilling seeing my designs in use on the other side of the planet, through the magic of the internet.\nWhat I think is coolest about my camera designs, is that they can all be manufactured on some very inexpensive machinery that people are starting to have in their homes, schools, public libraries and makerspaces.  Namely inexpensive (sub $200) 3D printers.  \nI haven't given away any of the design files for my projects yet, they just take too much R&D time to get to the point to where you can print and assemble a working camera in a mere few days worth of printer time and a few hours of assembly.  Most of the cameras that I sell have taken many months of full time work to go from sketches and ideas in the back of my head, to fully printable stl files and actual working machines.\nSelling physical objects is how I have paid for my R&D in the past, but selling physical objects is getting to the point of getting in the way of some of the R&D I would like to be doing.  I think that my skills and talents are probably best used developing new products, and teaching people how to build them on simple machinery, rather than spending 5 hours out of every day printing, assembling and shipping already tested and proven designs.\nThis Kickstarter is my shot in the dark, my test to see if people will pay for the R&D on an open source project in a specific way.  I am not sure that this will work, or how people will feel about it, but I do know that if the Kickstarter should fail, nobody gets charged anything and I can always go back to selling cameras through the mail, but if it does work it could change the way I work and the projects that I get to tackle, and the types of cameras and photographic tools available to the public now, and in the future.\nBack to the camera:  The Brancopan is a 35mm panoramic camera that takes mamiya press lenses (theyre available from 50-250mm).  It's 3D printed.  It has two cold shoes for mounting finders and accessories.  it has a ratchet film advance with a frame counter and a lockout mechanism that will stop the film at every frame, assuring even frame spacing.  It has a spring loaded film door latch mechanism, common to so many cameras throughout history.  It has a tripod mount, and strap lugs for a neckstrap.  It takes great pictures.  I'm not the worlds best photographer, but I can put a beating on a camera by schlepping it around in a normal backpack and wearing it over my shoulder while climbing and sliding and bumping into things.  Mine has held up for months and 100+ rolls of film so far.  it's plastic, but it's oversized and super tough.\nThe camera only requires simple tools to make: a 3D printer, a hex key (M2.5 for M3 bolts), some coarse and fine sandpaper, an exacto knife or the like.  Same goes for repairs.  as its getting harder and harder to find parts for classic cameras, should I give out the files for the Brancopan, making replacement and repair parts in the future will only get easier and higher quality as printers evolve.\nNow back to the rub:\nI've poured months of full time work taking this camera from an idea to a reality, and then tested it part time for months.  I've spent a week putting together writing, and videos and pictures for this kickstarter campaign, and should it succeed I will spend more weeks making youtube instructional videos on how to print, assemble, calibrate, and use the camera.  Time is Money, and I could use more of both if I am going to focus on developing new products like this in the future.\nI would like to sell the stl design files to the world, through the pledges of you altruistic kickstarter backers, photography and 3d printing enthusiasts.  \nGOALS AND REWARDS\nI would like $12,000 to release all of the files for the brancopan, as well as to make three videos demonstrating: 1. how to print the files 2. how to assemble and calibrate the camera and 3. How to use the camera.  I would release the STL files first to the Kickstarter backers at the end of the campaign, and then to the general public on May 1, 2020.\nI made a few support levels in this campaign.  All levels will get the same files, at the same time.  Two of the levels will receive some laser cut film counter dials which requires a pretty large piece of machinery to make, and, while not necessary to build a functioning camera, does look and function really nicely.\nI am adding a few stretch goals to the campaign as well.  \nIf this kickstarter raises $20,000 or more:\n I will release all of the stl files for my original 4x5 folding field camera, the first camera that I made at cameradactyl.  I will release the files on exactly the same timeline as the brancopan panoramic camera, first to the kickstarter backers at the end of the campaign, and then to the public at large on May 1.  I will also make the same three instructional videos on how to print, assemble and calibrate, and use the cameras.  These videos will probably take an extra week to be released, but will follow soon after.\nThe CAMERADACTYL folding 4x5 field camera was our first camera\n\nIf this kickstarter raises $100,000 or more\nI will release the files and videos for both of the above cameras, and make a monthly vlog about the projects happening in the CAMERADACTYL workshop, and make everything I design in 2020, free, and available to the public.  This would allow me to work on open source projects for a long time.  Things like film and paper processors made from 3D printer parts and 3D printed parts, and more complicated mechanical cameras.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you very much for reading and I hope you liked my video.  I look forward to building more cameras with you in the future.\n\n*One important note:  All the files I release will be licensed for personal use only.  You can print a camera for yourself or a friend, but you cannot go into business printing and selling my designs on ebay or the like.  Please contact me directly for business licensing inquiries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally when people put a project on kickstarter, it is to raise funds for a project that they would like to complete. I have completed the Cameradactyl Brancopan. it exists, the files exist, it works. There is 0 chance that the camera wont ever see the light of day. that part is risk free.\n\nThere is some risk that I will make completely boring youtube videos that you will have to sit through and play back a few times in order to be able to properly assemble your camera. There is some risk that it will take me a few more weeks than expected to put the videos together in a less boring fashion. There is even an extremely small risk that you will find my youtube videos incredibly charming and fall in love with me, but I think that these youtube related risks are negligible.\n\nI put a $100,000 stretch goal on this campaign, which I don't really expect will be met, but I should address those risks as well. Should I spend the next year making open source photographic equipment projects, there are some real unknowns. I could get hit by a bus at the end of the campaign and never design anything again. I could design ten things next year that never work. In that case you would have the entertainment of watching my trials and tribulations on a monthly basis, but wouldn't have the satisfaction of being able to build a working product. I could also design things that people really aren't interested in. I am personally very interested in building a sub $500 minilab that will fit on your desk and process color negative film in about half an hour. Some people are not. I could design great things and make such putrid youtube videos about them that nobody could get through them and actually build their own model.

I am a humble camera designer, but, because of you fine folks, I have a bit of a bully pulpit to get a medium number of people who own 3D printers interested in designing and building machine parts that might save some lives.  I made a tiny little piece that is used in lots of ventilators today, a simple check valve that you can print in about an hour, for about 35 cents worth of filament.  I hope it'll never come to getting used for what it was designed for, but I am hoping that people will take it and use it in their machine designs as just a little building block.  Anyway, I made a few little videos about my project, and the greater projects at large.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact. As an independent publisher I'm committed to creating games that respect players, and delivering them with practices that are healthy for the community. \nHave fun and play nice. \nJoin the Armada today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is my most ambitious and largest game to date.

Founder Matthew Adams spent over 8 years in the United States Marine Corps. While working with paracord frequently; not only did he understand its importance; but was looking for ways to improve it. Quikcord created the quick and easy way to maximize the utility of paracord.\nTo preorder and bring it to life, click Back This Project.

The trials and tribulations with 550 cord and having to MacGyver ways to prevent the issues became cumbersome for most military personnel.\n\"From multiple deployments to the Middle East; along with some of the toughest training the U.S. Military has to offer, I found myself in multiple situations where something broke and needed to be fixed. FAST! Paracord was the answer but it was always a tangled mess.\" \n \" I started stacking my paracord with various miscellaneous items but nothing was sustainable. The feedback I got inspired me to create a tough, time saving tool that is now Quikcord.\" - Matthew Adams\nFOUNDERS\nQuikcord President: Matthew Adams\nQuikcord\u2019s President, Matthew Adams, spent over 8 years in the United States Marine Corps. He deployed twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan while on active duty. Matthew started out in the Infantry and later moved to Special Operations.

He has earned an MBA and Bachelors of Science in Finance; and manages a career focused in product research, development and protection. His past entrepreneurial endeavors and business expertise contribute to a dynamic partnership with long time friend Matthew Adams. Together, they have created the future tool, Quikcord.\nTESTED AND APPROVED BY:\nPrototypes\nWe started off with preliminary paper sketches of Quikcord to show design engineers our idea. Eventually we leaned towards a veteran engineering team to help us develop to military specifications. We have gone through six 3D printed prototypes to conclude with this latest design. \nWe also experimented with many various plastics and came to the conclusion that a polypropylene copolymer was the way to go; offering excellent low temperature impact as well as physical strength and resistance.\nPhotography within this campaign are a mix of various 3D printed prototypes. \n2017 Preliminary Design\n2019 Finalized AutoCAD Design\nMANUFACTURING\nThere was never a discussion about building the product anywhere else besides the United States. We felt a moral obligation to help create jobs and support our U.S economy. We have secured all injection modeling to take place at Cardamundi in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts - servicing major reputable companies; such as Hasbro for many years. https://www.cartamundi.com/us/en\nOne of various machine manufacturing plastic parts\nASSEMBLY\nAssembly and shipping is handled by Sunshine Village in Chicopee, Massachusetts with oversight by the Quikcord Inc. team.

To get a set of Magware for yourself and bring them to life, simply click 'Back This Project' in the top right hand corner. Have a scroll down to learn more.\nMagware have been designed to address a major problem facing our planet. We throw away billions of single use plastic utensils every year, and many of them end up in our Oceans and Waterways. Plastics never fully break down but rather degrade into small pieces that resemble food scraps to fish and other sea animals. The Ocean Conservancy lists plastic utensils as among the items \u201cmost deadly\u201d to sea turtles, sea birds, and other Ocean creatures due to their size and to the ease they enter our waterways.\nWe think the Bring Your Own (BYO) Cutlery movement could help reduce the number of disposable utensils that get thrown away every year. The same way as carrying drink bottles has started to become ubiquitous to people\u2019s everyday lives, we hope to see non-disposable utensils being used in the same way. Magware utensils are a simple light-weight solution to help in this mission, by making them as organized and easy to carry as possible. We really hope that by promoting this movement, we can have a positive effect in helping against this crisis that is growing exponentially every year.\n It is possible to add on any number of Single Pouches if you are pledging for a Magware Full Set and want the option to carry one single set in its own pouch. To add on a Single Pouch(es) to your order, simply increase your pledge amount by $8 per addition Single Pouch (shipping is included). You will be able to tell us you have pledged for the a Single Pouch(es) add-on in the survey that will be sent out after the campaign has ended. Read our second update for a step by step guide if you have already made a pledge and wish to add more pouches on.\nWe decided to use Hypalon for the pouches, as it is extremely durable, water proof, easy to clean and stain resistant. Hypalon is so tough it is the material that they make inflatable boats from. We have used high strength velcro for the closing mechanism. The full set pouch also has a thick elastic strap attached to give it an even firmer close. Both pouches should last a lifetime.\n\n If you would like to order multiples of any Magware set, simply multiply your total pledge amount by the number you would like. Multiple prices are listed below.\n\n\nTo add on the Magnetic Chopsticks to your order, simply increase your pledge amount by $24 (shipping is included).

Mark Windsor, our founder (tall, skinny dude below on the right), has been working as a product designer, bringing new products to life for the last 14 years. He has worked as a product designer for some of the world's best design firms.\nWe successfully launched our Muncher Titanium Multi Utensil (see below) in 2017 and Splitter Multi Tongs in 2018 fulfilling all 7146 pledges. The Muncher went on to be awarded Outside Magazine's 'Gear of the Year' 2018 and is now stocked around the world by reputable retailers such as REI amongst many others. Previous to this we successfully launched both our Nutter and Breaker Cycle Multi Tools on Kickstarter. We can't state how much we appreciate all the backers sharing the journey with us and allowing us to do what we do.\nWe have been working with our manufacturer based in Guangzhou, China who specialize in engineering and manufacture of high end products for the last 7 years and have a great relationship together. We have been working on Magware with them for the past 6 months. On everything from prototype development to drawing up the final product and tooling specifications.

I've previously run four successful Kickstarter campaigns, and this will be the fifth.\nOur previous campaign was called HandyMaps - Towns & Villages, and due to its success and the hugely positive feedback we received, we have created this campaign to provide some additional cards for buildings/structures.\nMatt is onboard again as a collaborator to help with the running of the campaign. The last campaign proved a really valuable experience for Matt to use in his University application's personal statement (he wants to study Economics), and will hopefully stand him in good stead for next year.\nWe also want to implement BackerKit post-campaign to collect shipping costs and also give you the opportunity to add some great add-ons during the process. I've used this on two previous campaigns so I'm aware of what's involved in managing that.\nYour support is welcomed, invaluable, and very much appreciated.\nFrom L to R: Glynn and Matt\nThe Physical Cards\nSo, we are creating set of twenty two (22), double-sided A5 cards showing beautifully illustrated and evocative elevations and floorplan layouts for fantasy-themed buildings/structures. The map cards can be used as player handouts or tools for game planning by Game Masters.\nThe Full Set of Cards (digital 3D mockups, colours may vary)\nThe Full Set of Cards (Reverse)\nAll the card fronts!\nThe cards will be double-sided in a handy A5 size (210mm high x 148mm wide OR 8.27\" high x 5.83\" wide) from 350gsm uncoated card stock (giving a nice matt finish, suitable for ink and pencil marking).\nEach side will be professionally digitally printed with a single full colour elevation of the building to one side, and a black-inked floorplan to the reverse, all on a parchment style background.\nThe floorplan sides will all have a basic grid and minimal text labels (generally kept to suggested uses, floor/storey labels, and level change designations such as stairs and ladders), but NO title, room numbers, or compass allowing Game Masters to use them as they need for their campaigns.\nSample Card 1\nSample Card 2\nThe elevations and maps used for the cards are already found in our previous product, The City of Great Lunden, so this card set is therefore a great resource for your The Midderlands setting games. Although, some brand new art is planned in the stretch goals!\nThe Digital Version\nAll backers will also get access to PDF/JPG versions (greyscale for easier printing). This will allow a Game Master to print the maps off at larger sizes if they want, and label them up with GM notes as they need for their game uses. These will be distributed via DriveThru RPG.\nDigital file(s) fulfilled by DriveThruRPG\nHandyMaps Luxury Box\nBoxed Architect and Boxed Master Architect pledge levels will come with a HandyMaps Luxury Box. This is a grey sturdy card presentation box with gold foil embossed logos to front of lid, and logo stickers to left hand side of the lid (for shelf identification). There is some room inside the box to allow you to get your fingers in to get the cards out, and the contents will be sufficiently packed for transit. These look lovely.\nThe box can hold upto approx. 100 HandyMap Cards. So, if you have the previous HandyMaps - Towns & Villages, you can put them in here too, as well as future HandyMaps.\nStretch Goals\nWe have some stretch goals available to add additional cards to the set. These will be included as part of your pledge and not increase the estimated shipping shown below:\nStretch Goal Status\nThe stretch goals will add 1 card to each set of cards, so if you back at the Master Architect pledge level, you will get 2 copies of the additional card. Note that the Stretch Goals for \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 already have the art completed:\nSome Stretch Goal Art\nBackerKit & Shipping\nShipping is NOT included in the pledge (please don't adjust your pledge level to accommodate it) and will be collected using BackerKit after the campaign. This will give the opportunity to include add-ons such as additional sets of the maps, previous Town & Village map sets, our new HandyMaps Luxury Box, and possibly other products.\nTo give you some idea of the shipping costs to expect (without any add-ons), see below. The physical rewards will be posted via Royal Mail 1st Class (within UK) or Royal Mail  International Standard post (everywhere else) at the prevailing 'Large Letter' or 'Small Parcel' rates below.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\nDelivery\nThe art is done (except for the last two stretch goals), and we have them laid out and printer-ready. All we need are funds for printing and packaging materials. Once the KS campaign ends, we can setup the BackerKit, send out surveys and spend a few weeks collecting shipping charges, info, and add-ons. We can then place our supplier orders and have distribution as soon as humanly possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk Kickstarter campaign we are undertaking.

Or just Send It. \n When will this be delivered? We are anticipating early 2020. \n Do you ship overseas? Yes. Separate shipping rates apply.\n Can you get different colors? There will be additional color options in the future. Sign up for details or contact us at hello@drafttop.com \n Are you able to put another logo on the Draft Top? Yes, but not during Kickstarter. Minimum orders apply. Reach out to us at hello@drafttop.com for more details\n Does it leave a sharp edge? No, the cut occurs inside the rim of the can and folds the aluminum into the rim.  \n Are the blades sharp? No, in fact they are purposefully dull. We call them splitters. Technically they are splitting the metal and not cutting it.\n Will the splitters rust? If left in water for a few days or covered in soda or beer there is a likelihood that they will develop surface rust. They are made of 300 series stainless.  \n Can it be washed/is it dishwasher safe? We don't recommend using it in the dishwasher as it could affect longevity of the tool. We recommend just rinsing it using warm water after each session. \n How long will it last? We've tested samples on hundreds of cans and have prototypes that are still being used well above 1,000 cans \n Does it grab the top? No. If the top falls completely in, you have to flip it on its side and pull it out. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n So the top just falls in the can? Sometimes. It all depends on how the tool is used. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n Isn't the top dirty? Maybe but its the same top that you put your lips on when drinking from the can the normal way. So just Drink Topless! Its a lot better.  \n Does it work on Tall boys? Yes, most 16oz to 19oz cans. It does not work on most 24oz cans or the Fosters Oil Can\n Does it work on crowlers? No - those are good for a nice set of glasses\n How does it work? When holding the tool in either hand, the top right corner has a part of the handle that sticks out. When you push this in the handle opens and retracts the splitters to the center. With the opposite hand holding the can near the top or bottom near the bends, you place the tool on the can and slowly squeeze while starting to rotate. The four splitters move outward from the center when you squeeze the handle. They puncture the inside rim of the can just below the top and split the aluminum open as you rotate the tool. A minimum of a quarter twist is needed to fully remove the top but sometimes it take a half or full twist. Below the handle are grooves designed to allow you to rest them on the rim and push the lid in. Remember, the objective is to open the top not take the lid out.   \n Do you or will you sell replacement parts? Not at this time. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 950+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $400M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there is always a potential for unknown\u2019s to occur, the only challenge we can foresee at this time is uncertainty of delivery times based on the volume of orders.

Car Wars returns in a bigger, faster edition. The detailed 1/64 scale cars move, shoot, and catch fire the way you remember, with faster car creation and play. Once again you can rule the roads!\nNOTE: All miniatures are pre-assembled at the factory and packed unpainted. Miniatures shown in the photos are prototypes. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. \nForeground: Warhawk, one of the six miniatures included in the Car Wars Sixth Edition core game. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. Displayed on Car Wars Playmat #1. All work shown is in progress and not final.\nNorth America, A.D. 2070. It's a new American frontier. The collapse of the U.S. government plunged the country back into the good old days -- days of wilderness lawlessness, banditry, regional dictators, and of the men and women who combat them. Modern-day knights and gunslingers are in demand; but the automobile has replaced the horse, and the machine-gun and recoilless rifle have made the sword and Winchester obsolete.\nWelcome to 2070. It's a rough world, but it's the only one around . . . \nCar Wars is the game of autoduelling; futuristic vehicular combat where the right of way goes to the biggest guns. Players design their cars -- complete with weapons, accessories, and crew -- and then take them into the arena where one emerges victorious . . . and the others are annihilated.\nFirst published in 1981, the earlier editions of Car Wars have sold over one million games and accessories during the game's near-four decades of life. Over the years, the Car Wars game -- as well as the world of Autoduel America -- has grown, adding more rules, expansions, and setting information. Car Wars has been featured in comic books, novels, solo adventure gamebooks, and even the fan-favorite classic Autoduel video game. \nNow, with your support, we're bringing Car Wars back as a faster, streamlined edition with detailed plastic models. The new Car Wars game was designed to put you in the driver's seat and into the action within moments of opening the game box.\nAfter six years of design, development, playtesting, and constant refinement and improvement, we've completed the core of the new Car Wars Sixth Edition game and we're now ready for your support. \nThe new core game includes:\n24-page rulebook, covering everything from building your car to movement and combat. All of the rules you need to start playing the game within moments of opening the box! \nTEN (stretch goal unlocked!) 1/64 scale highly-detailed plastic car models. Pre-assembled at the factory, these miniatures are ready to paint and take into the arena. Or, for those of you who want to jump into the action quickly, use the minis unpainted; the included car bases are color-coded so that you can instantly tell which car is yours during the heat of battle. \nFour color-coded player dashboards. These thick, durable chipboard player boards include spaces for your car's external armor, tire points, power plant points, as well as your car's current speed.\nFour car design decks, one for each of the included player colors. Using the Build Point and Crew Point mechanics, you can create a new car (and outfit your driver and gunner) in less than ten minutes! \nTwo different internal damage card decks, one for low-point value games and one for high-point value games. Once armor is penetrated, a card is randomly drawn to determine which internal components are hit by an attack.\nTwenty custom six-sided dice! These are used for all attack rolls, defensive rolls, and movement rolls in the game. \nA chipboard turning key. Use this when moving and maneuvering your car. The turning key works perfectly with the color-coded car bases; your car pivots over the turning key so that every swerve and turn made during the game is as accurate as possible. (Includes two copies of the key.)\nDozens of damage, control, Ace, and other types of tokens that are required to track the status of various parts of the game. \nA streamlined collision system that keeps the game flowing. See how the bases are used to push objects in a collision in this Facebook video. \nPlay on any smooth tabletop . . . or upgrade your game with one of the Car Wars playmats (see Add-Ons, below). The basic arena is a 36\" x 36\" playspace; scenarios expand play to even larger spaces for those of you who want to play a highway game, fight in a big arena, or tackle a custom scenario of your own design.\nDo you want to see Car Wars Sixth Edition in action?

Good News!", "update_content": "Thanks to a last-minute push by the team at GPI, we completed the tooling stage before the factory closed down for Chinese New Year. There are a few minor issues, but nothing that we cannot address during the manufacturing process.\n\nOnce the factory opens, we'll officially shift the project into the production stage. There will still be a number of checks (photos and video, so we can confirm that those minor issues are handled). We will not skip steps during this process or sign off on \"meh, that kinda works\" components. We get one chance to do this right, and we are going to do what it takes to make the game (and all of the expansions) the best we can manage. This means that although we are moving into production, we may find an item or two that requires another round of tweaks during manufacturing.\n\nWe know the one question everyone is asking comes down to: When will I get my game? We cannot answer that question until the factory opens and together we can nail down a final production schedule. One of the biggest risks of a Kickstarter campaign -- especially one of this size -- is that everyone gets to see the behind-the-scenes delays and issues that can plague a project. We don't assign a release date for many of our games until everything is at print (and often not until we have the tooling complete). This makes it easier to hit release dates, but even that has been a major challenge over the last year as the global pandemic disrupts everything.\n\nWe'll be back with a new update in early March after the factory opens and we work out a tentative production timeline. Once we have a production schedule, then we can start to plan a shipping schedule, but even that will be subject to the issues that are delaying shipping containers. (As an example, we had a 40' container canceled by the freight company last month. That tore a giant hole in our plans and was completely outside of our control.)\n\nAs always, thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to push hard at wrapping up the game, accessories, and expansions."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Vehicle Guide Sample Spreads, Tooling Update", "update_content": "As we wait for the factory, below are two sample page spreads from the Car Wars Vehicle Guide.

Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before  placing an order.\nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address. Unfortunately, we cannot split pledges to ship to multiple addresses.\nCurrency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends.

Finally, the most perplexing food storage challenges solved! And it\u2019s good for you and the planet. reVessel\u2019s innovations make living a healthy and sustainable life convenient to get you out of your kitchen and back out exploring. We\u2019ve packed three essential kitchen tools in one sleek design. We call it foodware, bakeware and takeware - Designed with premium materials preferred for human and environmental health, doing good never looked so good.\nPLAY\n\nRecommended Usage\nExplorer Kit\nGreat for explorers with smaller appetites\nIdeal for kids lunches, ages 4-10 or lighter adult meals\nPack for school, sports, beach, travel, shorter expeditions\nAdventure Kit\nGreat for adventurers with larger appetites\nIdeal for adult lunches, teens and bottomless-eating tweens 10+\nPack meals for the office, hikes, travel and snacks to share for longer outings\nLEAKPROOF\nSpills in your bag? Hummus on your apples? No thank you. The patent-pending leakproof seal is made of food-grade silicone. It keeps food on the inside from mixing, and wet stuff like salad dressing from spilling in your bag.\nMODULAR\nChoose your own adventure. No one likes to eat the same every.single.day. Some containers limit your options. For the first time, you can have your bento-style box and burrito in it too, a sandwich, veggies and dip, hors d\u2019oeuvres or a mega salad. Add, remove or swap - you choose. Individual containers are great for batch cooking and Sunday meal prep too.\nEASY TO CLEAN\nSharp angles and tight corners make cleaning tricky. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t have any. Gentle contoured bases make cleaning a cinch so you can get out of the kitchen and back out Exploring. \nDURABLE\nMade with 304 stainless steel, the containers are designed to endure.\nOVEN SAFE\nVersatile stainless steel containers are great at home in the oven or in the outdoors.\nFREEZER SAFE\nNo more broken glass or cracked plastic. Batch cook and stow away to have a meal in a pinch. \n COMPACT STORAGE \nNow you can reduce your carbon footprint and your storage footprint. \nREUSABLE\nEach steel container has a pre-printed weight and volume specification to make it easier to go plastic-free. Perfect for salad bars, bulk bins and farmer\u2019s markets.\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\nThe ring frame firmly snaps to the base, but can be easily removed for cleaning and storing. \nThe bamboo lid acts as a cutting board and serving tray. Helpful while you're out and about! \nTo keep the lid seal clean if cutting on dirty surfaces, place the bamboo lid on the ring hardware to avoid direct contact of the seal with the table.\nThe ring frame is specially designed to hold the lid while you eat. One thing worse than a dirty table is your lid on the dirty table!\nNo need to wonder what's behind that stainless steel in your fridge, wax pencils or dry/wet-erase markers make for a quick and easy label! And have fun writing notes to your little ones if you're prepping lunches for school.\nThe inserts are thoughtfully designed to be universal with the Adventure and Explorer Kit systems.\nFarmers Markets or Bulk Shopping - use in place of the single use plastic bins/bags that are typically given out. Remember, all the steel containers have a tare weight and volume in case you need them.\nBall Games - Eat healthier by bringing your own food and save a ton of money at the same time by not buying concession stand food! Because the inserts are modular and removable, they make for great pass-around snacks while you're watching the game.\nWork or Travel - The Explorer and Adventure Kits make the perfect companion wherever you go.\nBeaches, lakes, pools - No Glass Allowed. No Problem. Charcuterie by the shore anyone?\nCamping or Hiking - What\u2019s the perfect trail food? Pack a survival kit with shelf-stable dried nuts, seeds, fruit and jerky. The Explorer and Adventure Kits slide into you bag and keep you fueled on the journey.\nSchool - The Explorer and Adventure Kits make for great school lunchboxes. And because they are leakproof, they can be placed upright with no mess!\nWe have ongoing R&D to create markets for materials that already exist that would otherwise be waste destined for landfills or oceans. What will we come up with next?? Currently, the premium materials included...\nSteel: 304 18/8 food-safe stainless steel, providing superior corrosion resistance and durability for a long lifespan.\nBamboo: Not only does the bamboo look stylish, but it is a very functional piece acting as a lid, cutting board and serving try. A little fact about bamboo: it's not chopped down like a tree, but rather harvested like a crop so it's easy to replenish, making it a renewable resource.\nSilicone: The leakproof seal and the storage lids are made from food-grade silicone. This inert material makes it food-safe and is tolerant to both hot and cold temperatures.\nPolypropylene: The frame hardware offers precision and strength to keep the lid and seal intact for the leakproof confidence.     \nThese crush-resistant silicone inserts are part of the next system in the family of reVessel products that will work together or in place of the stainless steel inserts. You can mix and match as needed. They are built tough, designed to work with the leakproof bamboo lid kit. They are especially helpful when needing to heat up your food in a microwave. \nA little bit of our journey from initial concept and early exploration to design and manufacturing. It has been an incredible 2 years in the making!\nWe\u2019re new to Kickstarter, but not new to developing and delivering premium products. After launching our first flagship system, The Adventure Kit, we learned from our Community how important it was to safely and easily pack and carry an array of meals and snacks for kids and adults on quicker trips. The Explorer Kit was created in response to the need.\nWith our designs for the Explorer Kit complete, supply chain in place, suppliers ready to go, we can\u2019t wait to get this project underway and bring powerful tools to keep you adventuring or exploring consciously while enjoying your favorite food. Much of the testing has already been passed. We will use the backer funds to initiate the development of the new Explorer Kit molds and begin to introduce some fun designs to the ring hardware so you can have your own unique look.\nBased in San Diego, CA, reVessel is a sustainable brand focusing on designing morally conscious products to better prepare, store, and carry food without compromising the environment or our values. We created the company based on our own health and wellness quests and a mutual desire to have better options to bake, freeze, store and travel with our food to the office, our children\u2019s school, sporting events, the beach, and roadtrips.\nCrafted alongside a team of deep sea and underwater mechanical engineers, reVessel's products are tested to be leakproof and submersible. Additionally, each unit is reusable, modular, toxin-free and eco-friendly, replacing the 1460 sandwich bags a typical child's lunch could require annually. These containers add functionality to meals and a convenient way to develop healthy habits that frees us from relying on outsourcing food and single-use plastics while reducing exposure to toxins so that we can fully live.\nreVessel hopes to spark a ripple effect of healthy and sustainable change. \nBeyond the beautiful and versatile products, we intend to use our business to positively influence some of the world\u2019s challenges using long-lasting, premium materials. Much of our food produced in the US lacks nutrients and comes with as many as 700 chemicals. A portion of proceeds from reVessel sales goes back to protecting future generations by supporting farmers in growing regenerative food, rehabilitating our oceans and setting a new standard by offsetting our Company\u2019s entire carbon footprint. \nWe are a team composed of engineers, designers, health professionals and even leakproofing gurus. We care so much about our planet and we are committed to developing products that are good for you and good for the planet.   \nHelp us spread the word and earn 12% commission of every dollar you help raise for our campaign by being a reVessel Ambassador!

If you would like to add it to your order just pledge 69 USD extra, and if you would only like to receive The Chromatic Anti Oloid, select the \"ANTI OLOID\" reward level and pledge 69 USD.\nAs we want to ensure that each piece is made carefully, The Chromatic Anti Oloids will be shipped in January.\nTHE ANTI OLOID STAND\nSuch a unique piece like the ANTI OLOID deserved an equally exceptional place to display it, so we designed a special edition of our wooden stand.\nIf you would like to receive this amazing add-on, all you have to do is add $20 USD to your pledge for each wooden stand regardless of your reward level.\nAll our stands displayed on the Matter Collection website will also be available as add-ons in the Backerkit survey.\nTHE BLACK ANTI OLOID\nTo get this reward, just pledge 59 USD in THE ANTI OLOID reward level. \nIf you already pledged for one ANTI OLOID, simpy add 10 USD to make it black. \nNOTE: The Black finishing is exclusive for THE ANTI OLOID and NOT available for the Oloid.\nWe rush through life, constantly trying to cram more things into our days. Driven by the inertia of getting things done without even knowing why we are doing them.\nEvery day, we are being pushed and pulled by our obligations and schedules. We need to hold on to something to prevent us from losing ourselves. A token to connect  with our surroundings and take a moment to be mindful:\n\n\nWe set out to rethink The Oloid, a paradoxical solid you might be familiar with, to make it even more enigmatic and help you concentrate on the moment.\nRemember your favorite book and how each time you read it you found something different? THE ANTI OLOID has that same property. You'll be amazed by the variety of shapes contained in one single solid.\nThis shape is the minimal expression of The Oloid. If we deconstruct both of them, we'll find the same structure, yet, THE ANTI OLOID is made with the fewest elements possible. Creating different paths even though their motion is the same.\nTHE ANTI OLOID might be confused with a M\u00f6bius Strip, it actually looks similar to that extraordinary mathematical construction but unlike that loop, it has two different surfaces and it can't be constructed from a flat sheet.\nIt invites you to stop what you are doing and just contemplate its intricate construction, its simple yet sophisticated form and unexpected motion.\nThis is the perfect gift for a curious mind that appreciates beauty. A one of a kind object.\nSlide your fingers through its shape and give yourself a moment to connect with your senses.\nGive yourself a moment to meditate about how we are endlessly transforming and so is our environment. See how the passing of time is printed in copper's natural tarnish, or visit our recommendations to maintain an immaculate look and take care of your pieces.\nThis complex shape doesn't have such a difficult construction as it may seem, it is a continuous surface created by the trajectory of a line connecting two points that travel along two congruent circles in perpendicular planes so that the center of each circle lies on the edge of the other.\nThis was a challenging shape to create. It had never been fabricated in metal before and we had to find a way to produce perfect pieces on a large scale.\nAfter trying different methods, we decided machining was our best option. We perfectioned the CNC program to operate the 3 axis milling machine that carves the solid metal block and unleashes the shape as it was hidden inside. THE ANTI OLOID has many complex curves that can't be reached by the cutting tool, so we found a way to rotate the metal block and get the shape.\nWhen the machining process is done, each piece is hand-finished and treated like a work of art by the most expert hands we found in the world.\nDuring the whole design process, the perfect blend of technological innovation and human abilities was the key to achieving this ambitious project.\n Add $49 USD to your pledge for each extra ANTI OLOID you would like to add to your order. \nShipping will be charged in the post campaign survey.\nBelow, you can find an estimate shipping price, these prices may vary. In the campaign survey you will find the shipping price before confirming your order.\nOnce your order is shipped you'll receive a tracking number.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.

It will spin in multiple ways depending on how you interact with it.\nExplore endless ways of motion- spin it smoothly or from an angle, launch them together, throw from a distance or upside down. \nBEAUTIFUL METALS\nCrafted out of a solid block of Stainless Steel or Titanium and carefully shaped to replicate the surface of a rippling water. An object that is bending the borders between engineering and art. \nPolished VS Bead blasted\nSPINNING BASE\nPrecisely fitted base combines with the spinning top body creating a one of a kind desk sculpture. Flip it over and it becomes a concave spinning base which allows to achieve rotation times up to 5-6 minutes.\nThe connection tolerance between mezmoTop\u2122 and the base is so precise that it creates a slight air resistance when the top is placed into the stand. In the close up it looks very satisfying- like the top would slide in a slow motion for a second.\nA mesmerizing desk sculpture\nTHE PERFECT DESK COMPANION\nWe specialize in creating unique and extraordinary kinetic desk toys that bring a bit of magic in our daily routine and mezmoTop\u2122 is no exception.\nThe solid body and smooth finish make it very pleasant to interact with and it spins with ease on any desk or flat surface. A simple way to get out of your daily routine and relax between busy working hours.\nRotating still it creates an almost magical impression of a moment when the time stops.\nORIGINAL GIFT\nWant to surprise someone? mezmoTop\u2122 makes a truly great and original present that creates a bit of magic every time you interact with it. Each unit is designed with attention to the smallest detail and built to last a lifetime. \nA conversation starter- an eye-catching centerpiece that won't stay unnoticed on any desk or shelf.\nBut don't take just our word for it.  See what our previous backers are saying about our products:\nEXCEPTIONAL PRECISION\nWith our CNC machines, we are able to achieve such level of precision that is rarely found in regular everyday objects. You\u2019ll instantly notice minutely milled lines and smooth surface texture upon touching mezmoTop\u2122 for the first time!\nA tungsten carbide ball is pressed in as a contact point for each spinning top. It guarantees the perfectly smooth rotation and durability. Every unit is manufactured in our local workshop and goes through high standard quality check. The final result is a machined masterpiece that you would enjoy to use every day.\nmezmoTop\u2122 is available in two metals and two surface finishes. We offer Stainless steel or Titanium versions, both metals are available with polished or bead blasted (matte) surface finish. \nThe finish of the bead blasted Titanium version has a slightly darker tone than the Stainless steel and it is lighter as well. The looks of it reminds me of the surface of the Moon:)\nGet both surface versions and switch between bases to create mixed design combinations.\nEach spinning top originally comes with a plastic stand to keep it still on your desktop while not spinning.The metal bottom which also serves as a spinning base is available in specific reward levels you can check out below.\nI am Kristoph, the 10-time Kickstarter creator, and designer of mezmoTop\u2122. You might know some of my previous projects like Moondrop, Vortecon, Mezmoglobe, ManualPen, Mezmocoin and others. Together with my two brothers and team, we have previously created 9 campaigns with more than 16 000 backers joining us.

Do you want great stories, characters, and a truly fun, expansive universe?  Then come on over to the Galaxy Ascendant! We have everything you could possibly need here, from complex, heroic characters (all of whom are aliens), to epic, sweeping action, a great, expansive story, and even some good old fashioned romance!  Help support the best new space opera franchise out there, and join us out here in the Galaxy Ascendant!\nThe Campaign In Brief\nWelcome to the campaign for Galaxy Ascendant books 4 & 5, A Fiery Reckoning I: Ascendancy\u2019s Rise, and A Fiery Reckoning II: Empire\u2019s Fall!\nI\u2019m Yakov Merkin, author of the Galaxy Ascendant series, The Dragon Hand, and a few other things. I\u2019m also a recovering academic and active duty soldier in the Israeli Defense Force.\nWhile I\u2019ve been blessed with the ability to write quite a bit during my service, these books being the second and third I\u2019ve written over about a 19 month period, army salaries aren\u2019t anything to write home about, and, as I\u2019m doing all of this on my own, it can be a bit difficult. My aim with this campaign is to raise the funds to be able to pay my cover artist, editor, map artist, and formatters for their excellent services and bring these next two books of the Galaxy Ascendant series to life!\nNow, the big question: Why try and fund two books at once? The answer in simple. These two books were originally conceived as one; however, it quickly became apparent that the story was so big it required two books to tell properly, and so we come to the two biggest books in the series so far, if not in word count than in the scope of events that take place. We follow more than eight primary characters through this war which began in Galaxy Ascendant book 3, A Shifting Alliance, and which has only further escalated.\nMy ultimate goal with my writing is to make this my full time job once I complete my army service, and one crucial stepping stone to that is being able to continue to be able to afford to get the highest quality people to work with me on this project\u2014which will not end when the series concludes with book 7. The Galaxy Ascendant is here to stay.\nThat\u2019s where you come in. By helping me cover these costs, you assure that this series, loved by its readers, can continue, and you can help ensure that in an age where so many established space opera franchises are reeling, new, fresh, and awesome stories can still be told in\u2014in my opinion\u2014the best speculative fiction genre out there.\nWhether you're new to the series and want to jump in wholesale, or just want to take your first steps, or if you're a returning reader, there are rewards perfect for you! And for those of you who want to truly play a role in this ongoing universe, there are numerous fun options as well.\nSome More Details\nAs mentioned above, I need your help to be able to promptly pay my artists, editors, and more for top-quality work.\nOf course, you will get things in return for your support. Reward tiers range from a cheap as $5, which nets you ebooks of books 4 & 5, up to levels that get you the entire series in ebook and print, with Galactic level reward tiers that can see you help shape this emerging universe.\nWith the Travel to the Galaxy Ascendant, A Glorious Death, and Live in the Galaxy Ascendant reward levels, you will get the opportunity to work with me to create a side character who will appear in the last two books of the series.\nWith the Ship Design reward levels, you will work with me and an artist to design ship concept art. Level 1 sees you get input into the look of ships already established in the series, while level 2 allows you to help create, from the ground up (with some limitations) designs and specs for ships mentioned but not described in detail in the series\u2014or possibly an entirely new ship type which will appear in book 6 or 7. ;)\nLastly, if you truly want to make your mark on the Galaxy Ascendant, we have a new, mega reward tier that will see you work with me to craft a Galaxy Ascendant short story which will be canon to the universe, centering on a character of your choice from the series. Apart from that, you will help determine the type of story that will be written, what will happen, etc (I get some say too, of course), and then I will write the story, which will be dedicated to you in thanks for your generous support. You will of course see it before anyone else. Additionally, when I eventually (within the next year or two most likely) put together a collection of Galaxy Ascendant short stories, yours will be included as well.\nEven if I don't hit my goal, I will still make sure that these books, and the rest of the series, are released as planned, but being able to raise the amounts necessary to cover production costs makes all of that much easier to do in a timely manner. By the time this campaign concludes, book 4 will be out, and I intend on releasing book 5 within a couple of weeks of this campaign's conclusion, after getting the Ebook version to backers early. And, of course, if we start exceeding my goals, I do have many ideas of what additional funds can go to, apart from more books (things like audiobooks, bonus artwork, and more!)\nMany of the great sci-fi franchises we grew up with and which inspired us are not in a good state today, whether due to poor creative decisions by those overseeing them, or through simple abandonment. The Galaxy Ascendant series is my contribution to an indie space opera renaissance, a vast, expansive galactic setting in which the storytelling options are endless, and in which I intend to write for a long, long time to come. And this galaxy is growing rapidly. Book 1, A Greater Duty, was released in May 2017, and now we\u2019re nearly at the release of book 5. G-d willing, books 6 & 7 will be out by next spring. In total, I\u2019ve already put out four novels, including A Greater Duty, in that time span, along with several smaller works. And as those who backed my last camping can attest, I get the rewards out on time, and the book released promptly. I take great pride in getting my work done, on time, and getting people what they paid for. If there are any unforeseen delays, rest assured that I will be completely transparent about them.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nI knew that there are plenty of people out there for whom money is tight; I\u2019ve been there myself. However, even if you\u2019re unable to contribute at this time, you can still greatly help this campaign by sharing it out with others online, telling people you know personally about it, or even by sharing the campaign video, which is on YouTube. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much even a simple share, which takes barely a second or two to do, can do to help! It only takes the right person seeing the campaign to help ensure that it is a success.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks & Challenges\nThere are none for you! As I mentioned above, I pride myself on getting the work done, on time, and I am easily reachable if there are any issues (due to time delay and army stuff, it might take my a couple days to get back to you, but I always do.)\nObviously, there are more risks & challenges here for me; I have the books to get ready and out, after all, and, as can be seen, I\u2019ve already gotten all parts of the project done so that there will be as little as possible time between the campaign\u2019s end and when rewards start shipping out.\nThis is why it\u2019s all the more vital that I be able to raise the necessary funds via this campaign, so I can properly pay everyone on time. Whatever happens, I will make it work and get the books out, because this is what I do. This series is something I need to complete and share with the world. But it\u2019d be much better, much more pleasant, if this campaign can take care of that. Success here will better enable me to put out more, awesome products in the coming year\u2014and of do I have fun things planned!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "A Fiery Reckoning Digital Bundle", "descp": "Get both Galaxy Ascendant books 4 & 5 in ebook format.

We need your support for the first production run. Thanks for supporting small business and all our first responder buddies who are itching to get their hands on one of these!\nYes, we're a small company...but we've been featured in big places! Among the many accolades, our firebiner\u00ae was labeled \"Best Gadget\" by Backpacker Magazine in their 2019 gear guide. Much love and respect to our community!\nThe Fire Escape is the next-gen to the acclaimed firebiner\u00ae, and shares some of these tried and true features:\nEverSpark fire wheel\nReplaceable ferro rods\n Bottle opener (but in a new location)\n Titanium coated stainless steel body (rated for 125 lbs of gear)\n TSA Friendly (see update for more details on experiences with TSA)\n Black or Silver color choice (with more options added as stretch goals)\nIt also boasts some awesome new ones:\n Bigger, beefy custom cutting blade that is replaceable (includes rubber cap to safely cover blade when not in use)\nTungsten carbide-tipped window breaker\n O2 wrench & hang slot (for keys and such)\n\u00bc\u201d hex wrench & hang slot\nThe Fire Escape is just as useful for every day carry as it is for emergencies. When you need it, you will certainly be glad you have it. Don't leave home without it. \nSeat Belt Cutter: easily slice through a seat belt to escape in an emergency\n Window Breaker: quickly smash out a window to escape a disaster\nMojica had too much fun field testing this. The owners of Littleton, CO U-Pull Automotive Recycling center were awesome (we owe them a couple of fire escapes).  \nFire Starter: light your camp stove or campfire quickly with the EverSpark fire wheel. It is the same tried and true technology we use on the firebiner\u00ae so you know it will work every time with ease. \nAccessory Kit: always have a dry piece of tinder with you by carrying a TinderQuik in your Wombat Whistle attached to your Fire Escape. Available with packages that contain an optional Accessory Kit, or added on later.\nHex Driver: tighten or loosen screws as needed by inserting a hex bit and taking care of business. Fits all standard 1/4\" bits. \nBottle Opener: pop, fiz, happiness...  Easily remove your bottle cap.\nO2 Wrench: ditch unnecessary extra tools and know you're covered. No more fumbling around when every second counts - oxygen tank open in no time. We let one of the prototypes take a hospital and ambulance run...it performed flawlessly. \nReplaceable Ferro Rods: with 2 extra replaceable ferro rods lasting over 2,000 sparks each, your Fire Escape will be your go-to fire starter. \nWhy carry 8 different tools when you can carry a 1.7 oz Fire Escape?\n For the price of a movie night out you can invest in the newest and coolest life-saving device on the market. Fire escape - $20. Peace of mind - priceless.\nIf you love to explore, have a passion to be prepared, ...have a camp stove, have a vehicle with a window, you need this. It needs you. Let the Fire Escape join your adventure. Be prepared for anything, escape when necessary. \nAnd for all you brave men and women risking your lives to help the rest of us on a daily basis, we think you will love the functionality and ease of use of this small, lightweight multitool that you can carry with you anywhere and everywhere.  \n Mojica got a little excited when he brought the Fire Escape to Arches National Park :) \nWe love our National Parks and are a proud sponsor of the PLA. If you happen to be running in a park with Vacation Races, you very well might see Mike, his wife or his daughters on the trail or on the \"podium\". Help us support our public lands.\nFor you technical folks out there, check out all this fun stuff: It's always a process...it all starts with an idea, a conversation, a scratch in a notebook, 2D drawings, 3D models then prototypes...it evolves. We love this process. \nFire Escape to Firebiner comparison\n$30,000 in pledges unlocked the Ferro Rod Holder. This will be added for free to each Maintenance Kit ordered now or after the campaign. It will also be available to add on separately.\n$50,000 in pledges will unlock 2 new color options for the Fire Escape body. Send us a comment to vote for your desired color. So far, Aurora (multicolor titanium coating) is in the lead. We will consider using a ceramic coating for other colors not available in titanium (pvd) coating.\n$100,000 in pledges unlocks a surprise. It will be worth it!\nAdditional stretch goals for fun:\n1,000 backers Mojica will wax his legs (why? it was his wife's idea)\n1,500 backers: OE will make a donation of Fire Escapes to a local fire station\n2,000 backers: Mojica will take a polar plunge (with some added twists)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.\nMEDIA\nHere are some recent write-ups on the Fire Escape:\nDyrt: \"a highly functional resource for emergency and survival situations\"\nMeanderthals: \"It appeals to everyone...\"\nNew Atlas: \"The Fire Escape carabiner is indeed made with [first responders] in mind, although it's also designed for use by civilians\"\nHunting Insider: \"being prepared is important and brings peace of mind\"\nGeeky Gadgets: \"specifically designed to help you be prepared\"\nTrend Hunter: \"a seven-in-one device for those who are looking for a better way to stay prepared\"\nBest News\nGear Junkie: \"the newest model has even more cool features\"\nSolid Smack: \"really friggin handy\" - read about halfway down\nTIMELINE\nOur factory was willing to start the tooling process to help us meet our timing needs. Tooling is already in process. Now we need your help for the initial PO. Here are some of our expected milestones with dates:\nOct 20 tooling completed & production materials secured\nOct 31 testing and evaluation completed\nNov 1 production started\nDec 4 initial production completed and packaging started\nDec 7 packaging completed and ready to air-ship\nDec 15 receive shipment and begin shipping out from our \"warehouse\" (US early-bird orders first, to arrive before Christmas)\nWe are in constant communication with the factory to ensure all their preparations are in order for a smooth and seamless production. Even with the best planning and backup plans, there are always possibilities for delays. We are doing all we can to minimize those chances and to get the product into your hands before the holidays.\nWe have experience. We learned from the firebiner\u00ae. We listen to our community. We made improvements, dialed it in, and are ready to deliver a great product. We are working with the same factory that produces the firebiner\u00ae, so the learning curve will be short and we can get a quality product into your hands as soon as possible.\nMeet the Team\nMichael is the founder and chief innovator. He is an accomplished engineer with lots of experience in medical and aerospace, and several patents under his belt. With his passion for the outdoors and for business, he embarked on a new adventure in life, quit his day job a couple years ago and is focusing all his attention on Outdoor Element, despite several offers to bring him back into corporate life. His wife and four girls keep him young and active. His native American name is Bodaway, which means \"fire maker\", which turns out to be pretty appropriate here.\nJoe is the operations chief. He has over 25 years experience successfully running operations for small consumer product companies. After the last company he was with sold, Joe was semi-retired (aka being lazy and driving his wife crazy) when a mutual friend introduced him to Michael. Joe agreed to buy dinner at their first meeting but conveniently forgot his wallet and stuck Michael with the bill. True story, and forgetting his wallet really was an accident (or so he says).\nThis is where the logistic magic happens, in Joe's basement. Yes, our pick & staging station is really a covered pool table. The storage table in the back is the air-hockey table. And that is Michael's beautiful bride in the picture with us. It is a good thing Joe's kids are mostly out of the house, with only his daughter, his wife and him left at home, so the pool table and air-hockey only get used a couple times a year. Otherwise, this is what it basically looks like in our \"warehouse\". The commute is crazy. :)\nExplore with confidence.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur partner-factory making the Fire Escape has been great. We have worked with them for a few years now. They get us. They get the product. The learning curve will be minimal. However, we still have to wait until the body mold is finished before we can make the blade mold and the silicon cap mold, so that adds to lead time. We do plan to air-ship the initial orders to save time. This will be right before the holidays, but should be after the main rush to get product to retail. We have the current tariff wars going on which adds some cost pressure, but we have already factored that into our pricing. If the tariffs go up, then we will need to reevaluate prior to the close of the campaign.\nAs for the product, we learned a lot with the Firebiner, having delivered tens of thousands to the marketplace already, and are incorporating those lessons into the Fire Escape.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe use quality metals with replenishable ferro rods so your Fire Escape will last a long, long time and won't ever \"run out\".\nSustainable materials\nPackaging is created with recycled material.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe are still operating out of our homes to reduce our overall footprint and we use natural and LED lighting as much as possible. We reuse boxes for shipping and recycle those that aren't feasible to continue to use. We also reuse packing material to save cost and reduce waste.\nSomething else\nSome day we will outgrow our homes, but for now it is a great way to save money and to reduce our environmental impact.

This means moving up the 4 Prestige Tracks, being the first to complete Milestones and racing to meet the objective in the Lunar Season bonuses.  \nWhat's really great about the game is you won't find victory points on many of the cards.  Instead, development cards tend to move you up the difference Prestige tracks (Defense, Commerce, Infrastructure and Exploration) and your end-game score will be based upon your relative position on these tracks to the other players.\nWhat we love most about Godspeed is the amazing player interaction and worker-placement mechanisms.  Every single action you take affects other players.  End-game scoring is based upon how you have progressed versus the other players.  You can race for Milestone points, or move up the Prestige Track.   There is no dominant strategy in the game because everything is a give and take between you and the other nations.  \nThe worker-placement mechanics are unlike anything I've seen before.  Having each worker be specialized creates tense decisions.  Do I got all-in for the First player marker during the Supply Depot action and leave myself with very few Team Members for the action phase?  Or do you hold back and give yourself more flexibility in the Action Phase.  It's such a great, unique game that is unlike anything we have ever played.\nTo purchase an add-on simply adjust your pledge amount and add the cost listed above to your pledge amount. So a copy of the base game + Dino Island promo kit would have you pledging $80 USD.  After the campaign ends in the pledge manager you can specify which add-ons the extra funds were for.\n\nGodspeed went through over a year of internal and blind-playtest feedback from 100's of unique plays that allowed us to get data to ensure the game is perfectly balanced, the rules are clear and each decision is tense.  This is helmed by our Head of Game Development Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island).  The game was fantastic before it went into testing, and the game that came out the other side is something very special indeed.  \nDuring testing we got some amazing feedback:\n95% of players felt the game's length was exactly what they wanted\n100% of players felt the game was Incredibly Easy to teach or on-par with similar games\n98% of players felt that decisions in the game mattered.  82% of players felt that every single decision they made in the game mattered.\n93% of players commented that player interaction is exactly what they wanted, and 2% even commented that it had higher player interaction than expected!\nIn the final version of the game, 96% of games had unclear winners headed into the final round of the game.\n97% of players rated the game as Fun or Very Fun!\nWhat was the most notable part of the game?\n\u201cHow quickly each phase went (and each round, for that matter). Once we had the mechanics down, it wasn't overly complicated, which was nice as it moved the game along. That said, it wasn't \"too simple\" by any means - it was just noticeably efficient, which was nice.\u201d\n\u201cI think the group was surprised how solid the depth of decisions were.\u201d\n\u201cWorking out what to bid but remembering what workers to keep back for the action phase.\u201d\n\u201cMid-way through the 3rd age, when the milestones were used up there was a mad dash and complete strategy change toward prestige movement.\u201d\n\u201cHow easy the players picked up the game after one round.\u201d\nWhat was your favorite part of the game?\n\u201cWe really liked the internal debate there is to decide which Team Members to use in order to block the other player from finishing milestones.\u201d\n\u201cThis game is very clean already - smooth transitions & well thought out. The rounds are concise & easy. Just like Dinosaur Island, this game has a lot of weight to it, yet feels effortless.\"\n\u201cMy wife and I were both going for the same milestone.  We both bid 14 so she went first.  She then used the financier to get resources, which got my hopes up, then she played her two at a time card and took her second action, taking the milestone from me.  Well done.\u201d\n\u201cBidding in the market is a favorite, as well as gauging where the other player may intend to place their Team Members.\u201d\n\u201cVictory points at end were very close (we tied!), while we took different paths.\u201d\nAfter the campaign ends, there will be a pledge manager.  Anyone at the 5 dollar level or higher will have access to upgrade their pledge at this time.  This window will be short as the game will be entering production as soon as the campaign ends, and final numbers will need to be locked in quickly. Pricing after the campaign ends will be 75 dollars for a copy of the game, so your best value is to pledge for a copy of the game during the campaign itself.\nThe Kickstarter Timed Exclusives will be available on the Pandasaurus Website at a later date ( a minimum of 90 days after delivery) at limited quantities.  The pricing on these items will be higher than they are during the campaign to ensure that the best value is offered to those customers who back for a copy of Godspeed during this campaign.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs.  We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high-quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, UK, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.\nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, UK, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.\nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD; also be aware that you may be responsible for import duties, taxes, and/or brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or declare that it has a value of zero.

Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others.

This has allowed for a lucrative industry: Dino Ranching! \nIndependent ranchers have begun farming dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders for use in their high thrill theme parks. \nYou are one of those ranchers. Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?\nTiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management. It features classic euro game mechanics with unique twists that portray the dangers of farming these prehistoric beasts.\nIn Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players control a team of ranchers and will be acquiring, breeding and selling dinosaurs. The game is played over 6 rounds. With each round consisting of several short phases.\nIn phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by their dinosaurs.\nIn phase two, players will put their ranchers to work. This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm\u2019s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds. These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.\nIn phase three, ranchers return to finish their day\u2019s work at the farm.\nIn phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types and quantities of dinosaurs they have.\nPhase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed. Dinosaurs that don\u2019t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures\u2019 security and your other dinosaurs.\nPhase six is for breeding. For each pair of matching dinosaurs you have properly enclosed, you\u2019ll welcome a new dinosaur to your farm!\nAt the end of the game, players will receive victory points for each dinosaur they have, public and private contracts they acquired and for their research developments. The player with the most victory points, wins the game.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Laboratory Mini Expansion\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion introduces certain rewards to players during play, like extra dinosaurs, resources, or research cards. To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats. \nDuring setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Within the court of Moonflight they play a strange game of cards, swearing fealty and breaking bonds by its victories and defeats for the Jacks are strange beings and as happy to swear an eternal bond over the flipping of a card as for any other reason.\nMoonflight is a deck builder. During the first half of the game its cards will trigger traditional deck building abilities. However, when the marketplace empties rather than the game ending all cards spin through 180 degrees, activating a new set of card trashing abilities. The game only ends when one player has both no draw deck and no discard stack at the start of their turn such that their entire deck is drawn, when the game ends players score only cards currently in their hand.\nDuring the first half of the game players build themselves a puzzle which they have to solve in the second half of the game.  Whoever builds their puzzle most elegantly and dismantles it most efficiently will catch their opponent with non-scoring garbage in hand and win the game.\nRounds in Moonflight are simultaneous with players taking an action each one at a time until no more actions can or will be performed. Actions are:\n\u00b7 Play \u2013 To activate a card\u2019s single use abilities\n\u00b7 Spend \u2013 To activate a card's repeat abilities\n\u00b7 Shop \u2013 To purchase cards from the marketplace\n\u00b7 Build \u2013 To set cards to tableaux cards and allow them to persist for multiple turns\n\u00b7 Pass \u2013 And allow your opponent to continue\nWhen all players pass consecutively the Round ends, cards in play are cleared, the marketplace is refreshed, new hands are drawn and a new Round begins. This Reset can trigger the Turn or the End.\n\u00b7 The Turn \u2013 If a market supply stack is emptied when the market refreshes the Turn triggers and all cards spin 180 degrees to activate their secondary ability.\n\u00b7 The End \u2013 If a player has both no cards in their draw deck and none in their discard stack after they draw their new hand the game ends and players immediately score what they hold.\nThe Clay and Bones Card Bury/Dig cycles cards before the turn but trashes them blind after it, as is suitable for the master of the graveyard.\nPlayers will need to purchase resource generating cards that won\u2019t score, to be able to afford those that will.  When the game ends players score only the cards they hold in hand, so triggering the End by Trashing down to their last few cards is a significant advantage, but players will have to balance out trashing more quickly and possibly letting a scoring card slip through their net or perfecting their final hand but risking being caught mid-plan when the game ends.  \nThe Jack O\u2019 Words and Names card Teach/Understand scores 1 point (marked in the top right of the card) before the turn and 2 points after it. If in hand when the End occurs it will score based on whichever version of the card is currently in play, scoring cards in Moonflight are rare, ones that score both before and after the Turn are precious. Its good to teach a lesson, but its better when they really understand.    \n Moonflight has two modes available for Solo Play-\nScoring Mode - A tight score challenge mode with a seperate turn count mechanism, for Solo Players who want to test themselves.\nAI Mode - Rules for a full AI system are provided for each Jack for players who want to experience the multiplayer game alone or train to beat their friends.\nNone of our Previews are paid for, beyond the gift of the copy of the game or prototype.\nThe guys from Friday Night Gamers were good enough to preview a Print and Play copy of Moonflight on their Podcast, you can listen to the episode by clicking the banner below:\nWhat the guys said about Moonflight:\n\"You\u2019re engaged the entire time, even when I\u2019m playing my own hand I have to pay attention to what you\u2019re doing.\"\n\"This is a more accessible Deckbuilder, you have a theme to your deck\u2026its not as daunting.\"\n\"I really really liked it. I\u2019d back it, I\u2019m eating this up.\"\nVanri the Rogue from Real Women of Gaming was good enough to do us a written review based on a prototype of the game, click the banner below to read what they had to say:\nWhat Vanri said about Moonflight:\n\"The artwork is absolutely stunning.\"\n\"The instructions were easy to understand and broken up into manageable parts.\"\n\"Moonflight is a fun, fantastic, and fascinating deck building/unbuilding game that will keep you entertained.\"\nIain McAllister from the Giant Brain has written us a preview based on the Moonflight Print and Play version which you can read here by clicking the banner below:\nWhat Iain said about Moonflight:\n\"Moonflight is a game that revels in crazy combinations and bold plays ... this part of the game really appealed to me.\"\n\"an interesting deckbuilder with a good amount of replayability\"\n\"The art style is bold and interesting\"\n We\u2019ve shot some videos taking you through the basics of a game of Moonflight.  \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDue to backer demand we're now offering a few add-on options.  To receive any of these options manually increase your pledge amount and then please message us to say that you have done so:\nAdditional copies of Moonflight - \u00a323 UK, \u00a325 Rest of World per additional copy.\nPlaymat - \u00a322 (\u00a317 for the mat and \u00a35 for additional shipping)\nPlaymat stitched edges - \u00a35, only available on pledge levels that include a playmat.\nSSO: Parasites expansion - \u00a34, per copy please note Parasites is an expansion to SSO, not Moonflight.\nTo manually change your pledge amount, click the \u201cManage your pledge\" button that appears next to your pledge amount and then select \"Change your pledge\" on the following page.  Remember to still enter the new amount within the correct pledge level and note that you are not adding the number entered to your existing pledge; the amount you enter should will be the total amount you intend to pledge.\nThe add-ons so far are based on direct backer requests, we're trying to keep them simple, but if you want something not included in your tier that isn't limited let us know and we'll try to figure something out for you.\n Moonflight is officially funded for a full print run.  Congratulations everyone!\nMoonflight will now be printed on heavy 340 gsm card stock for a premium finish. \nMoonflight will now be presented in a high end magnet catch box.\n\nThe Moonflight playmat is now available as an Add-on to any pledge level.\n All Moonflight cards will now be printed with a premium textured linen finish.\n\nThe Moonflight box will now be treated to a UV Spot Finish to make it look super cool.\nAt \u00a313,500 we will add additional cards to each Jack's marketplace selection, opening up pre-game supply building options to further sculpt your chosen Jack to your style.\nThroughout the campaign we released a series of riddles from the Jacks, by enough people finding the answers they unlocked a textured embossed metal Coin version of the first player marker.\n Well over 200 brave and brilliant souls have beaten the riddles of the Jacks and so a high quality metal first player marker will be added to every copy of Moonflight.\nWe will be fulfilling with UK based fulfilment centre Huboo who have warehouses in the UK and Germany, covering us against possible issues with Brexit looming. All delivery packaging will be fully recyclable. Delivery costs will be charged during the campaign as we are not using a pledge manager. Delivery charges for the base game will be:\nUK  \u2013  Free\nROW -  \u00a310\nPrices for limited levels will vary, please check the price when you pledge. \nWe have already spent around \u00a34,000 on illustration and graphic design. Our \u00a38,000 goal is set to cover all costs from the point of the Kickstarter launch until fulfilment of our rewards. This mostly covers our manufacturing costs to Long Pack, import taxes  and Kickstarter charges . Clearly this will neither cover all of our costs and much less make us any profit, however it will cover the costs incurred in printing \u00a320,000 worth of games, the sale of which will eventually make profit on the project. Furthermore, our goal is intended to ensure that we do not end up further out of pocket from the Kickstarter successfully funding, because we have already invested in artwork and will certainly neither make that money back nor make any profit without a successful Kickstarter.\nWe have been developing Moonflight\u2019s gameplay and prototype for roughly 2 years now, artwork has been being worked on for around 10 months and we have had our print and play available for blind playtesting for three months. Once the Kickstarter is complete we will take around a month to finish up any changes that arise from feedback during the Kickstarter before telling Long Pack to start printing. Printing should then start in November and complete in December. It should then arrive from the manufacturers with us in February, looking to complete fulfilment by the end of March, with backers receiving their copies finally in April.  \nSince late June we\u2019ve had a public access print and play version of the game in open beta featuring the full rules and the first two decks, Jack O\u2019 Clay and Bones and Jack O\u2019 Words and Names. This print and play is free to download from our Website, Moonflight\u2019s Board Game Geek page and its Facebook group and we encourage you to take a look before backing. We still have plenty of time to clarify wordings and tweak cards so this is your chance work with us to improve the game before it ships.\nPrint and Play Direct Download \u2013 Moonflight Free Print and Play\nLatest Rules Iteration \u2013 Current Rules\nMoonflight on BGG \u2013 Board Game Geek Page \nMoonflight on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Page\nIn addition, thanks to the amazing Wes Woodbury of Fun Da Mental games we have a copy of Moonflight available on tabletop simulator via the steam community.\nYou can also watch Wes and Moonflight designer Glenn Ford playthrough a game of Moonflight via the link below.\nWe are Man O' Kent Games, an independent games designer and publisher, and Moonflight is our second full project. We are led by Glenn Ford, previously Lead Developer on Osprey Games' Gaslands (winner of the People's and Judge's Choice Award at UKGE 2018) and designer of SSO (successfully Kickstarted in 2018). Artwork is supplied by Henry Peters and Bluepepper Designs, and we'll be printing with Long Pack Games.\nMoonflight is our second Kickstarter with the same team and the fourth game we've worked on to go on general release (including Gaslands: Refuelled).  Our first game SSO was fulfilled successfully so you can be confident that you will receive your copy of Moonflight as promised.\nOur first Kickstarter project, SSO can be viewed here, with further details on our website, BGG and facebook. For backers who wish to receive the full Man O\u2019 Kent catalogue it is a 1-6 player sci-fi survival horror game. Players in SSO arrive aboard the deserted Space Ship Omega and must survive long enough to guide it to the completion of its mission. Players can work co-operatively but win or lose as individuals, meaning that they can not only work together and betray each other but that players can nobly sacrifice themselves for the good of the mission.\nSSO is driven by the events of the Challenge deck, a series of cards triggering terrifying events and activating missions to deal with them. The base set comes with the AI deck, allowing players to experience a story similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey but it can be expanded by the First Captain set where the original mission\u2019s captain has murdered the original crew and is now hunting the rescue team. Alongside Moonflight we are launching the new Parasites deck where the crew will become infected by a deadly mind controlling parasite, forcing crew to act against their best wishes, and finally killing them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoonflight is the second Kickstarter from Man O\u2019 Kent Games and although we are an independent company we fulfilled our first Kickstarter SSO successfully. We learnt a few lessons from SSO, the main one being that we ran two months over our fulfilment date, so this time we have been able to make more accurate promises on dates.\nDuring this campaign we will be using a professional fulfilment company who have pre-quoted our fulfilment costs and specified delivery times so if our goal is met our only significant risk comes from co-ordinating the add-ons such as play mats. It is for this reason that the levels including these options have been limited, if needed we will self fulfill these items.\nWe have the initial artwork completed and a highly professional art and graphic design team in place and a strong accumulation of playtesting both privately and openly via our print and play, such that we know the game is both solid and able to sustain future expansions. While we have chosen to leave some room for feedback from the community during the Kickstarter to facilitate clarity and ease of play the game is a completed product. We have a production contract with the company Long Pack, who we worked with on our previous project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Rising Moon - Thank You", "descp": "A thank you E-mail including a digital photograph of the moon taken just for you and our gratitude for your support.\nPlease note that we will NOT be using a Pledge Manager at the end of the project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Moonbeam - Full PnP", "descp": "Print and Play of the full game of Moonflight.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a323 or more", "title": "Moonflight - Base Game", "descp": "The full game of Moonflight including all stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["185 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "Man O' Kent Loyalty Package", "descp": "A copy of Moonflight, and the new SSO expansion, Parasites.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nSSO: Parasites", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a340 or more", "title": "Foundations - Game and Playmat", "descp": "The full game of Moonflight and all Stretch goals plus a 14\" x 24\" playmat.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nPlaymat", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["44 backers", "Limited (6 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a343 or more", "title": "Man O' Kent Games Full Package.", "descp": "Copies of the full Man O' Kent line, Moonflight, SSO, SSO: First Captain and SSO: Parasites.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nSSO\nSSO: First Captain\nSSO: Parasites", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["64 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3175 or more", "title": "Group/Retailer Pledge", "descp": "10 copies of Moonflight.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Moonflight the game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Light of the Moon - Fine Art", "descp": "Copy of the game, playmat and a limited edition art print of a single jack.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nPlaymat\nArt Print", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Dreaming - Original Prototype", "descp": "The game and playmat, plus the original prototype and all development notes.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nPlaymat\nOriginal Prototype", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Drawing - Original Art", "descp": "A Copy of Moonflight, playmay, plus the original design sketchbook and hardback artbook.\nINCLUDES:\nMoonflight the game\nPlaymat\nOriginal Sketchbooks", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1 backer"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "The Moon and beyond!", "update_content": "Harken Friends,\nIts now at least 28 days since the sending out of fulfillment was completed.

A few years ago, another company successfully launched an Evil Dead 2 board game campaign that was never fulfilled to its backers. This other company collected all of the money and delivered nothing to thousands of Evil Dead 2 fans that participated in their project. Because of this travesty, Jasco Games, in collaboration with Lynnvander Studios, the Evil Dead 2 licensing group, and our other partners have come together to bring Evil Dead 2 The Board Game back from the dead. We're calling this campaign a Heartthrob Campaign. What that means is if this campaign successfully funds, all of the backers of the previous campaign (that we had nothing to do with), will be getting a copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game for only the cost of shipping (that's right, free + shipping). \nReturning Backers\nWe cannot deliver exactly what previous backers pledged for, as that was not our project, however, we hope that you will all love this game and appreciate what we are trying to do for our beloved gaming community. Our Evil Dead 2 board game is an entirely NEW game designed by Lynnvander Studios and directed and tested heavily by Jasco Games and our play testers. If you were one of many backers of the previous campaign, refer to the section below called \u201cOriginal Backers\u201d  to find answers to some commonly asked questions and to verify that you are on our backer list to receive your copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game.\nNew Backers\nIf you are a new backer, we welcome you as well! You will not only be getting a fantastic board game for $59 (An $80 retail value game when it hits stores), that is completely designed, tested and ready to print upon funding of this campaign, you are also helping bring thousands of people a new copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game! They really got hurt by the other company and we, as a community, are very proud to have the opportunity to do right by those backers. \nIf you have already done the math on this, you will see that this Kickstarter campaign was designed to do a good thing. Profit is not the main purpose of the campaign, which is why we are selling the games as close to our production cost as possible while including the free game to original backers into that cost.\nSo, now that's explained, let's take a look at this beautiful board game, shall we?\nNow includes Combat Ready Ash!\n\n1. Search For Items \n2. Battle Deadites \n3. Evil Can Get In You, And Turn You BAD!!!\n4. Battle Your Former Friends \n5. Seal The Portal (Or Open It) \n6. Save The World  \nYou know how it is. You get together with your friends and decide to have a nice weekend in the woods. Maybe head up to the cabin, go for a walk in the woods. No city, no distractions, just some time with your mates and your girl. Groovy!\nAnd then some evil darkness decides to crash your party, possessing people. And before you know it, the dead start rising from the ground, looking for this magic book or perhaps just a tasty snack. The only hope to stop them is to find that book ourselves and seal the portal near the cabin. But be careful, \u2018cause the evil can get in you and turn you bad. And evil has its own plan for the portal, wanting to open it up and release Deadites on the world.\nIt\u2019s down to us to save the world.\nDetailed Model Turns (Good & Evil)\n\nHuman Ash and Deadite Ash\nHuman Linda and Deadite Linda\n\nHuman Ed and Deadite Ed\n\nHuman Annie and Deadite Annie\n\nHuman Jake and Deadite Jake\n\nHuman Bobby-Jo and Deadite Bobby-Jo\n\n Monstrous Bosses\n\nKiller Tree, Henrietta, and The Hand\nRotten Apple Head and Limbs\n\n\n                      CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK! \n\n Evil Dead 2 Cinestory - The Movie as A Graphic Novel! \n\nThis 332 Page hardcover book is a full color illustrated graphic novel of the entire Evil Dead 2 movie.

Coupling that with its approachable rules, Mint Cooperative is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of cooperative gaming.\nMint Works is coming back for its THIRD REPRINT!

Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product selling over 30,000 copies and still reprinting. Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in Hour 1, raising almost $200,000 and expanded to the French market. \nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series where we make a singular modern board game mechanism approachable by being simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time. \nWe have continued the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has branched out and provided mints to more than just the local neighborhoods. Now, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis have begun lurking, and the Mint Cooperative has come to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression. \nWhat could be next?\nWatch this to hear how the world of Mintopia has unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.\nLet's look back at Mort's debut and then his adventure into the world of supply and demand!\nGame On Tabletop French Campaign by Lucky Duck Games\nWe are very excited to be able to bring Mint Works, Mint Delivery, and Mint Cooperative to the French market through our localization partnership with Lucky Duck Games. They have a concurrent campaign through the Game On Tabletop crowdfunding platform and we have combined our efforts to unlock Stretch Goals together! Unfortunately campaign add-ons are unavailable in French at this time.\nShort, sweet & simple:\nUSA....$5\nInt'l....$8\n**These shipping prices are good for up to three tins total (three copies of Mint Cooperative, Mint Works, Mint Delivery or any combination of the three). If you are looking to ship more than three tins, you will receive a shipping total in the post-campaign manager, but if you need to estimate, use these numbers per three tins ($10 for 6, $15 for 9, and so on) - most likely it will be less than that, but it gives you an estimate!**\nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Brazil, Russia, Mexico, South America, South Africa or the Middle East due to high postage prices, lengthy delivery times, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We offer our Print n Play free because we believe in the inclusive nature of hobby gaming, and hope that if we are unable to ship to your location, you can still play the game!\nWe are working with warehouses globally to bring customs-friendly shipping to all major markets. With the low price of our games, the mailing should be well under the threshold for most fees, but there are always cases where that is a concern so we are doing our best to make shipping super affordable for everyone!\nWe plan to ship in 3 waves. The first will be to those who fill out their survey by our announced cut off date (which will be in an update). Wave 2 will follow shortly after, with a final Wave after that. Those who do not fill in their surveys by the Wave 1 cutoff may be subject to VAT and shipping fees, if incurred, outside the USA. \nWe would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Cooperative, as well as Mint Works & Mint Delivery before the games make their way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series now, we feel like we have learned a lot about the process from start to finish.

It makes it possible to fly with ease and smoothness in a variety of conditions. \nSay goodbye to nosedives and choppy flights. We\u2019ve added a new on-board flight computer and 2 new sensors: gyro and accelerometer, combined with 2 thrust vectoring motors. That means flying POWERUP 4.0 is smoother than ever, and can now do all this:\n\nThat\u2019s right. POWERUP 4.0 can auto-loop. So you can master tricks and awesome aerobatics by simply pressing a button.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve added 2 high speed motors to POWERUP 4.0. That means you\u2019ve got double the thrust, additional maneuvering possibilities, and sharper turns. \n\nAnd together with the flight assist, you can fly just about anything\n\nNow you can learn to fly like a pro. We\u2019re showing you real-time analytics including heading direction, thrust level and turning angles.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made it a lot easier and way cooler to fly POWERUP 4.0 at night. Optional LED lights will enable you to light up the night - making for awesome visuals and round-the-clock fun.\n\n\n2 rear wheels and 1 front wheel give your paper plane more style and make for easier takeoff and landing. They also make it possible to launch off of a surface rather than hand-launching. \n\n\n\nWe partnered with the best RC hobby vloggers on the planet \u2013 FliteTest! They have put together their incredibly creative minds to develop a foam jet inspired by the F22 for the 4.0. It is made from a special laser cut foam board they created and make in the USA.\n\n\nIntuitive control makes it easy to fly. Simply tilt your phone in the direction you want your plane to fly. It\u2019s really that easy.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to 3 super successful Kickstarter campaigns,400K+ happy customers, and more than $3.5 million in funding, we decided to bring you a new and improved paper airplane kit to add to your collection.\nShai Goitein - pilot, industrial designer, CEO and founder - decided it was time to level up again. So we listened to feedback from our POWERUP 3.0, POWERUP FPV and POWERUP Dart users, and made this the most powerful, most intuitive, and overall best version yet. Our brand new Autopilot Assist feature makes every flight a smooth one-- even in bad conditions. Real-time analytics help you become a better pilot, and two high speed motors mean you can get super creative with your plane designs. We\u2019ve even added optional LED lights so you can fly at night.\nPOWERUP 4.0 is breaking paper plane barriers, and we\u2019re excited to share this badass edition with you all.\nPOWERUP is an incredibly helpful tool when it comes to teaching and learning aeronautics. Students can test multiple designs, analyze their work and improve their planes. Through trial and error, they can understand what makes their plane fly smoother, longer and farther- key lessons in airplane design.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTross is a data driven Crowdfunding company", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident in our ability to deliver POWERUP 4.0 on time.

It raised nearly $500K in total funding with over 6,000 backers and went on to become the World's Most Successful Pocket knife selling over 30k units worldwide in its first year.  We're back on Kickstarter with a complete redesign of the B-2 Nano Blade, this time concealed inside a discreet military style sheath.  After 5 successful campaigns and early delivery each time, Bomber & Company is extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our collection, the B-2 Dog Tag, a fully concealed nano blade pocket knife.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDimensions:\nUltraLight Weight: < 2oz\nLength of Knife (opened): 3.7in\nLength of Knife (closed): 2.75in\nLength of Blade: 1in\nThickness: 0.2in\nHandle Length: 2.5in\nMaterials (Blade and Body): 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel\nHardness: 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale)\nColor: Jet Black\n\nStraight Edge Blade: The sharp flat ground straight edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices and versatility of everyday use. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.\nSizing: Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the B-2 Dog Tag. The full opened length is only 3.7inches and when closed, it stands at 2.75inches in length and less than 0.2 inches in thickness. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket, wallet, or worn around the neck as a standard dog tag.\nWeight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 2oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440Carbon black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.\nMaterials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Dog Tag is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Dog Tag can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.\nButterfly Lock: The B-2 Dog Tag uses a custom designed double-sided butterfly lock. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a nano blade/knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is released by squeezing both sides of the B-2 Dog Tag and engaged automatically when let go. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding with no locks. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock.\nDurability Tested: While designing the B-2 Dog Tag, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 Dog Tag is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 Dog Tag to hit perfection.\nLifetime Warranty: We can ensure that all of our products are made with the highest quality in mind as we would never offer a product that we would not use ourselves. All Bomber & Company products carry a full Lifetime Warranty.  If it ever breaks, send it back to us. We'll replace it free of charge.

We made MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 as tiny as possible.\n\nIn our busy lifestyle convenience is everything. As you receive a parcel you start looking for a knife or some other sharp object you could use to open the box. Often it just takes too much effort. With MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 you can forget about spending your time on searching for the blade.\n\n\nEither you want to keep it in your pocket or next to your keys, the MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 will fit your lifestyle perfectly. It will always be there when you need it. \nWe designed the blade at 35deg bevel angle. It makes the blade sharp enough to cut with confidence.\nNot only for cutting. With MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 you can scratch, peel off stickers, split pills, open cans and do other daily tasks.\n35\u00b0 cutting angle not only makes the blade sharp enough to cut paper but also safe for touch. It is reliable when you use it.\nA flexible stainless steel spring keeps the cap secure and makes it completely safe in your pocket.\n 30mm carabiner ring for fast attaching\nWe designed MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 combined with super-fast attaching/detaching carabiner ring to ease your everyday carry. Carabiner ring also gives you a good, secure grip when using the blade and enables full control of the edge positioning.\nThe perfect companion on the go. Whether you are going to office or heading for a hike in the mountains, MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 will be with you within a hand's reach.\nSilicone rubber plug for safety cap \nEach MICROBLADE PILL\u2122 comes with a special rubber plug where you can put your safety cap when the blade is used. \nSimply pull off the cap of the blade and put it on a cap holder. When you have finished using the pill put it back on the blade.\nMICROBLADE PILL\u2122 comes in three metal cap variations to fit you perfectly. Choose between brass, copper or stainless steel, or mix them together. \n\nEach MICROBLADE PILL\u2122  blade is CNC machined from hardened stainless steel rod and each cap is CNC machined from solid brass, copper or stainless steel rods. \nCopper and brass are very dense and unique metals that over the time will attain beautiful patina on the surface. It means that copper and brass caps will eventually get darker and change their patterns over the time. \nManufacturing\nWe have been planning this project for months. Funding goal and delivery dates are well-considered. We have a great team with previous experience in bringing new products in market.

It is not a replica of any particular battle and the emphasis is on the tanks and their characteristics: Mobility, Firepower, and Protection.\nUnit positioning is the key factor in the game, which makes it a direct technical simulation of real combat, as in computer games. Simple rules allow quick game pace with many twists in a single battle. Dice contribute to versatility, but with good tactics, the luck factor is reduced to a minimum.\nHaving multiple units at disposal, you know their strengths and weaknesses, and the enemy units waiting for you on the battleground - there is no predetermined way to win, and all you need to do is to move your tanks wisely while outsmarting the opponent by shooting at the targets\u2019 weakest sides.\nThe game system is a sort of sandbox concept where you can test various situations with the given \"physics\" determined by the rules, while the scenarios are there to guide the game by giving specific tasks in specific conditions.\nDuring the war, tanks almost always acted together with other military branches and types of units - infantry, artillery, aviation, etc. In this game, alongside tanks, there is self-propelled artillery, while the infantry is present in the form of armored half-trackers and has specific tasks depending on the scenario: to take control of a city square, demine a building, release prisoners, etc. However, the main role is reserved for tanks and tank destroyers, and players act as commanders of an armored formation.\n\nPANZER STRIKE GAME SERIES\nThe plan for Panzer Strike: Western Front (PS:WF) is to be published in three standalone games and two expansions which will together form a huge urban 3D terrain (~ 2 x 1,5 meters). This project features the first two games:\nPS:WF 1 represents the Central part of the town, with many residential and public buildings.\nPS:WF 2 is the Northern part, which is characterized by a railway station and an industrial zone.\nFuture games and expansions will be the following:\nPS:WF 3 will be the Southern part where the town gradually transits into suburbs. It will have a small river with bridges over it, a large estate with a chateau, etc.\nPS:WF 4 will be a terrain expansion (only board and 3D objects) which extends the town to the West. The outermost edge will be bordered by a large river. It will feature a port and an old town (fortress). Besides the terrain, the set will contain movable ships.\nPS:WF 5 will be an expansion to the East. The railway and industrial zone from the Northern part will continue here, and the main feature of this expansion will be an airport.\nMore details about \"Western Front\" series will be published in one of the future updates.\nPanzer Strike: Eastern Front will primarily represent an open field environment. Besides the 3D objects, it will feature a full 3D terrain (hillocks, riverbeds, etc.). It will also have multiple expansions.\nPanzer Strike: North Africa and Panzer Strike: Spanish Civil War are also planned.\nAll the games from the Panzer Strike series will be mutually compatible (scale, rules, miniatures, etc.)\nThere are two games in offer in this campaign: PS: WF 1 (Center) and PS: WF 2 (North) in two versions each: Standard and Premium. The difference between versions is in tank pieces: the Standard version has molded pieces (102 of them), while the Premium one comes with realistic miniatures (66 pcs).\nOther elements (board, buildings, plastic elements, manuals...) are the same. The full contents of each option is presented in the images below:\n-\n-\n-\nThe rules, although very simple, realistically emulate a real battle. The game features two different sets of rules: Simplified and Core.\nSimplified rules date from 12 years ago and they were the first set of rules implemented in the game (link to history). The movement of the piece consists of a series of individual steps (forward movements to the adjacent square or a rotation in place by 45\u00b0) which resembles the movement of tracked vehicles in real life. In the Simplified rules, the destruction upon the action of shooting depends on the Firepower of the shooting tank (determined by the red dice rolls), Armour value of the target vehicle (different values for each side of every tank type) and the Distance between the tanks (determined by a special ruler): the tank is destroyed if the Firepower is greater than the sum of the Armour and Distance values. Shooting efficiency drops drastically over distance, so the combat occurs mostly at short range.\nThese rules are excellent representatives of our MCMD principle (minimum complexity, maximum diversity). Because of this, the Pocket version of this game has already had some great reviews on BGG:\n  \"The simplicity cannot be overstated - I read the rules and was playing in around 10 minutes! However, simple does not mean less tactical - I think with the right players this game could be as tactical as chess!\" -  Review by Graham 13\n  \"... the designers vision seemed to me to force you to move, the old shoot, move and communicate Boom-Boom concept.\" - Review by Robert Smith\n  In the Core Rules, the movement of the pieces is identical, but the difference is that in addition to Firepower (penetration), Armour, and Distance factors, there is a fourth one: Accuracy. Unlike in the Simplified rules, the penetration value drops gradually over distance. These changes make the game even more realistic and a more tactical engagement from players is required, while the rules remain simple to learn.\n  Besides the basic differences from the Simplified rules, in future, there will be a series of Advanced Optional Rules which can be applied in any combination, so the players can adapt the game to their own affinities, depending on the age, level of tactical and strategic knowledge, time at their disposal, etc. (for example difference in accuracy when moving and when standing still, different types of damage, etc.).\nYou can read the rules (working version) HERE and HERE:\nSimplified rules - Table 1\n\nIn order to implement some specific tasks, there will be a dozen scenarios in a brochure. Some of them will have fixed initial positions and tasks, and some will be more flexible. There will be symmetrical scenarios (similar tasks for both players) and asymmetrical ones.\n  Read more about scenarios for PS:WF 1 HERE.\nPS:WF 2 will contain scenarios for the Northern part of the town and for both boards combined.\n\nThe battleground consists of a board, three-dimensional buildings and plastic elements.\nThe board has 4 parts (33x39cm each, total 66x78cm).\nThe 3D buildings come in unassembled. The set contains sheets of a gray solid board (thickness 1mm) and self-adhesive paper that are used to form buildings\u2019 bases. The walls are made of a gray solid board of a 1.5mm thickness that is already cut to the exact shape and size. The facades are made of self-adhesive laminated paper. The roofs are printed on laminated cardboard.\nThere is a detailed instruction for assembling. The set contains one extra building that serves for practicing. With a little patience and dexterity, everything can be easily assembled. The Northern board is a bit more challenging than the Central part because of some smaller elements (barracks and wagons).\nBuildings built this way are very sturdy and resistant. See the drop-test video:\nPLAY\n\nPlastic elements are also a part of the terrain and they can represent high (monument, walls, trams, etc.) or low obstacles (fountains, planters,etc.).\nIn the Northern part, there is a train composed of plastic and cardboard elements. The locomotive and some wagons count as high, while the other wagons count as low obstacles. Like a tram, they can also move along the rails during the game.\nFor our Tank Chess project, we already made two molding tools for the plastic pieces. When we make a series of PS:WF pieces, they will be done in camo-like colors, in tones similar to ones of the miniatures. These pieces do not have rotating turrets. Each piece represents a class of tank: there are Light tanks, Medium tanks, Heavy tanks, Light, Medium and Heavy Tank destroyers, Howitzers, Tank hunters, Armoured cars, and Half-tracks.\nEach standard set contains 102 tank pieces (51 on each side)\nThe Premium set contains miniatures done according to particular types of armored vehicles. If a tank has a turret, the turret on the mini can rotate. There is a total of 66 miniatures, but the distribution by classes is different, i.e. the German side has more Heavy tanks, and the Allied side more vehicles in total (mediums and lights).\nAs add-ons, there are various sets with different miniatures, and in the future there will be even more.\nMiniatures are in 1:300 scale, i.e. \"6mm\". They are produced in SLS 3D printing technology, which results in a sand-like surface. According to that, the level of detail is lower (vehicles don't have spare tracks, boxes, hatches, etc.), but the important details are there and the proportions are correct so each version of a vehicle is recognizable.\nThe miniatures are already dye painted, and therefore immediately ready to play (although, you can paint additional details if you want).\nMiniatures made in this technology are quite robust and don't require much care when packing. For example, gun barrels are elastic and therefore hard to break. See the short video:\nPLAY\n\nSince the miniatures are in standard scale (1:300), you can use miniatures from other manufacturers as well (even 1:285 miniatures could do).\n\nEveryone who pledges for a physical copy of a game (all the options except for ''Thanks'', PnP and STL) during the first 24 hours will receive a First Day Gift: an armored train with two wagons and a long-range cannon Big Bertha along with special scenarios where they have the main role. The Big Bertha will not be involved directly in the fight, as its range is too much for a battlefield of this scale. All these items form a mini-expansion that will be available as an add-on for $8 if you don't manage to grab it as a gift.\n\nThe add-ons will be available after the campaign through the Backer Kit pledge manager. These will be some of them:\n- Armored train and Big Bertha howitzer mini-expansion - $ 8 (~0,10kg)\n- Set of 3D buildings (Central) - $ 12 (~0,5kg)\n- Set of 3D buildings (Northern) - $ 10 (~0,45kg)\n- Set of 3D destroyed buildings (compatible with both Center and North) - $ 8 (~0,17kg)\n- PS:WF 1 (Center) terrain only (board + 3d buildings + plastic terrain elements) - $ 38 (~1,9kg)\n- PS:WF 2 (North) terrain only - $ 42 (~1,9kg)\n- Standard tank pieces pack (102 pcs) - $ 18 (~0,23kg)\n- Basic miniatures pack (66 pcs) - $ 58 (~0,17kg)\n- Basic miniatures half pack (33 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,12kg)\n- Basic German miniatures (31 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,12kg)\n- Basic Allied miniatures (35 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,12kg)\n- Miniatures pack - French vehicles (33 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,17kg)\n- Miniatures pack - German vehicles - early (33 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,17kg)\n- Miniatures pack - UK vehicles - early (33 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,17kg)\n- Miniatures set - auxiliary vehicles and guns/howitzers (33 pcs) - $ 29 (~0,14kg)\n- Print and Play files (Central) - $ 5\n- Print and Play files (Northern) - $ 5\n- Print and Play files (full pack) - $ 8\n- STL files of miniatures - $ 20\n  Each add-on will be described in the pledge manager.\n\nThis game is already very rich in content, but we\u2019ve prepared a set of stretch goals that will enhance it even more. We are open to any backers\u2019 suggestion and we\u2019ll consider every proposal that could lead to an even better gaming experience.\n  #1 - $ 10 000: Barricades (6 low and 6 high ones)\n-\n#2 - $ 12 000: Passenger train (a locomotive and 4 wagons)\n#3 - $ 14 000: 4 improvised bunkers\n The pledges made on BackerKit (after the Kickstarter campaign) also count towards reaching new stretch goals.\nBy using services of fulfillment companies, we\u2019ve provided EU friendly and US friendly shipping, and if we have at least 50 backers from Canada and Australia, we\u2019ll provide friendly shipping for these regions also.\nIn our previous campaign, we used for the first time the services of a pledge manager company (Backer Kit). Because of some discrepancies, some of the backers were charged twice for the shipping (the first time on KS, the second time in the pledge manager) and they will be compensated for it. However, since we don\u2019t want the issue to repeat itself, in this campaign, the shipping will not be charged during Kickstarter, but only in Backer Kit! That way, the shipping fee will be calculated after you complete your order (you may add various items then) according to the total weight of the order. The table shows the shipping fees:\nFor example, a single copy of the game (PS:WF 1 or PS:WF 2) weighs approximately 2,4 kg, which belongs to the category \"< 3,5 kg\". Two copies (PS:WF 1 + PS:WF 2) belong to the category \"< 5 kg\".\nThe reward options and add-ons section show the rough weights so you can estimate what will be the shipping costs if you purchase add-ons in the pledge manager.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gained a lot of experience working on the realization of previous projects.

We are sure you will agree, this d20 will reign supreme on your game table. All other dice will quiver in fear before it!\nThe Black Death crushes all other dice!\nStanding at almost an inch tall and featuring a skull on the 20 face, this mighty d20 will allow you to go medieval on all those who oppose you! Reach into your dice bag and draw forth the deadliest d20 available!\nThe Black Death is as fearsome in appearance as it is in name! Many tales of woe will be wrought by its cold, silent faces. Check out some of the deadly features detailed below.\nThis die towers above lesser dice. The size of the Black Death along with its crisply presented numerals means it is easy to read while being frightening to behold!\nWe've worked to offer some unique and exciting exclusives as part of this project. In addition, we've got some GREAT stretch goals. Our backers from previous projects know that we focus on creating value within our projects and we think the stretch goals really show this. Read on!\nEach of these exclusives are part of this project only and will not be available again after the project closes (except the Coin & Blood PDF) so get yours while you can! Each of these items are associated to a specific pledge level and will not be available separately in the pledge manager. For backer levels that include physically shipped exclusives on this project, we are only shipping to the USA.\nNot just any dice box can contain the insidious Black Death. We asked Dog Might Games to design a dice box worthy of the theme and they returned with a killer design! This dice box features a skeletal coffin top and black finish that pairs exceptionally well with this stone cold d20. It can hold a dozen Black Death d20s with ease.\nAs with the exclusive dice boxes from our Dragon d20 project, this dice box is based on Dog Might's Dragon Sheath product line and comes in their Abyssal Black Flame Birch. It matches the theme perfectly!\nDog Might really came through for us on the Dragon d20 project and our backers LOVED the dice boxes. We are excited to have the opportunity to work with them again!\nThis item is available to ship to US backers only.\nLet your Black Death d20s roll in style through the winding stairwells of Skull Keep! This dice tower brings all the theme and then some. At a full 12\" tall, this 3d modeled and printed tower is a sight to behold. These towers come fully assembled and hand painted in the likeness of the photos. You will be ready to roll upon the opening of your rewards shipment! \nThis tower is based on designs licensed from Fat Dragon Games and also modified designs from the Dragonbite Community Creator program. The Skull Keep is a sturdy and well crafted tower. It will last you many years and look incredible on your game shelf!\nPLAY\n\nThere have been questions regarding availability of the STL files for the Skull Keep model, but these will not be available as part of the project as they are not owned by Black Oak Workshop. We do not have an agreement in place that allows for release of the files, so we will not be offering those this go around. Thanks for understanding everyone!\nNOTE: Due to the work required for these beautifully hand painted items, the quantity is limited to 30 (updated from 20). The reward level is limited and if all 30 are taken, there will be no option to purchase this item in the pledge manager. If any do remain, they will be available on a first-come/first-served basis. This item is available to ship to US backers only.\nIf you need to take death to the next level, we have you covered! The Epic Death is an utterly HUGE d20 that stands a full 6.5 inches on your game table! This is a hand painted and assembled item using 3d printed faces and a tough rubber frame - it's light, but rugged. You can roll it with no fear - that's right - this mega d20 can be rolled and used in game!\nThis is an exclusive, custom variation on the Giant D20 by Amber's Secret Cove. You can view the standard product here. These huge dice are awesome fun to toss on the table or put on the shelf for display and are well rated by customers. Check out this monster in action!\nPLAY\n\nNOTE: Due to the work required to assemble these, the quantity is limited to 50 (updated from 25). The reward level is limited and if all 50 are taken, there will be no option to purchase this item in the pledge manager. If any do remain, they will be available on a first-come/first-served basis. This item is available to ship to US backers only.\nWhile not truly an exclusive, we are partnering with the fine folks at Gallant Knight Games to once again offer one of their killer RPGs as a fun addition to the project. For Coin & Blood is another one of many well-received products by the GKG team and we feel it is a great thematic pairing for the Black Death!\nFor Coin & Blood is a classically inspired d20 fantasy roleplaying game with a twist...a twist of the knife!\nThis game has received very positive reviews and is a great read. We're very honored to be able to offer it to you here at as a PDF bundle with our dice or as the PDF with a print on demand code to get a physical copy. Check out the game on DriveThruRPG!\nEmbracing the literary genre known as \"grimdark\", and inspired by stories of mercenaries, sellswords and blackguards, FOR COIN & BLOOD keeps you on your toes, as you tell stories about the terrible things that happen to people, when they head out in search of coin, passion, and revenge...\nClearly, this is a most excellent game in which to sling your Black Death d20s! We're offering two pledge levels for this item. The first includes a PDF download of the game and the other includes the PDF and a code for a free softcover POD copy of the game! These are both excellent values for this product! For backers ordering the POD version, the physical book will ship separate from the other rewards on the project.\nNOTE: The Coin & Blood PDF will be available in the pledge manager post project for $6, so for those backers who would like to receive a copy it will be available there. However, the POD code will not be available in the pledge manager.\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing First-Class Service and International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with BackerKit upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nFor our International backers, we are adding a note that the shipping costs are reflective of what the USPS charges us. We do not have overseas distribution and likely will not for some time as we are a small shop. As we grow, we hope to be able to get those costs down for  you as we know they are painful. All tariffs/taxes/fees associated with international shipments are the responsibility of the receiving party.\nNOTE: For backer levels that include exclusives on this project, we are only shipping to the USA. We cannot risk lost international shipments for these items as replacements will not be possible.\nNOTE: We do not ship to the Russian Federation or the DPRK.\nDice Maniacs!\nFor all you dice lovers out there, Black Oak Workshop encourages you to visit and join the Dice Maniacs Club on Facebook.

Most evident is our new, easier-to-use format. The original Traveller, many years ago, was three Little Black Books (LBBs) - 48-page black-covered booklets with the titles Characters and Combat, Starships, and Worlds and Adventures. We're formatting this edition as three Big Black Books (BBBs) with the same titles, but 280 pages (Book 1) or more (304 pages for Book 2 and Book 3), and all in a slip case.  \nThe T5 Core Rules Set\nWe have been working on this project constantly since 2015. Oh, there were breaks along the way. After the last printing, I was inspired to write the Traveller novel: Agent of the Imperium; somewhere in there, I had a quadruple bypass (I'm recovered, thank you). But we've been playing Traveller5 and working through its rules and concepts.\nThe Three Core Rules Books\nNow is the time for a reprint. \nAdventuring In The Traveller5 Universe. The Traveller5 Core Rules are a foundation, and  they support all sorts of adventuring within the rich Traveller universe. To help get everyone started, we have created a set of five Traveller EPIC Adventures: \"The Voyages of the Free Trader Insert-Name-Here.\" This 32-page PDF follows the exploits of any Free Trader as it wanders through Regina subsector in the Spinward Marches. We'll release it at the same time the physical books ship (that is, in August). \nAdventuring In Regina Subsector: our introductory EPIC adventures\nCards. If you have ordered anything from us in the past few years, you have probably gotten a few cards stuck in your order. We find these are great pieces to use in adventuring. So we have created the Traveller5 Benefits Deck - 54 Poker Cards in a box (subject to some last minute changes): \n12 ships (Beowulf, Scout, Yacht, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, as encounters, or as goals for adventure.\n12 worlds (Regina, Capital, Rhylanor, and more) for use as homeworlds, interesting places, or as destinations.\n12 weapons (StapleGun, Magnum, Advanced Combat Rifle, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or available in the local weapons shop.\n 6 arcane tasks (Drive Tuning, Knack for Astrogation, and more) for acquisition in the course of adventures.\n 6 medals (Starburst for Extreme Heroism, Exemplary Service, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or as adventure hooks.\n 6 random items for use in adventures. \nJust a sampling; subject to change.\nThe Captain's Supplement (with the Ship captain Level) provides still more items.\nAdd-Ons.We also have three add-ons (they are included at the Owner-Aboard level) that enhance the Traveller system: Deck Plans, the Traveller Novel, and the Traveller Audiobook.\nThe Deck Plans were originally issued with the Big Black Book. This edition describes them in detail based on the Ship Design System, and we find they are a great resource for adventures. \nAdd the Deck Plans to your Pledge for $20.\nThe Traveller Novel - Agent of the Imperiumgives insights into the history of the Imperium. If you missed it, this is your chance to get reading copy, and the Audiobook (on two CDs; about 10 hours of audio). By the way, the Audiobook disks include the novel eBook, AND a footnoted PDF: 300 footnotes explaining and detailing what's going on in the story. \nAdd the Paperback to your pledge for $14.\nAdd the Audiobook to your pledge for $14.\nOr, add both to your pledge for $22.\nAdd Ons\nFinally, each level has one or more Crew ID Cards: Traders' Guild Member Cards with a pre-generated, named character corresponding to the Backer Level (and all the lower level cards as well). At the First Officer (and above) Level, we'll edit the name of the character to a name you specify (within reason).\nAside. This is intended to make you support at a higher level: to bump your pledge up so you'll get more of the cards. But I just can't do it. So everyone backing at a physical shipment level will get a set of at least five Crew ID cards taken from my pre-generated set of 40 or so ship crews. We'll do customizing at the First Officer (and above) level.\nExample Crew Cards (from Free Trader Aesir)\nUSB Flash Drive Option. For some of you, the CDROM format does not work. When you choose this option, we put the files on a USB Flash Drive instead of the CDROM. Add $5 for this option. \nAnd By The Way. Some of you may ask about the fabled Traveller5 Player's Manual. As we worked on this edition, we (that is, I, Marc, the designer) felt that we wanted to work out the bugs and details of the Core Rules before we then abridge them into a Player's Manual. It's still coming, and the PDF will go out to everyone who supported the original T5 and/or who supports this T5.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks, but we are well on the way to completion.

If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. If your order cannot be delivered, we will refund your order completely, including fees.\n \nReshipments and late survey shipments will all be sent out at the same time, about 3 months after the start of fulfillment to simplify the logistics and avoid errors resulting from sending multitudes of single orders.\n \nThe shipping survey will close 3 months after the start of fulfillment.

In order to get the gold you need, you will have to turn to the wealthiest - and most dangerous! - individual you know...\nThe Dragon!\nIn Jesse Li's Dragon's Interest, you will be the leader of one of these kingdoms, and it will be up to you to outbid, out maneuver, and out play your opponents to reign supreme. You will borrow gold from the draconian loan shark on the mountain to finance your improvements, but you will need to make sure you have ample reserves on hand when the Dragon comes calling, because if you can't pay her back, she will take out her anger on you and your kingdom, laying waste to all you hold dear!\nDragon's Interest has players competing with economic engines that they will create in their kingdoms. They will collect gold and knights and knowing when to spend or save those resources will be the tightrope they will need to walk. Dragon's Interest modifies and enhances the original mechanisms found in Ponzi Scheme to allow players to bluff their opponents and engage in secret bidding wars as they try to stay one step ahead of their opponents, and of course their scaly loan shark. Only the player who does the best job in rebuilding a large and diverse Kingdom will come out on top in this mid-weight Euro style strategy game!\n\n\nAt the start of each round, you will bid interest payment values for your loan from the dragon. The more interest you're willing to pay, the better your selection of loan value and building type.\nTake turns activating buildings. Gain resources based on how many of a particular building you have, then make secret offers to others (based on the type of building you activated) for buildings and resources. Be careful- if your offer is too low, it may backfire on you!\nAt the end of the round, the Dragon will move at least one space around the mountain. Whichever building type she passes dictates which building projects owe interest to her - payable immediately! Sometimes new building tiles revealed in the center will indicate that she should be moved more than one space, or that other events should trigger.\n\n\nClick on the banner above to read the rules to Dragon's Interest!\nAt $30,000, we will add a King and Dragon Meeple to the game to take the place of their cardboard counterparts.\nAt $45,000 we will add a Mountain Meeple for your Dragon to circle, as well as stickers for all the meeples - your Knights, King, Dragon, and Mountain that was just unlocked.\nAt $60,000, we will add a cloth lining into the Premium Magnetic Box so your Knights and Coins don't get so bruised when they are thrown into it!\nDragon's Interest will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped inside a custom fitted box to ensure maximum safety when being shipped to you.. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy.\nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of the above countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you! \nFriendly Local Game Stores are an invaluable part of this hobby that we love, and we appreciate everything they do to bring value to the industry. TMG recognizes that the brick & mortar store is not only a place to buy games, but a location for people to enjoy their hobby with a welcoming community. \nThe individuals who own and run game stores are some of the most informed people within the industry, and the knowledge that they have shared with TMG has proven to be most insightful. We invite all Retailers to join our Facebook Retailer Group so they can be part of the conversation between publisher and retailer, get any questions they might have answered, and be involved in future projects.

Each player is assigned a role on the ship be it captain, engineer, doctor, or one of the many other roles. In secret, players are randomly assigned to be an alien or human. The human team must fix the ship and find the alien queen before the ship arrives home. \nEach round, players will draw tokens out of a shared bag and give the tokens to other players or use them to perform actions on the ship. However, if you spend too much time redrawing your tokens for the right ones, time will run out and you'll be forced to make difficult decisions without enough information. Jumpship plays quick so you need to think fast!\nJumpship is designed by Tony Go (Deep Space D-6, Mythic Arcana) and is Illustrated by Shirin Rafie aka drawmonsterdraw.\nIn Jumpship, each player is given a special role. Each role lets you play the game a little differently, whether it's granting immunity from being scanned like the First Mate, or directly applying target tokens like the Security Officer.  From there, all players are assigned to be a human, an alien, or the alien queen. The aliens will know who each other are, but the humans won't know who anyone is.\n\n\nThe goal of the humans is to find and eliminate the alien queen. Meanwhile, the aliens only need to ensure the queen is still alive and on the ship when the ship arrives home. \nThe game rules are simple: On your turn, draw two tokens out of the bag and give them to other players.\n- You cannot give yourself tokens.\n- You cannot give both tokens to the same player.\nWhat do the tokens do?\n\nPlayers may also re-draw their tokens once per turn- but beware, because countdown tokens must be played immediately, re-drawing your tokens too often can cause time to run out! Unless... that's what you wanted to do...\nThroughout the game, events will trigger giving the humans an opportunity to eliminate the queen. If they can accomplish this, they'll immediately win. \nThe Boards\nJumpship centers around two boards that indicate the concurrent progress of the game. The primary ship console board tracks time. As time runs out, the players will have to make decisions on who will be put into quarantine, ejected, or killed. \nCountdown to Quarantine - The player with the most Command tokens when this countdown track is filled must choose a player to place in Quarantine. Placing a player in Quarantine puts a slight hindrance on them depending on the mode being played. Typically a quarantined player is restricted to drawing one token per turn, or their special role ability is disabled. \nCountdown to Eject - When this countdown track is complete, the player with the most Target tokens is ejected from the game. If this player is the Queen, the game immediately ends and the humans win. Otherwise, the ejected player no longer draws tokens but can still participate in the conversations of the game. \nCountdown to Kill - The last and final track of the game is the last hope for the humans to win. At this point, the player with the most Command tokens must choose a player to kill. If they successfully choose the Queen, the humans win! If they pick wrong and kill a human or regular alien, the aliens win!\nThe second board is the Ship Repair Console. Players can choose to place Repair tokens on this board in order to repair the ship and bring the systems online including the ever important Bio Scanner. \nAs a team, you'll need to work together to fix the ship and bring the scanners online. The scanners are required for players to perform a scan. After the 5th repair token is played, further repair tokens will eventually get the ship home. If the aliens can get the ship fully repaired, and the queen is still alive, the ship will return home and the aliens will immediately win. Can you trust players that keep placing repair tokens?\nOther Social Deduction Games\nJumpship began as an exploration of hidden identity games. As a gamer, the concept of hidden identity games are immensely exciting to me, but the execution of many of them left me wanting more (and sometimes less!). Jumpship was designed to address some of the issues I have with a few of the more popular games.\nResistance/Avalon - Due to the way players choose other players to go on missions, there are many times when some players don't have anything to do an entire game (except voting- an element that is largely ignored in many groups/sessions). Additionally, deep dives into the meta game of Resistance show a strong trend of the first half of the game playing out the same every time (captain always picks herself, first mission always passes, etc). \nSecret Hitler - Secret Hitler uses a unique deck of policy cards to make it appear as if a good player was forced to make a bad move. However, because the policy deck is of known quantity, and the results of each round are shared, players can effectively track what everyone has played. This splits the participating players into those who are willing to put that effort in, and those who are just looking for a social experience.  \nWerewolf/Mafia - On the other end of the spectrum, Werewolf-type games rely heavily on pure social cues. Where the previous two games sought to add game mechanics on top of social ones, they often resulted in the games feeling entirely playable on mechanics alone. Werewolf simply lacks enough mechanical meat to allow players to indulge in double-think and strategy. Versions of Werewolf also require moderators and have early player elimination. \nSo how does Jumpship solve these aspects?\nPlaying the Game and Strategy\nHidden Identity games need to provide means for both sides to accomplish their goals directly but not overtly. Ideally there should be mechanics in place for which players can hide their motives. \nFirst, are the tokens in Jumpship. Early in the game you will draw a target token and be tasked with giving it to another player. As a human, this doesn't feel good because there's not enough information to determine who is on who's side. This discomfort is a welcome place for the aliens, who, under the same condition, are now able to directly further their goals while acting as if they had no choice. Someone who shows no sign of remorse when giving a target token may indeed be an alien!\nNext, we have the board. As countdown tokens are placed onto the board, a sense of urgency increases. Just about every action you take in Jumpship can be interpreted from the perspective of an alien or a human. For example, scanners are one of the only ways to get hard information on another player. But in order to perform a scan, you not only need 4 scan tokens, but the scanners have to be repaired. Repairing the ship is a very human thing to do indeed, however it is also the same track as getting home early. In this way, aliens can contribute to both objectives without revealing who they are. Don't forget: you can't always trust the person who performs the scan...\nLastly, Jumpship features unique roles for individual players. These character roles dynamically change the game each time you play. The Captain role allows you to decide ties creating a natural leadership. The Scientist gets a discount for scanning, making other players unwittingly focus scan tokens on him. These roles subtly guide how players interact. Imagine a Captain that is secretly the alien queen!\nMany hidden identity games also leave scarce options for the \"bad\" players that have been discovered. In a game like The Resistance, if you've been outed as a spy, you'll never go on a mission ever again, likewise if you're caught on the wrong side of the policy cards in Secret Hitler, you've practically been eliminated. In Jumpship, because only the Queen needs to survive, an alien player can decide to make openly alien moves in a last ditch effort to win.\nThere are many layers to Jumpship and I'm excited for players to discover them for themselves. \nDesign\nTokens!!! Why tokens?\nacrylic laser cut prototypes\nParty games and highly social games are identified by their high potential player count and low level of complexity. What this translates to in practice is an important question from a design perceptive: \"How much can we ask from a player?\" \nIn designing Jumpship, I looked at the physicality of social games. Each round in Jumpship, a shared token bag is passed between players. This makes it very clear whose turn it currently is. As players draw tokens and give them to players, there is a high level of engagement as players vocalize why they gave a token to someone as they are defending themselves. \nGiving something to another person is such an incredibly simple action, and yet through the mechanics of the game, it can turn such a innocuous gesture into a devious one.\nPLAY\n\nSo these tokens have to be nice. I'm partnering with a manufacturer known for their casino quality parts. The plan is to create a custom token mold of a recessed hexagonal shape with casino quality stickers on both side. These tokens will have a satisfying feel and heft making each turn a joy to dig into the bag. \nHolistic product design is something I'm enamored with. I won't rest until a product meets my exact specifications. Because when a game is made, it's out there and lives in homes and on tables. In the past I've been known to drive my manufacturers crazy in an attempt to reach my vision. I hope this is evident in my past work and will show through in my future endeavors.\nAs with all my Kickstarters, you won't find crazy positive video reviews/previews or extensive marketing campaigns with stretch goals where I try to maximize funding by over promising. Hype is not healthy for the tabletop industry, and I implore you to decide for yourself if you'll enjoy the game by looking at the rules or trying the print and play. As an independent publisher, I believe in investing in a solid product, and not my ability to convince you to back it.   \nJumpship will always be available as a print & play, and this Kickstarter will be a way to get a deluxe version with premium poker chips and components. Please check out the game for yourself.\n\n1 x Box, 1 Rulebook\n70 x Tokens, 1 x Token Bag\n1 x Ship Console Board, 1 x Ship Repair Board\n10 x Role Cards, 11 x Bio ID Cards, 3 x Quarantine Cards\n\nTau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later. If we exceed funding I'd like to further enhance the quality of the game components and add some more characters or character variants. \nA smart goal would be some custom card sleeves, as hidden identity games can be ruined by marked components when said components are roughly handled- you know who I'm talking about, Charlie. \n$32,000 - Upgraded Cardstock\n$34,000 - 2 bonus characters\n$36,000 - ????\n\nShipping will be accomplished by 5 main fulfillment partners based out of the USA, UK, China, Australia, and Canada.

You'll reveal a unique and challenging landscape every single time the game is played which will require you to adjust your strategy as you go. Managing resources and battling the other explorers, it's a tense and explosive race to control the Shrines first!\nDon't see what you need? If you\u2019d like to purchase a copy of the KS Edition of the base game or the Thieves expansion only, head to playmonster.com where we have a few remaining copies from the second print run available while supplies last. These will ship immediately upon purchase.\nThe Island of El Dorado - Legend Edition includes every single upgrade that we could think of right from the start. We've pulled absolutely no punches and maxed out our components in every way possible, matching the quality of our previous campaigns from day one rather than using stretch goals to get back to where we\u2019ve already been. Still, we\u2019re always open to improvement and will consider every stretch goal idea you all post in the comments which doesn\u2019t shatter our timeline or budget. Honestly, this is the version of the game we'll be personally using and we want it to be flippin' awesome. Let\u2019s work together to make this thing absolutely insane.\n*Update*: We've heard some great ideas in the comment section already! Here is our list of backer-idea stretch goals! You can help improving the game by sharing this project with your family and friends! Click here to share on Facebook.\nThe Island of El Dorado is defined by the beautiful artwork which makes up its tiles, resources, and characters. Each gameplay element brings a new life and a new application to these 16th century masterpieces which were created by some of the most iconic and gifted painters in the history of visual art. Graciously opened to the public domain by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, we consider it an honor and a privilege to apply these works of indescribable beauty, mystery, and majesty to the narrative of The Island of El Dorado.\nThis is the ONLY time The Island of El Dorado Legend Edition will be available. While the base game, Thieves expansion, and a small box version of the Revenge expansion will be available in retail going forward, the only time you\u2019ll be able to secure a copy of the Legend Edition big box, game organizer trays, and the kickstarter exclusives from this and previous campaigns is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.\nWe want you on this journey with us. The feedback we received before, during, and after the first two campaigns from our families, friends, and backers is a huge part of what made the El Dorado universe what it is. We want to hear your ideas, see your islands, and know both the things you love and the areas you think we could improve. Now more than ever, we need your feedback to make the Legend Edition big box the coolest thing any of us have ever seen.\nEl Dorado Games started with three friends just trying to make a game we could play together at game night. With the success of the first and second Kickstarters and overwhelming positive reviews, our new goal is to bring all the fun and excitement we\u2019ve had to friend groups around the world. We\u2019re thankful for every single one of you and we\u2019re excited you\u2019re on this rollercoaster with us!\nWe initially created The Island of El Dorado to be a strategy game that we could play with our friends and family who don\u2019t like strategy games. It was designed to be a tool to bring new people into the hobby; to be the kind of game you could play against your grandma (and she could beat you!). As the game and the community surrounding El Dorado grew, however, we\u2019ve incorporated new rule sets and modes of play that allow you to tailor the gaming experience to the preferences of your group; everything from a casual dice-chucking story to an asymmetric brain-burning strategy showdown!\nCasual Mode - For casual gamers. Thoughtfully incorporated elements of luck keep things balanced to the very end and allow players who may fall behind from inexperienced decision making to catch up - and win!\nHardcore Mode - For strategy veterans. Every action takes thought and could have lasting consequences as elements of luck are significantly reduced or removed altogether. It\u2019s you against them.

With incredible support from the community, the project raised $196,560 with 2272 backers! \nAfter years of testing and feedback from the community, we're back to solve the biggest problem in timeboxing today: interruptions.\nWhen you get interrupted mid-sprint, you can now stop time. \na new superpower, just for you\n\"Got my Esington today and I am ecstatic! I can't believe how great you handled everything. I am really impressed and grateful for putting this great idea out to the public... I just can't wait to change my life and discipline myself a step at a time to accomplish what I've always wanted to do.\" - Vanessa C, backer of the original Esington glass. \n$100,000 free acoustic base has been unlocked!\nEsington 2.0\nDid you know the average worker gets interrupted after only 11 minutes of work? The crazy thing is it takes 25 minutes to get re-focused on the job. \ninterruptions suck\nWith Esington 2.0, the magnetic time-stopper will keep your place in the sprint and act like a bookmark for your brain, waiting to be unleashed to restart your work.\nControl Time\nWe invented a new way to control the time on your glass. Simply place the magnetic stopper over the neck of the glass and the timer stops!\na cool new magic trick - stop the flow of iron nanospheres with the silicone magnet\nThe magnetic stopper interrupts the flow of the solid iron nanospheres and keeps your place during your timeboxing sprint. \nAbout the Glass\nEach glass is hand-blown borosilicate glass\nFor Esington 2.0, we are using borosilicate glass (like pyrex). Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that contains boron trioxide which allows for a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. This means it will not crack under extreme temperature changes like regular glass. It's a standard 25 minute timer designed for the Esington timeboxing method (similar to the pomodoro method with a few cue differences). \n4 million solid Iron nanospheres - more than 1 kilogram in each glass\nFor the timing medium, we are using solid Iron nanospheres. These work perfectly with the magnetic stopper since they are highly attracted to the embedded magnet. \nThe most beautiful productivity timer ever made\nThe solid Iron nanospheres flow freely, even after thousands of magnetic stops. \nWhite Noise\nMillions of solid iron nanospheres produce a soothing white noise for the first 20 seconds to act as a cue to start your work habit (more on this below).  Here's what it sounds like on different surfaces:  \nPLAY\n\nIf we reach $100,000, we will also be including a ring that enhances the white noise effect:\nPLAY\n\nMagnetic Silicone Stopper\nThe silicone stopper is designed to have a unique feeling and a satisfying soft \"click\" into place to stop the timer. This will make it easy to engrain the \"bookmark for your brain\", and bring you back exactly to where you left off your work when you're ready to resume.\nAn elegant addition to any executive desk\nWhile the stopper is in place, your brain senses incompletion and will subtly pull you back to your work. You will get a satisfying reward when you pull out the stopper and unlock the timer.\nWe tested the prototypes thousands of stops and they work perfectly every time.\nThe Esington Method\nThe Esington Method is a timeboxing technique that is similar to the popular pomodoro method, but with a few important cue differences.\nTurn off all distractions\nTurn over the glass to activate the 3 cues\nWork on a single task until your time runs out\nSoft Stop\nThe Esington timer has a \u201csoft stop\u201d.  There are no annoying bells or beeps to signal the end of your cycle.  \nThe timer runs out gracefully.\nSometimes, your focus can take you well beyond 25 minutes, and that\u2019s ok (especially if working on lower-energy tasks like answering emails).  You don\u2019t want to lose a valuable train of thought.  Just be sure to rest proportionally to the energy spent working.\nWhy You Need the Esington Glass\nIf you\u2019re not using a timeboxing system, this is the perfect way to start. The Esington Glass is simple, beautiful and is built to last. \nIf you\u2019re currently using a timeboxing system, you need to upgrade your timer.  Esington is beautiful, elegant and unique.  What does your current timer say about you?\nEsington 2.0 is the perfect gift for someone you care about.\nThe Design Process\nWe made a 3d mockup of the magnetic stopper and then hand-cut a sample out of silicone. \nAfter a few iterations, it worked perfectly with the iron nanospheres!\nWe used solid iron nanospheres to work better with the magnetic stopper. We also found the the solid iron nanospheres worked much better at flowing smoothly because of the smoothness and uniformity of the nanospheres.\nSpecifications\nThe Large glass is our executive edition: 40% larger and 3x bigger. The Large glass has louder white noise. Both are 25 minute timers. Borosilicate glass with 4 million iron nanospheres.\n\nTo show off your glass in an elegant way, we are including a free cork base with each glass. \nA cool cork base with each glass!\nTimeline and Expectations\nJuly: Early bird orders ship\nAugust: Regular bird orders ship\nWe have the prototypes ready and have lined up a primary and secondary manufacturer. We have 4 years of experience making these glasses so we are confident we can deliver on time. \nThe solid iron nanospheres have been tested thousands of times and we're also confident we can secure high quality material. We also have 4 years experience quality testing these glasses, so we're confident in getting you a great product in a timely fashion. \nFeedback from our first campaign\n\"I'm going to add to the growing list of glowing reviews. You not only delivered early but also the packaging was outstanding protection. The glasses themselves are even more impressive than I imagined from the photos and I am more than happy with them. You have also been great with your updates and keeping your backers informed. This is how a Kickstarter should be run and I look forward to any future projects from you. Thank you.\u201d - A.

In that campaign, the first manufacturing run was quick and efficient and provided a wonderful experience to about 1/3 of our backers. Unfortunately, we had delays for the 2nd and 3rd manufacturing runs which caused delays of up to several months for some unlucky backers. Since then, our manufacturing runs have become much larger and more efficient. Our QA process is refined and our logistics network has been built out in the last 4 years. We have employees overseeing every step of the process, rather than just Rudy handling everything :)\n\nThe iron nanospheres have been tested thousands of times and we're also confident we can secure high quality material. We also have 4 years experience quality testing these glasses, so we're confident in getting you a great product in a timely fashion.\n\nThe biggest risk is in an unexpectedly large and successful campaign, which could cause some delays if the manufacturing requirement is more than 20,000 glasses.

Once fully charged, MEZONE can support an ultra long playtime of 8 hours and 80 hours in total added by the charging case. Its ergonomic design is guaranteed to never fall out and never cause soreness in ears. It features the most advanced Qualcomm chip with TWS+ technique, Bluetooth 5.0+EDR, IPX7 nano waterproof and touch controls. It is THE best, budget-friendly earbuds you don\u2019t want to miss!\n\n Media Featured \nMEZONE\u2019s uncompromised audio quality is a relish even for hardcore audiophiles. \nThe sound is optimized in both frequency and impulse response through digital sound processing (DSP) to create a perfect balance of treble and bass.\nMEZONE features the latest Bluetooth algorithm for a true lossless uncompressed audio quality and it incorporates a dynamic transducer made with graphene which delivers a high resolution audio. It is tested and tuned by our engineers to create crystal-clear acoustics and immersive music listening experience.\nThe cavity is uniquely designed to refine the sound frequencies and absorb the unwanted reflection and diffraction to provide 3-D surround sound. Its right contour and impeccable seal cancel out the external noise to protect your hearing.\n Mezone - What People Say\nPLAY\n\nThanks to MEZONE\u2019s ergonomic design, they stay in place even during the most vigorous movements, and they fit so snugly that you can even sleep in them.\nWe scanned and gathered data from the canal and exterior of the ears of thousands of people and used it to determine the perfect tilt and angle that lock the earbud in place for all types of ears. We made many iterations to streamline the earbuds\u2019 surface to perfectly match the contour of the ear for maximum comfort.\nMEZONE is rid of any stick, hook or wingtip, offering a more comfortable, stable fit and a better look for any occasion than most of the sports headphones. \nMEZONE\u2019s cutting-edge Qualcomm chip allows each MEZONE to pair to your device individually, so you can use either one separately and switch between the two without any delay or interruption. \n\nIn comparison to MEZONE's Qualcomm True Wireless Stereo Plus technology, other TWS earphones work in a master/slave mode in which one earphone is the master and the other is the slave. In case the master gets lost, damaged or out of power, the other one becomes a dud. This mode causes extra power consumption, connection dropouts and bad synchronization between the two earphones. MEZONE avoids you from all these pitfalls, allows you to enjoy the music just the way you want it!\nMEZONE\u2019s Qualcomm chip cuts power consumption and 2x the playtime of average TWS earbuds. The built-in battery in the charging case will provide extra 72 hours playtime which adds up to a total of 80 hours. MEZONE is designed to play your music all day without interruption and you will never run out of juice again!\n\nWith the portable charging case, you can charge your MEZONE on the go, anywhere, anytime. The headphones charge while they are in the case. To charge the case, simply place it on a wireless Qi mat, or plug a cable into its Type-C charging port. The case features 3 LED battery indicators for both the headphones and case, so you are never left guessing.\nAfter the initial setup, MEZONE auto-pairs to your device the second you open the charging case. There is no need to take the headphones out of the case. Just like that, open and pair.\nThe charging case is small and lightweight enough to be stored in your pocket. We use innovative overmolding while crafting the case, which improves the mechanical strength to provide optimal protection, so you can just toss them in your bag or pocket without worrying about it being scratched by keys. \nOur magnetic secure-fit design guarantees your headphones click into place for an instant, efficient charging and never fall out of place or get lost.\n\nWith a gentle tap on the smart button on the MEZONE, you can play/pause musics, change tracks forward, volume up/down, answer/end calls and call up the digital assistant. The button is quick to response yet not too sensitive to be triggered by accident. Unlike many headphones with physical buttons, you don\u2019t need to press the buttons which can end up pushing the headphones into your ear. \nThe upgraded version of the Bluetooth means various improvements in MEZONE, including longer playtime, better audio quality, greater range, stronger connection and stereo phone calls in both ears.\nWhat makes the MEZONE even better at waterproofing than other IPX7rating earphones is its reinforced waterproofing design. Not only is the MEZONE structured to be watertight and dustproof, its internal components are also covered in the nanocoating which makes water flow right through without coming into contact. This translates to a protection from accidental submersion in 1 meter (3.3 feet) of water for up to 30 minutes. You can simply rinse your MEZONE off after a particularly hard workout.\nWe have a 16-year history of innovation and a persistent pursuit for perfection in audio products coded into our company\u2019s culture and DNA. We have cooperated with world\u2019s leading brands including Philips, JBL, Beats and Huawei in designing and production of a wide range of high fidelity products, including microphones, headphones, telephone accessories for personal, professional, business and military applications. \n WE ARE IN CES2019\nPLAY\n\n\nA Big Thanks To: \n Featured on BackerPlanet - IDEAL PLANET FOR CROWDFUNDING ENTHUSIASTS.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 600+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\n\n As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are now improving the 2nd prototype.

So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you\u2019ve never played a card game quite like this before.\nSince we created Exploding Kittens four years ago, we've been making games that bring friends and family together around a table, away from their screens. We brought this game to Kickstarter because we believe that adding a bit of physicality to game night is what comes next.\nSo, if you're into the idea of party games and weaponized Mexican food, please help us make this game a reality.

We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo if a world full of weaponized Mexican food is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \nWith love and mad strafing skills,\n- The Exploding Kittens Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge for our team is building the throwables.

But throwables are a new challenge. We're working with the finest toy manufacturers in the world to make sure that we deliver the best materials that are fun to throw (not too light) and don't hurt when they hit you (not too heavy).\n\nIt's also very important to us that everyone gets their game on time. We don't want this to be a campaign where you spend the next two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want you to start throwing burritos at your friends as soon as possible.

Dive into a world where you're on your own. The temperature is falling rapidly and there's nothing to eat or drink. Darkness is on the horizon and soon it will be night. Let's hope you're lucky enough to start a fire. This is a remarkable game of survival, and only the bravest will prevail. Each player manages their own health against the elements. As time passes, the game itself will try to kill you off. Whether your lost in the woods or attacked by a bear, many things can happen as the days grow long and you struggle for rescue.  One simple truth remains, DO NOT DIE!\n\n\nOUR GAME\nThis is an effort to build something unique in the tabletop game market. Our game focuses on managing player vitals and resources while simply trying to stay alive and find rescue. Players can build shelters, loot cabins, hunt and fish for food, even cozy up to a nice campfire. But make no mistake, the goal here is survival. Players must stay alive and find their way out, even if that means player vs. player combat. \"Do Not Die\" is fast paced and exciting with deep complexity and many available strategies. It makes all players compete against each other but also has the game itself as the primary challenger. The mechanics involved push the players forward and if they lose sight of their primary objective, survival becomes impossible. It can also be played cooperatively, eventually joining player tiles. The game even has a vast and engaging solitary mode for single player action.\nThe Seers, Secrets of the Phantom Beast - An amazing supernatural thriller by K.G.Broas!\nOUR GOALS\n1. Our manufacturer is fantastic, providing premium quality and beautiful imagery located in Madison, Wisconsin. One challenge we face is that the production queues can be long, sometimes taking several weeks for delivery. The costs are also too high for full distribution and we know this needs to be addressed. We hope this campaign will allow us higher volume so we can secure prioritized status in their production queues. With this increase in sales we hope to possibly find formal distribution (brick and mortar) so we can bring our products to a larger market.\n2. We're in active negotiations with a manufacture that can delivery the same quality at a more competitive cost structure. The challenge we face is that the lead times almost double, the minimum order increases to 500 units, and shipping requires the use of distribution centers. We hope this campaign will provide us the revenue to overcome these challenges. With the capital to move forward, we plan to open a merchant account with Amazon and gain a foothold in the competitive board-game market.\n3. Most importantly, this is proving to be a wonderful lesson for my children in entrepreneurship. My ten year old daughter already has learned so much about production and the value of patience. To date we've brainstormed our concept, built a mock-up, tested through vigorous game play, brought our idea to production, developed our marketing strategy, and are now in the execution phase of our plan. Together we've created a name for our small team, The Four Ponies, and plan to launch several new games in 2020. We consider your support a true blessing and any help would be amazing.

In this set you\u2019ll find: Acadia, Arches, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Joshua Tree, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion.

It connects movement point allowance system with easy calculation of the outcome of a shot which together provide almost a computer game feeling to it.\nNo pesky infantry, just metal on metal, mano a mano! If you ever wondered what would happen if you just stormed a town Kelly\u2019s heroes\u2019 style, this is definitely a game for you!\nThis is a first game in the series of Panzer Strike games which is centered around a theme of tank battles on the Western Front. This is not a depiction of any particular battle, but a simulation of possible tactical conflicts between the Allied and German forces during the 1944-45 period, in an urban environment. During the war, tanks almost always acted together with other military branches and types of units - infantry, artillery, aviation, etc. In this game, alongside tanks, there is self-propelled artillery, while the infantry is present in the form of armored half-trackers and has specific tasks depending on the scenario: to take control of a city square, demine a building, release prisoners etc. However, the main role is reserved for tanks and tank destroyers, and players act as commanders of an armoured formation. Commanding a tank company of about 15 tanks, you are going head to head against your opponent through the narrow or wide streets of a town. But watch your back! Even a mighty Tiger is vulnerable from that side.\nDice are a part of this game but strategy and positioning can always mitigate unlucky rolls. Still, even the most heavily armoured tank on the battlefield can be incapacitated by a lucky shot, but you should never rely on it. The outcome of each encounter depends predominantly on the tactical decisions taken.\nThe game features two sides, so it is perfectly suited for two players. However, on each side there could be 2 or 3 players playing co-op against the other side (so in total the number of player goes up to 6). In that case, the tanks on each side are divided into several formations that will be controlled by different players from the same sides.\nThe rules are very simple, and at the same time very realistic so they perfectly emulate a real battle. The game features two different sets of rules: Simplified and Core.\nSimplified rules date from 12 years ago and they were the first set of rules implemented in the game (link to history). The movement of the piece consists of a series of individual steps (forward movements to the adjacent square or a rotation in place by 45\u00b0) which resembles the movement of tracked vehicles in real life. In the Simplified rules, the destruction upon the action of shooting depends on the Firepower of the shooting tank (determined by red dice rolls), Armour value of the target vehicle (different values for each side of every tank type) and the Distance between the tanks (determined by a special ruler): the tank is destroyed if the Firepower is greater than the sum of the Armour and Distance values. These rules are an excellent representatives of our MCMD principle (minimum complexity, maximum diversity). Because of this, the Pocket version of this game has already had some great reviews on BGG:\n\"The simplicity cannot be overstated - I read the rules and was playing in around 10 minutes! However, simple does not mean less tactical - I think with the right players this game could be as tactical as chess!\" -  Review by Graham 13 \n\"... the designers vision seemed to me to force you to move, the old shoot, move and communicate Boom-Boom concept.\" - Review by Robert Smith\nIn the Core Rules, the movement of the pieces is identical, but the difference is that in addition to Firepower, Armour, and Distance factors, there is a fourth one: Accuracy. Its introduction, along with some other elements, makes the game even more dynamic and realistic.\nApart from the two sets of rules, there are also optional rules that allow players to adapt the game to their own affinities, depending on the age, level of tactical and strategic knowledge, time at their disposal, etc.\nYou can read the rules in the Update #9 and #15:\nSimplified rules - Table 1\nIn order to make the game even more interesting, there will be a dozen of scenarios in a brochure. Some of them will have fixed initial positions and tasks, and some will be more flexible. There will be symmetrical scenarios (similar tasks for both players) and asymmetrical ones.\nRead more in Update #13\nClick for more information\nThe game is offered in three versions: Light, Standard, and Premium, as we want to offer diversity to the gamers with different budgets.\n- The Light version comes with 60 molded plastic pieces, and the other elements are adapted to the lower price (board of a thinner cardboard, no 3D buildings, and a simple transport box).\n- The Standard variant is made according to the higher production standards. Along with 92 molded pieces, it includes 3D cardboard buildings that the players assemble themselves, while the board is made of thicker cardboard. The box is big enough to store the once assembled buildings alongside all other elements.\n- The Premium version differs from the Standard version in the fact that it includes 60 realistic miniature tanks in 1/300 scale (3D printed in SLS technology) with rotating turrets instead of the molded pieces.\nEvery version includes an impressive board of the same size: 66x79 cm (26x31 in).\nSee more details about buildings in the Update #11\nMore information about assembling the buildings in Update #11\nA three-dimensional board implies that it contains objects which prevent movement or shooting through squares they\u2019re on. In general, refer to all these objects as obstacles. Buildings and monuments belong to High obstacles that cannot be demolished or removed during the games (the buildings can be replaced by completely or partially demolished buildings depending on the agreement between players or a particular scenario in play). It\u2019s not possible to fire through High obstacles. It is possible to shoot over them, however, but this can only be done by Howitzers (explained in detail in the Rulebook).\nMore information in Update #6\n- For our previous Kickstarter project (Tank Chess), we made a molding tool for high-quality tank pieces that includes all armored vehicle types from the WW2 period: Light, Medium,  and Heavy tanks, Tank destroyers, Self-propelled howitzers, Armoured cars, Half-tracks, etc.\nThe following vehicles will be in the Light and Standard versions:\n- On top of that, we already have prepared the realistic models for almost all types of miniatures involved. These minis are made on high-end 3D printers using SLS technology. All miniatures will be painted, and the players will be able to decorate them further if they want to give them a look even more similar to the real vehicles. The production of these minis will take place at the company Voxellab, which has been an excellent collaborator.\nMore information about pieces and miniatures in Update #5.\nWe\u2019ve also prepared a long list of add-ons that can enrich the experience in different ways. The add-ons will be available after the campaign through the Backer Kit pledge manager. These will be some of them:\n- Set of 3D buildings - $ 12\n- Set of 3D destroyed buildings - $ 8\n- Set of 2D destroyed buildings  - $ 2\n- Additional tank pieces pack (60 pcs) - $ 12\n- Additional miniatures pack (60 pcs) - $ 70\n- Print and Play files - $ 5\n- STL files of miniatures - $ 20\nMore information about add-ons in the Update #8.\nThis game is already very rich in content, but we\u2019ve prepared a set of stretch goals that will enhance it even more. We are open to any backers\u2019 suggestion and we\u2019ll consider every proposal that could lead to an even better gaming experience.\n #1 - $ 15 000: Barricades  \u2714\n(cardboard markers for Light version, plastic pieces for Standard and Premium)\n #2 - $ 25 000: Trees and Trams\n(cardboard markers for Light version, plastic pieces for Standard and Premium)\nMore information about stretch goals in the Update #7.\nEveryone who pledges for a physical copy ($28 or more) will be able to get one of the following gifts:\n- A First day gift - Everyone who pledges during the first day will get an additional 50 stylized tank pieces or 8 realistic miniatures (depending on the pledge level);\n- A Loyalty gift - All backers that helped us in our previous project will get a dice tower;\n- A Happy Place gift - In the previous project, we had backers from over 60 countries in which Kickstarter is very popular. This time we want to reach the gamers from places where Kikstarter is not so well known and to expand the community to regions where we haven\u2019t had many backers from. We have selected various countries, states or regions according to the geographical principle. The gift is the game Panzer Strike - France 44 Pocket. Backers from the following countries/regions will get this game:\nFrom our region - Macedonia; from Europe - Poland; from Asia - India; from Africa - all countries of North Africa; North America \u2013 the state of Texas; Central America \u2013 Mexico; South America \u2013 Paraguay; Australia/Oceania \u2013 The state of New South Wales.\n- A Media Contributor gift - As in the previous project, we will reward all those who contribute to a successful project (before and) during the campaign through activity on social networks, BGG, posting in various magazines, blogs, etc.\nBased on all kinds of experiences we\u2019ve had with shipping during our previous projects, we made a different strategy for this one. By using services of fulfillment companies, we\u2019ve provided EU friendly and US friendly shipping, and if we have at least 50 backers from Canada and Australia, we\u2019ll provide friendly shipping for these regions also.\nShipping costs are the following:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gained a lot of experience working on the realization of previous projects.

DARTER is beautifully machined from aluminium and brass in our East London workshop.\nOur pen and sewing kit really is this tiny. The internal sewing kit is just \u00bc\u201d in diameter (6.3mm)\nWe have 4 options to choose from: all silver, all gold, silver with gold trim, and gold with silver trim. The silver is made from aluminium and the gold is made from brass.\nEvery part is machined from a solid rod of aluminium and brass. There are no plastic parts.\nWhy did we put a sewing kit in a pen? Our answer is: because we can.  \nOur cutting-edge \"Swiss Turn\" machinery and team can cut parts smaller and with more precision than most CNC workshops.\nAt first, our intention was to make the world's smallest refillable pen. Early on, however, we noticed that our designs had wasted space between the refill and the outer sleeve.\nAt ornisi, we pride ourselves on finding ways of utilising even the tiniest space.\nWe spent a long time designing this striking button feature on the back of our pens. Each button is machined and drilled from a solid metal bar.\nOur passion is making small, useful tools. At the design stage, every line and every detail are considered as we try and maximise functionality. Our speciality is in adding useful features into everyday miniature objects. Only when the design is complemented do we add these features, but never at the expense of beautiful simple lines. After much research, we felt that the perfect addition to the empty space in our pen would be a small selection of thread and sewing needles.\nOur machine and team work at rapid speeds. This shows a small sample of 3 days of work dialling in the machine. Everything fits perfectly.\nAt first, we thought it impossible to machine a sewing kit so small that it would fit within this space. Any additional thickness to the pen would have been a deal breaker. Finally, following an intensive month of machining and testing (and the breaking of a few of our tiniest drills), the world's smallest sewing kit was born.\nEach sewing kit can hold 4 needles and 2 small lengths of thread\nEvery part of this pen has been meticulously designed. With its 4 dummy holes, the selector knob has been made to look like a button.\nThe Design Brief\n1. The DARTER pen had to be small - really small. So small, in fact, that it could be added to your keychain and go unnoticed. It needed to be no larger than a door key.\nIt was crucial that the DARTER was not uncomfortable in your pocket, and so we set the diameter of the pen to 7.5mm and its length to 58mm.\nOur Swiss turn CNC machine with 4m bar feeder. It can be loaded with multiple lengths of material and left to run for days on end. When we go home, it keeps working.\n2. The DARTER is made in-house in our East London workshop. If a feature in the design needed to be outsourced locally or overseas, we got rid of it. For us, it was essential that every part of this pen could be made using our own machinery and our own expertise.\nAll our pens have a brass sewing kit hiding inside.\nWe learnt a lot from 3Coil, our sister company, who launched a successful Kickstarter campaign. Working with factories that have 40 years of experience means we have a wealth of expertise and capabilities to tap into. This said, since these companies are such huge businesses, they have many departments and customers. Making a change or tweaking a design can take over a month for a simple revision.\nBut waiting around was no good for this project. At Ornisi, we are just as impatient as you. We don\u2019t want to wait around. We want changes to happen in a few hours, not a few days or weeks. If we do have to make a revision, we want a shiny part in our hands by the end of the day.\nTo achieve this rapid prototyping solution, a different strategy to normal was needed. From Day 1, our creatives worked closely with our engineer. This meant that at the end of the design stage, this daily collaboration gave birth to an awesome product that not only looked and worked great, it could also be made on our machine by our engineer the very next day.\nAll the colours of Darter.\nIncredibly, our time for prototyping has reduced from one month to less than one day. Our in-house manufacturing is up to 1000 parts per day. Our machines run 24/7. \nThe DARTER pen is the perfect addition to any survival or every day carry kit\n3. It was important that our pen was refillable with a quality refill. Many pens on the market are either sealed and not refillable, or else use cheap refills that dry out quickly. A non-refillable pen is very wasteful. We wanted a pen which could both write well, and which would last a lifetime.\nTherefore, because of their quality and size, we decided to use Cross matrix ballpoint refills. All our pens ship with black ink.\nThe DARTER pen and sewing kit is always with you, so you can repair while you are out and about\n4. The DARTER pen doesn\u2019t need to carry metres of thread \u2013 just enough for emergency wardrobe malfunctions. Our kit carries the right amount needed for \u2018on the go\u2019 repairs.\nEach pen contains a single bobbin, holding 1 meter of thread\nThis said, sometimes a job may require an extra-long piece of thread for a larger emergency repair. The DARTER can also be used in this situation.\nAll our needles are No.10 Gold Eye Sharps needles \u2013 though small, they are tough and get the job done.\nWhy do we manufacture in-house?  \nWe produce beautiful turned parts in rapid time. Our expert team, from designers to our engineer and machinist, produce amazing results. Believe us when we say we can turn an idea or a sketch into a production part within 48 hours.\nIt can be frustrating for both our team and our backers to have to wait weeks, even months, for things to happen in our manufacturing partners\u2019 factories. But by making this ourselves, the momentum never diminishes. Plus, we can share this amazing journey with you \u2013 you can even see your pen being made through a webcam inside our machine. Should we need to make any changes or overcome any obstacles you can watch us fix the problem in real time.\nSpecification\nMaximum size needles 27mm x 0.75mm diameter\nLength of thread on a bobbin - 100cm (39\")\nMax length of thread on Darter Sew 2x 59cm (23\") - 118cm total\nNumber of needles in Darter Sew - 4\nCompatible Ink Refill - Cross Matrix Ballpoint Only \nInk Colour - Only Black supplied\nSilver Material - 2011 Aluminium \nGold Material - CZ121 Brass\nColours available in the Cross Matrix range - Blue, Black, Red\nWe need your support\nOur sliding head CNC machines require extremely precise material to be fed into them. This is not the usual \u2018off the shelf\u2019 lengths of aluminium or brass, but precision prepared material which is ground down to the exact same diameter along its 3-metre length. Since our machines run unattended, the slightest deviation in the diameter could jam the machine. In our test run of 100 parts, a lot of time was spent cleaning each piece from the cutting oil. The funding we raise will help us buy toleranced diameter material and an ultrasonic cleaning machine, which will speed up the assembly and shipping stage. In return for supporting us, not only will you receive the first DARTER pen in the world at half the retail price, we will also share with you every step of your pen\u2019s journey, from precision metal to precision product. We hope you are as excited as us about this journey.\nDARTER SEW includes 1x Brass cylinder, 1x Aluminium screw top, 4x No.10 needles\nEach DARTER PEN includes 1x Bobbin 1x Refill 1x Button 1x DARTER SEW with 4x No.10 needles\nIf you choose to buy 2 or more pens, all you need to do is select the main colour of the pen - either silver or gold.  At the end of the campaign we will email you a survey and you can customise each pen by selecting the button colour and band colour.  \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 600+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "1x DARTER SEW", "descp": "Grab yourself the world\u2019s most stylish and smallest sewing kit made from Brass and Aluminium.\nHalf Price - Retail \u00a316\nINCLUDES:\nDARTER SEW (Brass)\n4\u00d7 No.10 Gold Eye Needles", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["500 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "2x DARTER SEW", "descp": "Double up with two of the world\u2019s most stylish and smallest sewing kits made from Brass and Aluminium.\nLess than Half Price - Retail \u00a332!\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 DARTER SEW (Brass)\n8\u00d7 No.10 Gold Eye Needles", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["420 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "3x DARTER SEW", "descp": "Make it a treble with three of the world\u2019s most stylish and smallest sewing kits made from Brass and Aluminium.\nLess than Half Price - Retail \u00a348!\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 DARTER SEW (Brass)\n12\u00d7 No.10 Gold Eye Needles", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["200 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "DARTER PEN Silver/Silver with DARTER SEW", "descp": "Be one of the first to back our stylish Darter Pen with Darter Sew.

It scratches the competitive itch, rewards skill over strength, and above all brings people together. Sinking the last cup, house rules, bragging rights... it has all the makings of a pastime for the ages. I believe that the game should take its place in the pantheon of well-regarded parlor games, such as pool and darts.  In fact, there are ways in which the game improves on these two games in a party setting: it takes up less space than a pool table and it avoids the dangers of a sharp dart. \nBut, sadly, there are some important issues holding the game back from its potential. First, it's messy. No one wants to spill all over their patio, much less their kitchen or bar floor. Second, and because of the above point, the game has been relegated mostly to dark basements and windy back yards. A related challenge is that the typical beer pong table, while charming in the college context, doesn't fit with the lifestyle of a more mature 35-45 year old homeowner or hip entertainment establishment. \nVictory Tables sees a clear path to making Beirut a mainstream parlor game where it belongs. The first step is simply to play with water in the cups. This accomplishes a great deal: the odd spilled cup becomes a much less costly error; anyone can play, including non-drinkers, designated drivers, kids, and people who prefer a different beverage; and you can enjoy a nicer beer on the side if you so choose, foregrounding quality of beer over quantity. \nSecond, the world needs a table that reflects the aspirant stature of Beirut. Enter Victory Tables. \nWe design and build furniture-quality Beirut Tables. Why a Victory Table? I would submit to you three primary reasons:\n1. They're beautiful. Crafted from select hardwoods (cherry depicted, maple and walnut are also available), professionally lacquered, with robust clean lines, and refined touches throughout. \n2. Game enhancing features. The tables sport integrated ball storage near the point of play, classic triangle patterning to assist racking, adjustable feet for leveling purposes, a perimeter ridge to contain liquid, included microfiber towels to maintain a pleasant playing surface, and of course a rigourus compliance with official beer pong table dimensions. \n3. Smart engineering. The tables fold in half for convenient storage, have classic leather handles and shoulder strap for transport, and weigh a manageable 50 pounds while retaining impressive strength. \nVictory Tables. Love your table like you love the game. \nUSE OF FUNDS:\nWith an product order of this size I will be able to get up and running with a local production partner so I can bring mainstream beer pong to a wider audience. The campaign also serves as a proof of concept to investors that there is a market for a high-end beer pong table. This will enable me to attract additional investors for the purpose of expansion.

Insane durability - will outlast your guitar and even you! Super strong, solid grip. You won't find ANY other titanium pick at this price and with this level of craftsmanship.  \nIt looks so cool and makes playing so fun: It encourages you to practice guitar everyday for the new year! \n Polar pick is a powerful motivating force to learn guitar for your New Year resolution! \nMade of a single piece of 0.3mm thick solid Titanium, it gives you a bright, focused and defined sound. The unique properties of CP4 Grade 1 pure Titanium allow for a thin and light design with a medium-rigid feel.\nFree carrying case + Titanium ring for orders of 6 or more. $5 add-on for smaller orders\nAn elegant case made with quality lifetime leather comes + Titanium ring with each pledge 6+ guitar picks for FREE. (can hold 10 Polar Picks) \nThoughtful Design  \nWe thought about different shape designs, but finally we chose the minimalist traditional shape. It gives an appropriate gripping surface for your fingers.     \nA pointed tip produces a brighter, clearer, more focused and defined sound! You can also play with the 'top' corners, they will give you a rounder sound.\nOnly 0.3mm thick! Ultra-thin but super strong. Semi-stiff for all-around playability.  \nThe ultra-thinness and brushed finish give you a solid killer grip.   \nTwo colors are available! \nOur Polar blue finish is treated with heat first for the shiny blue patina, and then we gave it an annealing treatment in order to achieve the best hardness and flexibility for playing.\nWhy 0.3 mm thick?\nIn order to figure out the best thickness for playing guitar, we tested Titanium picks in different thicknesses of 0.2mm, 0.3mm, 0.4mm, 0.5mm, 0.6mm, 0.7mm and 0.8mm. \nAfter may hours of testing, we chose the 0.3mm thick guitar pick.\n0.3mm thick pick is exactly for playing, and could be used for both electric and acoustic guitar, both rhythm and lead playing\nPicks over 0.3 mm thickness are too hard and not flexible to play fast. \nThinner than 0.3mm picks were too thin and began to lose durability after many hours.\nThe hardness is equal to 0.7mm plastic picks, but incredible thinner and gives you a solid feeling.  \nThe curve makes them glide across the strings with a clean touch.\nWhy do I need a Titanium guitar pick? \nRegular picks made from nylon, polyethylene, celluloid or plastic are generally weak and wear down quickly.  \nTitanium, used extensively in the aerospace industry and medical implants, has the highest strength-to-density ratio of any element and will never tarnish or wear out! Polar Pick is indestructible!   \nTitanium delivers the strength, durability and a bright tone that you are looking for. It\u2019s a perfect choice for a guitar pick.  \nLive Testing \nWhen you want to try a high speed precision picking, THIS should be the pick you reach for. It transfers sound vibration much faster than wood or plastic picks. \nSweep picking, slide, hammer-on, pull-off, tapping, bending, or slap. \nPolar Pick delivers a unique, rich and bright sound.   \nIt's solid, and nothing but solid Titanium between your fingers.\nWhat my friends said about Polar Pick \nWe also make a Solid Titanium Polar Pick Necklace version (The small ring is made of solid pure Titanium too). Be ready to play anytime and anywhere. Also, it\u2019s a good way to encourage you to play everyday!\nThis will make a great gift for guitar players or those who learning to play for the next year. \nPledge now and get your Solid Titanium Polar Pick!\nWho is Polar Metals?\nAt Polar, we seek to spice up your life with interesting and unusual metals in unexpected ways. We've specialized inTitanium, Copper and Zirconium so far! And we are also working on bringing lesser known metals into the light like Tungsten and Tungsten Copper.

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art, it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends.\n Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems.\nImmersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences.

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay. We are responsible for the following big titles: This War of Mine: The Board Game, The Edge: Dawnfall, Lords of Hellas, Nemesis.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded seven Kickstarter projects.

The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed.

At the time, it set the record for boardgame support. When it was delivered, it was the biggest commercially produced game box ever. It still is.\nOne of our promises in that campaign was to release a supplement with more maps. This is it. Battlefields is full of Ogre goodies, including an updated rulebook, new counters, and maps. And what maps they are!\nIn its initial form, this set will include one 28.5\" x 33\" gameboard with a map on each side: G-3 and S-3. These maps have never before been available in this scale, and likely never will be again. They are suitable for play both with the counters provided and with the Ogre miniatures.\nA key stretch goal (NOW REACHED!) is to replace the double-sided gameboard with two two-sided boards, so they can be placed side by side for an even huger combat zone.\nNOTE: The new gameboards are the same size as the G.E.V. maps found in the Ogre Designer's Edition game. Each map is two separate boards, which offers even more flexibility when geomorphing these new maps with the earlier release. \nSwimming Ogres! 3-D radar stations! Light Artillery Drones and Heavy Weapon Teams! And the long-awaited Revetments!\nThere are some old favorites as well. If you didn't get a Ninja when the ODE first launched, here are two. Plus a Vulcan and a Fencer-B. And more Marines!\nThe most up-to-date version of the rules, consolidated and still in 32 pages, including the Combat Engineering rules.\nWhat's a gorgeous map without scenarios? Battlefields includes four pages of scenarios created for the new maps and showcasing the new units.\nThis is not a stand-alone set. We made it for our dedicated Ogre players, and it requires a large-scale copy of Ogre to play . . . either Ogre Designer's Edition or Ogre Sixth Edition. If you don't have a big Ogre, of course, you can get Ogre Sixth Edition as part of this campaign.\nIf you have the Ogre Designer's Edition, this set adds two green maps to the four you already have, and provides a slightly updated rulebook.\nIf you have Ogre Sixth Edition, this set introduces you to the wonder and terror of different terrain types with two huge GEV-style maps. Welcome to the joys of maneuvering Heavy Tanks through swamp, or using a treeline to block enemy GEVs. Terrain is good!\nBATTLEFIELDS is a pretty darn good package as it is, but if you support us with enough copies, we can beef it up further. The first stretch goals are PDFs, which cost us nothing but time. The later stretch goals make the game costlier to print, but if we're selling enough, it comes out fine.\n$35,000 - MAP PDFS. We will release both maps, G-3 and S-3, as high-resolution PDFs. (Update: G-2 and S-2 will also be released, because why not? - and they have all been placed with G-1 and S-1 here: http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/resources/)\n$37,500 - NEW SKINS. We will release a set of three \"re-skin\" PDFs for the Nightfall counter set. Starting with the Nightfall set, available from Warehouse 23 and as an add-on during this campaign, you can transform its counters and Ogres to \u201cfill out\u201d the forces of some of the other factions in the Ogreverse. The Vatican Guard, Nihon Empire, and others, as developed in the Sponsored Counter Sheets, now can have the same units available as the Paneuropean Federation and North American Combine. Truly epic multi-faction battles are but a skin away! \n$40,000 - OVERLAYS IN THE BOX. Every set will get an 11\" x 11\" sheet of die-cut map overlays, including town, destroyed town, lots of water, and BEACHES!\n$42,500 - CARDS IN THE BOX. Every set will get a set of six two-sided, erasable Ogre record cards - one for every Ogre in the set. One side has the boardgame stats, and the other has the minis stats. (LATER BONUS ADDED - One more card, a III-B for Iron Mountain.)\n$46,500 - DOUBLE OVERLAYS IN THE BOX. We'll duplicate the sheet of overlays for every set. Twice the map-hacking awesomeness!\n$50,000 - MORE NEW SKINS. We will release three more \"re-skin\" PDFs for the Nightfall counters. \n$55,000 - DOUBLE MAPS IN THE BOX. The big one. Instead of one two-sided gameboard, every set will include two one-sided boards that geomorph together. This doubles the size of your new play area, and the maps can be combined in four different ways!\n$60,000 - QUAD MAPS IN THE BOX. The bigger one. Instead of two one-sided gameboards, every set will include two TWO-sided boards. Flip over S-3 and get S-1, currently only found in the Designer's Edition. Likewise, flip over G-3 and get G-1. That makes 16 different possible combinations. \"Battlefields,\" indeed!\n$70,000 - SKINS AS COUNTERS. We will select two of the unlocked PDF counter sheet skins and produce them as die-cut, ready-to-play counter sheets packed inside the Ogre Battlefields box.\n$80,000 - MORE COUNTERS! Another two sheets of the unlocked stretch goal counter skins will be produced as printed counter sheets and packed inside the Ogre Battlefields box.\n$90,000 - WE HEAR YOU LIKE COUNTERS! The last two sheets of the unlocked stretch goal PDF counter skins created as sheets and included in the Ogre Battlefields box. Including the Pink Ogre of Doom!\n$100K - BACK TO BASICS IN A BIG WAY! The single original counter sheet (remember the original sheet?), with revetments, entrenchments, LADs, and specialist infantry, will be triplicated. Turning this 1 sheet into 3 adds more than 100 counters to the mix, and brings the total number of sheets in the box to 12 (we started with two). As a bonus to the bonus, these sheets will now include 3 LHWZ and 15 Armored Trucks for the Iron Mountain (mat M2) scenario.\nAdd-ons are only available as additions to a reward level. The \"no reward\" option is not eligible to select add-ons.\nPlease note that the first nine add-ons below are limited in quantity, though we have at least 100 of each. In BackerKit, we will set inventory limits on the scarce add-ons and they will be available on a \"fastest gets the mostest\" basis. Please complete your survey immediately when you receive it.\nThe current edition of Ogre. Features 3-D constructible models for the Ogres and Command Posts, with oversized, full-color counters for regular units; a large version of the classic wastelands map; complete rules; and two dice.\nThe first expansion for the new Ogre. Five 3-D units (3 Ogres and two CPs), a complete set of basic armor and infantry, and five new types of armor units for both sides. Also includes town overlays for the map, adding more challenges to movement and defense.\nThe Battle Box includes a giant poster map, 85 gray plastic miniatures for both sides (including five Ogres), five Ogre record cards, a reference sheet, an assembly sheet, a counter sheet, a six-sided die, and the complete Ogre rules.\nHigh-quality unpainted plastic miniatures that fit the large-hex maps in Ogre Sixth Edition and Battlefields. Two red Ogres, 26 blue armor units with 14 bases of infantry and a command post. Also includes two erasable Ogre record cards and the Ogre Miniatures Lite rules.\nThe Nightfall counter set features two full sheets of Ogres, Admin Buildings, Laser Towers, a Train, and Turrets, many in ominous black. This set also includes a sheet with GEVs, map hexes, and other game-play enhancers. \nA brand new release . . . Replace your standard six-sided dice with these bullet-shaped 6-siders, and bring the heat! Molded in two colors, \"brass\" for the cartridge and \"lead\" for the bullet, with white pips. Also available as a set of ten packs: 60 dice!\nEight 19mm Ogre dice, two each of four different colors! Because you can never have enough dice in your collection!\nThis eight-page gatefold includes the Ogre scenario, \"Bad Timing,\" as well as rules and cut-them-out-yourself map and counters. The perfect introduction to Ogre; hand them out to your friends!\nThe following are unlimited add-ons; there are no inventory restrictions. \nAnother copy of the Ogre Battlefields expansion.\nA 24\" x 24\" fabric playmat with rubber backing, featuring new Ogre terrain. Links with mats M3 and M4 for a bigger play area.\nThis special 24\" x 24\" playmat includes whole new kinds of terrain \u2013 impassable mountains and a winding road - and the Iron Mountain scenario.\nA 24\" x 24\" fabric playmat with rubber backing, featuring new Ogre terrain. Links with mat M1 for a bigger play area.\nA brand new 24\" x 24\" playmat, a \"Harbor\" map that connects to M1 and/or M3, that will be revealed before this campaign comes to a close. \nA new 24-inch square Ogre playmat that connects to M1 and/or M3. Take the war to an all-new battlefield with the latest in this popular series of Ogre accessories.\n128 pages of the best Ogre articles from Space Gamer and Pyramid (and some completely new stuff!). Fiction, variant rules, new units and  scenarios, cartoons, and predictions about real future warfare . . .  plus introductory material and an Ogre vignette by Steve Jackson. \nFor more than 30 years, the mighty Ogre cybertanks have terrorized boardgamers and miniature players around the world. Now the Ogres are coming to roleplaying. Take the part of a GEV pilot, driving his craft at fighter-plane speeds a foot off the ground . . . a ragged partisan, armed only with  determination and a nuclear bazooka . . . or a brand-new artificial intelligence, awakening to a world in which it is the most dangerous  creature of all . . . the Ogre.\nAfter the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager.

Lay Waste Games was the obvious home for this first installment because...well...IT'S METAL! \nLet's get this first question out of the way. Yes. Everything is solid metal. Even the box. For serious! And that is why we need Kickstarter to make this happen. With METAL, we want to showcase different metals, and create something that lasts forever, similar to the build quality of classic car frames and toaster oven bodies.\nThis is also just the start of something truly innovative by Jordan Draper: the Material Series!\nThe planned lineup is Wood, Paper, Rubber, and Fabric. Each title in this new line of games sets out to explore and showcase how a single material can be utilized in the context of tabletop games, with the highest manufacturing quality and techniques. \nEvery material will be a different partnership with a specialist company that leads in knowledge and experience. With your help, we aim to break the mold of what's possible! \nMETAL comes with 38 solid metal pieces made from 3 different types of metal: Steel, Aluminum, and Zinc alloys. And yes, they are all housed inside of a solid metal, two-piece telescoping box.\n1 stamped, two-piece telescoping box (Steel / Raw)\n1 small ball (Zinc alloy / Burnished)\n1 Lay Waste Human Skull kingpin (Zinc alloy / Electroplated Black)\n6 throwing batons (Aluminum / Raw)\n8 large balls (Zinc alloy / Burnished)\n10 rectangular pegs (Aluminum / Raw)\n12 numbered round pins (Zinc alloy / Electroplated Golden)\nOne of the parts of METAL that we are most excited about is the steel box. Jordan wanted the box to be a traditional board game box, with 1.5mm wall thickness, rather than simply using a tin box that might be found with breath mints. It took months of research but we nailed it. To make the steel box, massive metal presses will take sheets of steel and stamp them under intense pressure, forming the shape needed. The game\u2019s title, our logos, and our websites will all be imprinted onto the box during this process, for something truly unique in your collection.\nOur process is very similar to the GIF above, but involves more magic and love. The piece that might be made with the most love is the kingpin. This is what you will use for striking in various games, and Jordan decided to make this piece extra sweet. Atop traditional kingpins are often crowns, but in METAL, you get our signature Human Skull from Dragoon!\nIn order to cast these pieces as accurately as possible, we typically use spin casting in rubber molds. Some have told us there is a better way that is more natural. That is, of course, casting in real watermelons. We gave it a try, but it didn't work out as planned.\nMoving forward, we will be casting the pieces professionally, not with watermelons. And since the watermelon above is on a lawn, here is Jordan to discuss how lawn games influenced METAL. Perfect segue!\nI love a summer picnic, when you forget about everything and just play ridiculous lawn games. I also miss the feeling of being a kid, seeing a bunch of stuff lying around, and making a game out of it. Metal is an homage to these times, tapping into those experiences, but this time while you\u2019re out to eat with friends at a restaurant, or stuck in a queue for 3h to see a Panda. \nThe three classic lawn games give the awesome nostalgia of outdoor gatherings, and my new games take those same pieces as inspiration for quick, crazy games I used to make up as a kid. Bangers in particular was one of my favorite games to play on a pool table with friends, where we would all try to hit the white ball with the other ones in real time. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy your childhood again in style with METAL. (Please try listening to metal too, it\u2019s great!)\n- Jordan Draper\nReading Is FUN-damental! We all know this to be true and gave you more fun fuel below. When released, the rules will be available on our websites, which are stamped onto the back of the box. For now, all games are outlined below.\nHowever, we know some of you are busy business people who can't spend time reading because markets are fluctuating and DOWs are on the...rise or something? For those people, here is a video!\nNow that you have watched the video, you can get back to...playing the market with stock tickers...or something. For the rest of you, read onward!\nRandomly spread out and stand up the 1-12 pegs on the table. Give each player a unique large ball, and start their ball in front of them. Taking turns passing the kingpin around in clockwise order, players will take one hit with the kingpin to try to knock over the lowest numbered peg, and keep it for points. One hit per turn. As soon as all 12 pegs are collected the game is over. The winner is determined by the sum of the point values of all pegs each player has collected. If a player hits over the wrong peg, they must return a peg they have collected to the center of the table. It is allowed to combo hits together like in pool, but you must hit the lowest number first and then only the next highest number. So for example, you could hit the 1 peg into the 2 peg, and collect both in the same turn, but if you hit the 3 peg into the 5 peg, you would fail and need to put back a collected peg as well as stand up the 3 and 5.\nEvenly distribute the large balls among players, then put the small ball in the center of the table. In real time, all players now roll their large balls to try to hit the small one, receiving 1 point each time they hit the small ball. If they hit the small ball and it then falls off the table, that player will have their score reset to 0. All of the large balls can be taken as they roll to you.  The first player to get 3 points wins the game immediately. \nForm two teams, across from each other at least 1m apart, and place all of the golden pegs numbered 1-12 in the center. Each team will now draft pegs until the sum of their numbers add up to exactly to 20. Teams will take one peg at a time, starting with the youngest player at the table and alternating back and fourth between teams. If it is not possible to reach exactly 20, your team will put a peg back and take a new one in its place on your turn. (example draft picks could be (team 1: 11, 9) (team 2: 3, 4, 5, 8). \nStand up your pegs on the other teams side, spaced evenly and far apart, with the numbers facing toward you. Each turn, your team can take any combination of balls and throwing batons equal to the difference between your lowest number peg (numbers facing you), and the other teams highest number peg (on your side facing them). In this example, team 1 would receive 1 item, team 2 would receive 8 items. Starting with the team with the least items, they will roll balls and throw batons at their pegs, which must be knocked over in order from lowest to highest. If any number that isn\u2019t the lowest is hit, stand it up again. The other team will then do the same, alternating back and forth until one team knocks over all their pegs! If both teams have pegs left, take items as described above given the pegs left, and repeat.\nMost of you are probably familiar with at least one of these timeless classics. For those who are new to them, we debated rewriting the rules for each. However, in this glorious world of the internet, we believe the best way to learn about them is to simply link you to basic explanations on Wikipedia (Bocce / Kubb / Croquet) and encourage you to find some sweet content on YouTube (Bocce / Kubb / Croquet).\nThere are historically tons of ways to play each game and we greatly encourage players to make their own variants.

You are welcome to keep refreshing the page to see if we add another though.\nNOTE TO DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS: There are currently no plans to bring METAL into distribution or mass retail. The game is very expensive to make, which prohibits us from selling the game outside of Kickstarter and our own outlets post Kickstarter. \nMETAL comes standard with all the components listed at the top of the page. But now it will be even sweeter thanks to these stretch goals!\nAs you have likely already guessed, METAL is expensive to make. We debated having a higher price tag with more stretch goal components, but decided to keep the price low and include what we felt were the best stretch goals. Our hope is that this allows more people to enjoy Jordan's amazing designs and the lawn games we grew up loving!\nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | WEBSITE\nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | WEBSITE\nIf you would like to contact Lay Waste Games directly, feel free to email hello at laywastegames dot com with any questions, comments, concerns, or just to say hi!\nJordan Draper has an email too! It is talk at jordandraper dot com. He loves hearing about new ice cream flavors and what friends have bananas that he can steal.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less. By doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs for one copy of the game, and they are pretty simple.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates, and the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. So if you buy 1,500 games (which will weigh about 1 ton), not only are you a crazy person who loves metal, but you will pay a higher shipping price.\nIf you live in Australia, Canada, the EU, or the United States, you will not pay any fees beyond shipping. If you live outside these locations and want more information, please contact us.\nLay Waste Games was founded by Jake Given, Zach Given, Nick Nazzaro, and Jonathan Ritter-Roderick. We formed in 2014 with the sole goal of making Dragoon a reality. In 2015, that came true thanks to 1,295 amazing Kickstarter backers. In 2017, both the expansion to Dragoon and Human Era were made real thanks to over 5,000 backers.\nWe will always make sure our games have the highest production value, incredible artwork, and solid gameplay. Without backers, Lay Waste Games would not exist, and our dedication to them will last forever.\nJordan Draper is a designer, artist, and entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, UT.

As you press the activate button, the other you says, \u201cDon\u2019t screw it up like I did.\u201d\nOver the course of the game, you will revisit 3 time periods of your life. Starting all the way back in '81. You were young, impressionable, and had dreams of striking it rich. Odd jobs were too slow, so you tried another route...\nThen in 1994, you fell in love, and everything changed. The way you talked. The way you thought about talking. The way you ate your food. The way you thought about eating your food. It was as if someone had turned on a light that you never even knew existed, and everything had a purpose for a short while.\nAnd finally, it's 2005. You've hit rock bottom and found a way out. You knew a guy, that knew a guy with an inside tip to make you a lot of money. Money has been the root of all of your problems. After the big event you were going to leave the country and start fresh. But of course, it didn't go as planned.\nIn The Perfect Moment, players are racing to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Each player will have two double-sided equipment cards in play at a time. You can use the ability of any piece of equipment facing you, so that card your opponent just equipped might be the key to your next turn! Additionally, you'll have one card in your hand, called a revision, that you may score at the end of your turn. Finally, there is a paradox card in play that both you and your opponent may use for its ability, or score.\nTo score a card, you must have the required equipment in front of you. The more accurately you match the card, the more you score.\n If you simply match a single piece of equipment, you score the card for one point, and it remains face-up. Both you and your opponent can try to score it for more later!\n If you match both pieces of equipment, but they are facing opposite directions, you score two points.\n If you match both pieces of equipment, and they are facing the same direction, you score three points.\nIn order to rearrange your equipment to score, on your turn you may activate two pieces of equipment to draw, rotate, and swap cards. Here's a sample turn; let's see if there's a way to score all three points this round:\nThe game ends when one player reaches 16 points, or the deck runs out.\nWant to try it yourself?

You'll swap these with any set (Bank Robbery, Relationship, or Big Event) for a very different experience!\nABOUT THE TEAM\nIf you haven't heard of Button Shy, we are a family-run small press game company that specializes in pocket-sized wallet games.\nAll games are hand-assembled and primarily sold directly to our customers, allowing us to form a relationship and line of contact with those that are responsible for our success.\nOur reach is growing, but to expand to the masses we've formed relationships with companies such as AEG, IDW Games & Loot Crate and we're forming international partnerships as well.\nThe Perfect Moment is the 44th game in the long lasting Button Shy Wallet Game Series. The game is just 18 cards and comes packed in a vinyl wallet for maximum portability. Designed by Michael Brown, with art by Jonathan Fisher, it was a winner in our 2017 18 card design contest, and is Michael's first published game.\nBOARD GAME OF THE MONTH CLUB\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE.\nOur 2018 $5 packages include an episode of Timestamp, a time-travel game that takes place on a single postcard. Each episode is fully playable on its own, and supporters receive PNP links to previous episodes. It also includes a character in our expanding series Banned Books. All supporters receive the Banned Books base game in their first package. It's a solo game of literary characters trying to get their books un-banned. And finally it includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Legends of Dsyx Roll and Write Game. Legends of Dsyx is an ongoing roll & write series where each game is set in the same kingdom, but the games play very differently.\nOur $10 packages include all of those and something extra. Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. \nAnd our $20 September package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).\nYou can subscribe at https://www.patreon.com/buttonshy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nReleasing games each month has established a groove with the manufacturer. We rarely see delays on their end, but we can see delays before it goes to the manufacturer. We are spending time making sure the rules are 100% right and some of you will be invited to join in on that process.\n\nWith a lot to juggle and it being two people, we will occasionally see delays. A few previous projects were behind schedule so we've adjusted our schedule accordingly (instead of 2 months, we've extended our estimated delivery to 4 months to be extra sure we'll hit the date).

Vote on Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery here.\nMint Tin Mini Skulduggery (not final coin or pressed tin)\nWe were having so much fun playing this little game as we developed it that we decided to meet with friends for lunch to see how they liked the game. The skulls are an intriguing component of the game and having Skulduggery hanging over you makes the tension perfect. \nHoping for a good reaction from our friends, we ended up with a terrific one! We had so much fun as we played that we attracted strangers to our table. Our explanation of the game ended up with them joining us to play. We made new friends thanks to the game, which is not only fun but has the effect of making everyone feel happy. \nOne of the places (a brewery) was interested in purchasing the game to have for their customers, what a great testimonial! We hope to pass on the fun and happiness to you, enjoy! \nAll our Mint Tin Games are tough, even tough enough for roller derby refs!\nInvoke spirits of the ethereal realm to help you roll your way to victory, shatter the rolls of opponents, and push your luck without unleashing skulduggery!\nIt's a centuries-old dice game with modern twists making it contemporary for today's tabletop gaming community\u2014the oldest name we've found for it is L\u00e4j\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4 (Finnish for slam).\nThis modern-day interpretation has a deterministic element\u2014the mystical crystal skull\u2014to offset the luck-driven nature of this age-old game. Unleash the crystal skull to foil an opponent, stave off Skulduggery, or gain victory at the last moment. \nWe've added tiny stone skulls for scoring and a winged death head coin as a pretty unique game mechanic\u2014and a pretty rotten one too\u2014it's pleasantly wicked and nearly nefarious.\nIt's a nice way to unwind, connect with each other, and take a break from the hectic that life can be. It's a light and addictive dice game for easy stress-busting fun (unlike its frenetic cousin Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse). \nIt's so small and so easy to carry, we love playing when we're out for a bite to eat. We hope you like it too. \nHalf the size of an Altoids tin\nPlays in small space\u2014easy setup\u2014take out three dice & a crystal skull for each player\nLike our other games, Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery is maker-to-player and this game's made in the USA (on a dining room table in New Hampshire). And since we don't do offshore manufacturing, we search for existing and innovative components, such as this game's stone skulls.\nLet's take a look at how this game plays to see if fits your gaming needs\u2014because you should only back games that do.\nHere's a snapshot of the game's key elements with short descriptions below each pic:\nSummon the spirits to help you roll winning dice to collect points. A single spirit's one point, two are five, and three are ten (and very rare). In these pics, three is the spirit number.\nShatter a spirit die with your crystal skull and end your foe's turn and force them to roll with fewer dice. In the above, five points became one and since a spirit die is still showing, they continue to roll, but only with two dice. You can even form alliances if you think that's a good idea . . .\nSpecial rolls\u2014low-straights (1-2-3) and high-straights (4-5-6)\u2014give points to low scoring players or take points away from high scoring ones. Spirits frown upon runaway leaders and sometimes favor the underdogs.\nFinal coin not depicted in this pic\nTriples are powerful and can return your crystal skull from the ethereal realm and get points. But if you can't take advantage of a triple, the hourglass comes out, and the spirits will threaten to reign skulduggery down upon all of you!\nFinal coin not depicted in this pic\nIf you don't banish the hourglass and think you can push your luck, the Winged Death Head may appear and then all of you will suffer Skulduggery!\n \"Carter and I played Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery at lunch today and loved it! You and Kate are so creative and inventive\u2014Carter was especially impressed with all the skulls.\" Jodi and her son from our neighborhood\nDelve into the full rules, including the challenging solo mode, on our subQuark site. There's even a tiny advanced mode mod. Or grab the PDF here.\nThis ages-old game has always been played with three dice\u2014that's all you really need.\nBut . . . we've added some fun components while keeping it incredibly portable. We play test a lot when we're out for a bite to eat and the stone skulls catch people's attention\u2014it's like being a board game ambassador.\n16 white stone skulls to count successful spirit summons\n8 black stone skulls for mastery of spirit conjuring\n4 mystical crystal skulls to shatter the spirit connection\n1 Winged Death Head coin straddling the physical and ethereal bounds\n3 six-sided Chessex dice ready to conjure the spirits\n1 hand-pressed steel tin cursed as an ethereal realm portal\n1 sleeved quick reference guide to aid the interpretation of ethereal signs\nStone skulls\u2014white ones for 1 point each, black for 5 points, and glass skulls. The stone skulls are made from the mineral howlite which is similar to turquoise. In fact, howlite's popular for jewelry and these skulls are actually beads. The mystical crystal skull is a bit bigger and made of glass because of its special power and strategic nature. It's cool too because the glass is matt-finished but the eyes and mouth are shiny and clear.\nWhite & black skull are about 8mm and the crystal skulls about 12mm\nA nickel-plated minted solid brass coin makes Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery unique, like the hand-pressed tin, PLUS the coin can turn your best game into your worst, or vice versa\u2014SKULDUGGERY! \nThe coin's made on 150-ton presses at the oldest private US mint. Most game \"coins\" are molded from melted zinc. But real coins, like you might have in your pocket, are minted. Our mint makes coins for car washes and game arcades that see heavy-duty daily abuse in metal vending machines and they're meant to last a lifetime. And so will your Winged Death Head coin.\nArt files for the mint's custom dies & our sample which is slightly larger than a US quarter\nThe hard-working dice\u2014Chessex dice of course. We've shared over 30,000 Chessex dice with tabletop gamers in 49 countries\u2014they're the only dice we use because they feel great to roll and last forever. For Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery, we use three 12mm ivory-colored d6 with black pips as a nod to the game's heritage.\nFirst batch of 9,000 dice - individually inspected & ready to go\nThe game box\u2014a hand-stamped seamless hinged steel tin\u2014which can even be stored on the fridge with a magnet! \nAnimated GIFS\u2014cool or corny? but hey, save bookshelf space & keep this game handy\nWe design our own embossing plates and we've prototyped several and now a pair of 3D-printed stainless steel embossing plates are on their way to use for hand pressing your game's lid. The tin measures 2.3 x 1.9 x 0.5 inches (5.8 x 4.8 x 1.3 cm) and is about half the size of an Altoids tin.\nWe use an arbor press and enjoy this hands-on, maker movement, and personal step\u2014it's a truly rewarding labor of love. \nAnd we have serious experience in cranking these out. So far we've pressed about 5,000 for Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse\u2014here's a 20-second video of that lid:\nIf you carry your game around, like I do daily, expect the tin to get beat up. To me, that means I'm having an awesome life with time to spend sharing fun with friends. The dents you'll most likely see will be from the inside. When closing the tin, get all the pieces to lay flat below the rim of the tin and gently close. If it touches any game pieces, gently shake it to try to get things to lay flatter. But even with this attention, I inevitably end up with a skull making an outward dent. Maybe it's the power of the spirits trying to free themselves from the ethereal realm!\nThe back label. Okay, not so exciting but we voluntarily exceed U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards. It lets us track the complete manufacture of the game\u2014from the coins in Ohio to lid pressing in Portsmouth. It's a durable exterior-grade vinyl sticker made to last (mine from Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse been through the wash four times and in-and-out of my Levi's watch pocket every day for three years\u2014of course, we don't recommend washing your game, despite the Cheetos dust).\n \"You guys are brilliant. These games are sooooo creative and chocked full of fun.\" Caroyl S. via Skype\nAsymmetrical label - easier to apply & full of Skulduggery!\nA linen-finish French casino-grade card will have the official Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery logo and a quick reference guide. It doesn't fit in the mini tin but it's an easy way to refresh yourself on the special rolls. And it'll be sleeved in an acid-free Ultra-Pro Deck Protector Sleeve (110 microns).\nUpgrade! Checking the quality of 330gsm German card stock, looks and feels nice.\nMini Update Nov. 26th: We're checking out a German, black core, 330gsm \"superior smooth\" card. Once we see the samples, we may upgrade to it. Why the change? Supposedly this \"superior smooth\" yields better contrast and crisper graphics while being a better quality over the 310gsm linen we typically use. Since this isn't shuffled, maybe that makes sense. But we'll decide first-hand and, even though it's a bit more expensive, we always want to use what's best for the long term. \nDec.4th: Yep, looks like this card stock is heavier (hard to tell a difference of 20gsm, but the graphics are crisper, so that's what we'll do! An upgrade\u2014woohoo! =D\nThat's right\u2014well . . . sort of. This game's full instructions are online as a mobile-friendly web page, as a PDF at the end of the Kickstarter, and a quick reference guide. We include a quick reference guide with your game but it doesn't fit in the tiny tin. We don't think you'll need it after you play it once. You'll probably understand it after reading the official Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery rules when you check out if this game's right for you. \nThere's no point in backing a game, even an economical one built to last a lifetime unless you'll enjoy playing it.\nKickstarter exclusive PnP\nThe Kickstarter exclusive Print and Play. This reward lets you follow the Kickstarter if you aren't sure about backing it yet.\nSome of you Print and Play peeps create outrageously awesome versions of our games and we're honored that you pour your passion into them.\nOnce the Kickstarter's over, you'll get the download link for the PDF instructions, the high-resolution art files used for the tin, tin label, and winged death head coin.\nMint Tin Mini Skulduggery\nEverything you need to kick back, chill with friends, and have some easy fun with one copy of the Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery game. And you get the full PnP PDFs too.\nMint Tin Mini Skulduggery Two Pack\nYou get two copies of the Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery game. Be awesome and give one as a gift. Or keep one in your desk or car. \nHeck, combine two games for 5- to 8-player action!  Plus you get the full PnP PDFs.\nMint Tin Mini Skulduggery Four Pack\nGet four copies of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery. Butter up several friends with thoughtful gifts or stash them in your camping gear, fall-out bunker, or wherever. And you get the full PnP PDFs too.\n$9.75 per game in the US\n$11.75 per game for Canada\n$12.50 per game for the rest of the world\nThis reward's a great value for a group buy with total final cost per game, including shipping, that's close to the US single game reward.\nMint Tin Mini Skulduggery Ten Pack\nGet ten copies of the Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery game.\nWhat a fantastic club or group buy! The cost per game, including shipping, gets it below the US single game reward.  And you get the PnP PDFs too.\n$8.90 per game in the US\n$9.50 per game for Canada\n$9.90 per game for the rest of the world\nWe had one backer of Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse use her group buy as wedding gifts\u2014now that must have been a fun wedding! Nothing says love quite like the apocalypse or, in this case, Skulduggery!\nNope, while stretch goals can add excitement to a project, we think they're sometimes a bit contrived. If the game should have a metal coin, then make it that way. We thought about making the coin a stretch goal and maybe doing a chipboard token. But those don't last, especially for a game you can actually carry in your pocket or bag. The components in Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery are tough by nature. You'll beat up your tin long before the dice, skulls, or coin wear out (if they ever do!).\nWe learned from our last Kickstarter that it's best to do \"add-ons\" separately. By add-ons we mean our existing games and packages: \nMint Tin Pirates \nMint Tin Aliens \nMint Tin Mini Apocalypse\nMint Tin Mini Apocalypse Deluxe\nTriple Play\nTriple Play Deluxe\nWe calculate shipping for each reward to minimize postage and maximize protection with the shipping materials we use. Rather than do \"add-ons\" as part of your pledge, see the backers-only update.\nSupplies are limited but we hope to have enough on hand to meet your needs. For the US, these should make it before Christmas if you order by November 30th. International orders vary greatly with some delivering within a week and some as long as six weeks (we've had two that took 8 weeks to Sweden\u2014that's not many out of thousands of shipments, but if one is yours\u2014that stinks). Please plan accordingly and don't assume they'll be on time\u2014we wish we could control that but customs is typically the sticking point as to why some deliver sooner than others (we've found this to be true of all countries, not just Sweden). You'll receive tracking info and that only works as well as your country's integration with the USPS system.\nWe use USPS First-Class Mail and USPS First-Class Package International Service and here's what we declare:\nMTMS single - $5\nMTMS two pack - $10\nMTMS four pack - $20\nMTMA ten pack - $30\nEven though we \"hide\" the shipping cost where we legally can, the postage is in the barcode and is sometimes added to the declared value\u2014it's up to your Customs. \nYou're responsible for any VAT, GST, customs duties, or other taxes your country may impose. Of course, we think that the value added to your gaming library is tremendous for Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery, but paying tax on fun is anything but fun.\nIf you need special shipping, such as a confirmed signature, we'll find out the cost from the USPS and then ask you for that amount. Send a message with your requirements, we'll let you know the amount, and you'll pay via PayPal.\nWe love Kickstarter. Regular people can share their dreams with all of us and that's why you'll see that we've backed over 700 projects\u2014we wouldn't expect people to support us if we didn't support them. It's a great community.\nKeeping this close to home is key for this maker-to-player project. We source in the US with dice from Indiana, plastic bags from Ohio, tins from New Jersey, labels from Rhode Island, minted coins from Ohio, and shipping supplies from Wisconsin.\nIt all comes together in Portsmouth, New Hampshire\u2014on a dining room table (and pretty much the entire house). But none of this happens without you. \nThank you for checking this project out.\nThe link for this Kickstarter is: \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/subquark/mint-tin-mini-skulduggery\nYou can use these images (and any on this page) if you'd like to share the word about this project.\nThe images below can be saved with a right-click or, if you click them, they'll open a new window with the subQuark.com image.\nThe link for this game's permanent page, complete with rules, is:\nhttp://subquark.com/rules-mtmskulduggery.html\nIf you'd like to share our Twitter or Facebook page:\nhttps://twitter.com/subquark\nhttps://www.facebook.com/subQuarkpublishing/\nThis image is 640 x 360 pixels\nThis image is 640 x 230 pixels\nThis image is 640 X 315 pixels\nThis image is 640 x 320 pixels\nThis image is 640 x 470 pixels\nLike our other games, there are no plans for normal distribution because of the mark-ups in the distribution chain: designer->publisher->manufacturer->distributor->store->you \nAs maker-to-player we use our website, subQuark.com, to skip all that and keep the game made in the US with top-quality domestic components\u2014our distribution chain is personal: maker->you\nBut our games are in Diversions, our awesome and supportive friendly local game shop, in their Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Portland, Maine locations. We're deeply honored to be with them.\nThis Kickstarter's all about fulfilling your rewards\u2014getting Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery into your hands first.\nA second printing will be available in the subQuark online shop at a later date and at a higher price.\nFrom our past Kickstarters, we've donated games to troops, veterinary fund auctions, and children's hospitals. This was possible through generous over-pledging which we match. \nIf you over-pledge, we'll assume it's for donations and match it to make copies of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery to donate\u2014thank you\u2014you do make a positive difference.\n Thank you for checking out this project and sharing the word. \nOur other games, Mint Tin Pirates, Mint Tin Aliens, and Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse, are registered with the US Copyright Office. And Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery will also be made immortal in this way.\nIt's kind of cool because a copy of each game is permanently archived in the US Library of Congress.\nHome crafted games are our hallmark. Our games are made by the two of us, Kate and David. Once play tested, we source components domestically, inspect every part, and assemble each game in our home. It gets crazy but it's also deeply rewarding and that's because of you\u2014you make this fun\u2014thank you.\nCredits:\nThank you to all of you who constantly nurture us and provide wonderful support via social media. Your words and pics spur us on and have produced this Kickstarter. Thank you, we are humbled by your passion and generosity.\nSolo play and walk through video: Nick Shaw, long-time friend and game expert, he's created popular variants for our games and lends his insightful talents to this game. His solo rules are very fun!\nRules integrity: Natalie Miller, her ability to imagine unusual scenarios has clarified obscure but real game situations leading to better rules and more focus for the game.  Plus a nifty animated GIF!\nEditing: Jodi Labonte, our editor bar none, I cannot say enough about her passion, talent, and patience with us. Thank you Jodi.\nLatin: Andrew de Alvare, fellow game designer and Latin expert. Andrew created the perfect Latin phrases for the coin. \nTrivia:\nThe winged death head figure comes from 18th century New England gravestones. Many were inscribed with Fugit Hora (time flees) and to give your Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery coin a relevant game reference, we added Nunc Est Ludendum (now is the time to play). We also use Ad ludum festinamus (we are hastening towards the game).\nAn old US-version of this game, known as Buck, goes back at least to the 19th century as a dice game to pay for rounds of drinks. Dice and beer\u2014not a bad combo!\nDid you know that there are over 1,800 Craps books on Amazon? A pure luck-driven dice game! Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery's cheaper than many of those books and it's a game that'll last a lifetime without breaking the bank!\nPrototyping the embossing plates takes several rounds of 3D-printed high-detail plastic models. Once those work on doubled heavy paper (32 lb), it's time to have the stainless steel plates 3D printed. It's a slow go since it takes about 10 days for each cycle and it takes me a few cycles to get it right (there's variation between the plastic and steel printing that's challenging to account for).\nEmbossing plate prototype renders - 3D printed in plastic & then stainless steel\nIf you're into metaphysics, the mineral howlite reduces anxiety, tension, and stress, and facilitates awareness and emotional expression. I'll take an extra helping of that please!\nUpdates:\nAt the start, they may come out every few days but then they'll taper off for bigger announcements (and some will include recipes, see the last Kickstarter for pics and how-to for a grilled bacon lobster sandwich and yummy mushroom quesadillas). It's easy to get excited and send lots of updates, but you're busy and we all get enough spam. However, I do post long after the project's over as a way to share news. If you really want to stay connected, follow our Twitter or Facebook page. We post on those regularly.\nYou'll receive your Kickstarter survey a few weeks after the completion of this project. It's pre-filled with your shipping address, please verify that it's the best address for us to use. We made over 4,000 games to mail more than 2,900 packages to 49 countries for Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse. We were early and only two were lost in the mail. We want to do even better for this one and your accurate address helps us tremendously. Thanks! =)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFulfilling these rewards is paramount because we value our reputation. There are other games in the works that we'd love to Kickstart but these Kickstarter rewards come first!\n\nGame Component Risks -\n\nWe have components on hand to build a lot of games and our vendors handle ongoing big orders from us. We've had as many as 30,000 dice in the house, so we're pretty comfortable making big quantities of games.\n\nGame Manufacturing Risks -\n\nThese games are from maker-to-player which means we make them at home. No offshore ordering or import shipping logistics. All components come from US suppliers and we have experience from our previous Kickstarters. We delivered early and plan to do that again.\n\nFor Mint Tin Mini Apocalypse, Kate and I spent 600 hours making 4,000 games\u2014it's a lot of work but it's very satisfying to share our labor of love with your love of gaming.\n\nMassive Huge Kickstarter Funding -\n\nYes, that's a good risk and it could affect reward fulfillment. The last Kickstarter showed us that we could get over 4,000 games out ahead of schedule.\n\nIf this becomes massively successful on the order of many times the funding level, even backup vendors might not be enough. The worst thing that could happen is we'd have to push the delivery back a month or two in order to wait for more skulls to be made. \n\nIF . . . we need to do that, we'd honor existing backer' delivery dates and add new rewards with later more accurate dates\u2014that worked well for Mini Apocalypse and backers knew exactly where they stood.\n\nWith us, our promise to you is the most important thing.\n\nActs of Gods -\n\nWe pull this game together in Portsmouth, the birthplace of the US Navy. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard repairs and replenishes nuclear subs. As such, who knows what could wreak havoc on game assembly (big mutant monster, nuclear breach, angry sailors mobbing the town) but we figure we can get through anything. =)\n\nThanks for checking out this project, even if this game's not for you, we value your time in reading this. =)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE PnP", "descp": "PDF download of the high resolution Print-and-Play files for Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery's instructions and quick reference card, and tin, coin, and label art.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "MINT TIN MINI SKULDUGGERY", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery\nTotal pledge with shipping:\nUS 13, Canada 19, World 21", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["767 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "MINT TIN MINI SKULDUGGERY TWO PACK", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery\nTotal pledge with shipping:\nUS 22, Canada 28, World 30", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["249 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "MINT TIN MINI SKULDUGGERY FOUR PACK", "descp": "Four (4) copies of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery\nTotal pledge with shipping:\nUS 39, Canada 47, World 50\nFinal cost per game:\nUS 9.75, Canada 11.75, World 12.50", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["66 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "MINT TIN MINI SKULDUGGERY TEN PACK", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Tin Mini Skulduggery\nTotal pledge with shipping:\nUS 89, Canada 95, World 99\nFinal cost per game:\nUS 8.90, Canada 9.50, World 9.90", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "It's in the mail & a lavish recipe", "update_content": "Hi all!\nThank you for the print-and-play pics, Kate and I love seeing your creativity.

It is designed both in the Metric and the Imperial system.\n\u2014\nThe new line of Rollbe measuring tools adds an incredibly durable black titanium carbo-nitride coating. It has a clicking sound feature built-in and the visually highlighted \u2018\u2019start mark,\u2019\u2019 which helps to track measurements with ease.\nRollbe super compact versions - 4 Inch and 10 cm are similar to the size of a coin. These versions are super compact and with specially designed carabiner keychain case - easily fit inside your pocket or can be attached to your every day carry on.\nRollbe larger versions - 8 Inch and 20 cm are designed for projects with a more professional position. These rulers are very portable and come in handy at any time. A genuine leather case is available as an add-on option!! \nWith its agile functionality, Rollbe rulers have many applications for both professional and daily use.\nDaily use\nWe measure things on a daily basis \u2013 straight or curved lines, square or round objects, drawing, cutting, comparing - Rollbe is quick, easy and designed to keep you equipped at all times.\nProfessional use \nDesigners, architects, carpenters, sewers, decorators and many other professionals draft specific layouts and templates. Measuring curves and design details are necessary for these professions. Rollbe allows measuring curves and straight lines or surfaces in a convenient way.\n\nHow to measure\nIt is super easy to use. Place the \u2018\u2019start mark\u2019\u2019 on the starting point of the surface or line that you want to measure, roll and count rotations or measuring units by following the click sound or start mark, then add the remaining units.\nExample \nIf using Rollbe 10 cm, when it passes the number 10, add the extra cm or mm to your measurement. One full circle equals 10 cm, two circles - 20 cm, three circles - 30 cm. Keep on rolling and measure!\nMeasuring inside corners\nThe disk is round hence, it is not possible to place the regular start point in the corner. To measure inside corners you have to add the radius or diameter of the ruler to your measurement - You will find the radius indicated on your Rollbe.\nDesign\nDesigned and machined with precision to every unit. Core material used is 420-grade stainless steel, micro-blasted, coated with a premium black titanium carbo-nitride coating - tested and proven with a durable coating, Rollbe is built to last. It is finished with laser engraved markings that contrast with the dark surface and provides excellent visibility of the measuring units. The simple design allows you to make accurate measurements comfortably.\nThe click feature which is built inside the tool\u2019s handle part - provides very balanced and gentle, clear sound of the click on each rotation when rolling the tool.\nRewards\nFor any questions, suggestions or press inquiries feel free to email us at info@rollbe.com\n                                       Timeline\n\nTeam\n\nThank you! \n- We are passionate about what we do and appreciate all of the supporters that have shared and joined this journey with us.

Campbell published the novella Who Goes There?, about a team of scientists in Antarctica who discover and are terrorized by a monstrous, shape-shifting alien entity.

Frozen Hell expands the Thing story dramatically, giving vital backstory and context to an already incredible tale.

It\u2019s all about different people working together to overcome challenges and build amazing successes \u2014 and then celebrating the camaraderie of their shared achievements.\nThe best cooperative games are like that too. If you love cooperative board, card, and dice games, and you want to know more about how they work, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together is a book about how and why cooperative games work. It's a 384-page, 6\" \u00d7 9\" trade paperback with more than 150 illustrated figures. It's also available in digital editions.\nMeeples Together is for gamers. Whether you play games as a lifestyle or a more casual pastime, and whether you\u2019re just interested or you want to get better, this book will help you understand how cooperative games work, how you can play them better, and which games might be your next new favorites.\nMeeples Together is also for aficionados. Champions and connoisseurs of tabletop gaming can never get enough of thinking and talking about games. If you\u2019re the kind of person who logs your plays on BoardGameGeek and always tries the new hotness at Gen Con or Essen Spiel, this book provides crucial fuel for thought and discussion.\nMeeples Together is for critics too. The gaming community has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to writers, reviewers, podcasters, and pundits. This book moves the state of the art forward in terms of understanding this key subset of tabletop gaming, making it required reading for anyone with a serious critical interest in tabletop games.\nMeeples Together is for game designers. Not only does it break down existing tabletop designs in exhaustive detail so you can understand what specific mechanics and concepts make them tick, it also highlights ideas for game development with icons in the text, and appendices cover both the basics of game design as well as game design dilemmas.\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, aficionado, critic, or game designer, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together contains 14 chapters about the nature, mechanics, theory, and frontiers of cooperative gaming.\nAlong the way, 14 in-depth case studies (or more, depending on stretch goals!) of cooperative gaming\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 from Pandemic and Battlestar Galactica to Contract Bridge \u2014 demonstrate the concepts and ideas. (Not to mention Appendix V\u2019s capsule reviews of more than 90 cooperative titles!)\nThe physical edition is a 384-page, 6\" \u00d7 9\" trade paperback containing more than 150 illustrated figures.\nDigital editions will include a tablet-optimized PDF version, an Epub version, and a Kindle (.mobi) version.\nHere's the table of contents:\nForeword by Matt Leacock\nChapter 1: The Basics of Cooperation\nPart One: The Spectrum of Cooperative Gaming\nChapter 2: Styles of Competition\n     Case Study: Terra \nChapter 3: Styles of Teamwork\n     Case Study: Contract Bridge\n     Case Study: One Night Ultimate Werewolf ( \u2b05\ufe0f stretch goal unlocked!)\nChapter 4: Styles of Cooperation\n     Case Study: Pandemic \n     Case Study: Forbidden Island ( \u2b05\ufe0f stretch goal unlocked!)\n     Case Study: Forbidden Desert ( \u2b05\ufe0f stretch goal unlocked!)\nPart Two: The Mechanics of Cooperative Games\nChapter 5: Cooperative Systems\n     Case Study: Flash Point: Fire Rescue \nChapter 6: Challenge Systems\n     Case Study: Robinson Crusoe \u2014 Adventures on the Cursed Island \nChapter 7: Players Facing Challenges\n     Case Study: Shadows over Camelot \n     Case Study: Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game \nChapter 8: Players Undertaking Tasks\n     Case Study: Arkham Horror 2e\nChapter 9: Adventure Systems\n     Case Study: Mansions of Madness 2e\nPart Three: The Theory of Cooperative Games\nChapter 10: A Theory of Cooperative Gaming\n     Case Study: Space Alert \nChapter 11: A Theory of Challenge Design\n     Case Study: Ghost Stories \nChapter 12: When Games Go Wrong\n     Case Study: D-Day Dice \nPart Four: Cooperative Frontiers\nChapter 13: The Psychology of Cooperative Gaming\n     Case Study: Hanabi \nChapter 14: Assembling the Puzzle\n     Case Study: SOS Titanic \nAppendices\nAppendix I: The Basics of Game Design\nAppendix II: Game Design Dilemmas\nAppendix III: Game Design Types\nAppendix IV: Game Design & Social Theories\nAppendix V: Cooperative & Teamwork Game Synopses & Reviews\nHungry for more?

He's founded several companies focusing on social software, including Skotos Tech, an online game company where he aided in the design of Castle Marrach, Grendel's Revenge, and Lovecraft Country. His Life with Alacrity blog talks about the principles of cooperation, collaboration, and governance while his Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops imagine the future of collaboration on the internet.\nShannon Appelcline writes about games. He regularly contributed to the defunct board-gaming magazine Knucklebones, while his eurogame-focused Meeples & Mechanics blog contains over a decade worth of game analysis. He's also long been involved with the roleplaying field, working for Chaosium and supporting lines like Call of Cthulhu and Pendragon. He's best known for Designers & Dragons, a four-book history of the roleplaying industry.\nGameplaywright publishes books about games, stories, and the work of making them. Its co-founders are Will Hindmarch and Jeff Tidball. This is their seventh Gameplaywright release. \nFeaturing interior figures by Keith Curtis, editing by Renee Knipe and Colleen Riley, cover design by Will Hindmarch, and interior layout by Alex Mayo and Jeff Tidball.\nWe think every store in the world that sells board games can sell Meeples Together.\nWe\u2019re positive that we won\u2019t reach every gamer, aficionado, critic, and game designer in the world in the 30 short days this Kickstarter runs. For the 20 years after that, we hope game stores will continue to sell Meeples Together to people who love cooperative games.  If you have a store, our \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier is for you.\nThis campaign is retail-friendly because:\n* The price is the price. What it costs to back the campaign is also the MSRP we\u2019ll put on the back.\n* Your customers get everything. We\u2019ll give you access to the digital edition so you can pass it along to your customers who buy physical copies of Meeples Together from you.\n* We won\u2019t tie up your capital. You'll choose your quantity and pay the balance \u2014 with your pledge counted as a credit \u2014 the month before we ship. You\u2019ll even be able to add other Gameplaywright titles like Friendly Local Game Store and The White Box.\n* You\u2019ll get the discount you expect. Your discount is 50%, with shipping pegged closely to our actual cost.\n* You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. We'll ship to retail backers at least four weeks before we ship to general distribution.\n* You\u2019ll have long-term access. Through Gameplaywright\u2019s distribution partnership with Atlas Games, physical editions of Meeples Together will be available through distribution, so you can make it available for years to come.\nRetail backers must be established, brick-and-mortar, retail game stores. \nThe Gameplaywright titles offered in our \u201cPlus,\u201d \u201cDesigner,\u201d and \"Everything\" tiers are described briefly below. Also described are titles that will be available as add-on purchases via BackerKit, after the campaign ends.\nThe White Box is a game design workshop in a box, a 208-page book of 25 essays about how to design and publish tabletop games, and a kit of more than 400 generic components \u2014 cubes, meeples, dice, chips, punchboard \u2014 to get you started right away. ($29.95 as an add-on)\nThe White Box Essays is the book from The White Box. It's not available on its own as a physical edition, but its digital editions are part of the Digital Designer pledge level. ($7.95 as an add-on)\nThings We Think About Games collects bite-sized thoughts about games. It spans the breadth of games and the depths of gaming, offering insights about collecting, playing, critiquing, designing, and publishing. ($19.95 as an add-on)\nThe Bones: Us and Our Dice gathers writing about fandom and family \u2014 about gamers, camaraderie, and memories \u2014 and ties them together where they meet: our dice. Contributors include Wil Wheaton, Keith Baker, John Kovalic, Ken Hite, and Chuck Wendig. ($18.95 as an add-on)\nFriendly Local Game Store is a book about how to earn a middle-class income opening your own game store and creating a community for gamers. It\u2019s written by Gary L. Ray, author of Quest for Fun, the go-to blog for all things FLGS. ($24.95 add-on)\nHamlet\u2019s Hit Points presents the beat system, a toolkit for storytelling in RPGs \u2014 and any other form \u2014 by classifying story beats and letting you track their ups and down from hope to fear and back. Includes full-length analyses of Hamlet, Dr. No, and Casablanca. ($19.95 add-on)\nBeating the Story expands the story beat system by defining different types of beat-to-beat transitions, and providing practical guidance on topics like conceiving your story, creating its hero, mapping its beats, writing drafts, revising, and even editing the work of others. Includes extended analyses of Maupassant\u2019s \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d the Mad Men episode \u201cHave a Seat, Shut the Door,\u201d the X-Files episode \u201cHome,\u201d and a scene from The Color Purple. ($19.95 add-on)\nShipping charges for all \"Print\" tiers and the \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier will be collected after the Kickstarter concludes using BackerKit, a post-campaign pledge manager. \nThis is likely to help us to generally reduce the costs of shipping by allowing us to add more international fulfillment hubs based on demand. It also keeps your money in your pocket longer.\nWe\u2019ve estimated the following shipping costs by region and tier.\nUnited States (including Puerto Rico) Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $3-4\nPrint Plus: $6-7\nPrint Designer: $12-15\nEverything in Print: $12-15\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nCanada Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $10-12\nPrint Plus: $12-15\nPrint Designer: $15-20\nEverything in Print: $15-20\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEurope Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAustralia and New Zealand Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEverywhere Else Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $20-30\nPrint Plus: $30-40\nPrint Designer: $35-50\nEverything in Print: $40-60\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAs you can see, shipping physical objects around the world is expensive. We don\u2019t like it any more than you do.\nWe won\u2019t profit from the shipping costs for the various tiers of this campaign. Rather, we\u2019ll wind up modestly subsidizing shipping to most destinations. After re-shipping lost and stolen packages, we\u2019ll spend a little bit more. This is what we expect, and it\u2019s fine with us.\nPlease expect that shipping charges will increase if you respond to the pledge manager after shipping has begun. Make sure your inbox is set to receive backer updates, and look for them after the campaign ends.\nTo avoid shipping charges, consider the digital tiers. You can also wait until Meeples Together\u2019s public release, anticipated for April, 2019. If you buy the book in a store, you won\u2019t pay shipping charges.

At the beginning of the game, Player's will choose the creatures with which they'd like to play. Players will collectively choose to have all matching hands or play \"chaotically\" where every player builds their own unique hand of creatures. Either way, a player's hand must contain a single card of each number (0-8). With the addition of a new mortal card, the Expansion also invites you to customize your game play experience with a unique mortal deck every time you play the game. Every round, or Night, you'll also play to win location cards that give you added bonuses in future Nights.\n  WELCOME! Thanks for taking the time to check out our project. If you're looking to back Campy Creatures for the first time, the options above might be great choices for you. Campy Creatures 2nd Edition gives you everything you need to play the game for the first time. The Spooky Edition next to it is our Kickstarter Exclusive product. It's got a limited edition box and a limited edition pin, and it also includes everything you need to play the game for the first time, plus the creepy new monsters we're showing off in this campaign!\nYou've asked for more re-playability, so we've refined how the Mortal Deck gets built allowing for new deck variants, added an additional Mortal card, The Assistant, and added the Location mechanic. We also improved the game layout and redesigned the rulebook.  It will also feature a larger Clash-O-Meter, providing room for both the Clash Tokens and Location cards, all in a bigger box that will fit both the base game and future expansions.\n  We're providing every backer of The Expansion tier with a Conversion Kit that includes all the new and updated Mortals Cards, the new Location Cards, and the2nd Edition rulebook. This kit updates all the card components of a 1st Edition game to the design standards of 2nd Edition.\nAlternatively, if you want all of the new components in addition to the updated cards and rulebook, you can back at the Conversion Edition tier. The Conversion Edition includes Expansion I and the Conversion Box. The Conversion Box includes all of the new and updated 2nd Edition cars as well as the new box, updated Clash-O-Meter, Clash Markers, Monster Tokens, and rulebook.\nHere is a comparison of the Conversion Kit and the Conversion Box. \nNote, Conversion Kits and Conversion Editions will be available for purchase in BackerKit after the campaign, but we will not be selling Conversion Boxes individually. In the video below, Mattox talks through some key points to keep in mind with these kits and more!\nWith the addition of Expansion I creatures, players will get to choose between 2 creature options for Creature cards 2-6, just like players get to pick between the Demogorgon and Invisible Man today. A player's hand must contain 9 creatures, one of every number from 0 to 8. Standard setup involves players having identical hands of cards, but players can also decide to play \"chaotically\" where each player chooses their hand of Creature cards at the beginning of the game. Feeling extra mad (in a science-y way of course)? Choose different Creature hands every round!\nAlong with the original Mortal sets of Teenagers, Classics and Enginneers, two new Mortal sets are being added.\n2nd Edition contains The Assistant, a Mortal that, once captured, chooses to join your ghoulish team. Assistants persist across rounds earning an increasing number of points based the quantity you've captured. These points are collected at the end of every round!\nExpansion I contains The Angry Mob. These Mortals are always on the move! Capturing an Angry Mob will cause neighboring (players to the left or right) Angry Mobs to join your collection. Capture The Instigator and ALL Angry Mobs will move to you. Lots of negative points, but a great way to secure Location victory.\nLocations are new to both 2nd Edition and Expansion I. One location is revealed every round, which is won by the player who captures the most Mortals containing the relevant \"location icons.\" The winning player gains that location's reward. 2nd Edition includes 6 new Locations and Expansion I adds 3 more. \nStretch Goal Locations\nWe did it! Josh has been at Blizzcon (I'm not jealous, you're jealous), so he is still finalizing the illustrations. They likely won't be done by the end of the campaign, so if you are joining us late, hop over to one of our social media pages for finalized art/mechanics. Speaking of mechanics, Mattox has been testing ideas for these cards, so look for those reveals as well! \nWe hadn't planned on adding any cards via stretch goals, but felt like it was another area the community wanted and we could make happen. So thanks again for your patience and for sharing your feedback!\nMattox Shuler, designer of Campy Creatures\n2nd Edition is not only a reprinting of Campy Creatures, it is an opportunity to pull our community into the development process. When we thought about changing up the base game content, we looked directly at community and player feedback about their experiences. A couple of key features stood out to us as must haves in this new edition. First, we wanted each round to have a different feel and flavor\u2014culminating in the Final Act. This comes in the form of a new Mortal type (Assistants) that are kept round to round and Locations cards that change up each round. Second, the size of the board has increased to make scoring and maneuvering around the Clash-O-Meter a little easier. Lastly, because we want to make more things in the Campy-verse, we re-arranged the Mortal deck in a new way to make the game more expandable and give players more control over how it's setup. Thank you for all of your feedback and support!\nMario Radmilovic, co-designer of Campy Creatures Expansion I\nMy name is Mario and I am one of the designers for this expansion after being a playtester and somewhat of an idea man during the first Campy Creatures Kickstarter campaign back in early 2017. Working on this expansion and actually filling the role of a designer has been a completely new experience for me, but I'm really excited about where we arrived and can't wait for you to try it.\n *Note, only the Wooden Power Up/Venom tokens and three New Locations will be included in the Expansion ($13) tier.\nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want. This extra money will appear as a credit in Backerkit. You do NOT have to do this! Once the campaign is over, you will be sent a link to finalize your order. All the things will be there.\nAll shipping charges will be handled after the campaign via BackerKit. Although we haven\u2019t finalized the specifics, we do have estimates for pledge items (i.e. before add-ons) based on prior campaign data and fulfillment partner estimates. We are close to finalizing add-on shipping and will be providing a table in an update after the campaign, but we are looking at tiering by number of add-ons items and setting a flat rate for any number of Giclee prints. So the \"each additional game\" line above is slightly over estimating the cost of extra games/apparel/cards if you add multiple items, but it is slightly underestimating the cost of adding prints.\nShipping will be Customs Friendly (US, CA, UK, EU, AU, NZ)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are continuing our manufacturing partnership with Panda Game Manufacturing.

Introducing 'The Splitter -Titanium Multi Utensil' a SUPER light weight multi utensil that is compact and minimalist. The Splitter is made of two separate titanium utensils, 1 spatula and 1 long spork, that when joined together, turn into a handy set of tongs. It's the pinnacle of outdoor utensils, made from the highest quality materials available.\nWe are Full Windsor! We are a small outdoors brand driven by design, creativity and curiosity. This is our 5th kickstarter product launch. We have extensive experience, we have the manufacturing capabilities and we know what we are doing. Last year we released our Muncher titanium multi utensil on kickstarter, fulfilling every pledge to our 4553 wonderful backers with a product that then went on to be featured in Outside Magazine's 'Gear of the Year' 2018. Now stocked around the world by reputable retailers such as REI, the Muncher was a great success. We're now back on Kickstarter, with what we consider to be our best product yet - The Splitter titanium multi utensil.\nThe joining mechanism for the tongs is a small stainless steel pin fixed to the spatula that inserts into a keyhole slot in the spork's end. The tongs use the titanium materials flex to operate at the perfect force. The spatula has a chamfered edge that allows it to get under the fiddliest of food morsels. \nIt also features a serrated corner edge that allows it to cut into and check if food is cooked through whilst cooking. The long spork is perfect for getting into deep food packets and can be used as both a eating and serving utensil. When joined together into tongs the spatula can still be used to get under food and then the spork grips down onto the items to grasp them firmly. Its functionality makes it great for picking up all kinds of food.\nBoth the spork and spatula feature a unique joining slot that allows the utensils to join together into a single compact unit when not in use. We have designed the connection so it is a simple click to separate the two utensils.\nWe use the best!  \nTitanium is one of the most common metals found in nature. It is lightweight, strong, non-toxic and resistant to corrosion. Titanium is less heat-conductive than other metals, meaning it is safer to use when cooking. The Splitter uses aerospace grade 1mm sheet titanium. One millimetre might sound thin, but once it is three dimensionally formed into shape, it is very rigid. The reduced thickness is vital for the material flex needed for the tongs to function just so. After many, many prototypes we have refined the form into everything it needs to be.\nSustainability is at the heart of what we do. Titanium is one of the most beneficial metals to recycle because it can be reused again and again with virtually no loss of quality. It is cheaper and less environmentally dangerous to recycle titanium components into new materials than it is to mine fresh titanium from the earth. Also titanium can be reused almost infinitely, a benefit that increases every time a titanium product is recycled.\nThe Splitter will use 100% recycled card for it packaging that is fully recyclable. This means no part of the product will ever need to end up as landfill. This is very important to all of us at Full Windsor!\nThe long spork allows you to get right to the bottom of deep food packets to get every last morsel of food - YUM!!!\nSTEP 1 : Simply scroll up and click the green 'back this project' button at the top right hand side of this page.\nSTEP 2 : Pick a reward, and then follow kickstarter's prompts.  EASY PEASY! \nWe figured you could use some help!  Try talking to our friendly chatbot - Sebastian by clicking the blue box below. Then type your question into the 'type a message' box at the bottom of the page. \nWe are all set up with our manufacturing partner who specializes in the manufacture of high-end titanium products and metal engineering. We have been working with them for the past 6 months, on everything from prototype development to drawing up the final product specifications for the Splitter. They are all ready to start making the tooling and begin the production process. \nThe money raised from kickstarter will allow us to make the different sets of tooling and place an order for the initial production run. \nThe Full Windsor team is very experienced in terms of designing and manufacturing new products. We have been doing it for the last 7 years, ever since Full Windsor was founded in 2011. Mark Windsor, our founder (skinny dude below on the right), has been working as a product designer, bringing new products to life for the last 13 years. He has worked as a product designer for some of the worlds best design firms. \nWe successfully launched our Muncher - Titanium Multi Utensil in 2017 fulfilling all 4553 pledges.

Go to robots.management for the most up-to-date print & play files, release information, and more! \nInhuman Conditions is a five-minute, two-player game of surreal interrogation and conversational judo, set in the heart of a chilling bureaucracy.\nEach game has one Investigator and one Suspect. Armed only with two stamps and a topic of conversation, the Investigator must figure out whether the Suspect is a Human or a Robot.\nRobots must answer the Investigator's questions without arousing suspicion, but are hampered by some specific malfunction in their ability to converse. They must be clever, guiding the conversation in subtle ways without getting caught.\nHumans may speak freely, but may find this freedom as much curse as gift. There are no right or wrong answers, only suspicious and innocuous ones, and one slip of the tongue could land Humans and Robots alike in the Bureau's Invasive Confirmation Unit. There, alongside Investigators who make improper determinations, they will await further testing ...\nCurrent box sketch\nInhuman Conditions is designed by Tommy Maranges (Secret Hitler, Philosophy Bro) and Cory O'Brien (Myths Retold, Monster Prom) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Secret Hitler, Letter Tycoon).\n In each game of Inhuman Conditions, there are two players: one Suspect and one Investigator. The players agree on a theme for the round, and the Investigator is given a series of question prompts related to that theme. Then the Suspect is randomly assigned an identity as either a Human or a Robot. Sometimes Robots are peaceful, and other times they're violent; but their weaknesses always cluster around the chosen theme being investigated.\nRobot catalyzers determine whether the Suspect is Human or Robot.\nAdditionally, the players agree on a penalty that will be face up on the table. Robot Suspects must perform the penalty if they violate their constraint or if they cannot finish their checklist; humans never have a reason to perform the penalty, and should avoid performing it accidentally.\nFinally, the Suspect chooses a Suspect Note, which is a roleplaying prompt that helps the Suspect develop a character for the round.\nThe Investigator always has the same two goals, which go hand in hand: \n Ensure all Human Suspects are properly identified as HUMAN\nAND\nEnsure all Robot Suspects are identified as ROBOT and safely detained. \nThe Investigator loses if the Suspect is incorrectly identified, or if they are killed during the course of their duties by a Violent Robot. \nAll Suspects, robots and humans alike, share one common, overriding objective: Convince the Investigator that you are a human. Any Suspect who is identified as a robot (whether or not that identification is correct) loses. Additionally, robots will have some programming which they must obey. Patient Robots must obey a constraint on their abilities or pay a penalty; Violent Robots must complete a checklist and then kill the Investigator.\nAt any point in the five minutes, the Investigator may declare the Suspect a Robot and order additional testing; a Violent Robot must complete its checklist before this can happen. If, however, at the end of five minutes, the Investigator believes the Suspect is a Human, the Suspect is free to go.\nInvestigators and Human Suspects win and lose together; Robot Suspects only win if they can fool the Investigator.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, nothing happens outside the conversation. there are no cards to count, no votes to track. The conversation is the event. Words don't explain or obscure your decisions; the words are the decisions. It's not just that everything you say can and will be used against you; it's also that there's nothing else you can rely on to defend yourself.\nHide your true nature from the inquisitive Bureau.\nAs a Patient Robot, conceal your true nature. Answer the investigator's questions, avoid certain behaviors, and outlast the Bureau's curiosity.\nPatient Robots must carefully conceal their weakness.\nPeaceful Robots must survive the entire round. For five tense minutes, find new ways to answer questions without arousing suspicion. Discover cleverness you didn't know you were capable of. Volunteer just enough information to throw the Investigator off the scent, without appearing uncooperative.\nAs a Violent Robot, go on the offensive, fulfilling a checklist of items during the conversation so you can kill the Investigator.\nViolent Robots must press the offensive.\nViolent Robots are on the offensive. Find the right opportunities to take control, move your goals forward, and fulfill your objective. Violent robots are more talkative than normal, and you must resist the impulse to strike too early without leaving everything for the very end.\nAs a Human, you must thread the needle. You have nothing to hide, but this works against you as often as it helps. If you're too talkative, the Investigator might think you're trying to kill them; not talkative enough, and the Investigator might wonder if you're hiding a constraint.\nBut remember, the goal is not to give correct answers (there are no correct answers!) but to give answers that don't seem suspicious to the Investigator, no matter how bizarre the character you've created is.\nAs an Investigator, your job is to tell the difference between these three roles. You'll ask pointed questions to expose robotic weaknesses in your Suspect, questions like\n\u201cWhat lie do you tell most often?\u201d\n\u201cWhere, physically, do you feel joy?\u201d\n\u201cWhen was the last time you saw your father cry?\u201d \nLines of Inquiry are provided to help Investigators, but where you take them is up to you.\nOr devise your own questions, improvising on the theme of the round. Watch carefully for behavioral clues: \"Why does he keep talking about dogs?\u201d, \u201cDid they rhyme those two words on purpose?\u201d, and \u201cIs she avoiding discussing her past because it\u2019s painful, or because she doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d\nLearn to focus on what's important, and trust your instincts. You'll encounter Suspects of all kinds, and telling the difference requires the right mix of intuition and knowledge. Sooner or later, everyone passes through the Bureau.\nInhuman Conditions combines the suspense and thrills of social deduction with the possibility and challenge of roleplaying games.\nEach Suspect chooses two cards\u2014the Robot Catalyzer, which determines whether they're Human or Robot, is private. The Suspect Note, which determines the role the Suspect must play, is public.\nSuspect Notes provide the beginnings of a character. Players decide how far to take it.\nIn games like Secret Hitler and Avalon, some event happens, and then players use conversation to make sense of that event.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, every Suspect, no matter what the Robot Catalyzer actually says, must convince the Investigator that they're Human, and the conversation is the only tool the Suspect has. The only way to convince the Investigator that you're Human... is to act convincingly like a human.\nOne of our favorite things about Inhuman Conditions is how playtesters enjoyed re-living the games they just played, hearing the perspective of others and sharing highlights from their inner monologue.\nAs with other social deduction games, players love talking about clues they noticed or strategies they tried. Investigators commiserate with Robots, bemoaning the one thing they wish they had followed up on, or proudly describing the small clues they caught. When Humans win, they celebrate with the Investigators who certified them; when Humans lose, they debate with the Investigator over whose fault it really was that they both lost.  \nBut they also love talking about the characters they created. It's unlike anything we've seen in any other social deduction game we've played. Playtesters consistently stayed late to re-live games and compliment each other on both clever maneuvers and hilarious or chilling characters. We still hear stories from our earliest playtests, and we can't wait to hear the stories from the games you play.\nBecause each round of Inhuman Conditions is only five minutes, players cycle in and out quickly. That means you don't need to decide between playing a game and hanging out. \nWe set out to create a social deduction game for two players, but through playtesting we discovered that the game is entertaining for more than just the two people involved in the interrogation. Inhuman Conditions to be as much fun to watch as it is to play. Playtesters often stayed late, swapping stories and complimenting clever maneuvers or twists that they had witnessed in other playtesters.   \nInhuman Conditions can be played on a quiet night in with a single friend, or at a bigger game night.  \nThe complete contents of the box.

We\u2019ve got the mechanics and art where we want them, and we\u2019re just fine-tuning the writing on individual cards. But actually getting the game out into the world is going to be a big undertaking. We want to create a unique experience for players, and part of that is about the components. The stamps, the forms, the box, and the Investigator\u2019s badge all add to the atmosphere, which informs gameplay. We\u2019re working with AdMagic to ensure the best quality possible for our components, but in order to purchase in enough quantity to make this practical, we need your support. You are the final ingredient.\nThis game is writing-intensive, which means it's also playtest-intensive.

We hope you'll join us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Inhuman Conditions for two years now, and we can't wait to get it to you.\n\nThe biggest challenge we face is that this is a more writing- and playtesting-intensive game than any we've worked on. Fortunately, we're both experienced writers, and this Kickstarter will allow us to focus full-time on the game.\n\nWe're a smaller team, so we're focusing our energy on our strengths: making the game itself really, really delightful in every aspect of the presentation. \n\nMaya Coleman (Secret Hitler, Trogdor!) is our community manager, so you\u2019re in great hands.

We've decided to play it safe on shipping, which means our estimates are based on a rounded-up final weight of the game. We're also using Blackbox, our friends who shipped Secret Hitler. \n\nThe game is being printed by Breaking Games, who produce Cards Against Humanity and Secret Hitler.

\nWith more than 15 000 desk toys delivered to 9000 backers all around the World, we are back with our 7th Kickstarter! The feedback has been amazing and today we are excited to show you our newest creation\nA precision machined globe that creates a full body optical illusion when spun. Simply rotate it to reveal the mind-bending effect of a continuously flowing spherical helix.  \nA piece of kinetic art that invites you to transform it from precisely engineered still shape into hypnotic optical illusion. Made out of aerospace grade aluminum it has a helix-shaped groove milled alongside the whole surface.  \nWhen revolving it creates an almost magical effect that looks like continuously flowing helix would merge into a surface of tabletop. \nDesigned to spin on any desk or flat surface. The solid spherical body and smooth finish make it very pleasant to interact with. It spins silently so you won't be bothering anyone around. \nBuilt for creators, makers, thinkers, and anyone who wants to release their inner creativity and imagination.  Keep focus, relieve stress or simply relax during working hours or brainstorming sessions. \nThere is something oddly attractive about the shape of the sphere- it just asks to be held in a palm. It was the best choice for creating a solid desk toy that you would want to use again and again. \nSpin Mezmoglobe and it will turn into a dynamic sculpture that changes its patterns along with direction and speed of rotation.  \nMezmoglobe presents a full 360\u00b0 view to enjoy different visual effects from various angles. \nEvery globe has a rotating base equipped with high-quality stainless steel bearing. It guarantees a smooth and silent spin as well as long-lasting. The base is removable to easy access the bearing. \nWant to surprise someone? Mezmoglobe makes a truly great and original present that creates a bit of magic every time you interact with it. Each unit is designed with attention to the smallest detail and built to last a lifetime. \nWe enjoy seeing the reactions when someone spins Mezmoglobe for the first time. It instantly creates that ''WOW'' effect. The most frequent ones: WHAT?!..., Again please..., HOW?! or simply Mesmerizing....:)...  \nBut don't take just our word for it. See what our previous backers are saying about our products:\nWith our CNC machines, we are able to achieve such level of precision that is rarely found in regular everyday objects. You\u2019ll instantly notice minutely milled lines and smooth surface texture upon touching Mezmoglobe for the first time! \n                                                  I am Kristoph, the creator, and designer of Mezmoglobe. You might know some of my previous Kickstarter projects - Moondrop, Vortecon, Gr2 Spheres and others. Together with my two brothers and team, we have created 6 successful campaigns with more than 9000 backers joining us. Our greatest inspiration is the amazing feedback from our supporters.\nThis is our passion, our hobby, and our job. With every project, we try to bring something new to the World and Kickstarter is an amazing platform to do that. Our supporters get the best price and a unique chance to follow the whole manufacturing process. This time we are excited to get the Mezmoglobe into your hands;)\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox Partner Program which includes risk free Facebook ads\n                     ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "1x MEZMOGLOBE - Super Early Bird!", "descp": "\u00a322= USD28\nOnly first 48 hours get the best deal for one Mezmoglobe in any color.\nYour color choice will be asked after the project ends.\nRegular retail: \u00a327= USD35\nINCLUDES:\nMezmoglobe", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1,004 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a323 or more", "title": "1x MEZMOGLOBE - Early Bird!", "descp": "\u00a323= USD30\nOnly on Kickstarter get the best deal for one Mezmoglobe in any color.\nYour color choice will be asked after the project ends.\nRegular retail: \u00a327= USD35", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1,219 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a323 or more", "title": "1x MEZMOGLOBE - Extended Early Bird!", "descp": "\u00a323= USD30\nLimited time extended ''Early bird''.

With the success of our last titanium rolling pin and titanium sushi plate projects, we decided to introduce our solid 100% Zirconium & Titanium chopsticks.\n$75k stretch goal unlocked! Free Titanium chopstick rest with each pair ordered!\nIntroducing solid Zirconium! A rare metal that's more corrosion resistant than even Titanium! A solid Zirconium rest comes with each Zirconium chopsticks pledge!\nZirconium UNLOCKED! \nUsed in jewelry and other decoration for centuries \nResistance to corrosion: even higher than Titanium \nUsed in delicate surgical applications due to high corrosion resistance\nCommon in cool stars and moon rocks \n Density: 6.52g/cm3 Zr702 (99.2%+ pure)  \nMade of solid 100% Titanium, Woerden chopsticks are durable, eco-friendly and hygienic!\nTraditional wooden chopsticks can harm our environment and our bodies. It takes one aspen tree just to make a few thousand disposable chopsticks. Each year we lose thousands of acres to deforestation just from these disposable chopsticks!\nOver 70 billion pairs of chopsticks are consumed around the world each year, which needs to cut 14 million aspens and results in a deforestation of more than 9300 acres!\nNot only do disposable chopsticks result in deforestation, they harbor bacteria in microscopic crevices. Plastic or rubber chopsticks will produce harmful substances to human body over time. Steel chopsticks can make some people allergic and have an unpleasant metal smell and taste.\nBeing magnified 100x you can clearly see where bacteria can hide in all wooden chopsticks\nWe're solving all of these problems with the most durable, eco-friendly and hygienic chopsticks CNC milled from a single piece of solid 100% Grade 1 (CP1) Titanium! CP1 is the purest form of Titanium that is the most resistant to corrosion.\nSolid 100% Titanium chopsticks with simple, elegant design.\nPure titanium bowl available as an add-on.

Highly-polished by hand. Aesthetically pleasing to look at.\nThe cubic design of the tops prevents chopsticks from rolling away while the tips are cylindrical design, which integrates the ancient ideas of orbicular sky and rectangular Earth. \nJapanese style tips make them easier to pick up even small amounts of food, for example, picking out the fish bones and peppercorn.\nTwelve convex grooves make them more convenient for gripping dishes, or even heavy food.\nThe slim Japanese style design keeps your chopsticks\u2019 tip away from the table. Super hygienic.\nVery convenient. Can be cleaned in the dishwasher. \nWith the highest strength-to-density ratio, our chopsticks never warp or blend like wooden or plastic chopsticks.\n9 inches in length, 1.8 oz. A perfect weight for balance and offer a better more comfortable experience.  \nDaily Life Testing\nBe proud of yourself for using chopsticks and enjoy noodles perfectly and securely without worry that noodles will slip.\nOur chopsticks offer a appropriate gripping force which will lock onto the food you are trying to pick up. A beautiful addition to your dining set! Perfect for everyday use.\n A perfect match with our titanium sushi plate.\nOur solid Titanium chopsticks will get noticed when you are eating in public. Take your clean Titanium chopsticks with you anytime and anywhere, and no need to worry the dirty tableware restaurants provide.\nEnjoy barbecue with our super hygienic Titanium chopsticks.

Originating from China, they began to spread to Japan and Korea by 500 A.D. So far, chopsticks are becoming popular utensils in restaurants and hotels across the globe.\nNowadays, chopsticks serve many new functions besides tableware. For example, you can buy a pair as a gift to your friends and relatives. In Chinese, it reads 'Kuaizi', which means to have sons soon, so a newly-married couple are happy to receive it as their wedding gift. \nChopsticks are adored and used around the world. A recent experiment shows that many joints and muscles are being exercised, improving your dexterity over time. They certainly make you cleverer, don't they?\nPledge now and help us bring the solid 100% Titanium chopsticks to life!\nThank you to BackerPoints for supporting our campaign, they are awesome!", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Join the Woerden family", "descp": "Get a free gift for your support and stay updated with everything Woerden!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "pair of SolidTi Chopsticks EARLY BIRD", "descp": "CNC milled from a single piece of solid 100% titanium, our solid 100% Titanium chopsticks are highly-polished by hand for the premium version with Japanese style tips.

These coins are an extremely high quality mint and are akin to a traditional military challenge coin.\nRat's Ass coin: Each Rat's Ass is 1.073\" in diameter, and .080\" thick. They are noticeably larger, thicker, and significantly heavier than a US Quarter.

For one reason or another, these coins didn't pass our initial quality inspection. They might have scratches, dents, dings, or marks. They might be perfect too. It's a mixed bag. In any event, we'd rather see them put to good use rather than just scrap them.\nCoin Materials/Metals\n100% Designed and Manufactured in the USA!\n   Decision Maker (Gold) - Proprietary Blend\nThis blend is a solid brass alloy, formulated to look like 18KT gold. Aside from it's durability and weight, this alloy reproduces the finest detail. After minting, each coin is individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\nDecision Maker (Bronze) - Proprietary Blend\nThis blend is the same brass alloy used in the gold version, but is then chemically aged to build up a rich oxidized coating giving it the bronze finish. Upon completion, each coin is also individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\nDecision Maker (Silver) - Nickel-Silver\nNickel-Silver is a heavyweight alloy that is is bright silver in color, scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.\nRat's Ass - Nickel-Silver\nNickel-Silver is a heavyweight alloy that is is bright silver in color, scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.\nHoliday Delivery\nNothing Says \"Season's Greetings\" like a close up of a rat's anus\n  Punctuality is important to us! If you are a previous customer, or previous backer, you know we always deliver! Just look at our previous project, we actually delivered ahead of schedule.\nEach side of the Decision Maker is marked with a ZFG (Zero Fucks Given) \"H\" for heads, and \"T\" for tails\n  We plan to have ALL REWARDS shipped in time for X-mas! (for US/Domestic orders)\nOur estimated Ship date is December 15th.\nShipping generally takes 3-4 days for US/Domestic orders, so we estimate that you should receive your rewards (in the US) by December 20th. This IS NOT a guarantee, but it is the most likely scenario.\nInternational orders, we CANNOT promise delivery in time for X-mas. Most transit times take about 10-days, and that does not include any delays with customs, which there usual are. Because of this, it is highly unlikely any International shipments will arrive before December 25th.\nShare Our Project\nThe more you share our project by posting it on Facebook, tweeting about it, emailing it, sharing on Reddit etc. the more likely it is we'll be able to unlock all the stretch goals and give you some free coins.\nSo if you're in a good fucking mood, and like what you see, please help us spread the word!

Every drink makes the theories in question more daring, the counter theories bolder and the data increasingly questionable. \nJoin university and live the discussion and don\u2019t forget the first rule of every debate: Debatable!\nIn Quod Erat Disputandum (QED) you play as a student at university. During the day you run across campus attending lectures, study in the library or go shopping in the second hand shop. In the evening you engage in spirited debate with your opponents by presenting your theories, counter theories, and data! The winner spends the evening celebrating while their opponent goes home early, rested and ready to get revenge the next day. \nDesigned by He Does Not Throw Dice, It plays in 45 minutes and suits 2 or 4 players. The game board will be different every time you play giving QED an especially high longevity. Rules will be in English.\n\nDing & Dent Essen Review from minute 14.20\n    In QED you play a student who wants to win discussions against his colleagues. You have to manage your time and money carefully during the day at campus to make sure you get to have the best arguments in front of a cold beverage at night.\nThe game continues until one player has won three discussions. Each round is structured into two phases: The Study Phase, that takes place during the day, and the Debate Phase, during the night.\n  During the Study Phase you move around a modular board consisting of 9 different locations, each of them is connected by streets of different lengths. You decide if you want to spend your hard earned cash on a bus ticket or spend your time strolling from location to location. \nOnce you reach a location you can use the action it provides by paying its costs in money, time or food. Different locations will provide you with various abilities from getting money to acquire new theories to use in your debates. Each student moves and takes one action after the other until everyone has passed because they run out of time and went to the bar.\n    During the Debate Phase, everyone gathers their theories, counter theories, and data and heads to the bar to debate with the other students! In pairs of two they use the resources collected during the Study phase to earn the right to be right. Each player selects one card from their hand to play face down. This is called an argument.\nBoth players reveal their cards at the same time and check who won the engagement. Theory beats Data, Data beats Counter Theory and Counter Theory beats Theory. Additionally, students can play equipment cards and special debate cards collected during the Day Phase to strengthen their arguments. The card that wins triggers its special ability. In case of a tie, both cards trigger. Draw up to your hand card limit and repeat. The first person who can\u2019t play a card loses the debate.\n  Quod Erat Disputandum is a resource management and fighting game which is all about the daily life of students: Getting up in the morning, listening to professors in the auditorium, shopping for fancy underwear in the second hand shop and financing everything by \u201cdonating\u201d blood.

The Draxian universe is far and wide. There will be a total of 4 expansions. Each will develop the universe and add a new element of game play. Jimmy has written a full RPG based on Draxia, and outlined the topography and world history. There are other game genres under development that will be based in the Draxian Universe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are you turning to Kickstarter?\n\nKickstarter was a great starting point for us in 2015. That kickoff allowed us to manufacture 1000 first edition games which sold out in less than a year. The exposure created the nucleus of our very supportive Community, and has brought us back to where we started for this expansion. Kickstarter makes it possible for us to reach around the world.\n\n\n\n\nWhat will the money contribute to?\n\nThe proceeds will go towards manufacturing costs for the expansion game and promotional rewards.

It's 2017, and all the travel adapters on the market are still equipped with a single-use fuse that was invented in the 19th century.\nAs a result, every time you go on a travel, there's a high chance that your travel adapter will fail because of the single-use fuse, and you could be one of the reviewers above. That's why we built Passport.\nWhen we began to work on this project two years ago, we simply wanted to resolve the single-use fuse problem so people don't need to worry about charging their devices while traveling.\nAs our project went on, we found many other problems of the current travel adapters on the market, such as child safety issues, not enough USB outputs, and awkward two-handed operation. So we ended up making a truly worry-free ultimate universal travel adapter and charger. \nAuto-resetting fuses are commonly seen in the aerospace industry, but it\u2019s never applied in travel adapters before due to cost and size.\nIt took us a long time and hundreds of experiments to finally be able to customize the perfect auto-resetting fuse at the right cost and size for our product.\nPassport\u2019s use of auto-resetting technology allows the device to recover from an overload on its own within just one minute, making it electronically unbreakable, and the most resilient travel adapter ever.\nIt\u2019s actually a mini switch with a built-in Bimetallic Thermal Sensor. It consists of two thermally different metals stuck together back to back. When it is cold the contacts are closed and current passes through the switch. When it gets hot, one metal expands more than the other and the bonded bi-metallic strip bends up, opening the contacts and preventing the current from flowing. The fuse can stand up to 10,000 reset cycles.\nThanks to its built-in all-in-one plugs and the universal AC output, Passport can work seamlessly in over 150 countries worldwide.\n  Passport can plug into type A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, N and O outlets.\nPassport can accept type A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, L and N plugs.    \n          According our research, most travel adapters on the market are not CE EMC certified for their USB charging electronics. Such devices can put out electromagnetic radiation that causes flickering screen or unstable behavior of your devices.\n          Note: images in the chart are to scale.\n      From the beginning, we wanted to design something that's world-class. So we partnered with Y Studios, an award-winning design firm based in San Francisco. They have won numerous Red Dot, iF, and Good Design awards in the past and have worked with several esteemed clients, including Microsoft, Activision, TiVo, Sphero, and Sonos. They worked closely with our team in East Palo Alto, California, and China for nearly two years.\nTwo years may seem like a long time to develop a product like this, but it was a matter of answering several complicated questions: how to fit so many components in such a small body, how to reinvent the something that has existed for decades and make it better, how to find the best auto-resetting fuse at the right size and cost, how to design it so it looks great. The fruits of this process are several pending patents and a unique structure that's second to none.\n      Dimensions: 2.24\u201d x 2.8\u201d x 2.5\u201d/57mm x 72mm x 64mm  \nWeight: 5.6oz/159g  \nUSB Output: 2.4A/12W Max per port, 5A/25W Total with ZEN+\nAC Input: 100-250V/AC 50/60Hz\nAC Output: 6A Max (600W at 100V or 1500W at 250V) \nNote: Passport doesn't convert voltage.

We have been blown away by the reviews and comments that customers have given us about our aluminum dice sets and have taken their feedback into consideration.\nOne of the biggest requests we\u2019ve had is for an entry-level dice set that is more affordable than our metal dice, yet still made without compromise. After a bit of research and tinkering, we\u2019ve come up with precision-crafted PMMA dice that we think you will love.\nOne of the biggest requests we\u2019ve had is for an entry-level dice set that is more affordable than our metal dice, yet still made without compromise. After a bit of research and tinkering, we\u2019ve come up with precision-crafted PMMA dice that we think you will love.\nThe Anatomy of a Perfect Dice\nOur Gravity Dice\u2122 have been designed to not only be as precise as possible in their manufacturing but also to change the way dice roll to make them more enjoyable, more random and completely unique. Each angle, corner, and chamfer was analyzed and reconfigured during weeks of testing.\nWhy We Use PMMA\nPMMA, also called acrylic glass, has a high surface hardness, meaning it is very scratch resistant. It is also easily machined, easily cleaned, and lightweight. PMMA is also fully recyclable (although we know you\u2019d never throw your awesome dice away!).\nWith a precision of less than 100 microns and engineered to enhance your random roll mechanics, these PMMA dice are simply amazing.\n Our Polyhedral Dice Set\nWe are offering a full set of polyhedral dice which includes 7 Dice: D20, D12, D10, D10%, D8, D6, and a D4. Each of our dice will have the numbers formed into the dice and will then be color-filled to help maintain the perfect balance.\nPolyhedral sizes are as follows: \nThe D20 measures 20 mm from face to face (FF) and 21.98 mm at its peak. The D12 is slightly smaller at 18 mm FF, the D10 and D10% measure 18 mm Point to Point (PP), the D8 is also 18 mm PP, the D6 is 16 mm FF and the D4 is 16 mm PP.\n Our first available colors: Translucent Red, Translucent Smoke, Translucent Blue, Translucent Teal, and Translucent Purple. As we reach our stretch goals we will unlock new colors and options, such as:\nLED Dragon Forged Dice Vault:\nThe Light-Up Dragon Case will be in a solid color with translucent dice to match and will come with white LEDs and replaceable batteries.\nVault Specifications:Inner plastic tube casing: Height: 6.25,\" Diameter: 1.25\"\n\nThe vault can hold up to 9 dice, depending on the size and shape of the dice. It comfortably fits our set of 7 polyhedral dice or 9 D6s.\nD6 Sets\nWe took our famous Aluminum Gravity Dice and made them in PMMA just like the Polyhedral Sets. Each dice has a perfect center of gravity as well as mathematically calculated perfect random rolls. Each dice has the pip numbers at different depths and inked in either silver or gold dots.  We are offering a 6 Set for $12, a 12 Set for $20 and the Mega 36 Set for just $35.  You can also add these to your existing pledge amount if you want more than just D6's. \nRenders of some color options\nD6 Color options:\nD6s with pips: Translucent Red, Blue, Green, and Smoke or Solid White, Black and Purple. \n\nD6s with numbers: \nTranslucent colors: Red, Smoke, Blue, Green, Teal, and Purple\nSolid colors: Black, Red, Blue, Green, Purple, and White\n\nStretch Goals\nInitial funding goal: $10,000 \nThe dice vault will be in the solid colors (Black, Blue, Teal, Red, Purple, and Green) and will light up with three LEDs and use two cr2032 batteries.

It's fun, addicting, easy-to-learn, and while you're playing, you discover how computers work.\nI'm all about teaching kids to code. When I was a professor at the University of Minnesota, I saw how valuable it is for all students to be coders. I have three young kids and I've tried all sorts of games to build their interest in coding. The problem is that they all treat computers like abstract, black boxes. They overlook the fundamental, most amazing concept: how simple switches, connected together in clever ways, can do incredibly smart things.\nKids learn best when they use their senses to explore concepts. Turing Tumble is the only game that lets kids see and feel how computers work. The logic isn\u2019t hidden inside a computer chip \u2013 it\u2019s all right there in front of them. It builds logic and critical thinking skills, fundamental coding concepts, and grounds their understanding of computers. \nAnd adults, this game is not just for kids! \nIt's a game unlike any you've ever played. It takes creative thinking to come up with a solution to each puzzle - you can't just stumble across the solution by trial and error - and it's extremely gratifying to build it and watch it work. Even if you're an expert programmer, I guarantee you'll find the latter puzzles a challenge.\nThe Game\n Turing Tumble comes with 105 parts:  \n1 game board\n1 game board stand\n30 ramps\n10 bits  \n8 gear bits  \n6 crossovers  \n4 gears  \n3 interceptors  \n1 presser \n20 red marbles\n20 blue marbles  \n1 puzzle book\nTuring Tumble has 105 parts in all\nHow it works\nThe game board releases one marble at a time from the top. Each marble falls down the board and when it reaches the bottom, it pushes down one of two black flippers at the bottom that release another ball. If it pushes down the left flipper, a blue ball is released. If it pushes down the right flipper, a red ball is released.\nPlayers add logic by putting 6 different types of parts onto the board:\nThe ramp directs balls in one direction, either to the left or to the right.\nThe \"ramp\"\nThe crossover lets ball paths cross over one another. Balls come in one side and exit on the opposite side.\nThe \"crossover\"\nThe bit adds logic. It stores information by pointing to the right or to the left, like a 1 or 0. It becomes more and more important as the puzzles progress.\nThe \"bit\"\nWhen the computer\u2019s objective is complete, the interceptor is used to stop the computer from releasing any more balls.\nThe \"interceptor\"\nLike the bit, the gear bit stores information by pointing right or left, but when the gear bit is flipped, it also turns other gear bits connected to it by gears. \nThe \"gear bit\" and \"gear\"\nThe gear bits are mind-bending, but they add a whole new level of functionality to the board. They also make the computer \"Turing complete\", which means that if the board was big enough, it could do anything a regular computer could do!\nTuring Tumble comes with a book of 51 puzzles. They start out easy and become steadily more challenging. Each puzzle leads the player to discover new concepts that can be applied to more complicated puzzles later on. The puzzles are woven into a 20-page comic story, beautifully illustrated by Jiaoyang Li, where each puzzle brings Alia the space engineer closer to rescue from a seemingly deserted planet. Jiaoyang is a senior at the University of Minnesota, majoring in both art and computer science. This will hopefully be her first published artwork. \n\"I've had the chance to preview the material with my 8 and 10 year old children and they loved the story-based approach. The graphics are very high quality and the story is fast-paced and engaging. The puzzles do a great job of showing how you can build complex systems from simple building blocks.\" -- Dr Tracy Gardner, Director Tech Age Kids\nHow to Play\nThe goal of each puzzle is to build a computer that completes an objective. For example, here's challenge #1:\nChallenge #1\nThe objective of this puzzle is to make all of the blue balls (and only the blue balls) reach the end.\nYou begin by building the starting setup. \nPuzzle 1 starting setup\nYour job is to figure out where to put the parts listed under \"Add to board\" in order to complete the objective. It tells you to add four green ramps to the board...but where? Here's what happens when you run it with just the starting setup:\nPLAY\n\nWithout those four green ramps, it doesn't work at all - there's nothing to catch balls coming off the third ramp down, so they fall freely and bounce all over the place. And it doesn't complete the objective, since sometimes red balls reach the end, too.\nCan you think of the solution?\nTo solve this puzzle, place the four ramps in such a way that they complete the path from the top of the board to the bottom of the board. \nHere it is running:\nPLAY\n\nWay to go!\nWhat Kinds of Things Can It Do?\nThe Turing Tumble mechanical computer can do all sorts of things. It can:\ncount\nadd\nsubtract\nmultiply\ndivide\ncompare numbers\nit can do logic\nit can create patterns  \n\u2026and much more \nHere are a few examples...\nExample 1:\nThis computer is the solution to puzzle 11, where the objective is to create a computer that generates the pattern: blue, blue, red, red, blue, blue, red, red\u2026\nPLAY\n\nExample 2:\nWhen you reach puzzle 19, binary numbers are introduced into the puzzles. In the following picture, a number is represented by four bits. To read the number from the bits, all you have to know is that the top bit is worth 1, the second bit down is worth 2, the third bit is worth 4, and the fourth bit is worth 8. Simply add together the values of the bits that are pointed right. For example,\nThe numbers 0 through 8 are shown in binary. To read them, add the value of the bits pointed right.\nNow, here\u2019s a computer that counts up to 8 in binary. You can ignore the other parts, just watch those four bits.\nPLAY\n\nExample 3:\nHere's one of the more difficult puzzles. The goal of this puzzle is to create a pattern that starts with a group of 2 blue balls, then a group of 4 blue balls, and then a group of 8 blue balls, with each group separated by a single red ball.\nPLAY\n\nStretch goals\nStretch goal #1 ($150,000 - reached!): We\u2019ve heard from many of you that with kids at home or in classrooms, it's important to be able to glance at the box and see that all the pieces are accounted for. If total funding reaches $150,000, we'll upgrade the box insert to a vacuum molded insert with shaped holes for the individual parts. \nStretch goal #2 ($200,000 - reached!): We think it's important that the Turing Tumble box is sturdy enough to stand up to repeated use. Both at home and in a classroom setting. If total funding reaches $200,000, we will upgrade the box to a premium design with a magnetic latch, and we'll make it out of thicker cardboard. \nStretch goal #3 ($250,000 - reached!): Sometimes you just need a little extra help. We'll put hints to each of the puzzles online. This is in addition to the solutions that are already in the back of the book.\nStretch goal #4 ($300,000 - reached!): Four extra red balls and four extra blue balls in every copy. By now, we've probably got a full set of balls hiding under our fridge. And our couch.\nStretch goal #5 ($350,000 - reached!): Stand upgrade! We'll give the stand adjustable tilt so you can speed up or slow down your computer. Might need to add a CPU cooling fan if you get it going too fast. :)\nStretch goal #6 ($400,000): This is the big one. Can we reach it? If we can hit this stretch goal, I'll create *9* more puzzles \u2013 up to 60! We'll also make an educator\u2019s version of the puzzle book online, and we'll create a website where you can share your own puzzles/creations.\nInternational Shipping\nGood news! We have enough backers that we can import Turing Tumble into several countries and pay customs fees ourselves. Check the FAQ to see a list of the countries that will not have to pay VAT. \nThe cost of international shipping is reduced by $10 for our international backers (excluding Canada)! See this update for more information.\nCreating Turing Tumble\nI spent a good part of the last two years designing Turing Tumble. I started by attempting to make it something like a board game version of the wonderful browser-based game, Manufactoria, where you build Turing machines to sort objects and create patterns. It wasn\u2019t long before I ran into the same problem other programming board games have\u2014if your program has more than a few instructions, it becomes a long, tedious process to run it by hand, and the person running it is prone to error\u2014especially because they\u2019re the one who made the program in the first place.\nI knew the game had to be able to run the programs itself, and that\u2019s when I started looking into mechanical computers. An old toy from the 1960\u2019s came up in my searches\u2014the Digi-Comp II. The Digi-Comp II was probably the first mechanical computer powered by marbles. It was a great place to start, but I still had a long way to go. It wasn\u2019t programmable, it wasn\u2019t Turing complete, and it wasn\u2019t a game. \nI began by creating a system where parts could be placed anywhere on the board to program the computer. The first part I created was the bit. I thought a simple T-shaped part (a) would do the trick, but I 3D printed it and found that it didn\u2019t. When it was angled at 45 degrees, the ball sat directly on top of its rotational axis, so there was no force to rotate the part. I played with the shape, size, weight, balance, and surface friction, and eventually arrived at a working design (g). However, when I altered the design to make it injection-mold-friendly and CNC milled it (h), it became too light and bouncy. A ball would flip it one way, and it would bounce right back the other way again. I made a few more adjustments and finally arrived at (i).\nDevelopment of the bit\nThe ramp was the next part I designed. I thought it would be easy, but a simple ramp (a, b) didn\u2019t work at all. If two or more ramps were placed in a row, balls got going too fast, and by the time they hit another part, they\u2019d bounce off the board. To slow the balls, I tried all sorts of things, but eventually arrived at a counterweight system (c) that carried through to the final version (f).\nDevelopment of the ramp\nThe crossover was another tricky part. At first, I tried to make it like a tube that took a ball over another part and back down on the other side (a). But since the only part that could fit behind it was the ramp, the next version had a ramp built in (b). It worked well enough, but it stuck too far out of the board, leaving no room for the gear bits. The next version was flat (c), then more reliable (d), and then injection-mold-friendly (e and f).\nDevelopment of the crossover\nI tried a few different approaches to make bits that could turn each other. Eventually I arrived at a design using gears. I found that the gear bits had to be balanced differently than the bits. Bits needed extra weight at the top of the part so that after it flipped it had some weight to keep it there. Gear bits, on the other hand, needed to be balanced because the extra weight on top became too much when, say, three gear bits were connected together. The later designs had equal weight on top and bottom.\nDevelopment of the gear bit\nThe interceptor was, as you might expect, the easiest part to make. The first was 3D printed (a), and the final version was CNC milled and compatible with injection molding (b).\nDevelopment of the interceptor\nThe game board also went through several iterations. At first, I 3D printed a test board with just 6 places to insert parts (a). As the parts evolved, the test board did, too. By the time I created test board (e), things were working well, so I designed a complete game board (f). I had it 3D printed elsewhere since my 3D printer wasn't nearly big enough. I used that game board a lot to continue improving the reliability of the parts and to do beta testing. Then I designed a final, injection-mold-friendly version and made it by CNC milling (g).\nDevelopment of the game board\nHow will the funding be used?\nThis game has a higher funding goal than most tabletop games because of the large number (and size) of plastic parts - it's sort of like a LEGO set, but without the massive quantities that would normally bring costs down. The injection molds for the 14 different plastic parts will require the majority of the funding goal. The rest of the funding will go to per-game costs for 75 plastic parts, 40 painted balls, 30 stainless steel counterweights, a 100+ page booklet, and packaging. A small fraction will be left for unforeseen costs.\nSpecial thanks for the wonderful articles!\nPopular Mechanics: This Brilliant Mechanical Computer Is Built for Gaming\nBoing Boing: Cool marble-powered mechanical computer to solve logic problems\nTechCrunch: The Turing Tumble lets you and your kids build real mechanical computers\nThe Mac Observer: Turing Tumble on Kickstarter Has Kids Building Mechanical Computers\nGeekDad: Kickstarter Alert: Program a Mechanical Computer With \u2018Turing Tumble\u2019\nTech Age Kids: Turing Tumble: Gaming on a Mechanical Computer\nThe Toy Insider: Turing Tumble Has Potential to Create a Coder in Everyone\nEngaged Family Gaming: Kickstarter Preview: Turing Tumble\nThe Laughing Squid: The Turing Tumble, A DIY Mechanical Computer Powered by Marbles That Solve Puzzles of Logic", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBesides some cosmetics, the game is fully designed, so there is relatively little risk. The change to injection mold manufacturing introduces some risk. Though the parts are already designed to be compatible with injection molding, it may be that the when parts are made with this new process, they have a different balance or need to otherwise be adjusted to meet tolerance requirements. These types of things could cause delay or additional cost, but of course as a Kickstarter backer, the additional cost would not be passed on to you.\n\nIf the project is fully backed here on Kickstarter, we will likely work with Panda Game Manufacturing to create the first production run (for everything except the injection molded parts).

The industrial smog is choking the city to death but there is nothing its citizens can do about it. The Royal Company controls what comes in, what goes out, and all the people that live within. What's strange is that nobody seems to remember when they came to power or how they stay in power, for that matter. \nHowever, a few key citizens with extraordinary talents in the art of lock picking have just received a series of strange lock boxes inviting them to a mysterious location near The Station. This group of individuals come from all walks of life and social tiers, drawn together for some unknown purpose by a masked stranger. \nThis is Triplock, the latest game from acclaimed designers Josh and Adam Carlson and Chip Theory Games. This heavily themed abstract game will have you wracking your brain to solve locks faster than your opponent. Play 1 vs 1 against another lock breaker, or take on The Station in a series of 4 solo challenges as you begin to unravel the mysteries of New London. Play vanilla rules for a completely level playing field, or take on the role of one of four unique personas to add new strategic depth and theme to each game.  \n    The Rules\nHere is a web optimized version of the Triplock Rulebook 1.0.  \n Triplock can be learned in minutes. Players compete to solve the Master Lock first or before time runs out! In competitive play, solving the Master Lock means being first to complete 5 Diagrams or acquire 10 pts.\n\nWhen going Solo, you must select which characters you will be bringing into the depths of The Station and with each Room you encounter, you will need to select the best lock breaker for the job. Every Room is different, some are on timers, while others have Station opponents! Solve all the Rooms before running out of characters to win. \nTurn Sequence\nIn Triplock, your turn gives you the chance to use your Skill and roll your Action dice. That's the easy part. What you do with those dice is where it gets interesting as you have two options: Take the two Actions you rolled and perform one or both of them. Or, forgo both results to choose any 1 Action. \nRemember, your objective is to manipulate the Master Lock to complete Diagrams by discovering and matching specific Mechanisms per your Diagram's instructions/orientation. Solving your Diagrams can award you points, further Actions, even new Diagrams. \nThere are many lines of play a person can take - but your opponent is doing the same and is manipulating the Master Lock as well! You will want to use Traps and Counter Measures to stall and befuddle your opponent while you make the necessary adjustments needed to reach your goal (10 pts or 5 Diagrams) to solve the Master Lock! \nCheck out this quick overview of the components and how they all fit together: \nDiagrams\nWhen Diagrams are drawn, an orientation must be selected. It is then placed face down in front of you. Each player is allowed 3 Diagrams at one time and cannot see what the other has chosen unless they use an Action to Reveal the Diagram.\nDiagram Card\nEach player starts with one Diagram and may draw more throughout the game by using a specific Action to do so, or by completing a Diagram that tells you to draw a new Diagram. Each Diagram has 4 orientations you may choose from, each with a variety of symbols showing and also the method required to solve it (Trip, Combo, Collect).  By manipulating the Master Lock using your Skills and Actions, you\u2019ll attempt to identify and line up Mechanisms in various patterns to match your Diagram. Bigger groups of Mechanisms will earn you more points. Be careful though, going for aggressive Diagram orientations will take longer to complete!  \nTraps and Counter Measures\nTraps and Counter Measures are also Diagrams, but are used specifically against your opponent. Traps stay hidden just like a normal Diagram and are revealed when they are Triggered. Counter Measures always stay face up and can be an ongoing source of Points, however, you cannot \"Complete\" a Counter Measure. It's always there, taking up one of your 3 spots. You will need to use them wisely!\n      Triplock is designed, out of the box, with a strong solo component. This is not something tacked on after the fact to add artificial value. The game comes with 4 solo challenges and a storyline to follow right out of the gate. Once you\u2019ve completed the entire location (The Station), revisit it with our Challenge Mode to increase difficulty. Still too easy? Become a Master Lock Breaker and attempt to complete the game without failing a lock! Quick to setup and tear down, Triplock makes for a great travel solo experience. Also, as you will soon see...this is just the very first location of many.\nThe story follows a group of people from New London who, whether they realize it or not, have managed to become the best lock breakers in the city. They all hail from a different walk of life, but their paths are criss-cross in important ways. Solo play in Triplock will have you assembling a specific team and taking on The Station one room at a time.  \n                  If you've followed Chip Theory Games for any other campaigns, you already know what to expect. For those that are new here, let us explain how we operate. We believe many game companies don't spend enough money investing in, or time thinking about how components affect their games. We see components as more than just the tokens used to play a game. Premium components add immersion, top-level enjoyment, and durability to any game. Each of these are imperative, in our opinion. Combined with innovative mechanics and solid game play, it can change your entire experience for the better. \nEvery CTG game is designed with this in mind. We eschew traditional cardboard whenever possible and use neoprene mats, 11.5g premium custom-foiled chips, waterproof PVC cards, and HD print/heat-impressed dice. Our components, box inserts, and box itself have their own development timelines alongside the actual game. In our minds: \"Everything says something.\" The best game in a shoddy box = less than \"the best game\". Obviously, this attention to detail tends to come with a price tag. But, we are trying to buck that trend a bit with Triplock by offering amazing value and a very aggressive price savings for the game on Kickstarter. \nWe want you to feel great about your game the first time you crack it open, before you play it, while you play it, and after you've put it away. But achieving this goes beyond the game itself. Over the course of our previous four campaigns we've developed an industry-best reputation for communication with our backers and fans. We treat you how we'd want to be treated, period. This means sending out regular, timely, informative, and often entertaining Kickstarter updates to our backers. It also means staying OUT of the unreachable \"ivory tower\" and making ourselves contactable directly on social media, etc. \nIn addition to all of this, we're very active in the comments, BGG, facebook, Twitter, Discord, and anywhere else you might find us. We don't take a single one of your entertainment dollars for granted and want to make sure you're feeling excited, comfortable, and confident about your purchase every single step of the way. That's the Chip Theory Games experience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery new Kickstarter is an opportunity to improve on the last.

In it, players take on the role of a starship captain stranded in hostile space. As captain, you'll be tasked with assigning crew member to various stations in order to deal with external threats like enemy spaceships, as well as internal threats like system malfunctions. \nOriginally starting as a print & play game, Deep Space D-6 released commercially in 2015 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Beautifully minimalistic and tightly designed, the small print run was quickly consumed by avid gamers of all types and stock has been scarce ever since. \nIt's time to return to the deepest of deep space! Whether you are an accomplished D-6 Captain or have never tried a solitaire board game before, I'm glad to have you aboard! Now is your chance to get a hold of Deep Space D-6 with a revised rulebook. In addition, there is a new mini expansion that brings a new threat to the galaxy. This is a rescue mission and we'll need all the help we can get. \n          What's new in the reissue? \nThis is a straight reprint (not a 2nd edition). The first Kickstarter unlocked a wealth of enhancements and the box is at max capacity. As such, there will be no stretch goals and only minor changes from the first printing. The components are largely identical with the following revisions:\nRevised Rulebook - added some card clarifications\nHull and Shield cubes now have rounded corners\nOuroboros gameplay text has been modified\nRead more about the changes here.\nNew RPG game mode:\nClick the image to learn more.\n  The Long Way Home is an optional roleplaying supplement for DSD-6 that will be made available for free to all backers in the months following delivery of the game. A professionally printed version may happen in the future, but will not be part of this campaign. \nEach turn in Deep Space D-6 you'll roll crew dice and assign them to stations to perform unique ship actions. There are 4 unique ships, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. \nYou can learn more about the game by visiting the original Kickstarter campaign here. \nHere are some videos made from the first printing:\n   Special thanks to all video contributors!\nWant to know more? Check out the original rulebook.\nOr try the Print & Play.\nMagnetic one-piece box\n4 Ship Boards\n6 custom 14mm crew dice, 1 standard threat die\nThreat Deck of 54 cards including the Ouroboros Boss Encounter  \n8mm plastic Hull and Shield tracker cubes\nRevised Rulebook\nInfirmary card\n  As with all my Kickstarters, you won't find crazy positive video reviews/previews or extensive marketing campaigns with stretch goals where I try to maximize funding by over promising. As an independent publisher, I believe in investing in a solid product, and not my ability to convince you to back it. The following videos are completely independent and have no affiliation with Tau Leader games. \nThis video nails my design intention regarding the interesting decisions and how they are less about the random dice rolls, and more about deftly managing threats and resources:\n  See more written and video reviews at BoardGameGeek.com\nFound this cool piece on reddit: I'm really surprised how well designed Deep Space D-6 is\nCalling all captains! A new threat has been detected. We don't know where they came from or what they want, but their numbers never seem to end.\nnon-final artwork\nTo defeat this new threat you'll have to perform overkill effects or be prepared to be overwhelmed by rapidly deploying enemy fleets. The Endless feed off each other and the more of them on the board, the more dangerous they become. Lucky for you, we've got ship upgrades available to help you overcome this radical new threat. \nThe Endless Expansion, available for the first time through this Kickstarter consist of:\n54 new cards including external threats, internal threats, ship upgrades, and a new final encounter.\nReplacement Ouroboros cards to bring the 1st edition inline with the 2nd printing.\nNote: You do not mix this new expansion with the base game cards. This new mini-expansion plays on it's own but requires the base game. However, the upgrades can be used with the original threat deck. Fully compatible with all 4 ships. Yes, it fits in the base game box.\nThe nice thing about this campaign is that shipping is no longer a mystery. Final box dimensions and weight have been predetermined. Shipping for this project is a subsidized rate of the actual shipping costs I was charged from the original Kickstarter campaign fulfillment. \nTo see the shipping rates, click on the pledge tier you are interested in and it will display the different costs based on your region. \nGames will be shipped through fulfillment centers primarily in China, the EU, and the US. This reduces custom fees and VAT. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies and/or any number of expansions for the listed pledge price. There is no extra shipping charge.\nPlease note: There is an error in the Fleet Commander pledge. The estimated delivery is not November 2017. Estimated delivery for Fleet Commander pledge is December 2017, just like the rest of the pledges. \n  Tony is a visual designer and UX specialist currently residing in New York.

But try watching something on your mobile device without holding it. Go on, try now. Lean it, balance it, wedge it. Nope? Those slippery blighters just won\u2019t stand up. So there it lies, flat on the table, projecting its wonders towards your ceiling. \nNow imagine taking from your wallet an ultra thin, ultra tough device, which let\u2019s your mobile or tablet stand on its own two feet. Imagine no longer, oh brave new world.  \nDiscover the Standeazy Ultra.\nDesigned and made in Britain.\nThe Standeazy Ultra is manufactured from a premium quality laminate of brushed aluminium and polypropylene, and easily folds into a 3D stand for virtually all smartphones, e-readers and most tablets, too. \nIt can be adjusted to hold your device at a variety of angles in both landscape or portrait depending on what you prefer for each app.\nTo give your phone or tablet a safe place to rest, the Standeazy Ultra has pleasingly smooth rounded edges, giving it an extra luxurious feel. It really is beautifully finished, just as slick as the slickest electronic device in your collection.\nYou'll want to stroke it, own it or buy it for your loved ones. It's a perfect stocking filler or little thank you gift \u2013 easy to post in an envelope. It\u2019s just one of those simple ideas that really works and actually solves a problem.\nA note on the hinges: German RWT\u00dcV testing of the material has shown that the hinge application is unimpaired even after 80,000 bends.\nThinner than a penny!\nOnly 7g light and 1.2mm thin, the size of a credit card \u2013 ultra portable!\nThere's a different angle for everything! Great for watching things or taking pictures \u2013 no matter which phone you use \u2013 Android or Apple devices, no adapters required!\nThe Standeazy Ultra has a variety of settings to make it super versatile for both Apple and Android phones and tablets.\nThe polymer version of Standeazy has been around for a few years now and is not just a concept, but a tested and proven product our customers love and use every day \u2013 at home, at work and of course when travelling. That's why we feel the Ultra will be a great addition to your travel and home accessories \u2013 and with your help we can bring it to market at an affordable price whilst producing it locally. \nOne of our highlights was being selected by the the Gadget Show on Channel 5 as the product of choice for holding the iPhone 6 and the HTC smartphone in an Android vs Apple comparison feature.\nAndroid vs Apple comparison on national TV... proudly supported by Standeazy!\nHere are some of the reviews we've had for our original Standeazy, the polymer version, on Amazon. We thought we'd share this because it has the same mechanism, but the Ultra is obviously stronger and can hold even more devices...\n And some reviews from the tech press...\nA super convenient way for hands-free selfie photography. Set up your phone in one of the different angles. Position the family. Use your Apple Watch remote app to check and set the timer. Say CHEESE!\nWe are based in the UK so Kickstarter will show our prices in GBP. We've also shown rough equivalent prices in USD, however these may not match the exact amount charged.\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n         John, Petra, Regine and Steven. It's a family affair.\nBack in 2009, John and Steven Wilber (father and son) designed and engineered a credit card sized stand \u2013 and after many iterations of mechanisms, materials and finishes, the first Standeazy was born in the form of a polypropylene design with two unique hind legs for extra stability. \nThis created the basis for the Standeazy you see today. The next few years saw various improvements to the design and material of Standeazy and we patented the initial and follow-on designs. In 2014 we launched the second generation polymer model that is available in selected shops. Our ambition has always been to create an extra versatile version for heavier or larger devices whilst keeping Standeazy small enough to fit in a wallet. That's why we started work on the prototypes for a metal version, the Standeazy Ultra. \nOur Kickstarter Live Cast\nTimeline\nA note on the time line. You may think 'what's taken them so long to launch this'... but since the conception of the idea of a metal phone stand, we scrutinised every little element of the design and later the production method to find the perfect combination of design, functionality and cost. We worked with 3D printers on the hinges and looked at various ways to use progressive tooling for the production. These things take time...\nWe are proud to work with local manufacturers, which means the Standeazy is truly designed and made in Britain. \nWith your support we can produce the Standeazy Ultra at a price that's affordable for every smartphone owner. \nIt's fantastic to have you be part of our journey!

Another element of the cost is the low quantity charge for the specialist laminate we use. Larger volumes will add savings by purchasing directly from the manufacturer.\n\nJohn, our head of product development, is a professional manufacturing engineer and has worked extensively in previous projects with a colleague at a press tool company. A method of production has now been devised in conjunction with this company that will reduce the cost of manufacture significantly.\n\nWe have minimised the risks by thoroughly investigating potential manufacturing problems while developing the prototypes and we are working closely with our local partners to create the Standeazy Ultra with modern tooling designed for mass production.\n\nWe are glad to welcome you on this journey!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "1 x Standeazy Ultra {\u00a38/$10)", "descp": "Get your Standeazy Ultra.

That\u2019s a great question. The straight answer is that nobody\u2019s made anything like The White Box before, so we're not sure how many people want it. Kickstarter can answer that question.\nWe think The White Box will be big. But even if it's huge, we're not going to reach everyone in the 28 days this Kickstarter runs.

We think it's retail-friendly because:\nThe price is the price. The White Box is worth thirty bucks.

Just before the turn into the 20th century Irwin Biddle purchased the house and turned it into what he called an orphanage care facility. But his severe governorship of the orphanage made the home for lost children anything but a haven. A fire in 1939 nearly destroyed the Thornhill Mansion. All but 13 children escaped the blaze. It wasn't until 1956 that Arthur Holland, a mining tycoon, purchased the Thornhill and footed the bill for a full renovation. However, it became clear within weeks of moving his family into the Thornhill that the Victorian mansion was far from settled. Holland's personal account of his family's stay in the Thornhill tells of unexplained children's voices, the sounds of little feet running through the night, of moaning heard inside the walls, even of parts of the house shifting. After leaving the Thornhill, Holland declared, \"The place is a house of the dead. No sane person can live well within its walls.\"\n13 ghosts live in the Thornhill, victims of the devastating fire that happened so long ago. As a ghost hunter, you welcome the chance to stay in the ghostly orphanage. Will you be the one to finally put the children to rest? Or will the malevolent child spirits drive you insane?\nGhostly Children\nIn Children, a 3 Headed Giant game from Quirky Engine Entertainment for 2 to 4 players, you spend a night in the haunted Thornhill Mansion. Your goal: trap as many of the 13 child ghosts as possible by finding their toys and confronting them. To win, be the ghost hunter to trap the most child ghosts.\nPlayers lay out the Thornhill Mansion by placing room cards face up on the table. As players move throughout the rooms, they pick up and leave items, including toys, bewitched objects, and traps. The rooms of the mansion shift as players work their way around the house. Ghosts move along the spectral vortex, marked in ghostly arrows through the rooms. When you encounter a child ghost, pray that you have his or her beloved toy. Otherwise, the results can be \u2026 well \u2026 petrifying.\nChildren comes with the following components:\n68 Children Cards\n13 Ghost Cards\n13 Toy Cards\n18 Mansion Cards\n4 Player Pawns\n12 Skull Tokens\n1 Kitty Kitty Token\nIn Children the game, you wander around the Thornhill Mansion trying to trap ghosts.\nAt the beginning of the game, you deal the 13 Ghosts deck face down off to the side on the table. You then deal the 13 Toys cards face up over the 13 Ghosts cards, creating 13 2-card stacks. Each player gets 5 cards (the hand limit at the beginning of the game) from the Children deck.\n13 Children 2-card Stacks\nPlayers collectively build the Thornhill Mansion during their turns by placing room cards face up on the table in a grid pattern. The mansion is built in 4 levels--basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, and 3rd floor. Each room card indicates on which floor it must be placed.\nPlayers Build the Thornhill Mansion\nYou search for toys and helpful devices by moving your pawn from room to room throughout the mansion. Each time you enter a room, you draw a card and add it to your hand. With a 5-card hand limit, players are forced to leave cards in rooms by placing them facedown beneath room cards. Players may also leave traps beneath room cards. You look at left-behind cards when you enter rooms. Left-behind traps spring immediately. You may add other left-behind cards to your hand.\nYou place ghost cards into the mansion when they appear at the top of the draw pile. Ghost cards are placed face up beneath room cards so players can read ghosts' names and see the toy icons on the tops of the cards. \nTo trap ghosts you must have toy cards. Each ghost card is marked with a toy icon. If you are in a room with a ghost and you have its corresponding toy in your hand, you immediately trap the ghost and put it, along with the toy card, in front of you to keep score.\n When you trap a ghost, you must see if another ghost in the house becomes enraged. To do this, flip over the 2-card stack you made at the beginning of the game that corresponds with the toy you used to trap the ghost. If the revealed ghost is in the mansion, flip its card over to its enraged side. Every enraged ghost in the house reduces the hand limit by 1 card. If the hand limit reaches 0 cards, no players win. The ghosts take the game.\n  Each Mansion card represents 1 room. Place the room card face up on the table on its designated floor (written on the room card). When possible, you must place new room cards adjacent to already in-play room cards, such as playing a 2nd story room next to an already in-play second story room or below an already in-play 3rd story room.\n  Each ghost card is marked with a child's photograph, the child's name, and the toy required to trap the child. The 13 Ghosts cards are dealt facedown on the table at the beginning of the game.\nThe 13 Toys deck is used to establish which ghosts become enraged during the game. Each 13 Toys card features a photograph of one of the 13 toys that can be found in the Thornhill Mansion. The 13 Toys cards are dealt face up over the facedown 13 Ghosts cards to create 2-card stacks at the beginning of the game. When a ghost is trapped in the Thornhill Mansion, turn over the 2-card stack marked with the toy used to trap the ghost. The revealed ghost becomes enraged.\n  You will use the deck of 68 Children cards for the bulk of game play. The cards are divided into 5 categories: Ghost Cards, Toy Cards, Device Cards, Trap Cards, and Fate Cards.\nThe Ghost Deck\n13 unrequited child spirits haunt the Thornhill Mansion. Ghost cards in the Children deck represent these spirits. 13 unrequited child spirits haunt the Thornhill Mansion. Ghost cards in the Children deck represent these spirits. Each Ghost card is double-sided. One side represents the ghost's stable temperament. The other side represents its enraged temperament.\nGood and Angry Child Ghost\n Device Cards\nDevices can help make your night in the Thornhill Mansion easier. Using a device puts it out of the game. Discard Device cards after using them by placing them in a discard pile next to the Children card draw pile.\nDevice Card\n Trap Cards\nTraps make life more difficult for your opponents. You can set traps by leaving trap cards beneath room cards. But be careful, if you enter a room card that has a trap, even if you set it, it will spring on you.\nTrap Card\n Fate Cards\nSometimes fate deals a bitter blow. When you draw a Fate card from the Children card draw pile resolve its effect immediately then draw another card.\nFate Card\n   Want to know the details of how Children is played?

Unfortunately, they used to be hulking, complicated, expensive, and with limited functions. We\u2019ve been hearing about and experiencing the pain of setting up the difficult-to-use DIY 3D printer kit and being limited by the standard plug-and-play 3D printer. We are hoping to change that. So we came up with an idea: create an all-metal 3D printer, which is easy-to-use for beginners, expandable for makers, and truly affordable for everyone.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Snapmaker to be all-metal and all-in-one.\nAfter many stages of analyzing the mechanical design and making prototypes, we\u2019ve developed the Snapmaker 3D Printer to provide an enjoyable user experience. Moreover, It's also a desktop makerspace, a combination of 3D printer, laser engraver, and CNC machine with interchangeable heads. We can't wait to share it with the Kickstarter community and have you help nurture this unique machine with us.\nSnapmaker is entirely made of metal, ensuring a high quality and reliable 3D printing experience. Along with a rock-solid aluminum alloys frame, all major components are CNC machined. It uses the precision acme lead screw as a drive mechanism to boost the precision and capacity. The all-metal build also translates into a premium industrial outlook.\nSnapmaker has an innovative modular design, which enables a flat-packed and low-cost shipping, quick assembly, strong expandability and manufacturing cost reduction. In particular, we designed a new type of linear module, which can be used in any of x, y, z direction and performs high precision linear motion.\nThe key to high precision is the combination of a streamlined structure, CNC precision parts, and an improved mechanical design. Snapmaker is capable of high quality printing with excellent details.\nPLAY\n\nA timelapsed video of Snapmaker 3D printing a vase (L 64.5 x W 64.5 x H 80.0mm). We used 1.75mm PLA filament and 0.2mm layer height. It took approximately 1 hour and 19 minutes.\nHigh resolution 3D printing is now an affordable reality with Snapmaker. It prints at a resolution as fine as a $1000 3D printer does, while at a fraction of the cost.\nSnapmaker comes with a very friendly newbie software experience in Snap3D. Simply drag and drop a print file onto it or add other print files to make multiple items at a time. Besides the Snap3D, you are free to use other slicer software that you prefer.\nWith movable and intuitive touchscreen, you can check and control various settings in your hand, such as homing, loading the filament, etc. The 3.2-inch color touchscreen enables you own a standalone 3D printer that is capable of handling your 3D printing workflow from start to finish.\nUnlike most traditional 3D printers, Snapmaker never needs leveling. The ingenious design ensures a completely level print platform. Simply set the Z-axis offset with a piece of paper and Snap3D, and then enjoy the 3D printing.\nNo more hassle of prying loose your print from the print bed! Snapmaker comes with a hassle-free and reusable platform sticker, offering better results than traditional blue painter\u2019s tape and glue sticks. Prints stick well on the printing sticker base and are easy to remove whencompleted.\nHave you ever tried to assemble a 3D printer in 10 minutes? With Snapmaker, now you can! It creates an easy setup of 10 parts in only 10 minutes. Do not hesitate, and try it yourself. It\u2019s cool!\nPLAY\n\nSnapmaker can be easily transformed into a laser engraver using the add-on 500mW laser module. You can laser engrave images and logos on wood, bamboo, leather, plastic, fabric, paper and other soft surfaces. Now, customize your wallets, coasters, leather iPad cases, jeans, and more!\nPLAY\n\n[A timelapsed video of carving the Superman logo on bamboo. It took approximately 1 hour.]\nYou can do CNC carving on wood, PCB and acrylic using the add-on CNC module (spindle speed: 2,000 - 7,000 RPM). The interchangeable modules equip you with more creative power from 3D printing to 3D carving. Instead of purchasing three machines costing around $500 per piece, now you can use one compact and reliable machine, saving your money and desktop space.\nIsn\u2019t it incredible! The Snapmaker 3D Printer surely will be a game changer. High quality, reliable, versatile, and affordable. To own an equivalent printer on the market would cost significantly more. But, now you can get it for a pledge that starts at only $199. Making all of this was a big challenge, a challenge we won by using all-metal & modular design and previous work experience in engineering and manufacturing.\nHow We Made It So Reliable?\nUse All-Metal Design\nWhen it comes to 3D printers, reliability is the issue that people care about the most. Snapmaker owes its reliability to an all-metal design. It uses a solid aluminum alloys construction, an all-metal hot end and precision acme lead screws, giving it precision print quality and consistent performance.\nIn general, higher strength and precision designs can be achieved with aluminum alloys. The body of the linear module is made of extruded aluminum alloys, making it extremely rigid and durable. It has over 10 times better tolerances than plastic, and also better performance than sheet metal. Regarding the motion system, we use lead screws instead of belts and pulleys to achieve higher accuracy and durability.\nHow We Made It So Versatile?\nUse Modular Design\nWe not only love 3D printing, but also have a great interest in a number of creative designs. In fact, there are lots of like-minded people who want to create more than 3D printing. We found that all 3D printer, laser engraver and cnc carving machine require a three-axis linear motion system to work. So we combined them into one machine that performs all functions.\nSnapmaker is built to be versatile from the very beginning we designed it. It is a compact desktop makerspace: a combination of 3D printer, laser engraver, and CNC carving machine. Its versatility is achieved by using interchangeable heads, modular connectors (RJ25 and RJ45 jacks), and modified firmware that enables three applications of 3D printing, laser engraving and CNC carving.\nHow We Made It So Affordable?\nWork Experience in Engineering & Manufacturing\nTo enhance product quality while reducing manufacturing costs at the same time, the usual method is to use dies and molds for mass production. It is exactly the way we made the all-metal Snapmaker affordable. Clearly, we can expect a lower cost per unit if we make them in higher volume. Meanwhile, we are able to sell our printers in high volume by hitting a very affordable price point.\nPLAY\n\nGenerally, making a die or mold is costly. We have been taking this issue under consideration throughout the design process and finally found a great solution: using modular design and designing all three linear modules (the most important and expensive parts) to be identical so that all of them can be made with the same dies. It not only cuts dies costs, but also allows for making linear modules in higher volume. Decreasing the overall manufacturing cost eventually enables us to offer the all-metal Snapmaker at a truly affordable price.\nBesides, we control manufacturing risks and costs by selecting popular 6061 and 6063 aluminum alloys raw materials. They not only have good mechanical properties but also are relatively easy to ensure a stable supply. Moreover, we use many common components in making Snapmaker, such as using 42 stepper motors and T8 acme lead screws.\nSnapmaker is a tech startup team based in Shenzhen & Walnut, CA. We are passionate engineers and designers with working experience in the fields of aviation, robotics and 3D printing. We enjoy creating products that can let you enjoy the innovative technologies in daily life. We\u2019ve been working hard to make the Snapmaker 3D Printer a reality. Moreover, there are numerous amazing partners we\u2019ve worked with for video filming, manufacturing, shipping, etc. We want to give a huge thanks to all supporters, backers and team members!\nProduct Development and Manufacturing\nDaniel has a unique vision of product design and strategy. Tinker and Otoko complete detailed design and communicate with suppliers. All the three of them are experienced engineers and responsible for the design, development and manufacturing of Snapmaker.\nWebsite, Community and Marketing\nDavid builds and maintains our website. Jade handles Snapmaker\u2019s community management, content operation, etc. Marx handles the market\u2019s research and outreach.\nSoftware and Electronics\nWalker works together with Noah to develop our slicer software Snap3D.

The mini tactical B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is designed with precision and detail that allows it to be extremely robust and versatile in every survival situation. \nWe wanted to design a quality miniature tactical pocket knife that can endure the toughest daily tasks and also small enough to carry without notice. In other words, we wanted an all around badass pocket knife that was fully concealable.\n                        Urban Military Concept: All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The B-2 Nano Blade is engineered to hold durability and functionality similar to military grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Halo Belt.\nBlade: The blade is split with a serrated teeth edge as well as a sharp edge. The sharp edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices whereas the teeth is perfect for tougher materials like wood. The B-2 Nano Blade uses the \"Great American Tooth\" pattern much like in traditional crosscut tree saws. The pattern was designed specifically to saw and rake wood fibers. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.\nThe B-2 Nano Blade cuts using the \"Great American Tooth\" pattern. Wood or other tough materials can be sawed and raked.\nThe non-serrated part of the blade or precision cut blade is flat ground. We were looking into both options during the design process and concluded that a flat ground blade would be more versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry. \nThe serrated part (teeth) of the blade, however, is a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry. \nAlthough the knife is very small, it was engineered to be very tactical. The versatility of both blade styles give it an advantage over every other small pocket knife.\nSizing: Discrete concealability is the definition of the B-2 Nano Blade. The full opened length is only 80mm and when closed, it stands at 48mm in length, 20mm in width (closed) and only 5mm thick. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice.\nWeight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 1oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife. \nThe B-2 Nano Blade is the smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife in the world.\nMaterials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Nano Blade is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Nano Blade can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.\nCasing Design: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife embodies a full redesign of the vintage SR288 stock casing. Originally, this discontinued casing was used for full-sized pocket knives ranging from 5 to 9 inches. The reason we have chosen this stock casing is because of its ease of use, comfort, and reliability in tactical use. Our redesign of the stock casing has given the body a tremendous upgrade in quality as well as addressed the original flaws that didn't make it a versatile knife. \nWe have upgraded the casing material to a heat treated 440C black stainless steel and shrunken the size dramatically to a miniature version similar to its older brother. In addition, we upgraded the blade material to 440C black stainless steel to achieve a 58-60HRC hardness scale. \nUpon doing so, we were able to add the Great American Tooth pattern for \"sawing\" tougher materials like wood. Staying true to its size proportionally, the thickness of the casing comes in at 5mm. Ultimately, with the entire redesign, we were able to increase the overall mobility, strengthen the tactical utility of use, make it fully concealable by size, while maintaining a very comfortable hold and improving the military/tactical aesthetics of the entire pocket knife. \nSafety as a priority - Snap Lock leaves zero wiggle room and prevents accidental closing when in use.\nFolding/Locking: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is both locking and folding. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button lock. You can actually use the spine to scrap splint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.\nWhen the B-2 Nano Blade opens, the lever \"SNAPS\" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open.\nWhile designing the B-2, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 to hit perfection.\nThe B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the world's smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife ever to be created by mankind.\n Minimal and Versatile\nRobust and Precise\n Functional and Tactical\n  PLAY\n\nIn-depth Look of the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife\n                                    All Bomber & Company products were originally designed for ourselves. We engineer everything under strict quality and durability standards. It is our promise to provide a lifetime warranty for the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife. If it ever breaks, send it back to us and we will replace it free of charge.  \nOur goal was to make the most compact, stylish, and functional miniature tactical pocket knife ever created. With the measurements of 80mm in total length and weighing at less than 1 ounce, the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the perfect concealable everyday carry miniature tactical pocket knife.\nB-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife\n                                    Dimensions\nUltraLight Weight: < 1oz\nBlade Length: 30mm\nBlade Thickness: 1mm\nSerrated Teeth: 7 total (two large and six small)\nSerrated Teeth Style: Great American \nOpen Body Length: 80mm\nHandle Length: 48mm\nClosed Width: 20mm\nOpened Width: 16mm\nBlade Materials (Blade and Body): 440C heat treated black stainless steel \nHardness: 58-60HRC\nColor: Jet Black\nIt's simple. We made the B-2 Nano Blade pocket knife compact and ultra-light while still holding an extremely tactical feel and durability. We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry pocket knives, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\nB-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife\nExamples of B-2 NANO BLADE KNIFE USES:\nTeeth to Tinder Fire-starting\nCut open boxes\nPry open cans\nScrew in loose screws\nCut Paracord\nEmergency Seat Belt cutting\nCutting fruit & food\nRemoving Staples\nCarving wood\nStripping wire\nB-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife Uses\n     Hi-Res Gallery: HERE\n    Prototyping:\nThe following shows the steps of prototyping as well as process of how the B-2 Nano Blade came to life. During the design process, we had a few key elements we wanted to incorporate into the B-2 Nano Blade. The knife had to be small enough to carry discretely, however still big enough to be used as a functional knife. It also needs to be extremely durable. Consequently, we decided to use 440Carbon stainless steel because it is corrosion resistant as well as stronger than most standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steels.\nEarly Sketches of the B-2 Nano Blade\n  Early Sketches while prototyping of the B-2 Nano Blade\nThe following picture shows a 2 dimentional drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade. It was our first drawing of the knife. It gives us the very basic design look and length.  Once we achieved the perfect look and tactical feel of the knife, we were able to create a CAD rendering.\nEarly 2D drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade with vertical perforated holes on the blade.\nOnce we had the 2D drawing, we were able to start making a visual product with depth. We then adjusted the thickness of the knife in the CAD rendering to create the perfect 3D model. We then use the 3D CAD model as a blueprint for the first tangible product.\n3D CAD modeled design of the B-2 Nano Blade\nBelow is the first handmade prototype of the B-2 Nano Blade. We had used sheet aluminum to wire cut the first prototypes.  As you can see in the pictures, we had cut out the holes for the screws as well as perforation in the blade using this method. This was not a functional prototype, as it was not safe enough to use. The sheet aluminum is soft and just an early design to understand the overall feel, weight, and hold of the knife. Once we had the overall aesthetics of the knife down, we needed it to be fully functional in the following steps.\nFirst hand made prototype\n\nIn the second prototype, we managed to produce it out of real stainless steel. Using 5Cr13MoV stainless steel, we were able to achieve a stronger, more tactile, precise, and functional prototype. This gave us an understanding of first case usage, mobility, and design aesthetics. We also added more functionality to the blade by adding a hole for a keyring, as well as tilted the perforated slots in the blade to a 15 degree angle.  This allowed material to slide off easier than standard verticle perforated holes.  The second prototype does not have a blade edge or a serrated blade.\n2nd Prototype - No serrated ground on blade | Made from standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steel\n\nOur third prototype, we added a precision grind onto the blade. We originally decided to go with a serrated blade \"chisel grind\" (meaning only one side of the blade was sharpened) because we were going to add a serrated section.  The following final prototype shows a \"flat grind\" on the blade because it allowed both left and right handed users.  It was ultimately more versatile. As you can see in the video below, we show the differences between the final prototype and the third prototype with different grinds on the blade.\nPLAY\n\n  2D design drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade\n  PLAY\n\nABOUT US\nBomber & Company is an industrial urban product design company based out of San Francisco, CA USA with a mission to provide premium survival gear to the modern explorer.

Once you have all five animal cards and your lineage marker, you can move your student and master to the center octagon. The first player to do so has successfully passed on their martial arts lineage, and wins the game!\nMeanwhile, one player represents the emperor, working to unify the empire by placing towers in the four corners of the board. As the empire expands, the emperor\u2019s forces grow. Recruited generals give the emperor greater power and flexibility but the additional forces require vigilance and careful planning. Generals rely on the emperor or empress to create paths for them across unforgiving terrains. If the emperor places towers in the four corners before one of the other players has passed on their martial arts lineage, the emperor player wins, and only the emperor\u2019s lineage will prevail.\n    Wu Wei: Journey of the Changing Path is played in a series of rounds. In each round, players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the starting player. As the seasons change, a gathering will be triggered every winter, during which turn order is reassigned. The game continues in this way until one player wins.\n                      SOLO CAMPAIGN ADDED  \nNot only is there going to be a solo campaign but I have enlisted the help of Mike Mullins (a solo gaming enthusiast and experienced developer) to help me put the final touches on the solo version of the game. I'm really excited to have Mike on board. I've spent a lot of time with this game and if there's going to be a solo campaign, it's going to the best is can possibly be!  \n\"I'm elated to be a part of the development of Wu Wei. The multiplayer game translates incredibly well to solo play. The variable board setup, unique elemental abilities, and the difficulty level I insist upon will surely satisfy my fellow solo gamers.\" - Mike Mullins  \nMike Mullins is a longtime playtester and developer, best known for the creation of solo modes for games such as Castle Dice, Lagoon, and Compounded. He's the designer of Buttonshy's solo game Pentaquark, as well as the co-designer of Bottom of the 9th. He's also done solo modes for Fleet: Wharfside, Ahead in the Clouds, and Circle the Wagons and he's on the Board of Directors for Unpub, the Unpublished Games Network (Unpub.net). \n  Undead Viking Videos Review\n\"Wu Wei presents the players with fun and interesting choices and it has a very open feel to it. I never felt hemmed in. I felt like I was on a journey with my student and master but I never felt like a had to go on a certain path. And ultimately, is the game fun? Yeah! It is a lot of fun! If you are a fan of the martial arts world and clever path finding games you should check this out.\" - Lance Myxter, Undead Viking Videos\nDoug & Doug Gaming Play Through\nWe had WEI too much fun with this one *wink wink*... no but seriously, this is an amazing game and a must have for your collection! - Doug & Doug Gaming\nGeekDad Preview\n\"Wu Wei is one of those games that will attract passersby at a convention just because it looks so elaborate when it\u2019s all set up. If you\u2019re a fan of abstract strategy or if you want to see a martial arts game that isn\u2019t about flying kicks and throwing punches but digs deeper into the philosophy, Wu Wei is certainly worth checking out. It\u2019s perhaps not a game for everyone\u2014you do have to have patience learning the rules and how to read the board and trackers\u2014but I think it is rewarding for those who are, ahem, disciplined enough to master it.\" - Jonathan Liu, GeekDad.com\nPreview from GeekDad by Jonathan Liu\n  \"Wu Wei is a rare game with the elegance of an abstract, yet every detail contains deep meaning. Each game feels dynamic with a simple resource system ensuring that advantage flows between the players, and with three variants the game grows with your mastery of it.

I had an idea for a new app called \"Chardonnay Go\", which showed women where to find glasses of Chardonnay in their neighborhoods. It was an instant hit on Facebook Live! The video garnered 23 million views in less than 2 weeks and it helped our Off Broadway show \"One Funny Mother\" (also launched on Kickstarter) flourish this summer. After 9 months in NY, we decided to head back out on the road with the show and I began developing the initial concepts for Chardonnay Go- The Board Game.  \nChardonnay Go comes in a distinctive wine bottle box\nConcept: Chardonnay Go is packaged in a distinctive wine bottle box and set in a vineyard with players facing outrageous challenges to get to the elusive tasting room. The board features spaces such as \"Wine Bitch\", where the player must fill everyone's glass while wearing \"wine bitch\" apparel, and \"Time Out\" and \"Chardonnay Go\" challenges, where players have to perform uproarious tasks while reciting absolute nonsense.\nPrototype:  We made 15 prototypes of the game that were mailed around the country and played by over 300 people as part of a big drunk beta test. Players signed up through Facebook and provided valuable feedback regarding the final development of the game. (Beta testing finishes Feb 26) We have also partnered with the agency that manufactures Cards against Humanity to help us find our manufacturer. \nIt's a Chardonnay Go party night!\nWhat's in the box:\n1 Instruction sheet\n1 Game board\n1 Die\n6 colored barrel playing pieces\n70 Chardonnay card\n70 Go cards\nThe object of the game: Laugh and drink* your way through the Chardonnay Go vineyard, while performing uproarious tasks until you find your way to the tasting room and WIN!!! *Drinking alcohol is NOT REQUIRED!*\nChardonnay Go Beta testing pic\nHow to play: Everyone grab a drink and sit next to someone you like. If you don't like anyone, you should leave. Be sure to leave plenty of room around table for game play.\nPick your favorite barrel and place it on the wine barrel near START. The game includes 6 pieces, if you have more than 6 players, improvise. You can use wine corks, coins, bottle caps, small animals, etc. \nWhoever had sex most recently goes first. \nRoll the die to advance through the game, following the directions on the board. \nOther ways to play: 1.) Naked  2.) Set board aside and go around the table, having each person pull one \"Chardonnay\" and one \"Go\" card and perform the Chardonnay Go Challenges. There's no real winner, it's just funny as hell. \nWhy we need funding: Your contribution will help us manufacture an initial order of 5,000 games. This order will help us fulfill our Kickstarter rewards and leave extra games to sell.  Our Kickstarter participants will be the first people to receive Chardonnay Go!  We have relied on Kickstarter and our FB /One Funny Mother fans to help us recognize the need for fun, dirty games like Chardonnay Go and we look forward to bringing this game to our devoted fans FIRST.  Help us bring this unique, ridiculous and somewhat uncomfortable game to market for all the moms & dads who are overwhelmed and want to unwind with a nice glass of wine, a few friends and a lot of laughs! \n                                                    STRETCH GOALS:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are in the process of finalizing our design and are ready to place our first PO as soon as the Kickstarter is fulfilled.

Seward, and George Atzerodt who was tasked to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson.\nBy simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration, Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government thus reigniting the Civil War which ended only a few days earlier.\n        The Knights of the Golden Circle\nBelow is a map of Washington DC with a Knights of a Golden Circle template superimposed on top of it. As legend would have it, the KGC buried millions in gold across many secret locations to finance a second Civil War. As means for future generations to locate these treasures, the KGC were known to carve treasure map templates into trees and rocks.\nThe template below would suggest that the Washington Monument (under construction at the time of the Civil War) would be an excellent hiding place to keep confederate gold safe, right under the nose of their enemy.\nWarning: Please don't disturb the Washington Monument and/or the land surrounding it. The probability of anything being there is pretty low.\nRise of a Nation Playing Cards\nEarly in 2016, the Barclay Mountain Co., released Rise of a Nation. This deck was the first in the Decoded History Series. It was printed by the United States Playing Card Co. and can be found at the gits shops in Colonial Williamsburg Virginia and the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC.\nThis deck also featured Washington DC and the role secret societies had in forming our nation. The codes within the deck identified 10 locations within the nations capital. When the locations are looked at on a map, they create what's known as a tree of life.\n    Decoded History Series Future Projects\nOnce Divide of a Nation is produced we'll be focusing on the next two decks in the series, Call of a Nation based on the Franklin Roosevelt years in office and Fear of a Nation based on the assassination of John F Kennedy (and the rise of the cold war).\nPLAY\n\nNotice on the video above how the eagle lines up perfectly with the lawn of the Capitol building. Likewise, notice how the street grid come together perfectly at the tip of the pyramid. We'll explore more into this and other topics as we develop the series.

By integrating the laser engraver and cutter into the mechanism, it becomes a versatile yet affordable desktop tool for artists, craftsmen and makers to set their imagination free. XPlotter is not just capable of simulating real effects of handmade drawing and writing, cutting out and laser engraving on different materials as people like, but also be able to pick and place objects with great accuracy, leaving room for secondary development on more applications. \nXPlotter Can Write\nThe writing of XPlotter features handmade effects. Indeed, the process is almost the same as that of a human hand writing. It is accomplished stroke by stroke with a real pen at certain angle to the paper but just by a robotic arm, which moves in a steady programmed way. \nXPlotter allows you to produces good writing in any fonts and styles you like without making any typos, stains on the paper, while retaining the realistic feel of hand writing. Pen is not the only choice for XPlotter. As the pen holder is adjustable, it fits various implements, such as pencils, markers, charcoal, chalks and so much more.\n  People often feel comfortable and respected in front of nice hand writings. You can spread this feeling through people around you with the help of our XPlotter. There could be a wide range of applications:\nCards or notes or letters \nCool posters (could combined with the drawing of XPlotter)\nCustomized signature\nInvitations\nPlace cards for conferences and important social events\n......\nXPlotter Can Draw\nXPlotter draws pictures in two different ways. The drawing can be executed in pen, ballpoint pen, water color, pencil, etc.\nYou can choose a picture and upload it on the computer. Then XPlotter could start draw it on the paper. It is not simply \u201cprinting\u201d the images you choose but a process involves a lot of techniques. Like the cute cats we present to you, in order to portray the texture of the fluffy fur, XPlotter uses varied length and density of lines to render the shading on the cat, making them look more vivid and real. On the contrary, printers often fail to reappear the texture and details of the original picture.\n  PLAY\n\n    You can also let XPlotter to draw on its own via the program, that\u2019s how the colorful tree was painted. Unlike the upload-and-draw way, XPlotter will totally listen to his internal voice (the program) and create images randomly without repeating the same for twice. Every picture is unique. What an original artist!\n  PLAY\n\nXPlotter Can Laser Engraving\nXPlotter is more than a plotter. It could transform into laser engraver if you want. From wood, leather, fabric to kraft, there is a wide range of materials it can engrave directly on. Equipped with a powerful laser, XPlotter is able to engrave a work of art within a short of time.\n  Engraving on Anodized Aluminium\nWhat can you do with the engraver\nYou must be tired of using the same products as any other. How about customize your individual style? For instance, you can engrave your own phone case and music box, or anything that is suitable for laser operation. Turning your (or other people\u2019s) favorite picture into a laser-engraved form could also be amazing and of great fun. Let alone it can help make unique gift to the person you care.\nUse laser engrave to do Printmaking is also very easy.\n  About Safety Use\nSafety is always what we concern about. Lasers are potentially hazardous as it could be powerful enough to burn and cut things. The laser we use is of high power, in order to minimize the potential risks of laser accidents, we offer a specifically designed goggles for XPlotter to protect your eyes during laser working. On the other hand, a Velcro sticker pad was designed for Laser head with a view to avoid excessive scattering of laser. If unfortunately, (we wish it would never happen) you expose your skin under the working-on laser head before you realize it, pls press the quick shut down key as soon as possible to avoid further injury to the skin. We hope you can enjoy yourself on engraving but stay alert is necessarily important.\nXPlotter Can Laser Cutting\nIf XPlotter can be laser engraving, then why shouldn\u2019t we make the cutting accessible?\nXPlotter laser cutter is a great tool that expands the field of creation from the two-dimensional world to a three-dimensional one. XPlotter is capable of cutting up to 3 mm of wood.\nOnce the pieces were cut out from the board, the happy time of assembly would start. You can make yourself a decorative lampshade or other interesting works involves in fitting and assembling. Models require high precision can also be done by XPlotter. It would be convenient for architects, artists and makers to build up their own models unmistakably through our XPlotter. Since XPlotter could cut graphs into tangible pieces, it provides a good chance to verify the prototypes in a more direct way, e.g. making a moving Nautilus Gears.\nYou might be wondering if it was possible for XPlotter to cut materials that is thin and light. Because as we all know the thinner the material is, the harder the cutting will be done. But our answer is \u201cYes\u201d.  XPlotter has no problem with that. It is able to cut complicated and delicate patterns out from thin materials as a scissor or pen knife does to it, but the edges will be soother and clearer. For example, the XPlotter can make a exquisite paper cutting on a sheet of thin paper. It can deal with all the details carefully without breaking any ties between the hallow patterns.\nMaking a Laser Cut Leather Lamp at home is no longer impossible.\n  Laser Processable Materials\nXPlotter Can Pick and Place\n\u201cX\u201d is a mysterious letter, indicating something or someone that is unknown or unclear, which requires endless exploring and discovering. That is exactly what we wish for our robot. We want you to always have an expectation on our work.\nXPlotter could be far beyond a plotter, a laser engraver and a cutter if you let yourself go out of the box. We managed to make a built-in vacuum pump system, enable XPlotter to pick and place at a high speed and feature a precision within 0.012mm. It only takes you a few minutes to change the end effector into a vacuum suction cup, which is powerful enough to grab spherical items. We will open source the interface for you to conduct a secondary development. For example, you can make XPlotter to play the chess with you. XPlotter can become a medium for your further innovations.\nShowcase\n  Follow Us\nFacebook | Twitter | Youtube | Google+\n  Development of XPlotter\nWe have developed 5 prototypes of XPlotter, improved the hardware for more than 10 times. Finally we choose to use the all-medal CoreXY as the main structure for enhancement. The product becomes more solid and stable and can move very fast. Now the final XPlotter is ready to release. Below images present the improvement process of our main prototypes in different periods.\nEasy to Use (Hardware + Software + Secondary Development)\nOur goal is to make a product that integrated the functions of a plotter, a laser engraver and a cutter but comparatively at a lower cost, making it accessible to more people. Added functions mean added complexity. But we managed to simplify the steps and keep it easy to use. At the same time, we open source the operation interface to welcome more amazing applications made by our users through the secondary development.\nEasily Assembled End-Effector\nUser Friendly Software\nWe offer an easy-to-use operating software for different application scenarios. The software will work on Windows and Mac OS.\n     Compatible with Inkscape\nSecondary Development\nThe mainboard we used is ATmega2560, Arduino compatible. We will open source the operation interface for users to extend their own applications on the basis of the XPlotter.\nTouch Screen & SD Card\nYou can also use XPlotter by the 2.8 inch touch screen and SD without connecting to the computer.\nXPlotter Specifications\n  XPlotter VS Others\nRewards\nTime Line\n Team members\nThere are 7 members in our team so far:\nEric Wang leads this team on project management and business.\nJerry Peng is the software and algorithm engineer in the team.\nJames Wang is the mechanical engineer.\nWanhong Zeng is the electronic engineer.\nYi Yang works for the supply chain part.\nKebo Shi works for the manufacturing part.\nLichun Deng is the Graphic Designer.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "XPlotter 8.5-Inch LCD Writing Tablet", "descp": "Pressure-sensitive LCD writing surface is easy to clean and maintain.

Players are mad scientist in need of precious Mortals for future experiments. Rather than getting your hands dirty, your army of Campy Creatures awaits to do your bidding. Capture the most valuable Mortals over the course of three nights to win. But be warned\u2014the Mortals won\u2019t go down without a fight.\nWhat is Campy Creatures?\nIt's a ghoulish game of bluffing, deduction, and set collection for 2-5 players. Players begin each round with the same hand of creatures. Their goal is to capture valuable Mortals by outguessing their opponents. Each player has perfect information at the start so knowing what a person might do in a particular situation is key.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nFive Creature Decks: 45 Poker-size Cards (9 Creatures each)\nThe Mortal Deck: 30 Poker-size Cards\nThe Clash-O-Meter (The Board) and Player Markers\n5 Monstrous Meeples\nThe Rules\nWe've made a component update mid-campaign and are now including small meeples in the game! This will replace the current score-trackers and sit nicely around the board. \n      Mortal Artwork Incoming\nAll Mortal cards will be fully illustrated and Josh is working hard to finish them up during the campaign. Follow along on our Instagram where we share in-progress shots to see them developed out.\nWho\u2019s Campy Creatures for?\nIf you enjoy the thrill and tension of reading people and outwitting them in a particular situation, then Campy Creatures is for you. The heart of the game is outguessing the other players as much of the time you have perfect information as to what\u2019s in their hand.\nThis would be a light-to-medium weight game. Non-gamers and casuals should be able to pick it up and have a blast within no time.  For the masters of meeples out there, we believe this could be a great starter to game night or a nice lunch-break or convention game.\nThe theme is playfully dark, but all content will be family-friendly. The box must say 14 and up, but we found the game has been enjoyed by kids as young as 8. \nA free companion app for iOS and Android will launch with the game to make it super portable\n      Download the Print-n-Play\nWe firmly believe in this game, but feel free to kick the tires first. We're giving the PnP away for free for a limited time (only during the Kickstarter). We'd love to hear you thoughts if you end up playing the game. As people found with our earlier game Control, the final components will be top-notch so we believe there's still reason enough to back the game if you PnP.\n  The download above includes A4 and US letter sizes along the rules in English. You can find other translations here:\nGerman Rules Translation\nSpanish Rules Translation\nDutch Rules Translation\nExample Gameplay\nYou can download the full rules here, or watch an example of the setup for a three player game and how a round plays out.\nVideo notes: The Mortal illustrations will be finalized during the campaign.\n      Where does Campy Creatures fit into my collection?\nCampy Creatures is in a different genre than social deduction games like The Resistance or Coup. We love bidding / simultaneous-action selection games like For Sale, Libertalia, or Eggs & Empires and Campy Creatures would fall closer into their categories. It owes a lot to these games, but we believe it stands on its own as it offers a bit more of a cerebral take on a few things.\nFirst, we wanted the game to be easily portable and affordable. Second, we wanted there to be a fun tension of doublethink present as you second-guess yourself or your opponents\u2014there's a reason all those creature eyes are watching :) Third, we wanted the game to shine at all player counts\u2014we found these style of games didn't accommodate two players, the two-player experience was just alright, or it required extra rules. We wanted to create a great two-player experience while keeping the gameplay unchanged. We looked at great two-player games like Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and Brave Rats and sought to inject some of the fun found there into Campy. And lastly, we wanted a unique yet meaningful tie-breaker system. It was thanks to the forums on BGG discussing tie-breaker variants for Libertalia that birthed the idea for Campy Creatures' Clash-O-Meter\u2014something that's integral to the game as you'll often make decisions based on your positioning.\n  A Series of Tart Ales \nCampy Creatures not only plays great over beer \u2019n pretzels, but there will actually be a series of beer released alongside the game by Bottle Logic Brewing. This board game / beer series combo might be the first of its kind. The limited edition series will be tart ales with art from the game and each release over 2017 will feature a different creature from the game.\nCampy Creatures Posters\nEach poster is an 8 x 10 inch gicl\u00e9e prints on archival paper. In layman terms, the print is high quality\u2014almost seeming like it's been painted\u2014and the paper is nicely textured and able to hold the print for a very long time. Each creature has been updated with campy flavor text to give the posters a cinematic feel. If you click the image below, you'll go to a higher res version to better view the posters. \n  Josh Emrich (the game's illustrator) also has collector's edition movie-size posters available through his site.\n  Retailers\nWe are currently not working with a distributor, but we love providing games at a 50% discount directly to friendly local game stores. Please reach out to us here with proof of being a retailer and we can get the conversation started. Minimum order starts at 5 games. \nIt's Alive! \u2013 The Art\nWe approached Josh Emrich some months ago about illustrating and designing a creature game. Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined what's before you today. To say we're excited about the art is a vast understatement. We believe he has captured the inspired styles and era of creature features in immense detail. Josh is a mad scientist when it comes to design and illustration\u2014he has truly brought these creatures to life. \n                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our second game we have Kickstarted.

It is a wonderful sequel to Snapped.\nDuring the late 1930s and early 1940s an unidentified mortgage broker at the Valley National Bank spent some time wheeling around Tucson with his 2-1/4 x 3-1/4 camera to visit his home loan clients. He pulled over to the curb, snapped a quick photo of their property, and drove away. \nAlong the way he even caught people and pets at play, reading the paper on their porches, their jalopies parked in the driveway. After the photos were developed, he carefully pasted each snapshot one per page in a black-paper photo album across from a carefully typewritten accounting of each owner, address, appraisal, loan, taxes, and insurance. Over the course of years, he created 14 of these albums. \nThe spine and cover of a typical Scavone album\nIn the 1960s, another Valley National Bank employee named Cirino Scavone rediscovered these documents, now without a business use, and somehow convinced his boss to let him take them home to save them from the dumpster. In 1990, the Scavone family donated them to the Arizona Historical Society library where they reside today. \nA typical spread from one of the albums\nTaken as a body, these photographs are an astonishing document of what Tucson felt like in the early years of its expansive growth. Many of these homes are new, with little vegetation, and stand like small monuments to the resilience of humanity, taking a stand at the edge of the desert frontier, proudly broadcasting to all viewers the sense of home unique to each owner. \nDetails from two of the Scavone photos\nPeople, animals, and cars are also caught in the viewfinder, accidentally encapsulating a perfect moment of everyday life that links us across the generations, much like the street photographs in Snapped. \nThere are Pueblo and Spanish Colonial fantasies, Streamline Deco statements, and hunkered-down bungalows. In many, the mountains watch over warily in the background. A time capsule of mid-century architectural fashion is laid out in these pages. \nA rendering of the proposed book cover\n  When I first encountered the homes in this astonishing time machine, I was seized by a desire to find out what they look like today. In light of this comprehensive view of how we lived then, who are we now and what do we value? How has the context for these homes changed? What signs of the past remain? \nI set out on my first expedition \u2014 archaeology in plain site. I looked up the addresses, pulled my twenty-first century jalopy up to the curb, and snapped a photo with my iPhone from the same angle and the same time of day and season as the original. \nA sample spread from the proposed book\nI found that many homes have additions, others have walls or large obscuring trees, and others have been demolished completely. Some street names and numbers have changed, and others, simply labeled \u201cCatalina Foothills Estates\u201d, will take research to uncover. \nIn the handful of homes I have rephotographed so far, stories already flow like the Santa Cruz during a monsoon. Driveways change sides, windows are plastered over, sleeping porches give way to air conditioning. Homes become businesses. Small adobes become large mansions. Priorities and styles change. \nThese images \u2014 now and then, side by side \u2014 invite engagement, discussion, and introspection. Who were we? Who are we? What have we lost? What have we kept? \nA sample spread from the proposed book\nI will design and publish a 6\"x8\" book on black paper with a leatherette cover, preserving the size and feel of the original albums. In order to keep costs and book size in line, I am proposing that the book feature between 50 and 100 of the most interesting/significant homes from the collection. The final house count will depend on fundraising success. The book will be locally printed at Arizona Lithographers in Tucson. The accompanying website can include more than are published in the book\u2014 perhaps even all \u2014 depending on how much funding we are able to raise. \nLike the originals, the book will be Wire-O bound\nThis book and website will also be unparalleled historical documents. Researchers of all levels will have indices as a guide, and can find specific homes at specific addresses, note the relative popularity of styles, see what homes were valued at what prices, track the evolution of specific neighborhoods, evaluate the frequency of leapfrog development, compare tax rates, explore mortgage practices, and more. A searchable spreadsheet to all 669 homes in the collection will be part of the website. \nIf you want to see a list of the addresses to see if your home is included, click here for a google doc.\nHere are the numbers of homes represented in the collection, by neighborhood:\nSam Hughes 177\nBlenman-Elm 113\nJefferson Park 46\nSamos 32\nCampbell Grant 27\nNorth University 26\nPalo Verde 24\nRincon Heights 22\nUofA Campus 19\nPeter Howell 17\nSouthside 18\nCatalina Vista 16\nMountain 1st 15\nFeldmans 13\nSan Clemente 13\nCatalina Foothills Estates 11\nWest University 11\nEl Encanto 9\nColonia Solana 5\nMiles 7\nHedrick Acres 6\nSan Gabriel 5\nUnidentified 5\nEl Cortez 4\nNogales 4\nEl Montevideo 4\nPoets Square 3\nWillcox 3\nMiramonte 2\nMountain View 2\nSierra Estates 2\nBroadmoor 3\nDunbar Spring 1\nEl Presidio 1\nOcotillo Oracle 1\nRosemont West 1\nSouth Tucson 1\nTotal 669\nDetail from a 1940 Tucson street map\nI will also include contemporary Tucson street maps from 1940 so that readers can see what street names have changed, what areas had not yet been subdivided, and examine the varied concentrations of development. To keep the historical context intact I will publish the mortgage and owner info, as originally typed in the albums, opposite the now-and-then images. \nI will work with prominent local architecture and historical preservation expert, University of Arizona Architecture Professor R. Brooks Jeffery, who will write notes on the significance of each home, its architecture, its owner, and/or its builder. Professor Jeffery believes this project is so important that he has committed his writing and editing as a $10,000 in-kind donation to this project. \nA sample spread from the proposed book\nSnapped on the Street was another collection of ephemeral street photographs that painted an evocative picture of mid-century Tucson, and was phenomenally popular. This present book, and its accompanying website, will similarly be of intense interest to a broad range of readers. \nHere are a few of our target audiences: \n\u27a4 historical researchers \n\u27a4 architectural researchers \n\u27a4 genealogical researchers \n\u27a4 archaeologists \n\u27a4 fans of street photography \n\u27a4 art book collectors \n\u27a4 realtors \n\u27a4 proud homeowners \n\u27a4 local history buffs \n\u27a4 Tucson fans at home and abroad \nDetails from two of the Scavone photos\nIn the fundraising phase, there will be intense interest among a similar range of readers. For instance, realtors understand that placement of historical properties in this book will result in higher sales prices, and the book in general will increase interest in and sales of homes in these historic neighborhoods, so a contribution to this project will be seen as an investment. Neighborhood associations are also a good likely source of significant funds to help promote the historic nature of their homes. I have a very long list of potential funders, and I have a great deal of experience in asking folks for money for good causes. \nSince this project will create a product that can be sold, the money entrusted by granting organizations and individual supporters will enjoy a strong return on that investment. Snapped sold 750 copies on its first day and more than 5,000 in its first two years at a price of $20 a copy. Sales from the book will benefit the nonprofit activities of the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation, and that means that part or all of your contribution may be tax-deductible.\nIf this project is as successful as I suspect it will be, other homes from the collection can be featured in future books. Preservation and education through deep engagement with our everyday history has real power. I believe this project can tap into and spread that power widely. \nA sample spread from the proposed book\nProject timeline \nI have already started on the basic research and development of the spreadsheet information for all 669 homes in the albums. Fundraising is also under way. I have begun the re-photography and will continue through next summer, as Dr. Jeffery works on the text and our intern does further research. Final design and printing will take place in Fall 2017, with the books ready for sales in late fall, just in time for the holiday season.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to this project is the inherent uncertainty of fundraising. Will people respond and invest? Will they do so at a high enough rate to green light the book?\n\nTo overcome this risk, the budget is scalable, depending on fundraising success. If revenues are more difficult to come by than expected, the scope can be scaled back. If they flow easily, the scope can be scaled up. I am confident, given past experience with local history books that we will raise the funds necessary for the high-end scope, especially with the added incentive of backers being able to use part of the investment as a tax deduction. \n\nNote that $10,000 of these costs is already covered as an in-kind donation from Prof. Jeffery, and another $8,396 is already covered as an in-kind donation from THPF. \n\nThe fundraising goal on Kickstarter reflects the additional cost for 1,000 books featuring 50 homes printed in full color throughout, with 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website. \n\nIf we raise more than that goal, I will increase the number of homes featured in the book, and then the number of copies of the book.\n\nHere are a number of possibilities for project scope, depending on funds.\n\n1,000 books featuring 50 homes printed in full color throughout, with 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n5,000 books featuring 50 homes printed in full color throughout, with 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n5,000 books featuring 100 homes printed in full color throughout, with all 669 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n5,000 books featuring 100 homes printed in full color throughout, with 400 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n5,000 books featuring 100 homes printed in full color throughout, with the same 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n5,000 books featuring 100 homes printed in black ink only plus aqueous coating throughout, with the same 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website\n\n1,000 books featuring 100 homes printed in black ink only plus aqueous coating throughout, with the same 100 homes rephotographed and included on the website\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Steve Farley\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nSteve Farley is a visionary, motivational, highly entrepreneurial leader who in addition to being an award-winning artist and author is also...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "Can't spring for the book right now, but want to help out?

I have been collecting ephemera, news, and images in and of my neighborhood that will become the source material for the project. The installation will consist of a series of rooms covered in hieroglyphic-style carvings, an atrium with seating for the public, and a small garden area. I will hire people in my community to help construct the large-scale installation on an empty lot in the Crenshaw District (where I'm seen standing in the video above), which will be transformed into a visual archive of the neighborhood. \nUpon entering the last room of the structure, visitors will be invited to make their own \u201chieroglyphs\u201d by carving into a series of blank panels. This will serve as a medium for the public to express personal narratives, share important news, honor community leaders, celebrate events, and leave obituaries or memorials. It is necessary that we, as residents of South Central LA, author our own stories. Adapting the ancient hieroglyph as a metaphor for power, futurity, and permanence allows community members the freedom to commemorate and monumentalize themselves in a public artwork.\nThe hieroglyph structure's rooms will look similar to this presentation (covered walls and floors). kingdom splurge (3.7.15.15) 2015, The Studio Museum in Harlem.

There will be both curated programs and open calls for the public to participate. Some of the programs will specifically aim to facilitate dialogue about the gentrification that is happening rapidly throughout our neighborhoods, and the ways in which we can prevent gentrifiers from reimagining our community. Other programs will seek to inspire facilitate meaningful discourse between the local community and greater Los Angeles. All events at the Hieroglyph Project will be free and open to everyone!\nWhy is this important?\nThe ultimate goals of the Hieroglyph Project are to inspire liberation, self-definition, healing, and community building through the emancipatory narratives inscribed into the hieroglyph walls. I will document and inscribe into panels the plural experience of communities in South Central LA, describing iconographies, aesthetic styles, informal economies, leisure activities, celebrations, oppression and local histories. It is my hope that the images and narratives engraved by the public will inspire productive dialogues about liberation for South Central LA from within. In this way, the Hieroglyph Project will provide a public platform to challenge familiar narratives of oppression that reinforce states of inferiority, stereotypes, and invisibility in our communities.\nAbout me\nI was born and raised in Los Angeles. I took my first art class in the 12th grade, and was deeply inspired by a project on hieroglyphs. I went on to practice art and architecture at El Camino Community College for four years, CalArts, and Yale University, where I began to focus on rethinking and remixing the built environment through art in my neighborhoods of South Central LA and the Eastside. I continued this work as an Artist-In-Residence at The Studio Museum in Harlem and in the Session residency program at Recess.\nkingdom splurge (2.4.6.14), 2014, 24FT x 40FT, Yale University.

By moving them, these magnets will attract one another, thereby triggering the switch.\nIt's a new and interactive way to brighten up your room!\nThe two balls are the switches of the lamps. By lifting the lower ball up, it will draw the two balls together with each other's magnets inside. First they will flow in the air and when they reach a balance, the light will switch on.\nUsing the HENG will bring a fun, innovative and interactive twist to your life!\n  The HENG lamp has an attractive curved design, it creates the illusion of light passing through the wooden structure.\nThe most magical element of this lamp would be the switch. Two wooden balls function as the light switch. Once you pick up the lower ball and put it near the upper one, the two balls will find a balance and levitate in the middle of the lamp. Once the balance is reached, the lamp switches on.\nThe design has an easy structure, which makes it easy for volume production. HENG is already in the prototype stage and will be ready to be brought into the market.\n  Because we want you to feel close to nature, we selected high-quality wood to manufacture the Heng Lamp. This will give a warm and natural appearance and is suitable for all types of rooms, like study, bedroom and living room.\n                Switching the light on in mid-air\n      Our stretch goal is to reach \u20ac10.000.

Firstly, the production capacity can be increased within a very short time span. This also offers us more flexibility production-wise. Another advantage of having our own factory is that it enables us to offer competitive pricing, as fewer external parties are involved. Lastly, this full control over the production process allows us to closely monitor our products' quality, as the production process can constantly be monitored and tweaked where required. Because of this, we are able to try out innovative production techniques which would else-wise be impossible.\nThe HENG Lamp will be manufactured and packaged at Allocacoc's factory and production facilities near Shanghai, and will perform the final quality control to ensure that HENG lamp reaches you in the best condition possible.\n    This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we already have experience in the design and manufacturing of innovative products, we are confident that we will be able to fulfill the project within the specified time frame.

Scroll all the way down to see it!\n\nI got tired of card games where the only funny things said were things pre-written on the cards, so I created Dysfunctional Families.  \u2014 Eric Shefferman\n-- For 3 to 10 players\n-- takes 30 to 45 minutes\n-- recommended age 17+\nThe big thing that makes Dysfunctional Families different from other card collecting games (such as Go Fish!) is that to ask another player for a card you are required to do a simple, structured improv: \"I'm looking for [name of card] because ______.\" \nDysfunctional Families is a memory-based card game for 3 to 10 players similar to Go Fish! but with a touch of adult-rowdiness as you collect families of mad scientists, arsonists, cannibals, and more -- while dealing with additional characters such as social workers and psychics that can interact and change the flow of the game. You want to gather as much information as you can about your opponent\u2019s cards while revealing as little as possible about your own hand.\nThe making of Dysfunctional Families:  \nWhen I started researching card games, I discovered that the history of playing cards themselves is quite fascinating. Long before the current \u201c52 cards in 4 suits Ace through King plus 2 Jokers\u201d standard decks, there were all kinds of unique decks of cards.  \nOne game from the 1800\u2019s was called Happy Families, and I saw that and immediately thought of the name Dysfunctional Families. The original Happy Families game had rather grotesque looking family members, and it made me think that I could do Dysfunctional Families using my own (rather unique) art style.  \nTraditional Happy Families games relied on the tried and true professions: butcher, baker, candlestick maker, etc. I felt that the game needed a more modern twist and so instead used family professions such as mad scientists, cannibals, and stand-up comics. While creating the basic outline of the game, I realized some of the things that I could add to the original game and thus the \u201cPower People\u201d cards were created -- non-family members who could influence the course of the game such as the Psychic and the Parole Officer.\nAnd now it's finally ready for you to get your very own copy!

Tag a friend!\nTag a friend to show you care!\n  Tweet like the wind!\n     The Importance of Improv\nI'm very proud of the little improv element that I put into Dysfunctional Families. It is simple enough that almost anyone can come up with something to fill in \"I'm looking for [name of card] because ______.\" However, it is still open-ended enough that people can come up with some very funny sentences.\nA lot of people who are intimidated by the idea of taking an improv class don't realize that improv isn't taught as a \"do everything at once\" but rather is taught by breaking out skills as separate little elements to work on individually. Finishing the sentence in Dysfunctional Families is just one type of simple fill-in structure. But working on it can be the first step to expanding into working on other things and then suddenly... BOOM you're comfortable with all kinds of things.\nHere's some of the articles I wrote recently about improv:\nThe Importance of Improv in Daily Life\nImprov in Dysfunctional Families\nMy Favorite Improv Game: Because I Said So!\nI'd like to think that playing Dysfunctional Famliies will open you up to all kinds of new verbal facility!\nTo learn more about the game, you can scroll down to see images of all the cards and the rules.

I left school and started programming video games on the original Nintendo home system. Since then my life has always revolved around some combination of computers and art.  \nAs my life becomes more and more electronic and virtual, I find that I appreciate low-tech things more and more, especially things that can be enjoyed while hanging out in person with friends.

To achieve the low funding goal, I am using DriveThruCards as my primary printing service. They printed the demo and playtesting decks. They can print games one copy at a time as needed. This works for the purpose of getting the game to exist.\n\nThe challenge will be to get the number of games ordered to be high enough that I can print with a traditional printer and thus have economies of scale that would permit printing additional copies to put into distribution on amazon.com, etc. (This is the goal of typical Kickstarter campaigns and why they need such a higher funding goal.) At this level, the company has truly \"kickstarted\" and prints enough of the product that when it has sold out, there is enough profit to do another printing of the product.\n\nI am calling this a QTYONE (quantity one) business plan -- the product is viable even when selling just one copy.\n\nI have more details about the QTYONE business plan here on the igpay website.\nhttp://igpay.com/qtyone-business-plan-dysfunctional-families-kickstarter-relaunch-part-1/\n\nThe first time I had Dysfunctional Families on Kickstarter, it was a traditional Kickstarter where I needed to be printing at least 100 copies (preferably more) of the game in order for it to be financially viable. \n\nNow it will work no matter how few or many are wanted (although the more the merrier!).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Dysfunctional Supporter", "descp": "You Support Dysfunctional Families\nI will think very fondly of you.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you\u2019ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven\u2019t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 12+.\n  GAME CONTENTS\n1 Faux book container\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies)\n64 Cards (9 Brethren of the Coast, 16 Event, 30 Vote, 9 Loyalty)\n1 Rubber playing mat\n1 Burlap pouch\n9 Wooden pawns\n8 Wooden treasure chests\nTHE GAME\nThe game is packaged in a faux book box. The box has 3 magnets to keep it closed when you're moving it to and from game night.\n  The game fits nicely inside the faux book box. The box is big enough for cards to be sleeved, if desired.\n  The game board is a rubber playmat. The board rolls up like a map.\n  The 8 wooden treasure pieces come in a burlap bag.\n  Each of the 9 wooden pawns matches with 1 of the 9 pirates you can be in the game. Each pirate is based on a real pirate who roamed Tortuga and the Caribbean seas in the year 1667.\n     Each player has a secret loyalty: British, Dutch, or French. But be careful who you trust; someone claiming to share your loyalty may stab you in the back and steal your hard-earned treasure.\n  Use Event cards during the game to help your team get treasure, or to maroon members of the opposite team to the island of Tortuga.\n  Use Vote cards during the game to secretly impact Attacks against the Spanish, Mutinies against your Captain, and Brawls against your fellow pirates.\nREWARDS\nWe're not big into confusing reward levels or expensive add-ons. We want each of our backers to get the best reward we can offer: this beautiful game! We splurged on a few items that we felt really added to the game quality (the rubber playmat, faux book, burlap bag, wooden treasures), while still keeping the overall costs low and eliminating unnecessary pieces.

But I love this game. -Tessa\nTortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count. -Alex R.\nI have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It\u2019s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S\nI love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too. -Alex W.\nTortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family. -Brett A.\nA game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed.\" -Derek H.\nTortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. -Levi H.\nPRESS\nDice Tower News: http://www.dicetowernews.com/facade-games-welcomes-you-to-tortuga-1667-on-kickstarter/35996\nGeek & Sundry: http://geekandsundry.com/tortuga-1667-kickstarter-brings-treacherous-pirates-to-tabletop-gaming/\nCwowd.com (French): http://www.cwowd.com/tortuga-cap-sur-bonne-esperance/\nBeasts of War: http://www.beastsofwar.com/tortuga-1667/command-ship-secure-treasure-tortuga-1667-ks/ \nViva Veltoro: http://www.vivaveltoro.com/2017/02/tortuga-1667-pirate-game.html\nTabletop Gaming: https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/board-games/news/tortuga-1667-is-a-gorgeous-social-deception-game-with-pirates \nDDO Players: http://ddoplayers.com/2017/01/22/tortuga-1667-a-pirate-game-on-kickstarter/\nClub Fantasci: http://www.clubfantasci.com/kickstarter-week-tortuga-1667/\nBoard Game Stories: http://boardgamestories.com/news/party/no-pirate-trusted-tortuga-1667/\nIf you have an article about Tortuga 1667 or this project, please message us so we can have it featured here.

Complete rules, including tips & tricks, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, event card descriptions, and character biographies are not shown in the video, but are all included in the game rulebook. If you'd like to look at the complete rules now please visit the links below: \nEnglish \nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish \nDutch\nItalian\nPortuguese\nHungarian\nTurkish\nPlay the game as 1 of these 9 actual pirates from history. Biographies of each pirate are in the back of the rulebook.\n  Each player has a secret loyalty card. This is your team. Part of the game is deciphering who is your teammate and who is your enemy.\n  The Tortuga playing board. Teams win if they have the most treasure in their team's treasure holds when the Spanish Armada card is revealed.\n  Players choose to perform one action on their turn. One potential action is to reveal one of five available Event cards.\n  Be careful about which Event cards you reveal! Some may maroon you or your teammates to Tortuga.\n  If you reveal one of the three treasure maps, you must give it to someone you trust. If you reveal the Spanish Armada, the game is over.\n  During the game, Captains can call for Attacks, First Mates can call for Mutinies, and the Governor of Tortuga can call for Brawls. When one of these votes is called for, use your Vote cards to secretly cast your vote!\n  Depending on the player count, you'll need to rely more heavily on certain skills to win the game. We love the flexibility and variability of Tortuga 1667 based on the player count!\nTORTUGA CREATION PROCESS\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\n1. Mechanics\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\nA game in progress.\n  2. Theme\nTortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as \u201cThe Brethren of the Coast.\u201d Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.\nThe French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.\nTortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.\nAll parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!\n3. Design\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.\nAll pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.\nSome of Sarah's initial sketches and process for creating the beautiful illustrations in the game.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nBecause we've reached the following milestones, we will be adding 8 \"game-changer\" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a \"Captain's Helm\" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 \"double-vote\" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!\n  WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Tortuga 1667. We already have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go! As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our last game, Salem. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors.\nTHE DARK CITIES SERIES\nTortuga 1667 is Volume 1 in Facade Games' Dark Cities Series! Each game in the series will:\nBe packaged in a faux book. \nFocus on a particular city and year. \nInclude a dark, mysterious, or deceptive element in its gameplay. \nAccommodate at least 4-9 players. \nWe know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with Dark Cities Volume 1: Tortuga 1667!\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn April 2015 we raised $103,000 on Kickstarter with our first game, Salem. This game takes players into the dark world of the Salem Witch Trials. Players must hunt down the witches before becoming one! The game has now sold over 10,000 copies and is played around the world. \n\nWe are extremely proud to have delivered Salem on time to our backers! Here's what one of our backers had to say: \n\nI have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier. -Snuffles00\n\nSalem's Kickstarter Page\nSalem's Store Page\nSalem's Amazon Page (check out the reviews!)\n\nWe've made Salem available as an \"Add-on\" reward for this Kickstarter campaign.

Each chart will be researched for historical accuracy, featuring only the planes that a spotter or reconnaissance officer would see ( and would rather not see! ) flying in the skies overhead. \nThere will be three charts for each different theater of operation : \nPlus, a limited-edition chart designed strictly for Kickstarter supporters! \nThis spotting chart project began three years ago, when I fell in love with a poster I had seen in a great comedy called \"Father Goose\" ( 1964 ). The film features Cary Grant as an island bum who gets roped into becoming a plane spotter for the British Navy, working on a secluded island as their only early warning \"system\". Plane spotting charts are hanging on every wall in his little island hut next to his radio units.\nI loved the film and the charts so much that I wanted to buy some for myself.....but was not able to find any! Why? Because official plane spotting charts were never issued by the US military.....spotters instead had a manual that they used as a guide. Those posters were just a film prop. Shucks.  \nAnd so, I decided to make them for myself - after all, necessity is the mother of invention. Three plane spotting charts were designed, one for each of the main theaters of operation during WWII. Alas! the historic photo business that my sister and I operate kept me so busy that I was not able to complete the series. \nBut 2017 is the year this mission will be accomplished.....but only with your help!\n  Each chart takes me two days to make from preliminary research to final test prints. We have a stash of war paraphernalia that I use in the making of each print. The background is a scan of old faded WWII era paper; and the fonts and planes are from official spotting manuals. If The Spotting Chart Project is successfully funded the money raised will allow my sister and I to put our photo business on hold for three weeks to get this series completed. There's nothing like starting the new year with a resolution accomplished! \nThe three spotting charts that I had made previously have been up in my Etsy shop The Art of Byrd and have become my biggest selling prints. I wanted them to look authentic, and I guess they do because museums and even WWII reenactors have purchased these prints. These sales prove to us that there are WWII plane spotting enthusiasts as avid as we are! \n  Just who were plane spotters, anyway? Well, these were men and women volunteers, as well as servicemen, who kept their eyes to the skies constantly in watch of enemy aircraft flying overhead. They had a radio unit nearby and would alert the Army, Air Force, Navy, or RAF if an enemy plane was approaching. Spotters were vital personnel during the war and were stationed across London, the countrysides and coasts of England, throughout Europe, Burma, Australia, and even across America. The spotters in Hawaii and the Pacific islands often did double duty, scanning the seas for enemy vessels as well. \n  These are not prints from a generic photo lab, or mass-produced posters on cheap paper. We have a fleet of wide-format printers in our studio ( running a photo business has its boons! ) and I will oversee each print to make sure they are spot-on perfect for shipment. We only use the finest materials in our prints, and these will be printed on 230gsm premium matte paper with archival Chromalife inks. That means that these prints will still be around and looking great 100 years from now.... Now that's legend. \nEach chart is hand-cut to size. The 8\"x10\" prints will have no border, whereas the 16\"x20\" size will have a 1/4\" border around the edges to make it easier for matting and framing.\nThis is our first Kickstarter project but we have had years of experience in printing and handling customer orders because together we operate a historic photo reproduction business ( Silverbanks Pictures ) and a poster/map business ( Sylvester's Charts & Prints ). Customer service and excellent prints are our specialty!\nWe're a small squadron of two, but when we work together we are a crackerjack team and get every mission accomplished!\n  March 15th, 2017.  \nThe prints should be done by the second week of February, but we have a one month cushion just in case there are any delays in the printing/shipping process. We will be posting updates along the way and, of course, if at any time you have questions about the charts, feel free to contact us. We're never too busy to answer questions!\n  Thank you for supporting our project!

Send us a message! \n  The Mystery Add-On - This will be a specially designed print/art/poster only available for one week on Kickstarter ( this offer ends February 3rd )..... Why is it called the Mystery Add-On?? Because you won't be seeing a preview image of this poster! It will be a complete mystery purchase. This item hasn't been designed yet.....but it is sure to be something ripping! Once the Spotting Chart Project campaign is over, I'll start work on that mystery print and will post an image of it on the main project page. At that time, if you don't like it, you can exchange it for something else, or just ask for your money back. No risk involved....just a fun mystery purchase to enjoy!\nIf you spotted this, the very first Daily Target Add-On, today, then congratulations because it will only last until 12AM Midnight ( EST ) January 31st. This is a special add-on that you can request one day only....and today is the day! \n8\" x 10\" HISTORIC PHOTO REPRODUCTION  - $5\nA routine part of my and my sister's historic photo business ( Silverbanks Pictures ) involves collecting and cataloging scans of vintage negatives. Since I've been on a WWII history \"high\" these past weeks, I collected some really swell images of airplanes and pilots from the 1940s and then restored them so that they look as crisp as the day they were first taken. And yes, all of these photos date from the 1940s...even those gorgeous color shots. So what's the add-on? Well, for $5 you can request an 8\" x 10\" print of one of the images below ( add $15 for 16\"x20\" size ). If you want more than one, that's okay, too. These are printed on beautiful premium luster ( that's a pearly matte finish ) photographic paper and will be shipped along with your spotting charts. If you want one, make up your mind today because you won't be able to add these on tomorrow....the \"target\" will be destroyed! \n    It's time for another Daily Target Add-On! You've spotted it, so here is your chance to zero in on this daily special, an Italian Aircraft spotting chart, at a special discounted price....only $12. This 16\" x 20\" poster can be added to your pledge, but target it quickly because the offer ends at 6pm EST February 6th.....and it will not be one of the options available after the Kickstarter campaign ends! \n  It's time for the final Daily Target Add-on!! Since this is the last day of The Spotting Chart Project we're throwing in a looper! I had wanted to create a set of nautical spotting charts ( naval vessels, that is ) as a stretch goal but decided against it, so today I'm making up for that loss with this beautiful 20\" x 24\" poster print of PEARL HARBOR and the United States ships that were in harbor that fateful day of December 7th, 1941. \n Here's a closer view so you can see all the lovely little details.....\nThis Add-On will be available until the project ends ( wow, just 24 hours from now! ) for an added pledge of $15. It's a gorgeous print, with crisp lines and vibrant deep blue color. We hope you like it!! \nWe're just AMAZED at the support our Spotting Chart Project has received. Thank you to everyone who pledged to make this project a reality! \nIf this project reaches $1200....\nwe'd like to spice up your selection by adding an additional set of THREE spotting charts....this time featuring the war planes that flew over the skies of Britain between 1938-1945. \nIf the project reaches $2000.... \n...we'll add a dirty faded blue color option... just for those who want something different than the old paper look. \nWant more color?? \nSure! Everybody loves colors! If the project reaches $2500 we'll add another color option.....WWII olive green. It will match the color of your Jeep. \n If the project reaches $3000.....\n.....then KAZZAM!! We'll add the Burma Theater as yet another choice. This was crucial battleground in Asia and the roughest terrain that any soldier had to contend with. There were surprise attacks from the jungle as well as aerial attacks. Spotters hid throughout the mountains keeping their eyes open for these Japanese surprise dives and bombardments. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur project completion date - March 15th - already takes into account any minor delays such as paper supply shortage, running out of ink, computer repairs, etc. We'll keep you posted if any of these happen but we are well-stocked at the moment.

Made from AEROSPACE GRADE TITANIUM, it is amazingly strong and light-weight at just 0.7oz / 20grams. The ideal companion on any trip where weight and space are a consideration. The Muncher's versatility makes it an everyday carry for any adventurer or traveller, be it camping in your back yard to backpacking around the world.\nA Gift Certificate is available for download here to print at home, so you can give The Muncher as a gift.\nBoth spork and serrated knife are highly polished for an easy to clean finish. Because it is made of titanium you will experience no metallic smell or taste. Also, it does not rust like other metals.\nA hypalon pouch keeps the utensil safely stowed away. The carabiner allows it to be attached almost anywhere for safe keeping. The pouch stores a ferrocerium fire starting flint that can be used in conjunction with the angled edge of the can opener to create a spark to get your fire going wherever in the wilderness you might be.\nIn the middle of the utensil you will find a bottle opener which also functions as a handy potato peeler. Next to this is a can opener and chord cutter. The end of the utensil can be used in a variety of ways, be it a flat head screw driver, ply-bar for opening lids or even a box cutter for opening food packaging.\nWe are all set up with our manufacturing partner in Hong Kong that we have worked closely with for the last 5 years. They are experts in original equipment manufacturing, specialising in metal engineering. The Muncher will be stamped from 1.5mm sheet titanium and then CNC'd. It will be finished by polishing and sandblasting, giving it its unique high quality finish.\nThe pouch is made from a durable laser engraved hypalon material double stitched along either side with a riveted hole for the carabiner to attach.\nThe money raised from kickstarter will allow us to make the tooling and place an order for the initial production run.\nWith the \"Kiwi No.8 wire mentality\" (basically you can fix anything with a piece of fencing wire) Mark (Full Windsor founder) looked into how he could reduce the amount of gear you need when heading out into the whop-whops / outdoors / wilderness / whatever you wanna call it. He decided the spork was a great jumping off point, but surely more could be done! Listing the most commonly used tools involved around food and its preparation whilst in the middle of nowhere, he began the design process. \nWith functionality at the top of the checklist, every function of the multi utensil had to work great in its own right. With weight also being a major consideration, titanium was an obvious choice of material. After a year and a half of design and hundreds of tweaks later The Muncher (or the \"Kiwi Army Spork\" as we like to call it) was born.\nFull Windsor is an outdoor and cycle accessories brand working out of both San Francisco and the UK. We make unique gear that embraces the outdoors. Whether it be bike-packing around the world or your next micro-adventure out of town, for everyday use or into the wild. Our team is made up of curiously minded designers looking to create high quality gear that is unique and well thought through, both functionally and aesthetically. Founded in 2011 by award winning Kiwi product designer - Mark Windsor.\nWe have successfully launched both our Nutter and Breaker cycle multi tools previously on Kickstarter.

It will be the second deck of the Decoded History Series in which we\u2019ll explore the more interesting pieces of our history while at the same time making a unique experience by creating coded messages that are discreetly hidden within the design.\nThis deck will explore the conspiracy to reignite the Civil War by decapitating the heads of the Federal Government. It will also include information on the secret society known as the Knights of the Golden Circle and their rumored treasure.\n  As most people know, John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre the night of April 14, 1865. As time passes, fewer people realize that this was just the tip of the iceberg to a much larger plot.\nBooth's co-conspirators were Lewis Powell and David Herold, who were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward, and George Atzerodt who was tasked to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson.\nBy simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration, Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government thus reigniting the Civil War which ended only a few days earlier.\n        The Knights of the Golden Circle\nBelow is a map of Washington DC with a Knights of a Golden Circle template superimposed on top of it. As legend would have it, the KGC buried millions in gold across many secret locations to  finance a second Civil War. As means for future generations to locate these treasures, the KGC were known to carve treasure map templates into trees and rocks.\nThe template below would suggest that the Washington Monument (under construction at the time of the Civil War) would be an excellent hiding place to keep confederate gold safe, right under the nose of their enemy.\nWarning: Please don't disturb the Washington Monument and/or the land surrounding it. The probability of anything being there is pretty low.\nRise of a Nation Playing Cards\nEarly in 2016, the Barclay Mountain Co., released Rise of  a Nation. This deck was the first in the Decoded History Series. It was printed by the United States Playing Card Co. and can be found at the gits shops in Colonial Williamsburg Virginia and the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC.\nThis deck also featured Washington DC and the role secret societies had in forming our nation. The codes within the deck identified 10 locations within the nations capital. When the locations are looked at on a map, they create what's known as a tree of life.\n    Decoded History Series Future Projects\nOnce Divide of a Nation is produced we'll be focusing on the next two decks in the series, Call of a Nation based on the Franklin Roosevelt years in office and Fear of a Nation based on the assassination of John F Kennedy (and the rise of the cold war).\nPLAY\n\n  Notice on the video above how the eagle lines up perfectly with the lawn of the Capitol building.

In RobotLab the right move is usually playing your cards, not passing your turn. \nScalable Gameplay - RobotLab is designed for players as young as 6 with enough strategic depth that it\u2019s still fun & exciting for experienced tabletop gamers. You can start playing it with your kids when they are learning to read and understand games, and still be playing it with them when they\u2019re old enough to beat you easily. \nDeceptively Simple - There\u2019s one goal in RobotLab: build your robot first! While you\u2019re doing that your opponent has plenty of options to try and stop you. Anything from sneaking into your workshop and installing the wrong parts on your robot, to causing your robot to malfunction is fair game. However, with a little research, you can pull ahead.\n What's in the Game:\n Don't take our word for it, here's what other people had to say!\n      Unfiltered Gamer Review:\n BoardGameCloset Review: \n [toggle gaming] - playtest reactions:\nPLAY\n\n Review & Gameplay from LuckyPennyShop.com:\n  Ok, How do you play?\nWe're glad you asked!\nGoal: Be the first to build a robot of one color. You\u2019ll need One Head, Two Arms, and Two Legs\nCard Types\nThese parts are how you'll build your Robot. There are 5 colors and 3 part types: heads, arms, and legs!\n  These are cards that let you do things like look at extra cards or sabotage your opponent.\n Rules\nBuild - You can do ONE thing - Either play a Part or play an Action card. That\u2019s it! Just play one - it\u2019s that simple. \nDiscard - You can discard as many cards as you want from your hand as long as they are all the same color. You can also get rid of any action cards you don\u2019t want to keep. \nDraw - You end your turn by drawing cards! Simply draw enough cards to have 5 cards in your hand, and your turn is done.\nThese are Bonus Actions. They can be played at any time - even during your opponent's turn\nOutwit your fellow scientists, find the right parts and you'll be on your way to winning the accolades of the robotics community and the world!\n2-player game demo video: \n  THE REWARDS\nWe really want RobotLab to be a success.

Well if all that wasn't enough for you - don't fret! We do indeed have stretch goals! HERE THEY ARE!\n   So, you might be wondering... That Mad Scientist card; what does THAT do?\nHaving trouble finishing your robot? Stuck on a tough problem and don't know what to do next? Then bring in Devol Institute's resident scientist to help ya out.\nBut, be warned: He's spent way to many hours tweaking samoflanges, mixing pre-framulated amulite and adjusting roto-hydrators. So, he's a little off his rocker...\n  We reached our first Stretch Goal so we have added ONE copy of Mad Scientist to every deck of RobotLab. (We'll also make him part of the print-and-play reward.)\nGoal #1 - COMPLETE - 125% Funded: Mad Scientist Promo Card \nOur other two stretch goals result in a higher quality product for you. Since both of them add cost to our production; the goals are a bit higher.\nGoal #2 - COMPLETE - 3 Challenges Completed: Upgraded card stock from a Gloss Finish 270 GSM White Core to a super nice Linen Finish 300 GSM White Core. \nGoal #3 - 150% Funded: Upgraded packaging from a simple tuck box to a super sturdy, laminated, two-part, chipboard box.\n STRETCH GOAL CHALLENGES\nWith 9 days left in the campaign we unveiled 9 challenges that our fans can complete. For every three challenges completed we'll unlock one of our stretch goals.\nThese stack! So, now that we hit our funding level for Mad Scientist and at least 3 challenges are completed: Two Stretch Goals are unlocked. Just 3 more Challenges or $13,500 in total funding and ALL STRETCH GOALS will be unlocked!\n   3 Down!\nThe first 4 are all about how many fans we can get to follow us on various platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and BoardGameGeek. \nThe next 5 are all activities that you'll need to document and post on your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram accounts. \nJust be sure to tag us by using #RobotLabCG so we are sure to see what awesome thing you did.\nHere's the Full List of Challenges:\nSocial Challenges:\n500 Total Facebook Likes (Facebook Link)\n150 Total Twitter Followers (Twitter Link)\n250 Total Instagram Followers (Instagram Link)\nCOMPLETE! 50 Total BoardGameGeek Likes (BGG Link)\nActivity Challenges:\nCOMPLETE! 5 Robot Selfies (That's a selfie of you with a robot)\nCOMPLETE! 5 Robot Drawings (That's original drawings made by you - not just ANY robot drawing)\n3 Videos of fans doing the Robot (Ya know, the dance...)\n3 Videos of fans signing \"Mr Roboto\"\n3 Videos of fans impersonating a famous robot (Do your best Wall-E, Johnny 5, C-3PO, Terminator, etc...)\nREMEMBER: Tag your Photos and Videos with #RobotLabCG\n SHARE ROBOTS!\nJust high five one of these robots and they'll connect ya to our social stuff.\n                     Why are we doing this? \nWe love games and robots! Also, we think tabletop gaming is important to the world. It provides a great excuse to put down your phone, turn off the TV, and gather around a table with friends and family. \nThis Kickstarter not only helps make RobotLab a reality, but also jumpstarts our game company, XYZ Game Labs. Our mission is to make tabletop gaming accessible to more people. We want to design and publish entry-level games that are also enjoyable for experienced gamers. With our first game, we set out to make a high quality, simple to learn, super fun game that was great for kids and adults. We think RobotLab is that game. \nWe're using Kickstarter to get our game launched for 3 reasons:\nValidation: We believe that both Robots and this game are awesome. However, our opinion about that matters a lot less than yours. If you believe those things too, then back us and help us bring this game to life.\nExposure: In order to make tabletop gaming accessible to more people we have to do more than just design a super fun, adorable, easy to play but hard to master game - We also have to get into as many hands as possible. Kickstarter is a way for us to get exposure for the game and reach a large market.\nQuality: My dad used to say to me: \"Don't half-ass it son.\" Well, he was right. If you're going to do something: DO IT RIGHT. We've crunched the numbers, talked to production vendors and fulfillment houses, we've worked with exceptionally talented artists and consulted every game maker and industry expert that would return our phone calls. We've done everything we can to make this game look, feel, and play awesome. All of that does come at a price. It just so happens that price is the same as our Kickstarter Goal! \nSo back us and help us bring RobotLab: The Card Game to life!\n Hungry for more?

Additionally, we will be using Backerkit to help us process your pledges. These companies all have a great track record of success and experience with games similar to ours. We\u2019ve worked hard to make the most of our contacts in the industry and learn everything we can from them.\n\nWe\u2019ve crunched the numbers and are fully confident that, should our Kickstarter be funded, we\u2019ll be able to deliver to our backers on time AND within budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Love robots and just want to give us some support?

Most of the game actually occurs outside of the operating tent, at times when the flow of casualties has ebbed. Here you may fall in or out of love, fight the orders of ineffective top brass, set up pranks, help your South Korean allies, pick fights, seduce your way through the unit, pull rank, and much more. Can you find ways to relieve the mental stresses brought on by the war, and make it home with your sanity intact?\n+ Support MASHED at any level to get the full 200-page draft immediately! See the first backer-only update for the download link! +\n    \"Part game, part history lesson, MASHED captures the human drama of battlefield medicine within the context of the Korean War.\" - Marshall Miller, creator of The Warren\nWhen complete, MASHED will be a full-color 6\" x 9\" book with 200+ pages of content and illustrations. You also get digital copies of: seven character playbooks, multiple field guides and playsheets, and a 38-page calendar that covers June 1950 to July 1953 (the course of the war).\nSupport MASHED at any level to get the full 200-page draft immediately! (Go to the first backer-only update to see the download link.) This 'beta' version is already more than 90% complete in an attractive layout, but it can still be improved, and I encourage you to give your feedback and make it even better!\n  \"MASHED weaves history and military procedures through the game in a totally fitting way, doesn't dwell on or ignore the challenges of the era for modern eyes, and features a brilliant use of countdown clocks and wounds. I cannot wait to see this finished and on the table.\" - Meguey Baker, creator of 1001 Nights, co-designer of Apocalypse World\nMASHED is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3+ players, one of whom serves as the Commanding Officer (CO). A single game session can be as short as two hours, or extended into longer multiple sessions to eventually cover all three years of the Korean War.\nMASHED informs and educates through play, helping the reader learn more about the Korean War and the costs that war imposes on those who live through it. However, as Joss Whedon once said \"Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough, but then, for the love of God, tell a joke.\" With that in mind, the book covers the entire war in seven phases, with 30+ threats, 80+ events, and dozens of story questions featuring light comedy, gallows humor, and mature situations, all of which can be combined in new ways to create a multitude of scenarios.\n  \"MASHED uses a system that beats down the characters so they find solace in each other, places it into historical fictional context in which you're all the foreigners, and primes you for dramatic and challenging play.\" - Fraser Simons, creator of The Veil\nThe rules are based on Vincent and Meguey Baker\u2019s innovative Apocalypse World game engine and inspired by other Powered by the Apocalypse games such as Night Witches, Blades in the Dark, Monsterhearts, tremulus, and The Warren. The core mechanic involves rolling two 6-sided dice and adding a single character stat number against results of 10 (success), 7-9 (success with complications), or 6 (things get worse). \nMajor mechanical additions and differences include: Roles (personalities with unique moves), Stress points to affect personalities and change Roles during play, and medical moves with triggers that reinforce the need for teamwork during operating room events.\nWhen an Operating Room event occurs, you and your surgical team use medical moves (Assist, Diagnose, Prescribe, and Treat) in conjunction with a special patient playsheet. You use moves to try and stabilize the patient before the countdown runs out, but failed moves can impose consequences and complications that you'll have to work together to resolve.\nWhen you create your character, you use one of seven included Playbooks that provide a template for your character. Each playbook covers one of the MASH's medical or other Army personnel types, and includes a variety of options for you to customize your character. Playbooks include:\nThe Angel - A surgical nurse, general duty nurse, or nurse-anesthetist.\nThe Corpsman - A medical orderly or technician.\nThe Cowboy - An aviation specialist (pilot) or motor pool head (driver).\nThe Cutter - A surgeon.\nThe Doc - A physician treating illnesses or mental traumas.\nThe Grunt - An enlisted soldier without medical training.\nThe Padre - An ordained Army chaplain of any faith. \nCharacters also choose from one of eight character Roles that represent their personality, each of which contain unique moves (actions). Your playbook stays the same throughout the game, but accumulating Stress points can change your role, thus representing how the war affects your personality. You can embrace the transition to a new role or try to relieve this stress by taking actions appropriate for your current role. Your Role also affects your interactions with other players and how well you're able to connect with them. Roles include:\nThe Bully - People annoy you. You're all about intimidation and fighting.\nThe Casanova - You love sex. You're all about influence and casual love.\nThe Clown - You're the class clown. Laughter is your best medicine. \nThe Gray - You blend in. You're all about knowledge and avoidance.\nThe Misanthrope - You hate people. You're all about manipulation.\nThe Operator - You scrounge. You're all about deals and schemes. \nThe Sky Pilot - You pray. You're all about morals and temptation.\nThe Stickler - You want it done right. You're all about rules and regs.\n  If you want to add more books, or the optional card decks, to your pledge, it's easy! Just select the appropriate pledge level, then manually increase the dollar amount to cover any combination of add-ons. For example, if you want the limited $99 vintage signed edition as well as a standard softcover and the card decks, select the $99 pledge level to reserve your limited edition and add +$37 (+$28 softcover and +$9 cards) for a total of $136. I'll also ask you to confirm your order (via the Kickstarter pledge manager) before I ship. \nAdd More Books\n+1 Softcover: Add $28 to your base pledge to add one (more) softcover to your rewards.\n+1 Hardcover: Add $38 to your base pledge to add one (more) hardcover to your rewards. (You can't add the signed edition. If you want it, you'll need to select that pledge level.)\nAdd the Card Decks\nAdding $9 to your base pledge lets you order all three MASHED card decks at print cost from a Print On Demand supplier. These cards are optional and are not required to play the game. When I finish card production, I'll provide online discount codes so you can order any or all of the decks you want, in any quantity. The supplier will print and ship the cards directly to you (you pay print cost and shipping at that time).The print cost for Kickstarter backers will be around $5 for each full-color card deck (poker size; 2.5\" x 3.5\") printed on premium stock. \nYou'll also get the PDF deck files (featuring a single card per page). This format should work best for anyone who wants to use the cards with Roll20 or other similar virtual tabletop programs.\nOffering the cards as separate add-ons, instead of part of the base pledge, is actually better for everyone. Even with the small $9 add-on to help pay for the card art and creative design work, you're saving about $6 or more by getting the decks at print cost instead of waiting until after the Kickstarter, when they'll be released at a higher price. It also lessens my workload so I can focus on production, and I won't have to 'hold' your book to ship with the cards.\nCamp Card Deck\nAs you play, you'll be introducing new camp locations into the game. Rather than hand-drawing a map of your MASH compound, simply place the appropriate location card (Hospital Tent, Mess Hall, Nurse Quarters, Latrines, Minefield, etc.) on the table in relation to the others. It's a fun and easy way to generate your own unique camp layout! Includes 52-64 cards (est).\nCasualty Card Deck\nDraw a random civilian or soldier card (U.S., U.N., South Korean, North Korean, and Chinese) to generate random patients or non-player character (NPC) encounters. Includes 52 cards (est).\nWound Card Deck\nDraw a random wound card (like a 4-harm bullet wound with a compound fracture), then pair it with a casualty card to rapidly generate surgical patients. Includes 44-52 cards (est).\n  ...there are no 'stretch goals'. \nWhy? Because I want to complete the game and get it to you as soon as I can. As a one-man company, I can best do that by avoiding complicated reward tiers and stretch goals that would extend the distribution process and increase costs. This lets me keep this project running as smoothly as possible.\nNew backer rewards and new backer-only previews will be revealed as we move ahead, but these won't be tied to artificial stretch goal amounts. You'll get them no matter what funding goal we reach together!\n+ Thank our Troops: Backers have the option to also include the name of a relative who served/is serving in the armed forces, to go in a special thank-you section separate from the backer names. See the October 1st update for more information.\n+ Field Guide Preview: See the October 3rd update for a download link to a Commanding Officer 'field guide' that lets you keep track of all the player - and dozens of NPC - positions in your MASH camp.\n+ Print-On-Demand Extras (NEW!): Backers will receive discount codes to order printed compilations of the playbooks, field guides, calendar, and other digital extras! See the October 10th update for more information.\n+ Calendar Preview: See the October 18th update for a download link to the draft of the 1950-1953 calendar.

In the process, you can play cards to ruin other settlements or try to protect your own. \nHere's what it looks like in the flesh\n   It's a fairly simple game to learn.\nNUKED doesn't have attack point vs. defense system, there\u2019s not a ton of stats to keep up with, it's more like paper rock scissors. \nTeam Play\nYou can pair up and play in teams, or in teams vs single players. The plus side is that the team can pool their resources, protecting each other if they're attacked and play settlers faster. The downside is that a team must collect twice as many settlers to win the game.\n      Tempting Fate\nThe other element are the Fate Cards. The Fate Cards are a separate stack of cards. When a Fate Card is pulled, the player reads the card aloud and then has to do what is on the card. One card might make you switch hands with another player. Another might allow you to play any settler card in your hand. Fate Cards can be pulled by any player once per round, and in any order, so it doesn\u2019t have to be their turn to pull the card. It can really change the dynamic of a game and make for some pretty hilarious and fun moments.\nThe game can change depending who's playing.\n The game can be measured and tactical or chaotic and crazy, it all depends on the player. It's simple enough for kids but interesting enough for a group of friends or for a party. There's a lot of ways to play it.\nHow Long does a game last?\nA standard 4-player game usually lasts around 35 - 40 minutes. Larger party games can last hours. Typically, pairing off into teams makes the game go faster.\n Check out this video for more info on card types and gameplay.\nPLAY\n\nHow did it get started?\nWe heart games. Card games. Board Games. Video games. All of the games. We were playing one night when it suddenly dawned on us. \nWe should make our own game! So, we started with some pretty basic ideas:\n1. It should be fun. \n2. It should be easy enough to play with the family but fun enough to keep a bunch of touch screen junkies engaged and away from reddit long enough to finish a game.\n3. It should be small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse. \n4. It should make you want to not just win, but destroy everyone else.\nHonestly, that's probably not what we were thinking at the time we came up with it, but that's what we've got now! Through trial and error, our game became more and more fun.

Having a cat in one hand and a box in the other he announces that he finally cracked the wonders of quantum physics. \nConfused you listen to him as he tells you that as soon as he puts the cat into the box nobody can say if it is still alive or already dead. After he finished his elaborate lecture on cats and boxes he finally puts the cat into the box. Before leaving the room he orders you and your colleagues to watch the box closely.  \nAs soon as your boss has left the room you turn to the other assistants. You offer a wager on who can guess best how long the cat is already dead. After accepting the others decide to meet back in one week's time to determine the winner.\nSneaky as you are you are already planning to come back at night and take a peek. After all who deserves to win more than you?\nIn Dead Cat, you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead while misleading your opponents.\nWhen it's your turn you have two options: you either look into the box and change your bet, or you announce that the cat is dead. \nIf you decide to look into the box, you take a card from the box deck, look at it in secret... \n ...and put it on top of the time deck.\nNow bet on how long the cat is already dead, take your betting die and change it to another side, you choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.\nHere is the tricky part though: your bet should be as close to the dead cat as possible but on the other hand you don\u2019t want to give away it\u2019s position or the fact that you might not have seen one. For this reason, you also want to consider the dice of the other players who might have already seen a dead cat. \nAfter you are done the game moves to the next player.\n If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends but you can\u2019t change your bet.\nYou start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case, the player with the closest bet to the number of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest number wins. In the case of a tie both player receive a point.\nThe winning player or players receive a scoring token to keep track of their points. Whoever scores four points first, wins. \nYou can find the complete write up of the rules here.\n   16 ALIVE CAT CARDS\n 4 DEAD CAT CARDS \n THE BOX\n    The game design is inspired by a thought experiment of Erwin Schrodinger, an Austrian physicist responsible for significant developments in quantum theory.\nSince quantum physics is a rather complicated discipline, he developed imaginative scenarios to help non-physicists understand it. The most famous of these thought experiments is the cat in the box, better known as \u201cSchrodinger\u2019s Cat\u201d.\nHe imagined a cat in a box together with a capsule of nerve gas. The Nerve gas would be released randomly based on the decay of a radioactive isotope. That meant that as long as nobody would look into the box nobody could say if the cat is alive or dead. He concluded that the cat was at the same time dead and alive and only looking into the box and observing the cat would make one of the two states reality.\nSchrodinger wanted to explain a phenomenon that is causing physicists a lot of trouble even until today. If you observe a tiny particle you are changing its state; by observing it, you influence it, and can't determine its \u201cneutral\u201d state.\n LIZARD LOUNGE REVIEW BY\nROLL FOR CRIT PODCAST\nBEARDED MEEPLE GAME REVIEW\n Dice and Sorcery\n      He Does Not Throw Dice was founded with one particular goal in mind: unifying the design of game mechanics and graphics.

Our printer has informed us that production of Dead Cat is finished and we are ready to ship the game. Further down you can find a picture of the finished games but before we come to that some short notes on shipping. The games will be picked up from the factory in China and shipped via container freight to our UK distributor. This will take around four weeks.

We hope you enjoy your break.\nThis week we received the first pictures of produced components from our printer and of course we want to share them with you. The two pictures we received so far are of the cards and the cubes used for scoring. We got a question earlier this week about the colour of the cubes as the original picture we used showed black ones and the recent ones natural wood colour. We decided to switch from black to natural as it fitted the style of the game better."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Print and Play Release", "update_content": "Hey all,\nYou should have received an email earlier saying that you will be able to finally download the print and play files for Dead Cat.
