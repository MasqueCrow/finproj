[{"backer": "Ronny Anderssen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker.

You discover the tomb is inhabited by an undead queen and her spectral knights. In your exploration you have learned that she was murdered by the patriarchal structures of her own holy order. The method of her execution has denied her eternal rest. She plans murderous vengeance against the living but offers mercy under two conditions. First, help install her as an eternal monarch upon the religious throne. Second, eradicate the bloodline of those who betrayed her. What do you do? \nDungeons & Dilemmas is a collection of system agnostic techniques for designing dungeon-based adventures that engage the players on an emotional and ethical level. The presented process approaches dungeons as their own unique narrative structure, and the encounters within them as moral puzzles.\nDungeons & Dilemmas treats deeper emotional engagement as an additive dimension of play on top of the exploration, hazard avoidance, monster fighting, and treasure collection elements of traditional fantasy adventure games. All the ideas, tools, and techniques presented speak to the strengths of existing rule systems in common use. GMs and players won't have to hand-wave away or house rule their games to accommodate this material.\nFor several years, I have been using these techniques to keep players emotionally engaged and ethically challenged with adventures that reach beyond the stereotype of \"murder hobos\" and excuses to just \"kill things and take their stuff.\" #ZineQuest has provided a unique opportunity for me to share these ideas with you and hopefully help you think about the dungeon fantasy format in a slightly unique and fulfilling way.\nDungeons & Dilemmas is particularly well suited to games like: \nTorchbearer\nDungeon World\nAny of the numerous OSR-style games such as  Old-School Essentials \nAnd, of course, the current edition of the most popular fantasy adventure game.\nProject Structure\nThe current plan is a 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched booklet with black and white interior.

It never fails to surprise me when a pop-up unfolds into 3D space from seeming nothingness. I hope you guys will have some of the fun that I had when I got to put these together. These kits are part miniature model, part 3d puzzle, and all paper-craft! As you build them, you'll be guided by the instructions and labels found in the kit, and also full instructional walk-through videos where I build them with you step-by-step. I put a lot of work into making sure these designs would work consistently and look good. It makes me happy every time I see them!\nThese pop-ups are a great way to fill your table up with neat working terrain that doesn't break the bank and is easy to carry around and store.\nThis time around, we are only offering the digital files. That being said, these files are designed to be printed on both A4 and American standard 8.5 x 11 inch letter-sized paper. All of the files (at least those that are completed at the end of the Kickstarter, including the first 5 settings) will be made available to all backers as soon as the Kickstarter funds are distributed to us (Usually within 2 weeks of the project end date).\nAfter printing, the pages will look something like this:\nYou'll need additional supplies such as a hobby knife, double-sided tape, and backing material in order to assemble your pop-ups.  Once you put them together, you will be able to combine them into fantastic miniature worlds!\nOur initial funding goal will cover the design of the first five settings and one flat terrain peice. These will include the Mageboat, the Market Square, the Traveler's Wagon, the Castle Wall, Charlie's Castle, and the Mysterious Grate Flat Hex. \n Mageboat\nThe Mageboat is a watercraft designed to be steered and propelled by magical means. At a 28mm scale it would measure 50 feet from bow to stern. Take your adventures to the high seas with this sturdy vessel!\n Market Square\nAt the Market Square, you can find food, drink, weapons, and a host of other curios. This is probably where that stolen painting wound up, now coated in a thick layer of dust, after nearly 2 decades.\n Traveler's Wagon\nThe travelers are the continent's most prolific traders, and are always a welcome sight. But this cart seems to have been left unattended. Its team of horses and usual occupants are mysteriously missing. It was probably the giant ants. Again. Yes . . . that was what happened.\n Castle Wall\nThe castle wall is the perfect place to hatch a \"storming the castle\" plot. All you need is a wheelbarrow and a holocaust robe. You probably already have both! Print out and assemble 6 copies of the castle wall and you'll have yourself a stronghold!\nCharlie's Castle\nCharlie's castle is a very small castle (more of a fort really) that is mostly used as a customs checkpoint these days. It's fortunate that you adventurers came along, you can clear out the tribe of goblins that have set up camp within its walls. \n Mysterious Grate Flat Hex\nNot technically a pop-up, this hex tile provides some space for your characters to cross on their way to somewhere else. Because is it really a journey if no one journeys? Also, what's going on with that mysterious ground hole?\nWe are excited about making as many pop-up settings as we can to be included in this kit! That's why we are going to keep adding more stretch goals as these ones are met. Our current plan is that every additional thousand dollars pledged to the kickstarter adds a setting to the digital kit!\nCORRUPTED SHRINE: $3000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThis shrine honors the great philosophers and scientific minds that together founded the Elipsiconian council. Unfortunately, the shrine has lately become the site of several unexplained deaths. It's up to you to discover it's dark secrets! (This setting is a redesign using the basic structure of the Gazebo from our previous Pop-up Kickstarter.)\nTRINKET SHOP and WATERFRONT FLAT HEX: $4000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nWhere do all of these magic amulets and stuff come from? The trinket Shop! Full of magical whosits, whatsits, and at least 20 cursed thingamabobs, the trinket shop is the perfect place to get objects that may or may not offer any magical protection at all.\nThis flat hex serves as a transition from land to water. Here you can fish, swim, and relax as you prepare to head back into the nearby ruins.\nLONE TOWER : $5000 Stretch Goal  - REACHED!\nThis lonely tower is where the orcish sniper is holed up, shooting hapless travelers as they move along the nearby roadway. You guys should head up there and make sure he (OR SHE! Petra asks why it couldn't be a female orcish sniper. Girls can be snipers too!) is stopped. \nTHE DOCKS : $6000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThese serviceable docks are where people are talking about when they say \"Meet me down by the docks.\" Here the men of the sea come ashore, some boisterously headed for the tavern, others slinking through the shadows like rats.\nThe Pale Tree : $7000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nIn the woods near my childhood home, there was a large dead tree. It served as a landmark for my brothers and I as we hiked through the woods to the river. I always imagined there was more to that tree. Was it truly dead? If so, why didn't it ever fall?\nThe Mausoleum : $7479 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nAlthough the manor it once served has long ago burned to the ground, the mausoleum still stands, relatively untouched by time. Recently, the villagers have been hearing an unnatural wailing that seems to be coming from within. It's probably just some surly teenage half-elves, but the mayor would like you to check it out. (The Mausoleum is a redesign of the basic structure of the wooden fort from our first pop-up Kickstarter.)\n\nThe Tavern : $9000 Stretch Goal\n(Rough prototype pictured here) The local watering hole is a great place to gather information or simply regroup after a long day of spider-fighting. This pop-up is designed so that the roof folds back, creating an upper platform and allowing easy access to the interior of the tavern. \n\nAs we reach these goals, more will be added to the kickstarter. We already have some pretty awesome stuff planned, but we also want your suggestions for the terrain you'd like to see in the set!\n$18 Recolored version of Pop-Ups from our original Pop-UpKickstarter\nThis set includes PDF files to create 8 pop-up hexes, 1 large two-hex setting, and 3 smaller diamond settings that can be combined into a single hex. This version will be recolored to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original colored and uncolored versions.\n$10 Retextured version of Pop-Ups from our Halfling Adventurers Kickstarter\n(No pictures of this yet)\nThis set includes PDF files to create 4 pop-up hexes and 1 flat hex. This version will be retextured to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original version.\nWe are excited to get these pop-up files completed and have them in your hands so you can make them too!

You further acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the order (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented on Kickstarter.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nTypically, import duties are paid up front as part of your shipping costs (which is what \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d means), however, there are certain countries where regulations prevent advance payment by a third party, and you may be responsible to pay customs taxes directly.**\n\n**These countries include, but are not limited to the following: Central and South America (including Brazil), Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All customers in these locations must handle their own tariffs, and they order at their own risk, not ours. For Brazil in particular, we suggest you have your product shipped to an address of someone you know outside Brazil who plans on travelling there to hand deliver.\n\nYou are also responsible for providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAs per the terms stated on Kickstarter, a full refund will be provided if the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.\n\nOtherwise such a refund will be at our exclusive discretion and will be net of handling costs, Kickstarter commissions and credit card processing fees (15%).\n\nIf you fail to check out and pay for your order, including shipping costs, before the posted payment deadline, you may be forfeiting your products. Unclaimed games will be released after the closing date to online and retail sales since we lose money on unclaimed games due to storage fees.\n\nRefunds and/or cancellation requests will only be considered before we set the print run size for mass manufacturing with our factory in China, which takes place upon the posted payment deadline for the Pledge Manager.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "8-Bit America", "descp": "Get a copy of 8-Bit Attack that is ALREADY printed and ready to be shipped!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

We have some graphic design work left for the rule book and the back of the box, but we don\u2019t see any potential delays being caused by these tasks.

Roger, by the way, said not to do it! \nThe magazine covers, or fuses, content on all types of gaming including retro, modern, Indie, table top and even toys and there have been 7 issue to date that have been hugely successful with issue #1 selling over 1,250 copies and the others not too far behind.\nEach issue has bespoke artwork, not found anywhere else - it is created specifically for the magazine by Trevor Storey (issue #2 onwards) based on an article or an idea that inside the magazine. The issue #1 cover was produced by Wil Porter - he of Super Play covers for Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) magazine.\nTo continue the idea of the Crash and ZZap! 64 annuals also produced by us, the idea of a FUSION annual was always in the mind - so here it is.  \nThe annual is 120 pages in length and A5 in size, hardback and is colour throughout with high quality 135gsm glossy paper inside just like our Crash and ZZap! 64 Annuals. \nThe cover is shown below and is a Bladerunner type space scene - the first time a cover is not directly  related to content inside, it just looks great. The cover is also drawn by Trevor Storey:  \nThe quality of the annual is exactly the same as the Crash and ZZap! 64 Annual in terms of paper thickness and feel - this annual is not A4 but A5 so will fit nicely in backpacks and bags for reading on long journeys.\nWithout giving away too much of what the inside looks like, here are some double page spreads of what you will find inside to give you a taste of what to expect (remember there are 120 pages in total): \nWe also have a great interview with RJ Michael and features written by The Oliver Twins (Philip and Andrew), Dave Perry (The Games Animal), Stoo Cambridge (Sensible Software), Simon Butler (Ocean Software) and many, many more!\n\u00a310K Stretch Goal\nEach backer will get a 52-page ZX Fusion issue that concentrates just on the ZX Spectrum if we hit the \u00a310K mark.\nChris MacAuley\nChris McAuley broke into the comic book scene last year as a colourist for Marvel and 2000AD. Under the watchful eye of comic book legend John Charles he has worked on characters such as Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk and Judge Dredd. His work recently featured in the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art . Here we have 2 original images for Fusion - they will be signed by Chris and limited to 25 prints of each.\nImage #1\nImage #2\nPosters, canvasses, aluminium prints of each individual cover - just pick the perk you would like then tell us in the questionnaire sent after the Kickstarter which image you would like. I will include multiple perks so you can pick a selection of merchandise with the same image. In the Updates I will let you know to add further perks of the same kind with other images on them.\nSo as an example of the perks on offer with the imagery above...\nPicture Acrylic Block - 6\"x 4\" \nCanvas - 16 x 12\"\nCushion\nAcrylic Photo Print - 12\" x 8\"\nHere is an example of one of these with the ZZap! 64 2019 Annual:\nBoxed Framed Print - 12\" x 8\"\n\nAluminium Prints - 10\"x 7\"\nBinders\n A FUSION branded binder with issue #1 to #6 inside:\n Fusion Retro Books are responsible for producing high quality retro books that follow two distinct series paths.

Return to District 9 and relive the three days of the film from a whole new perspective. Lead your Faction through the alien slum in a search for the tech that will give you the edge. Salvage the most technology, take control of the district, and claim your victory!\nDistrict 9: The Boardgame is a Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE!\nIf this is your first time on Kickstarter - please check out our handy guide.\nThere are three phases in the game that represent the same three days in the film. There are key moments in the film which act as a timing mechanism for each phase. \nDay 1: Wikus is moving around the District evicting Prawns from their homes. When he locates and is infected by the Alien Canister the day will come to an end.\nDay 2: Wikus starts transforming into an Alien and roams the District hiding and looking for answers. Other Characters from the film appear including Christopher Johnson, the day ends when the both of them meet.\nDay 3: The Alien Dropship crashes into the District and Wikus suits up in the Mech destroying anything in his path. The day and the game will end when Players take down the Mech. \nYou need to make sure you are fully equipped before entering the District. Spend Influence to add Crew and upgrade Equipment on your Vehicle to increase your Strength and Defense stats.\nYou will need to get around the District in your search for Alien Technology. Spend an Action to move your Vehicle and Units around the District, Zone by Zone.\nTensions in the District are rising. As an action, Players may engage other Factions, Units and Prawn threats in your Zone.  There are no dice in District 9: The Boardgame, the fate of combat is resolved through the flip of a card.\nThe Evict and Claim actions allow you to pick up the Alien Technology and add them to your Vehicle. Prawn will start to emerge and may get hostile as you evict them from their homes and claim their technology. \nCheck out our Rulebook!\n5-6 Player Expansion rules\nFor more information and naming the card - see Update #13.\n\nThe scale of the pieces in the game alongside a card.

This universal resource and its collection of 70 places characters might visit in the course of their adventure went on, in fact, to become Skirmisher\u2019s most successful title and a Platinum bestseller at the popular DriveThruRPG retail site. \nWe designed City Builder as a resource that storytellers could use to create fun and believable communities, and interesting and compelling places within them, for their game settings. Altogether it contained guidelines for creating communities of all sorts and sizes and entries for dozens of different kinds of places characters might visit or spend time at, from taverns and inns to temples and guilds, organized into 10 thematic categories (i.e., Craftsman, Entertainment, Professional, Tradesman, Mercantile, Service, Scholarly, Religious, Governmental, and Underworld Places). \nAs successful as City Builder became for us, it was still one of our earlier titles and eventually did not represent what we were capable of as a company in terms of writing, editing, layout, design, art, or access to technology. Our awareness that City Builder could be even greater was, in fact, our motivation for creating what we are now calling the Platinum Edition of the book and, in doing so, taking it to the next level and turning it into a publication that is representative of where we are today. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nWith the Platinum Edition of City Builder we have created a dramatically improved version of the original book and upgraded it in every way possible to make it more user-friendly, enjoyable to read, and visually appealing. As part of this we have: \nCompletely redesigned the book to make it full color and give it a more contemporary and accessible look; \nExpanded the book from 176 to 192 pages (which, if all Stretch Goals are unlocked, will be further expanded to approximately 222 pages); \nThoroughly revised all of the text, to include expanding and reediting it as necessary and reorganizing the contents of some of the entries or their places within the book; \nMade entries more standardized and parallel in structure; \nAdded information to entries when applicable about how they might be approached in unique ways by various fantasy races; \nAdded three completely new entries for specific places; and, \nReplaced the original disparate collection of images with a suite of more than 100 new illustrations that give the book an even nicer and more cohesive look and which have a complementary style reminiscent of Renaissance-era manuscripts like those created by Leonardo da Vinci. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nThis new edition of our most popular title is now an even more essential asset to storytellers creating villages, towns, cities, and other sorts of communities for ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and fantasy settings. We sincerely believe that the Platinum Edition of City Builder has a place on every game master\u2019s bookshelf and have made every effort for them to want it to be. And if we exceed our basic funding goals for this project there is even more we will do with it! \nHere is a preview of what's to come.\nBackers that pledge enough for a print copy of City Builder will receive a code for an at-cost print copy fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.com \u2014 print on demand costs of $16 have already been deducted from the cost of the reward. This will allow backers to enter their shipping details and order at their leisure, and helps us keep costs down for everyone while delivering your rewards reliably and quickly. \nPDFs will be fulfilled with a complimentary download code from DrivethruRPG.com as well.\nFollowing are a number of stretch goal rewards we will provide to backers of the Platinum Edition of City Builder if we exceed our basic funding goals for it. They include a suite of 12 full-page original images by fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and a number of new places by game developers Michael O. Varhola, Clint Staples, and William T. Thrasher in addition to the 70 that currently appear in the book. \n$4,000: 12 Additional Full-Page Illustrations. If we exceed our basic funding goals by just $1,000 we will commission 12 full-page, full-color illustrations by noted fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and use them in place of the historic fine art images that currently appear at the beginning of the Introduction and Chapters 1-11. \nSketches by Amanda Kahl of some of the images that will appear as chapter heads in the book.\n$5,000: Pilgrimage Route (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether located entirely within cities or stretching through the lands between them, trails connecting religious places and walked by heroes, deities, and demigods can be great venues for quests of all sorts. \n$6,000: Tournament Ground (new Entertainment Place; Clint Staples). From Medieval jousting fields to athletic facilities like Olympia, tournament grounds can be places for characters to both enjoy spectacles and test their mettle against others. \n$7,000: Observatory (new Scholarly Place; William T. Thrasher). Knowing if the stars are right for launching quests, understanding constellations, and interpreting astrological phenomena are among the things that might lead characters to visit observatories of various sorts. \n$8,000: Farm (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Agriculture is the basis of most civilizations and farms among their most common features and are, consequently, places characters are likely to visit in the course of their adventures. \n$9,000: Caravanserai (new Service Place; Clint Staples). From fortified rustic inns to walled campgrounds in deep deserts, secure rest areas along trade routes are often vital resources for everything from merchant caravans to adventurous characters travelling from one land to another. \n$10,000: Mortuary (new Tradesman Place; William T. Thrasher). Properly preparing the deceased for burial or whatever other way their remains will be disposed of is important in all cultures (and can be even more critical in worlds where the dead do no always remain quiet). \n$11,000: Hermitage (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola): From hollow trees, rough caves, and lonely ruins, to neat woodland cottages, places used to shelter and nurture a spiritual environment for religious ascetics might be either deliberately visited or stumbled upon by characters in the course of their explorations. \n$12,000: Laundry (new Service Place; Clint Staples). Characters who have to look their best and rid themselves of dust from the road or the blood of their foes might need to visit laundries (which can themselves serve as venues for interesting encounters and adventures). \n$13,000: Water Feature (new Service Place; Michael O. Varhola). From natural oasis and springs to ornate fountains erected in city squares, places where people can obtain fresh water are essential to communities of all sorts and sizes. \n$14,000: Mint (new Craftsman Place; Jim Clunie). Coinage is one of hallmarks of sophisticated mercantile societies and the places devoted to creating money are among those most closely guarded from bandits, foreign agents, and other enemies. \n$15,000: Trade Fair (new Mercantile Place; Michael O. Varhola). Seasonal fairs where merchants meet to trade goods from different lands are key to the economies of communities and the countries of which they are part, and can also have important religious and entertainment aspects. \n$16,000: Animal Trainer (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether they need to purchase wardogs and mounts or have creatures like griffons and dragons trained, characters will have to visit the facilities of animal trainers of various sorts. \n$17,000: Map Maker (new Craftsman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Characters needing to navigate their way across foreign lands or distant seas may seek information about such strange places from those skilled at creating maps of all sorts. \n$18,000: Colosseum (new Entertainment Place; Michael O. Varhola): Purpose-built amphitheaters used for everything from gladiatorial combats to mock naval battles are among the places built by affluent societies to entertain their populations. \n$19,000: Taxidermy Shop (new Craftsman Place, Michael O. Varhola). Whether they want to have monsters they have slain preserved for posterity or more effective animation, or learn about obscure creatures they expect to encounter, characters might find themselves visiting the workshops of taxidermists. \n$20,000: \u201cIn the Footsteps of Hercules\u201d Companion Book. This specific example of a Pilgrimage Route will be at least twice as long as a regular entry of this sort (e.g., 3,000-4,000 words). It will include an overview of the trail and its history, synopsis of its twelve stages and the prevailing terrain and conditions associated with them, entries for all the major communities along it, and a number of adventure hooks. It will be system-free and compatible with any traditional fantasy campaign setting. \n$21,000+: For every $1,000 from this point onward we will add one new specific place that can be found along Footsteps of Hercules pilgrimage route (e.g., a Temple devoted to Hercules, a pilgrim Hostel established in the ruins of an ancient citadel, a Shrine dedicated to the goddess Hera, the Tournament Ground established by Hercules for the Olympic Games). Each will include a detailed description, information about non-player characters associated with it, a custom map/floorplan, a custom full-color illustration, and two or three adventure hooks.

Wouldn't it be nice if they couldn't wait to play around in your world? If they were pushing you to spend more time in the land you create?\nThat's why I developed these downtime procedures over decades of play and now I can share it with you!\nWhat's in it? \nSystems that motivate players\nSimple usable procedures that work\nCreativity and inspiration for adventure\nNo longer will your players wonder what their characters should do with all their gold. It includes clear, common-sense rules for everything from starting a cult, making sacrifices to gods, to hiring mercenaries and building vehicles and castles.\nGoing to an arena fight? Take seconds to determine the purse, peruse mechanics to handle the arena crowd, pick some ideas for interesting arenas, and select an opponent like the Necrourge: a master of the dark arts of necrourgy, who raises the bodies of traitors or other criminals after they have been forced to fight in the arena and died. \nI've got a vision of usable downtime procedures that motivate players and provide inspiration to Dungeon Masters collected in a published volume. I want one for my table. But I don't have the funds to hire a cover artist. So I'm Kickstarting this to pay Skullfungus (\"I draw dungeons, their inhabitants and everything in between\") to create a beautiful cover. The book is written, layout is effectively complete, and nearly all of the interior art is finished. \nWhat's it for?\nThe downtime goals give agency to players, and let them build a dynasty. Imagine a group eager to explore your world because they have their own plans! These objective procedures give players tools that fire a desire to dive into your creative world, discover its detailed history, and make their mark on it.\nIt gives your players the tools to make their wildest ideas come to life, without breaking your campaign or your suspension of disbelief, all the while driving them to adventure in your world. On Downtime and Demesnes is filled with tools that work. Build a flying ship, enchant it; or build a wizards tower and raise fortifications in the surrounding lands. All with simple, scalable, rules. \nThis is a book used in every game you run. Your next campaign, the one after that, the one after that. . . Not one wasted word. Every page is crammed with content and creativity. No filler. Tools that let players build castles and control land, without disassociated mechanics. This is the stronghold book you've been looking for. \nCurious about the content? Check out the table of contents from the book. Want to see what's written? Back the project and read the art free PDF.\nWhat are the Details?\nThere are two versions, one for basic Dungeons & Dragons, compatible with classic games, and one for 5th edition games. I play both kinds of games, and I needed rules for this while running my megadungeon using Basic and Expert Dungeons & Dragons, as well as world-spanning campaigns using 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Both are A5 softcover, designed for portability and quick reference at the table. No one wants to lug around another hardcover to their local game. \nThis Kickstarter is also part of the Break Kickstarter promotion! Instead of providing stretch goals, you'll be going on a \"choose your own adventure\" by selecting different content for gaming creators to add to the book! Once the Kickstarter funds, find out the name of the first creative. At 1,500$, the backers will decide what they will add to the book, and we'll unveil the next creative on the list!\nStretch Goals\nWell that took off! \nEvery day, we are going to vote on new stretch goals. Will we unlock them all?\nWho am I?\nI'm an independent writer and artist, who's been producing gaming and gaming-related products for years. You've likely already read stuff I've written. My free book, Tricks, Traps, and Empty Room Design, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times; my blog Hack & Slash has been popular for years; and since I've gone full time, my high-level module Eyrie of the Dread Eye has nothing but five-star reviews.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but the work is written, the art and layout are mostly complete, and the stretch goals are small pieces (<2000 words) of bonus content. The layout can't be 'completely complete' until the stretch goal content is in, but I've been working with Indesign for over a decade now. I have finished products like this dozens of times, and consistently receive astounding 4.5+ star ratings on my products. \n\nI have a lot of experience working with DriveThruRPG to produce printed copies. I expect all the extra content (the color art for the cover and the articles by guest writers) to be complete within 6 weeks of project completion, and checking the print proofs for sale approval to take 6 weeks. This provides an extra 8 weeks as a buffer for issues and late content. I expect digital copies to be distributed in mid-October, and print copies to be available on DriveThruRPG by the end of November. \n\nI don't suffer from depression, and I am a productive person who is online frequently. I like to work. The fact that the project is nigh complete except for the cover, all bonus content is already planned and accounted for, and the only external systemic reliance is DriveThruRPG give me a great deal of confidence I can complete this project on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the draft of the book, vote on stretch goals, and follow the campaign updates!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to a copy of the art-free draft of the book\nAbility to vote on stretch goals\nFollow comments and backer updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["172 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "This gives you access to a digital copy of the final book!

A few years ago, another company successfully launched an Evil Dead 2 board game campaign that was never fulfilled to its backers. This other company collected all of the money and delivered nothing to thousands of Evil Dead 2 fans that participated in their project. Because of this travesty, Jasco Games, in collaboration with Lynnvander Studios, the Evil Dead 2 licensing group, and our other partners have come together to bring Evil Dead 2 The Board Game back from the dead. We're calling this campaign a Heartthrob Campaign. What that means is if this campaign successfully funds, all of the backers of the previous campaign (that we had nothing to do with), will be getting a copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game for only the cost of shipping (that's right, free + shipping). \nReturning Backers\nWe cannot deliver exactly what previous backers pledged for, as that was not our project, however, we hope that you will all love this game and appreciate what we are trying to do for our beloved gaming community. Our Evil Dead 2 board game is an entirely NEW game designed by Lynnvander Studios and directed and tested heavily by Jasco Games and our play testers. If you were one of many backers of the previous campaign, refer to the section below called \u201cOriginal Backers\u201d  to find answers to some commonly asked questions and to verify that you are on our backer list to receive your copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game.\nNew Backers\nIf you are a new backer, we welcome you as well! You will not only be getting a fantastic board game for $59 (An $80 retail value game when it hits stores), that is completely designed, tested and ready to print upon funding of this campaign, you are also helping bring thousands of people a new copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game! They really got hurt by the other company and we, as a community, are very proud to have the opportunity to do right by those backers. \nIf you have already done the math on this, you will see that this Kickstarter campaign was designed to do a good thing. Profit is not the main purpose of the campaign, which is why we are selling the games as close to our production cost as possible while including the free game to original backers into that cost.\nSo, now that's explained, let's take a look at this beautiful board game, shall we?\nNow includes Combat Ready Ash!\n\n1. Search For Items \n2. Battle Deadites \n3. Evil Can Get In You, And Turn You BAD!!!\n4. Battle Your Former Friends \n5. Seal The Portal (Or Open It) \n6. Save The World  \nYou know how it is. You get together with your friends and decide to have a nice weekend in the woods. Maybe head up to the cabin, go for a walk in the woods. No city, no distractions, just some time with your mates and your girl. Groovy!\nAnd then some evil darkness decides to crash your party, possessing people. And before you know it, the dead start rising from the ground, looking for this magic book or perhaps just a tasty snack. The only hope to stop them is to find that book ourselves and seal the portal near the cabin. But be careful, \u2018cause the evil can get in you and turn you bad. And evil has its own plan for the portal, wanting to open it up and release Deadites on the world.\nIt\u2019s down to us to save the world.\nDetailed Model Turns (Good & Evil)\n\nHuman Ash and Deadite Ash\nHuman Linda and Deadite Linda\n\nHuman Ed and Deadite Ed\n\nHuman Annie and Deadite Annie\n\nHuman Jake and Deadite Jake\n\nHuman Bobby-Jo and Deadite Bobby-Jo\n\n Monstrous Bosses\n\nKiller Tree, Henrietta, and The Hand\nRotten Apple Head and Limbs\n\n\n                      CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK! \n\n Evil Dead 2 Cinestory - The Movie as A Graphic Novel! \n\nThis 332 Page hardcover book is a full color illustrated graphic novel of the entire Evil Dead 2 movie.

One integrated, innovative system - Infinite Creativity!\nAs Till, CEO of DUNGEONFOG, puts it: \n\u201cWe want to help Game Masters and storytellers to focus on their story, while they create a living, breathing, interconnected map system for their narratives.\u201d\nSince it our campaign story has become rather long and this has been requested: If you are looking for the ONE-TIME-BUY KEY check out our Platinum pledge level. More info can be found down in the Stretch-Goal section\nPROJECT DEIOS will allow for the seamless combination of battlemaps, city maps, regional maps and entire world maps. Our DEIOS suite will connect previously incompatible types of maps to offer an interconnected experience for boundless map-making. \nOnce we\u2019ve realized our vision, the \u201cDEIOS Suite\u201d will be integrated into the existing DUNGEONFOG Editor. We\u2019ll offer diverse packages for our users so that everyone will be able to choose the tools most suitable for their needs. \nCore Functionalities\nOur base funding includes all DEIOS Suite core functionalities that need to be developed from scratch. Other base functionalities, like brushes and shape tools, are already available through the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor and are not listed here:\nThe Citybuilder coherently assembles sections according to archetypes - e.g. poor human district or elvish administrative quarters - and logically auto-generates housing structures, squares and parks.\nEach house is equipped with its own automatically generated map-notes, including residents per house, construction costs, etc. and will be used to create note-based outlines for your cities. As is customary for the DUNGEONFOG system, notes can always be edited and expanded.\nEvery section can be set to a specific archetype, which will affect the random asset-pool for buildings:\nWealth level: Poor, Average, Rich, etc.\nType of building: Merchants, homes, administration, etc.\nRace/Species: Dwarven, Elvish, Human etc.\nPlan Settlements With Just A Few Clicks\nYou can also place landmarks and buildings manually. Temples, markets, towers, etc. can be planted precisely where you want them to be at any time. The remaining space can then be filled with buildings based on the selected archetype of the section.\nPin locations and link them to battlemaps\nPlay directly on the maps with our Fog-of-War viewer\nEach building, square and street can be mapped out in as much detail as you desire and require, including battle and dungeon maps. Let your imagination guide you without boundaries!\nClever Coding For Boundless Creation\nVector-based drawing enables you to manipulate landmasses to an unprecedented extent: Select, move or resize landmasses without losing quality on the graphics. Add, subtract or even combine landmasses to create unique regions. \nVector-based drawing allows you to revisit and manipulate all objects\nNever before was composing original regions and landmasses easier and more intuitive. By cleverly balancing tool functionality and harmonic art composition, the DUNGEONFOG core mechanics offer the perfect fusion of practical application and elegant map design.\nBIOMES\nBiomes are quickly and easily allocated with an intuitive brush tool. This renders different forms of vegetations, geographical formations and landscapes effortlessly and stylishly.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Grassland\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Forest\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Mountain range\nWith PROJECT DEIOS, you will have access to a base setting for fantasy assets that will include more than 200 assets, for biomes like:\nBiome Samples\nSince the monthly DUNGEONFOG prop packs enjoy high popularity, we will continue to develop new textures, settings and props on a regular basis.\nPROJECT DEIOS combines all your ideas, detailed maps and concepts for continents into one giant map model. Through clever segmentation and the gradual increase of detail complexity, your world creation is a stable, coherent concept without boundaries.\nAdvanced Export Functions\nEach region can be selected, viewed and exported separately, including all contained landmarks and linked maps. The scales are automatically adjusted to fit your viewport and level of zoom.\nPolitical borders can easily be drawn - the DUNGEONFOG core functions circumvent unwanted overlaps and neatly translate all attributes to practical and editable Game Master notes.\nClimate zones, water currents and other characteristics are effortlessly added with easy-to-use brushes. Each feature stays continuously editable, allowing you to change or add whatever you want as your story progresses.\nEach landmark you place on your creation is automatically attributed its individual location. PROJECT DEIOS stores all locations, landmarks and properties in a geospatial data model. This allows your creativity to venture out endlessly, because map sizes are almost unlimited.\nBuilding an entire world from scratch might seem a bit intimidating. With the community maps feature, you can form creative alliances and collaborate on your storytelling endeavors. You can also share your worlds or use and adapt maps from fellow Game Masters or authors. There is no need to hide your creativity away - be proud and enrich multiple adventures with your ideas!\nJoin A Community Full Of Stories And Creation\nThe three pillars of DUNGEONFOG have always been \u201cPlan - Create - SHARE\u201d. We will stay true to our core functionalities, even while expanding our scope to make effortless world creation a reality.\nA great advantage of the innovative DUNGEONFOG map-making toolset is the simple but crucial feature that every object, entity and map stays perpetually editable and can be reused and even shared. This enables Game Masters, Authors, Storytellers and RPG enthusiasts to collaborate, exchange feedback and help improve each others\u2019 worlds. \nYou can draw from the users' collective creativity by using community maps, adapt them to your story\u2019s needs and make your own original ideas accessible to others.\nCollaboration Opportunities\nWe\u2019ll even go a step further, and explore how we can make collaboration between multiple authors on shared maps a possibility. Collaboration is not just working together on one map - but also using other users\u2019 maps to add to your own stories. Discovering a beautiful world map will spark new ideas and with PROJECT DEIOS, you\u2019ll have the platform to add your own creative stories to existing maps and let marvellous adventures unfold.\nWe think that everybody should be able to create maps with the new DEIOS Suite! After launch, we\u2019ll offer Free Access with limited features to everyone.\nIf you'd like to have access to all of our features, consider backing us at the Bronze level or higher for access to the full DEIOS Suite. \nKickstarter only\n\n\nYou and your support through Kickstarter will bring the DEIOS Suite to life. So we\u2019re offering you special bargains as a thank you, which are only available exclusively during this Kickstarter campaign:\nKickstarter-Exclusive Art Packs\nWhen supporting our campaign at Silver (pick one), Gold (pick two) or Platinum (all) level, you will receive our additional, Kickstarter-exclusive art packs, each containing 25 assets for cities, regions and world maps.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Video Series By The GreatGM\nCreating entire worlds with manifold distinct areas and settlements offers possibilities for near endless adventures. It might be easy to get lost in boundless creativity and to lose sight of one's goals, were it not for the guidance of wise masters and the help of fellow adventurers. \nIn his exclusive 6-part video series, The GreatGM lends Kickstarter supporters (Gold level and above) a helping hand and shares his vast knowledge of worldbuilding and storytelling. Since his new series is exclusively tailored to the DUNGEONFOG system and the  DEIOS suite, all viewers can expect valuable hands-on tips and masterful tricks from The GreatGM himself.\nDUNGEONFOG, World Anvil, GreatGM and Caeora Have Teamed Up For This Project\nAt its core, DUNGEONFOG was founded to support Game Masters and storytellers on their creative journey, and to make map-making easy, intuitive and practically useful. But we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not alone on this quest. World Anvil, The GreatGM and Caeora also aim to transform map-making, storytelling and worldbuilding into an extraordinary experience for you. So we\u2019ve teamed up!\nPROJECT DEIOS is our shared vision - ONE system that can support ALL your map-making and storytelling needs. DUNGEONFOG was a massive Kickstarter success back in 2017, and our toolset makes the mapping process effortless, quick and perpetually interconnected. With these incredible partners, we\u2019ve formed a team of experts in the world of storytelling, worldbuilding and map-making to make PROJECT DEIOS a reality.\n www.dungeonfog.com \n www.worldanvil.com \nwww.greatgamemaster.com\nwww.caeora.com \nWorld Anvil Integration\nOur partner World Anvil brings a lot of experience with collaboration features to the table. Drawing on their expertise, we will develop a permission-based co-authoring, commenting and sharing system. Simultaneously, we have a keen eye on the smooth technical connection between DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil. \nWe\u2019ll start with basic integration features, like accessibility of DUNGEONFOG maps while editing a world in World Anvil, or accessing your written world descriptions as a resource while creating maps in the DUNGEONFOG editor. \nWe\u2019ll also pay attention to the functionality of pins: Creating locations will auto-generate pins, and therefore, redundant manual pinning will not be necessary. In addition, we\u2019re exploring many ways to integrate World Anvil\u2019s extensive Campaign Manager and their character manager, Heroes, with PROJECT DEIOS. For example, our player viewer could be integrated with Heroes, so that all party members know their location at all times, or the location of the main villain.\nEasy Collaboration\nThe joint communities from DUNGEONFOG, World Anvil and The GreatGM is a thriving community of map makers, storytellers, writers and Game Masters at your disposal. This makes sharing resources easy as never before. A thriving community also enables you to cheer for great maps by others and draw motivation from users that used your work.\nArtwork and Assets Will Be Created By Caeora \nThe assets will not only be created in his beautiful unique style, but will also pay attention to scaling & line art so that every map you create will always look stunning - whether you play digitally or export them in high resolution.\nOur dream is to help Game Masters, Authors and storytellers create entire worlds in all their detailed glory. Creating something this boundless is a huge endeavour! \nOur primary goal is to get enough funding to cover an additional developer and have enough funds to pay our partners for their work.  \nTo cover all core functionalities, we estimate the costs to be around 100,000 EUR (about $112,140). Since we launched DUNGENFOG, we managed to build up some resources that cover about 40% of the estimated development costs. Our partners agreed to help us with an additional 10%, which means we can already cover 50% of the development costs of our DEIOS Suite.\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to fully finance our dreams - rather, your support could pick us up halfway and carry us to the finish line. Therefore, we set the funding goal to 50,000 EUR (about $56,070). With additional  resources, we can hire additional developers and speed up the development process immensely, getting DEIOS into your hands sooner!\nProject DEIOS Pricing After Launch\nWe want to make sure that prices are compatible with using the DUNGEONFOG system as a hobby. At this point, we estimate the full package (meaning the \u201cDEIOS suite\u201d including the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor) to cost around \u20ac 7.90 (about $8.80) per month. \nBattlemaps are included in DEIOS - so you only need the DEIOS subscription\nOur DUNGEONFOG battlemap subscription will remain untouched and will be available as a separate subscription as well.\nWe will offer monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription models with respective discounts. As is usual for DUNGEONFOG, you\u2019ll always be able to pause your subscription without losing your creative work. \nWhile planning this project, it was highly important to us that we grant our supporters early access to the DEIOS Suite development stages. Therefore, our timeline includes several stages of development releases to keep waiting time short, while at the same time enabling room for early feedback and improvement. \nNow that we have reached our funding goal - let's talk about stretch goals! \nAs enthusiastic map makers and RPG adventurers, we have a full array of additional ideas we thrive to implement - so here they are:\nPortals and Planes - FUNDED!\nPROJECT DEIOS is conceptualized to evolve and grow infinitely. Our first stretch goal includes the possibility to not only build an entire world, but to conceptualize multiple planes of existence. To support even the most fantastic ideas, we will offer biomes and props to create adventures taking place in five additional settings - and it is up to you to decide which ones will be included in the DEIOS Suite. \nWhen we reached this stretch goal after the end of the PROJECT DEIOS Kickstarter, we will give backers the opportunity to vote for their 5 favorite settings, which could include:\nWe will notify all eligible (silver+) backers after the campaign where to place your vote\nOnce the stretch goal is reached and the funding is over, we will contact all eligible (Silver+) backers and ask you to help us decide on the new settings.\nIf you would like to add to that list, join us on Discord or post here in our campaign comments with the addition: \u201cSETTING -\u201d  (Example: \u201cSETTING - Candyland\u201d).\nOnce the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our voting tool and you can help us to determine what of those 5 settings will be created first.\nEach setting will include artwork for biomes, city buildings and landmarks and will contain more than 100 different assets for your worlds.\nThe setting will then be available with ALPHA 2 so you can test and review it as soon as possible.\n SOLAR SYSTEMS, STARMAPS and 3D World Mapping - FUNDED!\nEven multiple planes of existence are not enough for you? \nWhen we reach this stretch goal, you don\u2019t need to feel tied to one world alone - let your imagination venture out into unexplored galaxies and the unlimited possibilities of space. \n When reaching this stretch goal, we will add tools to create \nGalaxies\nSolar Systems\nand mapping tools to create a 3D mapping of your world as globe, disc, cylinder or dyson spheres.\nAll maps will remain linkable and you will be able to expand your creation into whole universes.\n RANDOM LANDMASS SEEDING AND CITY GENERATOR - FUNDED!\nWhile creating entire worlds and galaxies, not every village, town or region has to be created individually. Sometimes, a specific vision of a city demands special attention to detail only in certain places, while other districts could be more generally conceptualized. \nOr a story calls for a highly characteristic and specific shoreline, while the vast central plains don\u2019t need to contain that much detail. \nFear not, we have you covered: When we reach this stretch goal, we will develop a tool set to generate entire cities and landmasses randomly. All you have to do is adjust the parameters to you needs and create a randomly generated map.\n Random city generator: Adjust size, demographics and layout (medieval , western, etc.) and we will randomly populate your city map with districts and buildings.\n Random landmasses: Adjust landmass-types amount of water on you map, sizes,  island scatter and more to randomly generate world maps.\n Save the seed for your randomization and share it with your friends\nTo celebrate this unlocked stretch goal, we have added an additional +25 Asset Pack to the pool!\n\u20ac 175.000 - New Setting - FUNDED\nWith 175k funded, Caeora will now add another new setting that you can vote on at the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 250.000 DESKTOP APPLICATION - FUNDED\nWe can now hire an additional application developer full time and finish the desktop application together with the launch of DEIOS.\nOne-Time-Buy License Keys\nAll Platinum backers (and beyond) will receive in addition to all the other rewards 1 license-key to the standalone desktop application, which will run without subscription.\nThis means, that during our extended development time and beyond you will have:\nAccess to our ALPHA and BETA (online), \nAll Kickstarter settings and artpacks (also as part of your standalone license).\nPremium Access to Online DEIOS Suite until Desktop App has been released.\n1 License Key to standalone desktop application, that you can either use to activate your standalone desktop application, or gift a friend.\nAbout the Desktop Application\nOnce released, the software will available for download to any premium user at no additional cost.\nIn addition, we will offer a standalone license, that comes without subscription.\n+\u20ac 25.000 - The Indefinite Stretch Goal x6\n\n For every additional \u20ac 25.000 beyond our 250k stretch goal (275k, 300k, etc.) we'll increase the assets for all 7 settings by: \n + 50 battlemap assets  \n  + 15 additional landmarks  \n  + 15 additional special buildings for cities\nAnd + 50 new assets for solar systems & galaxies\n(in total 600+ assets)\n\n\nStep 1 - UNLOCKED: Digital badges for DUNGEONFOG and WORLDANVIL | +1 asset\nSuccess! All backers will be able to claim these exclusive badges for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles. And every backer will receive one additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 2 - UNLOCKED:  +3 month | + 3 asset\nSuccess! With all three Social Stretch Goals unlocked, we are now adding + 3 MONTH run-time to all PROJECT DEIOS subscriptions and every backer will receive three additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 3 - UNLOCKED: 3x +25 Asset Packs\n Wow - You have unlocked ALL our social Stretch goals!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has the potential to completely change the lives of all of us here at the studio, so we're putting our all into it.\n\nWe've been very open with the development of DUNGEONFOG so far and we take comments and concerns from our community very seriously. In fact, a lot of the changes in the editor came from community suggestions. We will continue to take and implement suggestions for Project DEIOSlong after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make everything compatible with as many operating systems & browsers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some older computers and browsers will not be able to support all features. Please try the free version of DUNGEONFOG to see if your computer has problems running the current battlemap editor.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for fairly regular build updates with monthly intervals, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We will try our hardest to make DEIOS a tool everyone will enjoy and will remember.\n\nWeb development isn't always smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part), so that's why we\u2019ve added a bit of a cushion to our timeline and chose Spring 2020 for the release date. This will give us a bit of breathing room so that we can get it to you on schedule... or maybe even earlier!\n\nIf it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.  \n\nBeyond the Gates of Jigoku  \nThis new expansion compels Okko and his band of intrepid demon hunters to pass through the hellish Gates of Jigoku to fight its demonic denizens in their own realm. But beware, for in the dark and desolate domain of the oni, their corruption is much more powerful than anything your adventurers have experienced in the world of the living!   \nOni Hunters \nThis expansion gives you the opportunity to play new scenarios or replay your favorite scenarios, without the need for an Oni Player by introducing both cooperative and solitaire modes to your Okko Chronicles games. Now the game is playable for 1 to 5 players ! \nMiniatures Storage Box\nA box to store all the miniatures from Okko Chronicles.   \n\n\n\nThis expansion includes several new tiles representing the hellish environments of Jigoku. \nNot bound by the physical laws of the mortal world, this nightmarish realm seems to conform only to its own twisted and devious logic.   \nAs a result, the Jogoku tiles can rotate, flip or even be replaced entirely during the course of a game, making adventures in the ever-changing kingdom of the oni an extremely disconcerting prospect...   \nThe following symbols are used on these new tiles to tell you how they are revolved: \n At the beginning of the game, each Hero takes a card to track their current level of corruption and its effects as they explore the lands of Jigoku. \nThe longer a hero remains in these accursed lands, the more likely they will be to fall under the influence of its evil influences.   \n  Fortunately, some of their equipment may mitigate the harmful effects of Jigoku\u2019s rampant corruption. \n\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nThis expansion allows everyone to play the Okko Chronicles scenarios as Heroes, without the need for one of them to take on the role of the Oni and its agents.\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nAt the end of each Strategy phase, players draw the top  card from the Adventure deck:\nThis card indicates how to place or move the Corruption tokens on the board, what Enhancements the Oni\u2019s Mortal Thralls or Supernatural Creatures will gain and any effects that will need to be resolved until the end of the round.     \nDuring the Activation phase, after a Hero has finished their Activation, the players draw a Reaction card. This card indicates which of the Oni\u2019s agents are activated and what actions they will perform.  \n\nNo SG included\nAs the various Stretch Goals are unlocked, they will be added to the Beyond the Gates of Jigoku and Oni Hunters expansion boxes.   \n\n\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\n  The saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness. \nHUB, the author of the Okko saga, has created many new illustrations and unique characters that will accompany Okko and his companions in their latest adventure. \nOkko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\n  Some miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\n  For us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here. \nIf you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac80), Hunter (\u20ac45) or Master Hunter (\u20ac125) pledges as you want. Shipping costs will be reduced for each additional copy added!\n  And of course, each pledge is accompanied by all unlocked Stretch Goals!\n\n\nAll costs shown are in Euro (\u20ac) and are based on the exchange rate posted at the launch of this campaign (approx. \u20ac1 = $1.13).\n  Any pledges that are confirmed after the close of the 'pledge manager' will be dispatched at a later date from our European distribution hub, which may significantly increase the estimated shipping costs above. \nThe RED JOKER is an established board game publishing company whose CEO, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Condette, has been working in the games industry for nearly 20 years.

Since then, Aslak \u2013 Eye of the World was released by Delcourt in 2011. Written by HUB and Fred Weytens, drawn by Emmanuel Michalak and colored by S\u00e9bastien Lamirand, it tells the story of a Viking\u2019s quest for new stories. \nStephane Camosseto, Valentin Zak and Patrick Masson are 3 french freelance sculptors working in the miniature and collectible statues industry.\n  They have been working in this industry for 7 years for many different games and collectibles company, like CoolMiniOrNot, Guillotine Games, Demented Games, Studio McVey, Luftkrieg 1919, etc.\n  They have created Kazama Studio in order to gather their skills and be able to propose companies high end miniatures and bigger projects.\n  It was a pleasure working on this Okko\u2019s chronicles project with the awesome concepts from Hub. \nBorn in 1974, Arnaud Boudoiron has worked in a variety of sectors: press, publishing, advertising, comics and sculpture. He began a career as a sculptor for Rackham at the end of the 1990s. He is a talented artist and a gaming fanatic.\n  After working for several years in the comic book industry, he took advantage of the increasing interest in board games including miniatures to finally find his primary passion: sculpture. Arnaud has worked on games such as Zombicide, Black Plague, Conan, The Godfather, Mythic Battles, Rising Sun and Batman: Gotham City Chronicles. \nA passionate board gamer, Nicolas spends most of his free time immersed in their worlds. When he is not busy inventing new role-playing settings, he polishes the rules of his own system, modifying or honing the game mechanics of the games or preparing prototypes (though his wife would prefer him to be doing the dishes).   \nNicolas likes big games, whether they contain small wooden cubes or miniatures, provided that the theme is strong and is conveyed well through its mechanics.     \nA fan of Hub's work on Okko, and with dungeons crawlers some of his favorite games, Nicolas could not refuse a trip into the Pajan Empire with Okko and his friends. The RED JOKER is pleased to introduce his Solo and Cooperative game modes for Okko Chronicles! \nHaving graduated in sociology and Internet & multimedia engineering, specializing in transmedia, Andoniya joined The RED JOKER earlier in 2017 as its Community Manager.\n  A gamer in her free time, Andoniya particularly likes Vampire The Masquerade. She also loves games that tell real stories and allow her to play characters of her choice. A little geeky, she loves Goldorack (Grandizer), Pokemon and the X-Men. Her favorite heroine is none other than Wonder Woman. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our sixth crowdfunding campaign and we have already successfully delivered the following campaigns, The Valley of the Kings, Fortresses & Clans, Guardians\u2019 Chronicles: The Clash of Heroes and the first printing of Okko Chronicles. Meanwhile, our most recent campaign, Highway to Hell, is currently in production.\n\nIn regard to these two new expansions to the Okko Chronicles line; many of their core components have been finalized before the launch of this Kickstarter campaign, and many of the add=ons and Stretch Goals are already well into their pre-production. As a result, these should be ready to go to print before the end of this campaign.\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A ZERO RISK PROJECT OR CAMPAIGN. \nWhile this is not our first game like this, there will always be unforeseen developments in manufacturing and logistics that are beyond our control, as we have learned to our peril in the past. That being said, barring a catastrophic meteor impact, a zombie apocalypse or other forms of armageddon (holy or otherwise), we are pretty sure that, thanks to our previous experience, the game is well prepared and that we have chosen our partners wisely (manufacturers, printers, freight forwarders, distributors, etc.).\n\nRefund Policy\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 60 days before they leave the manufacturer, without question.

You have already taken us past all the stretch goals.\nThank you! \nAll of these stretch goals are things we would love to put into TaleSpire one day, but take significant resources. If we get funded to these levels we can make them a priority and get them to you sooner.\nPlease note that the US dollar estimates were made at the time we set up the Kickstarter and may differ from current values. However the amount in Norwegian Kroner (nok) is exact.\nHero Crafting System (~$175k USD / 1,486,647nok) \nAn entire system for building your own minis within TaleSpire. No 3D modeling experience required!\nCustomizable Rule System (~$225k USD / 1,911,404nok)\nWe will add a customizable engine which will arm players and GMs alike with all the information they need during play. It will place the knowledge at your fingertips without forcing your hand or taking control away from the GM.\nCyberpunk Themed Assets (~$275k USD / 2,336,160nok)\nAnd they did not weep, for there were so many worlds to conquer!\nThis stretch goal funds the slew of packs that will form the foundation of a cyberpunk world within TaleSpire.\nOh and for extra fun, here is a mini trailer for the cyberpunk assets!\nTaleSpire is a beautiful way to play pen and paper RPGs online. It's a place where you and your friends build and tell stories together.\nWe are marrying the beauty and physicality you find in miniatures with the expanse of digital worlds. Our aim is to get rid of everything that gets between you and your stories. And all of this whilst letting people be together regardless of where they are in the world.\nTaleSpire is not tied to a specific game or ruleset; if it's role-playing on a square grid we have your back.\nWe have already built the alpha and have been running it with the community for 6 months. Thanks to their support and feedback we know what still needs building, and what needs polishing. The community has really shown us how far they want us to take this.\nYour support will get us to Early Access. There is a solid 8 months of fulltime work to do and this Kickstarter will make that happen.\nFrom there we will take our solid base and expand it even further, once again grounding our moves in the needs of the Early Access community in the same way we have been with our Alpha community (HUGE LOVE TO THE TALESPIRE DISCORD GANG, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE :D).\nMost importantly we believe that, for this game to be made without compromise, it needs to be independent of publishers. We have looked around and whilst this idea seems to be obvious and has clearly been discussed for decades it has never been made in quite this way. We feel that is almost certainly due to how risky it would be to do it 'right'.\nDespite bringing a pile of experience to the table, we are still a new company and we knew it wasn't right for us to ask for your money until we knew exactly what this needed to be, and could prove we could do it.\nWe have a working alpha, active userbase, over 20 updates shipped and we publish multiple developer logs per week. Even before the alpha we were experimenting with a pile of different prototypes so we are confident with what we need to achieve.\nIn short we have been doing this for some time now and we know we can keep it up.\nThe primary goal of the Kickstarter is to fund TaleSpire's development for 8 months. This includes full time wages for the core developers, server costs, creative tools and legal services required to bring this game to Early Access.\nThe timeline is aggressive. 6 months to the Beta and then 2 months to polish for Early Access.\nWe will start the timer from the end of the Kickstarter campaign. As the two full-time developers live in Norway we will have to comply with laws regarding the mandated amounts of leave companies must provide, so that will be factored into the delivery dates.\nThe goal is that the Beta will ship in February and the Early Access in April.\nEarly Access will fund and guide the next stage of TaleSpire's life. We will keep talking to you about how you play and where the game needs to expand to serve your stories.\nWith the start of the Early Access we will also begin releasing asset packs at fixed, regular intervals and ALL of those will be free. Post-Early Access the packs are how we plan to fund our future.\nIf we are so blessed as to reach the stretch goals, we will begin developing them once we reach Early Access.\n\nTaleSpire has a lot within its walls; let's go on a stroll through the main features.\nBuilding and play are one\nTaleSpire is a place where building and play happen throughout the whole play session. Want to destroy a wall to reveal a secret passage? Do it! Want to rain down piles of gold from the heavens? Sure! At any moment the GM (or GMs) can jump into building mode and change anything without interrupting anything else.\nYou will be able to build anything from tiny one shots to sprawling campaigns. Each board can be up to 30km across and 10km tall. We will be looking to make them even bigger post-Early Access.\nA campaign can have as many boards as you can build, and you can copy entire boards \u2014 which makes it easy to create alternate versions in various states of disarray if that is what your story calls for.\nBuild together\nBuilding doesn't have to be a solo activity. Grant other people GM rights to your campaign and build your world together.\n\nGorgeous sculpted scenery and miniatures\nTaleSpire gives you assets that look so good you'll want to claw them out of your monitor. \nRoll Call! Click for higher res version\n\nControl the atmosphere\nA necromancer is performing a poignant resurrection that deserves something special! With a click you can dim the lights, bring in the music and captivate your players. \nAs the GM you can store lighting, weather and music into 'environment pillars'. These let you swiftly change the mood of a moment.\nRain, snow, night and day are coming and you can wield them.  \nCustomizable dice with HEFT\nIn game dice that not only look great but feel great to roll. \n\n\nFrom play testing we found out players would do it so much that we needed a way for the GM to grab control at important moments in the story. Speaking of which\u2026 \n\n Cinematic Mode\nA foolish dwarf steps on a pressure plate \u2014 suddenly the camera snaps across the room and a necromancer strides into view.\nAs the GM you are armed with Cinematic Mode. Set up camera angles and take direct control of what every player is seeing. In that moment they cannot move their pieces and you are free to narrate the perils they have stumbled into.\nSetting up shots\n\nTools! Rulers, indicators, compass, etc\nPoint to point distance? Diagonal movement? Area of effect? No need to estimate when you can use our built in tools to tell you exactly what's what.\nGMs can do this privately or share it with the group so all are in on the plot. \nAn example size indicator used when placing tiles\n\nGM Requests\nCertain player actions request approval from the GM. This means events can\u2019t be unveiled accidentally before they make sense in the story. \nTurn based mode\nChoose the line-up, orchestrate the rounds! Keeping track is easy when you can switch to turn based mode at any time. When in this mode only the player whose turn it is can command their creatures. \nPLAY\n\n\nName and tint your creatures before bringing them into the game\nNo need to wait until reaching the board to set up your hero. Before jumping in, prep as many creatures as you like and assign them their campaigns. \n\nChanging your mini's base\nVariety == spicy life. \nWe know it's a subtle thing but dang it some days maybe your base should match your armor. \n\nFog of war\nThis powerful system keeps the path ahead obscured in a shroud until it is time to reveal it. \nPLAY\n\nNote: This video shows one of our fog of war prototypes. We are introducing a visual representation for the fog in the Early Access.\n\nScaling creatures\nNeed a bigger troll? Shrunk by a spell? The scale feature is at hand to help you. \nEmotes & spells\nSometimes waggling a piece just doesn\u2019t cut it: pick from a selection of actions and unleash sounds, animations & visual effects to really let that fireball spell send its message. \nFilter your session history\nDid Jeff move 10 feet or 15? Settle it with the session history!\nUse filters to see only what is relevant in the moment. \nGrant access with the smack of a button\nInvite codes let you easily grant people access to your campaign and are copied straight to the clipboard to they are ready to be thrown into your chat client of choice. \nShare slabs of tiles effortlessly\nSharing a slab is trivial in TaleSpire. Copied tiles are immediately available to paste as text outside of TaleSpire making it trivial to share useful chunks. Naturally this works in reverse, copy the text and paste in TaleSpire to summon the slab to your hand. \nMusic and sound effects\nTaleSpire will come loaded with mountains of sound effects, ambience, and a full soundtrack. From dripping caves to rowdy taverns, we have you covered.\nHere is an early sample from the soundtrack:\nModding! Add your own tiles, minis and more\nThe mods are fun and numerous: take this!\nTaleWeaver is the tool we use to bring content into the game. Import your models and apply the magic that lets them work in TaleSpire. \nWith the Early Access we will also ship the base of the scripting layer. To begin with, this will be focused on controlling tiles and props, but the system is going to grow in a big way as we continue to expand the game.\nYou and your players will be able to get mods from our official site (not yet live), but also from collections created and maintained by other modders. This means the power stays with the community.\nBookmarks\nBookmark Panel Prototype\nA light to guide you when all other minds go blank\n...by which we mean, save any point of the board as a bookmark and jump there with a click of the mouse\nFoam scenery blocks\nPlacing tiny tiles to build a hill is tedious; use the foam blocks to lay out large tracts of land.\nTunnel through them to make a perfect lairs for creatures favoring the dark.\nPowerful prop system\nYou can scatter not just tiles but props across the land. Props can be attached to tiles in myriad ways, and they respond sensibly when a player pushes into them. Make your rich settings without worrying about any details blocking play.\nAsset & feature suggestion sites\nWe will have official places to submit ideas for assets and features. These will be used to help guide the future of the game. We also promise not to destroy the focus by trying to include everything.\nGM Overlay: Notes, Hidden tokens/chests containing stuff useful for running a campaign\nKeep track without being swamped. As a GM you have an overlay mode where you can leave yourself notes. Place tiles, minis and prepare scenarios, all out of sight of the players.\nAnd plenty more!\n\u266b The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began \u266b\nCheck out our roadmap to see a high level overview of our plans.\n\n\n\n Concept Art\nThe following is the concept sketches for the Kickstarter Exclusive Minis and an in-game first pass at the dice.\nSee these updates for more info:\nDice: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2587520 \nMinis:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2586452 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe big one is of course time-frame. We have done a lot of experimentation to know what we need but it remains a lot of work in a fairly short period of time. We will need to leave polish and feel of some systems to late in the cycle. We can't reduce the amount of work to do so instead we will simply be as open as we can as to how things are progressing so that nothing comes as a surprise.\n\nThe other is subtler. Making things simple is complicated. There are many 'obvious' ways to do things which make for a worse or inconsistent experience. We need to keep focused and stay true to the *feel* that we are going for even if that means not supporting every imaginable feature, and especially if they seem trivial.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required). If you open your game and see that something is missing or broken, our customer service team will work hard to get you replacement parts and make things right. Simply contact them at https://support.cmon.com/hc/en-us.\nNote: Warranty does not cover accidental damage, theft, loss, or any other event that is not a manufacturing defect.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10,376 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Early Bird Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "11,919 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "FAQ and Updated Rulebook", "update_content": "Welcome to the Dream, Hunters...\n\nNow that the game is released and we've gathered feedback from the community, we have assembled two core assets for you:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Update #118: You've Done Well.

Final rules are currently in progress.\nStill confused about what to pledge? CLICK HERE! \nCost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic miniatures and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.    \nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. With so many different pledge levels and add ons, making sure the right pieces go in the right boxes takes time. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible. Most of the work for Tsukuyumi is already done, with some small tweaks and new content to be added. Of course you can\u2019t forget about all those minis either! They are going through their final stages of revisions as you read this, and then its time to print!  At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.  \nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to taking a company retreat to the moon (it's research for the next expansions for Tsukuyumi. How else would we come up with this stuff?).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

We are confident that we will hit our release goals with no problems, shipping delays or Acts of God notwithstanding.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself.

We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined eight Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partners in China and the United States for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. \n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color. But, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

Whenever I'm struggling with a design, I read the next chapter, and without fail I always learn something from the featured designer.\u201d \n-Jamey Stegmaier, Designer of Scythe\n\n\"You are asking interesting questions. These are not the standard questions which I have heard lots of times and have a spontaneous and direct answer to them. Your questions make me think a little bit more.\"\n-Reiner Knizia, Designer of 600+ published games\n\n\u201cGabe Barrett is simply one one of the best interviewers out there. He\u2019s talking with some of the greats in the game industry, giving you deep insights into their processes and perspectives.\u201d\n-Luke Laurie, Designer of The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire\n\n\u201cTons of insight from the top designers of our modern tabletop games \u2013 both inspiring and educational.\u201d \n-Sami Laakso, Designer of Dale of Merchants\n\n\"Board Game Design Advice is never far from my desk, both because it's a useful reference piece when I need help, and because it's a fun read as a fan of game design.\"\n-JR Honeycutt, Designer of Fireball Island\nExtended audio interviews with Reiner Knizia and Tim Fowers\nJames Hudson's top 3 tips for getting published\nJR Honeycutt's top 3 tips for working with a developer\n\nYou'll receive a digital copy of the book in three different formats: PDF, ePub, and MOBI. When the book is complete, you'll get an email with download links.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a paperback copy of the book, and you'll get it several weeks before the book is available anywhere else (GUARANTEED).\nSee shipping rates below.\n\nThe hardback version of the book will not be available anywhere else and comes with a special edition cover. Every copy will be numbered and signed by the author.\nIf you order a hardback, you'll also receive a digital copy of the book, a bookmark, some stickers, and a 6 month subscription to BGDL+.\nOh, and you get FREE shipping!\nWhat is BGDL+?\nBGDL+ is a spinoff of the Board Game Design Lab podcast. \nIt provides members with extra podcast episodes, exclusive interviews, giveaways, and more. It's a way for game designers to take their work to the next level.\nMembers also get free access to design contests like the Board Game Design Challenge coming up in May.\nTypically, you become a member through Patreon and pay by the month, but if you back this campaign to receive a hardback copy of the book, you'll get a 6 month membership for free (a $30 value).\n\nIf you're a registered retailer, and you'd like to get some copies to sell at your store, this is the level for you. You'll receive 5 paperback copies of the book at a 50% discount.\nShipping costs $5 for the continental United States and $10 for everywhere else.\nYou'll also receive a complimentary digital copy of the book.\nIf you want more than 5 copies, please send me a message, and we can work something out.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, and you can sponsor 1 week of content on the BGDL Facebook page and podcast. You'll receive:\nA banner on the BGDL Facebook page\nA banner in the weekly newsletter and podcast announcement emails\nA 90 second ad before that week's podcast\nFirst come, first served. Click HERE to see if the week you want is available before selecting this reward. Please click the \"+\" icon to add your name, select the week you want, hit \"Update,\" and select this reward immediately afterward.\nThis is a great way to tell people about your upcoming Kickstarter or game release. Typical episodes of the BGDL podcast average around 3,000 downloads.\n*All banners and ads must be approved by Gabe.  \nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, a bookmark, stickers, and two 1-hour coaching calls done over Skype to talk about anything game design related with Gabe.\nIf you've run into some design snags, need help with a Kickstarter, want another set of eyes on your project, or just need some encouragement, this is a great reward level to pick.\nDates and times of meetings will be coordinated after the campaign is over.\n\n *The paperbacks & hardbacks are EU friendly. \nStretch goals for a campaign like this are obviously a little different than a typical project in the board game space. I can't exactly upgrade to a linen finish or add extra miniatures. So, the stretch goals are going to add more content to the book in the form of mini-interviews on specific topics.  \nHey. My name is Gabe, and in 2016 I created the Board Game Design Lab with one main mission: to help designers create great games that people love.\nOut of that mission came a podcast with over 115 episodes, a website full of resources, and an amazing community of designers trying to help each other become the best they can be.\nIt's been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. If you think there's a game inside you (and I believe there is), I hope you'll come along on the journey to get it out of your head and onto a table. And don't worry, me and the BGDL will be there to help you every step of the way.\nwww.boardgamedesignlab.com\nSpecial Thanks\nI want to say a very special thanks to Drew Corkill who did all the awesome graphics for this campaign page. He also designed the covers for the book and is doing the interior layout and design.

All while charging at full speed through HyperDrive. \n6-in-1 USB-C Hub (HDMI, USB-C Data & Power Delivery, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5mm Audio Jack)\nPatented soft grips that secures HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio \nWorldwide Patent Pending\nAs slim as iPad Pro\nWorks with or without Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio\nGrips are removable to work with other iPad Pro cases or devices \nWorldwide Patent Pending\n$1M Stretch Goal: USB-C Extension Cable\nReplace all other dongles with HyperDrive \nCompared to other dongles in the market and from the Apple Store, HyperDrive is more portable, has more features and is made of better materials. You would need multiple dongles to achieve what HyperDrive does, at a total cost much higher than HyperDrive.\nStop figuring out how to store and carry your dongles\nHaving multiple dongles means that you now have more items to manage on top of your iPad Pro, which increases the risk of misplacing them as you move around.\nWith HyperDrive, just pack and go\nHyperDrive is designed to be compact enough to stay with your iPad Pro wherever you go.\nDon't look silly with dongles. Just go with HyperDrive!\nStop hanging and juggling with multiple dongles. A single compact HyperDrive does the job of multiple dongles. Dongles never look sleeker than this.\nPrecision milled aluminum enclosure color matched to Silver and Space Gray iPad Pro\nPerfectly color matched to Space Gray and Silver iPad Pro\nThe same HyperDrive works with both 11\" and 12.9\" iPad Pro\nDesign\nWe wanted HyperDrive to feel like a natural extension of the 2018 iPad Pro with similar product lines, thickness, right angled edges and rounded corners.\nAs the 2018 iPad Pro only has a single USB-C port for the HyperDrive to latch on, we had to come up with an innovative solution to secure HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro.\nThe end result is a sleek, minimalist design that perfectly matches the 2018 iPad Pro with almost the same thickness, with removable soft grips that secures the HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with its or the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio functionality. The Worldwide Patent Pending removable grip design also allows HyperDrive to be used with other iPad Pro cases or other USB-C devices and allows for future accessories like an extension USB-C cable to the HyperDrive.\nWorldwide Patent Pending\nWe decided to go with popular output ports (HDMI, microSD, SD, USB-A) most requested by users. Although HyperDrive takes up a USB-C port on the iPad Pro, it also returns a USB-C port as well, which supports USB-C 5Gbps data and up to 60W power delivery pass through charging through HyperDrive.\nFront view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nBack view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nProof of working prototype that is ready for production\nThe following unedited single-shot video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all (HDMI, USB-C, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5 audio jack) ports working. Using HyperDrive, the iPad Pro is able to connect to a HDMI display, connect to an external speaker via 3.5mm audio jack, import photos/videos from USB-C/USB-A flash drives and microSD/SD memory cards, all while being powered by a USB-C power source. HyperDrive for iPad Pro is plug-n-play and interfaces directly with iOS, with no additional apps required. Connecting devices to HyperDrive is like connecting devices directly to iPad Pro via original Apple USB-C adapters.\nSpecifications\n Output:\n                - HDMI supporting 1080p@60Hz, 2K@60Hz, 4K@30Hz\n                - USB-C data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s) and Power Delivery (max 60W)\n                - micro SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - USB-A data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s)\n                - 3.5mm Audio Jack (USB 2.0 Audio, 48KHz, 16-bit Audio Input/Output, TRRS)\n Input: 1 x USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2, 10Gb/s\n DC/DC Efficiency: Up to 96%\n Device Operating Temperature: Less than 48\u00baC / 118\u00baF\n Enclosure: CNC aluminum available in Silver and Space Gray\n Dimensions: 3.66\" x 1.2\" x 0.35\" / 93 x 30.5 x 9mm\n Weight: 1.2oz / 34g\nRewards \nAvailable in Space Gray and Silver aluminum enclosure\nHyperDrive will be available in Silver or Space Gray.

These volumes were an expansion of the work that is presented at www.lovecraftianscience.wordpress.com, a blogsite dedicated to conducting scientific investigations into the Cthulhu Mythos that was initiated in September 2013.\nThe first volume focused on a variety of subjects, including discussions on Lovecraft\u2019s love for Science, the biology of some Lovecraftian entities, Einstein in a Lovecraftian universe, the short story \u201cFrom Beyond\u201d and mathematics in \u201cThe Dreams in the Witch-House.\u201d It also included a number of articles that backers requested such as discussions on Cthulhu, how humans and Deep Ones can interbreed and the Dreamlands. A chapbook Biology of the Old Ones was also produced.\nVolume 2 of the Journal contained a set of articles with the overarching theme of the Lovecraftian Solar System, with articles on the planets of our solar system, exoplanets, comets and meteors. Again, another set of articles were produced on questions posed by backers, which includes subjects such as the Shaggai and the Shan, Warfare of the Old Ones and What Exactly is Azathoth? The chapbook associated with the 2nd volume was titled Essays on Yuggoth.\nSO WHAT\u2019S THIS KICKSTARTER ABOUT?\nThis Kickstarter is for the 3rd volume of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science and the overall theme will be stories that Lovecraft either ghost wrote or co-wrote. Similar to the previous volumes, the 3rd volume will be approximately 135 to 150 pages in length and will include a least one illustration for each chapter. In turn, each chapter will be a discussion of scientific ideas or concepts of each revision tale. These tales will include:\n\u00b7 The Mound, with by Zealia Bishop\n\u00b7 Out of the Aeons, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror in the Museum, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror at Martin\u2019s Beach, with Sonia H. Greene\n\u00b7 Through of Gates of the Silver Key, with E. Hoffmann Price\n\u00b7 Till A\u2019 the Seas, with R. H. Barlow\n\u00b7 The Green Meadow, with Winifred V. Jackson\nAlso, another chapbook will be made available on a description of the ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus in the tale \u201cIn the Walls of Eryx,\u201d co-written with Kenneth Sterling.  In addition, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, another chapter will be included in the Journal for \u201cThe Curse of Yig,\u201d co-written with Zealia Bishop. \nA draft illustration of the cover of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3\nSO WHAT WILL THE REQUESTED MONEY BE USED FOR?\nThe money raised through this Kickstarter will be used to conduct detailed, scientific investigations on a series of Lovecraft's revision tales. The articles developed for this periodical will not be available on the blog site. The Kickstarter will also cover costs for Steve Maschuck to produce at least 8 original pieces of artwork exclusively for this Volume. Finally, the Kickstarter will also cover professional editing and formatting of the periodical into digital formats. Additional material, either as new articles and/or new artwork, will be included, if higher pledge amounts are submitted (see rewards). Also, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, then an additional chapter will be included on the tale \"The Curse of Yig,\" which will include another illustration.\nWHEN DO I GET MY REWARD?\nThe digital and hard copies of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and the chapbook The Ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus (In the Walls of Eryx) will be forwarded to all backers in March 2019.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacle associated with the project is putting the text together for the proposed periodical. Fortunately, a portion of the text is already complete; this proposed project will increase the level of detail associated with each article. If funded, the project will be completed and digital copies will be submitted to all backers. While there may be some slight delay in completing the periodical, the disciplined experience I have acquired over the course of almost three years in putting articles up on the blog site on a weekly basis will guarantee the successful completion of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $10.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal and Chapbook", "descp": "For $15.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy of the In the Wall of Eryx chapbook and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $22.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Vol. 3 + Chapbook", "descp": "For $28.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["111 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Journal, Chapbook and Pose a Question", "descp": "For $50.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.

Campbell published the novella Who Goes There?, about a team of scientists in Antarctica who discover and are terrorized by a monstrous, shape-shifting alien entity.

The published novella was actually an abridged version of Campbell's original story, called Frozen Hell, which had to be shortened for publication. The Frozen Hell manuscript remained unknown and unpublished for decades, and it was only recently rediscovered. Frozen Hell expands the Thing story dramatically, giving vital backstory and context to an already incredible tale.

The specially designed cutter together with four minutely adjustable modules offers precise control on angle and depth of cutting to save time and increase stability. It adopts conventional 9mm snap-off blades and Perfect Cut customized blades.\nSimple, Fast, Precise\nParents can make unique costumes for kids' Halloween party; modelers could do jobs quicker; designers would be able to make sketch models easier and accelerate the design process.\nVari-Angle Cutting\nThe Vari-Angle module could be adjusted for various cuts. It controls the angle of cutting down to a 5-degree interval. With the snap-off cutter, the cutting depth can also be controlled.\nCircle Cutting\nCompass cutter, which could be operated with a single hand, is capable of radius between 6 and 25 cm.\n45\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 45\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade 45\u00b0 inclined to the surface of the material while cutting a spline free-handed or cutting along a ruler.\n90\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 90\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade perpendicular to the surface of the material while cutting along a ruler or cutting a spline free-handed.\nSnap-Off Cutter\nSpecial designed snap-off blade cutter uses both Perfect Cut customized blades and conventional 9mm blades. It could be used for both left or right-handed and holds the blade firmly.\nDifferent from the previous model, we created the 45-degree blade so that the tip won't break easily and at the same time allows you to make precise cuts.\n30cm Ruler\nThere will be four models of the 30cm/12\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system\nAluminum ruler in the metric system\nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nAluminum ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends. Don't worry about it at this moment.\nThe 60cm ruler is compatible with the 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and vari-angle module. It can\u2019t be use with the compass module.\nThere will be two models of the 60cm/24\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system  \nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends.\n\u203b Artworks are work in progress, minor change will apply.\nCutting Materials\nTimeline\nAt this moment the injection molds are almost ready (minor modification will apply.) We are working on the ruler and the customized blade.\nRewards\n\nYou can add extra rulers by selecting a reward, adding $29 to your pledge for one additional 30cm ruler ($58 for two, $145 for six,) or $39 for an additional 60cm ruler. (If you\u2019ve already pledged, click the \"Manage my pledge\" button to change the amount.)\n\nThis deal is exclusively for Kickstarter, and no extra shipping fee will be charged. We will send you a survey to collect your choices of material and measurement unit of the rulers after the campaign.\nPerfect Cut Specs\nMore Examples\nThank You for Your Support\nTo everyone who backed and feedbacked the project \u2013 thank you. Your support and constructive feedback make Perfect Cut and Polarlab a reality, has changed my life, and now changing others\u2019. The project started in Dec 2014 when I was a design student and was one of my degree projects. Moreover, now Perfect Cut got a chance to be real after years of developing and refining.\nThis campaign is about more than designing and backing a project. It\u2019s a business model and a good way for designers or anyone who has an idea to be evaluated and realized as a product. In term of business, crowdfunding allows us not to compromise the functionality and creativity of the product, and in this case, we could treat our communities, backers, partners and our team (of 2 people) as peers.\nOnce again, thank you for your occupation, and we will continuously look to you, our community, for feedback and direction. Enjoy cutting :)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $235MM raised between them.\n     About PolarLab  \nWe are makers, designers, and engineers.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing.

Whether you are a casual fan or a rabid one, we've got you covered. \nI loved Lovecraft even before I knew his name. His lore permeated every inch of my childhood. I didn't know, for instance, that H. P. Lovecraft was the mind behind the Necronomicon when I watched Evil Dead. I didn't know he was the grandfather of psychological horror as I binged In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Aliens, and dozens of other terrifying movies in my youth. \nI didn't even know Lovecraft created Cthulhu until well after I called the Great Old One's name. However, the older I got, the more I grew to appreciate the warped mind behind some of my all-time favorite things, and I wanted to create something that could show that love, with people who loved Lovecraft as much as I did, for people who loved Lovecraft as much as me.\nAnd Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is the result of that process.\nAfter the success of my first anthology, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t, I asked my fans, and fans of the book, what we should cover next, and they told me Lovecraft. \nImmediately, I was like \"YESSSSS!!!!\" \nMonsters and Other Scary S^&t was all about how monsters can represent anything from cute to scary and everything in between, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is just like that, but with Lovecraft. It's 35 stories that show just how deeply Lovecraft has permeated the  essence of our culture. \nWhen I create a book, the first thing I sit down to figure out is how my book can be different from everything else on the market. After all, there are HUNDREDS of Lovecraft anthologies out there, both from Lovecraft himself and from loads of authors who have carried the torch for him in the last century. \nAdditionally, there are tons of stories told from a Lovecraftian horror point of view, dealing with the creepy, unsettling nature of humanity. I didn't think we could compete with those, nor did I want to, either. \nThere is one thing I love, though, that I haven't seen a lot previously...a book devoted to the mythology of Lovecraft's universe. \nYou see, I've always been fascinated by the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, and I never seemed to get enough of them in the stories I read. Most Lovecraft stories are filled with the horror aspect of Lovecraft, but low on the mythology. \nBut my favorite part of Lovecraft is the mythology he crafted, the gods he made, and the way that mythology differed from the myths of every other mythology out there. So that's what I set out to create.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is a book steeped in the mythology and gods of Lovecraft. The stories inside it's pages follow the spirit of Lovecraft, but often strays from the tone of Lovecraftian horror. \nSure, some of the stories in this book are Lovecraftian in nature down to their very core, but there are also funny stories, cute stories, fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, and much, much more which build on the Lovecraftian mythos. \nIf you love the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, then Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is going to be your jam. \nBest of all, this anthology is ALL AGES APPROPRIATE. These aren't stories made for children necessarily, at least not all of them, but we toned down the cursing (there is none), the violence (there is no blood), and there was never any sex, to make sure you could show it to your child, even if they won't understand it all. \nI've had conversations with many people at shows asking for a book to indoctrinate their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc, into loving creepy things, and I think this book is a great primer for that, while being enjoyable to people who already love the creepy, too. \nWe listened to you from the last anthology, and made sure this was: \n-Appropriate for all ages (even though we deal with some very dark topics) \n-Full color\n-Shorter stories (2, 4, 6, or 8 pages) \n-All stories are even numbers, so they begin and end on the same page throughout. \nWe used your feedback to make this anthology even better! You opinions are very important to us, and we appreciate them very much. \nBackers really loved our first anthology\nThe real reason we're doing a second anthology is because Kickstarter backers and fans loved our first anthology so much. I was hesitant to do a second anthology before the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t campaign launched. \nHowever, the response from backers was so positive that I gladly decided to go into the fray a second time. There is nothing like geeking out about something with creators and fans, and that is what our anthologies allow us to do.\nCheck out the reaction to our last anthology. We hope this anthology has an even better reaction! \nWe brought back a bunch of creators from the first book and added a ton of new faces so we can make this book even more amazing! \nWhy do the other creators love Lovecraft so much? \nWe all have our reasons for loving Lovecraft, so listen to some of our creators talk about why they got involved in the project. \nWho am I? \n My name is Russell Nohelty, publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead S%&t, Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary S^&t, and this anthology.  \nI have raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter from 7 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous two projects, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and ask if they would rather have a cheaply made paperback edition, or a beautiful hard cover edition. \nSee, I can go hit enable distribution on a soft cover edition right now, but luckily Kickstarter backers have again and again wanted the hardcover edition, printed in the most beautiful way possible.\nWhat are some of the stories in this book? \nNora (art and words by Angela Oddling) -- a dejected teenager living in an ice village sets out to find Aphoom-Zhah and thaw his cold heart. \nThe Dunwich Boys (art by Esther Pimentel, words by Eddy Hedington, letters by Nikki Powers) -- Yog-Sothoth has materialized in a house in Dunwich, and the Dunwich boys have to banish it from their neighborhood. \nThe Eternal War (art and words by Eric Young) -- A retelling of the origin story of Lovecraft's universe, translated from the Voynich manuscript. \nCat is Cryptic (art and words by Megan Hutchison) -- a retelling of the Cats of Ulthar, one of Lovecraft's most beloved stories. \nTsathoggua's Triumph (art by John Edingfield II, words by Clay Adams) -- Tsathoggua dreams of his eventual conquest of the universe. \nCleaning the Mess (story and art by Brandon Perlow, words by Paul J. Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. \nSong for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. \nThe Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. \nMons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. \nThe Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. \nNo DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. \nSlumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. \nThat's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. \nHow to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. \nChurch of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. \nShe Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. \nFlycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. \nThe Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. \nWhy is this book going to be so awesome? \n1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!\n2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! \n3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. \n4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. \n5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! \n6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! \nAnd you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! \nWho drew that dope cover? \n It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   \nIf you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. \nAaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  \nOn top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.\nDid Dirk Manning really write the foreword? \nYes, Dirk Manning, an icon of Lovecraftian horror comics on Kickstarter, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. \nDirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more on Kickstarter, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. \nHere is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. \nFor now, take the time to enjoy this book.\nWhile it\u2019s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn\u2019t a story in this collection that I didn\u2019t enjoy... which shouldn\u2019t be surprising since it\u2019s a reminder that just like you\u2019re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I\u2019m not alone either.\nI was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. \nWhat are some other stories in the book? \nAshes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     \nOne Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. \nA 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. \nThe Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. \nLove Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. \nBasatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.\nThe Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. \nSunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. \nThe Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. \nWhere is the money going? \nGreat question. Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. This is subject to fluctuation based on pledges, but should be a good guide. \nBook production and printing - $9,000 (41.5%)\nShipping - $6,000 (27.7%)\nPins - $334 (1.5%)\nKickstarter fees - $2,166 (10%)\nCreator residuals - $2,166 (10%)\nEmergency - $2,000 (9.3%)\nYou may ask why I have such a high emergency fund, and I would respond that it is why I have been able to successfully deliver 7 campaigns, because stuff always goes wrong, and sometimes in a big way. \nWhat can you get for your pledge? \nI am not the kind of creator who offers a ton of different rewards, but I do want to offer some awesome ones. Here's what you can get for your money. \nBefore I move on, I want to point out a couple of our coolest rewards. First, I want to thank Andrew Pawley for making this awesome paper doll, which EVERYBODY who pledges even for $1 will receive! \nYou have to build it yourself, but it looks just so awesome when it's set up.\nSecond, for the first time ever, I am doing an exclusive PIN designed by Aaron Alexovich specifically for this campaign. I have this pin in hand already, and it is AMAZING. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It will show new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled all but this one (only because it's currently running) without going over budget, and having raised almost $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically for this Kickstarter. After my previous anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. This time, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from this course.

I feel as though I have fixed all of those issues at this point with my supply chain, but there are always some more that pop up. \n\nFor instance, with the monster anthology, we had to wait an additional 3 months for the glow-in-the-dark eyes to be applied correctly, and fix errors in the covers. \n\nWith Katrina, we had to wait 8 more weeks in port due to customs than we wanted, delaying our release from July until September. \n\nThese things can and do happen, and I can't say they won't happen again. However, I have done everything possible to ensure that we will have a smooth operation and these books will be in your hand as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Paper toy!", "descp": "Get a downloadable Cthulhu paper toy designed by Andrew Pawley from Galaxafreaks and Cthulhu Kids!\nINCLUDES:\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Lovecraft", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the anthology in .pdf and .cbz form!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["348 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Audio Commentary", "descp": "Get audio commentary of my thought process about each story, why I placed it in the book, and fun stories about the book's creation.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hardcover edition of the book!", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nGet a physical copy of the book in all its hardcover glory!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nHardcover copy of the book\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nSpecial thanks in the book!

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

She has been writing for Alarums & Excursions since 1991, and has written material for Unknown Armies and reviews for The Familiar, The Unspeakable Oath, and RPG.net. She has edited and proofread games and scenarios from Arc Dream Publishing, Golden Goblin Press, Modiphius Entertainment, Parenthesis Press, and Rogue Games. She has also playtested games for Evil Hat Productions and Pelgrane Press, and knows a playtest has been unusually successful when her players inform her that she is going to run the game again next week even though the playtest period is over.\nBadger McInnes - Book Designer\n\nBadger has been working as a book designer and layout artist for the Call of Cthulhu RPG since 2003, starting out under the tutelage of Charlie and Lynn at Chaosium. He has designed books for Chaosium over the years (Call of Cthulhu 7th edition, Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition, Secrets of Kenya, among others), as well as other sinister purveyors of Call of Cthulhu material such as Pagan Publishing, Pelgrane Press, and Golden Goblin Press.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

It\u2019s not a book with adventures, spells, creatures, or magic items. It\u2019s not a book for characters at all, but a book for players! If you play or run roleplaying games, this book is for you. Inside this gorgeous hardcover book, suitable for your coffee table or your gaming table, you will find advice and suggestions for enhancing your RPG experience at the table and away from it. This is an insider\u2019s look at everything that goes into the hobby\u2014finding a group, making a character, running a game, creating adventures, finding all the right ideas, hosting a game\u2026and that\u2019s just for starters.         \nIf You\u2019re an Experienced Gamer\nYou\u2019ve been gaming for a while now. Maybe even years. You get the concepts, and you understand the rules. No one needs to explain the dice to you. Your Best Game Ever embraces the hobby you love, and provides real tips, immediately usable advice, and hands-on pointers you can use at your game table. You\u2019ll find everything here from enhancing immersion, tips for running games online, creating characters with depth, worldbuilding, designing rules, dealing with personality conflicts that arise at the table, and more!\nIf You\u2019re Fairly New to Gaming\nYour friends play RPGs. You\u2019ve maybe watched some streaming games, or given it a try a few times. You get the general idea, but where do you go from there? How do you really get into this hobby the way so many others have? This book will give you everything you need to learn how to choose the right game, how to fit into your game group or start your own group, and get you going on the fast track to being a great gamer.\nNot a Rule Book, But a Tool Book\nYour Best Game Ever is divided into three major sections: general game topics, being a player, and being a game master. There\u2019s even a section on designing your own game, and getting it published. And this isn\u2019t just a stuffy book on theory, either. You\u2019ll find actual suggestions you can use to create better characters with character arcs, real recipes you can make for game night (and even spruce them up for your genre of choice), specific suggestions for music and ambiance depending on genre, plot ideas, character ideas, and other ready-to-use material.         \nThis 240-page book will enable you to become a better gamer. You\u2019ll find ways to create and manage a great game group, tricks for game prep (and what to do if you haven\u2019t prepared!), understanding and managing game balance, and taking everything around you and incorporating it as inspiration for your game.\nMonte Cook, the principal author, has been playing RPGs for 40 years, and working on them professionally for 30 years. The MCG team, all of whom will be contributing, are an extremely seasoned group with a combined total of over 250 years of RPG experience. But we wanted to get an even wider and diverse set of experiences and points of view in this book, so we\u2019ve recruited a team of folks that will provide feedback as well as their own contributions for the book. This dream team of consulting experts includes:\nEric Campbell\nMatt Colville\nLuke Crane\nStacy Dellorfano\nTanya DePass\nAjit George\nJennell Jaquays\nEloy Lasanta\nTom Lommel\nMatthew Mercer\nSusan J. Morris\nAlina Pete\nJohn Rogers\nMonica Valentinelli\n\nThe book will also feature comics and cartoons from: \nJohn Kovalic (Dork Tower)\nVickie Lee (Dungeons and Doggos)\nAviv Or (Up to Four Players)\nBrian Patterson (d20 Monkey)\nLen Peralta (Geek-a-Week)\nAlina Pete (Weregeek)\nStan! (10x10Toon)\n\n(Scroll down for more details on Your Best Game Ever)\nIn 2011, Monte created Numenera, and with it, a game system called the Cypher System. This game system has won awards and has been lauded by gamers everywhere as a wonderfully different way to play games of any genre. In 2015, we created the Cypher System Rulebook (CSR) to help gamers use the system for any type of game they wanted to play\u2014fantasy, science fiction, horror, superheroes, and so on. You can get a copy of that book in this Kickstarter campaign, but we\u2019re also Kickstarting a new version that will come out in 2019. The new version will incorporate lots of new options for players, but perhaps best of all it will take the concepts from Your Best Game Ever and apply them directly to the Cypher System. These two books will work hand-in-hand to create the best Cypher game ever!         \n(Scroll down for more details on the new Cypher System Rulebook)\nIf you're new to the Cypher System and are curious about how it works, you can download the free Cypher System Rules Primer for an idea of how the game plays.    \nNow that the Kickstarter has funded, our stretch goals will focus on the development of various genre-focused books that will take the concepts found in the new CSR and take them one step further, with specific examples. Each of these additional books will include an entirely new and original campaign setting as well as lots of material and advice for making your own in the realms of science fiction, fantasy, and more. \nYou\u2019ve read the effusive descriptions above. Is Your Best Game Ever really for everyone? More importantly, is it for you? Maybe it would be better to just show you what\u2019s in the book. Here\u2019s a brief listing of some of the topics we'll cover:         \n                                      Click here for a closer look!  \n\nOur goal with this book is to make every game your best game ever. But we know\u2013as GMs, players, and designers ourselves\u2013that every game and every experience is unique. What\u2019s the hardest struggle you have with creating great games, either as a player or as a GM? Looking for some GM or player advice? Let us know at this link. (Once the KS is complete and we\u2019ve started working on the book, we\u2019ll look through your comments to make sure the book covers players\u2019 biggest issues and concerns.)         \nWhen we were finishing the new Numenera books, Discovery and Destiny, one of the first things that playtesters asked us was, are you going to incorporate some of the cool new material in these books into the Cypher System?         \nA valid question. And it got me (Monte) really thinking about the Cypher System Rulebook as a whole. I didn\u2019t want to change the rules\u2014I love the Cypher System, and wouldn\u2019t touch the mechanics. But developing Numenera Discovery and Destiny showed me that there was a lot we could add in terms of player abilities and flexibility, and what the CSR really needs is flexibility. The idea that you can create any campaign in any genre is fundamental to the whole idea. And I realized we could take some steps to push that idea a lot further.\nSo we\u2019re Kickstarting a brand new, revised 416-page Cypher System Rulebook. Before I go any further, though, let me say right now, if you\u2019ve got the existing Cypher System Rulebook and you\u2019re happy with it, great! These new ideas don\u2019t change the way the rules work. You still roll a d20, you\u2019ve still got difficulties 1\u23bc10, you\u2019ve still got characters with descriptors, types, and foci. NPCs have levels. PCs use effort to decrease the difficulty. Everything is still fully compatible with everything Cypher-related that we\u2019ve ever published. You\u2019ll be able to play a game with half the characters from the original CSR and half from the new CSR all at the table at the same time. The difference isn\u2019t in how the game is played, but in the choices players get to create and run their characters.         \nWhat I\u2019m most excited about are the ways I\u2019ve thought about over the last few years to make things more customizable so that you could even more easily use these rules in any setting. To that end, in this book we\u2019re dramatically streamlining the chapter on character focus, so that you can customize your character\u2019s focus to perfectly match the setting and your character concept. So if you\u2019re making a starship pilot, a superhero, or an occult investigator, you don\u2019t choose the one that fits best from a list of foci\u2014you take your character concept and tailor your focus so that it really fits what you want to do.\nBased on player feedback, we\u2019re also making what we call subtle cyphers\u2014cyphers that aren\u2019t tied to a specific object\u2014the default for all genres, and we\u2019ll be including way more of them. (You\u2019ll still be able to have cyphers as objects too.) This will make applying the concept of cyphers, which is obviously core to the system, easy no matter what kind of game you\u2019re playing.         \nAnd of course, there\u2019s all those new additions from Numenera Discovery and Destiny that add a lot of new options that just make the game better. They\u2019re not really changes, they\u2019re additions\u2014new character abilities, more choices, player intrusions in addition to GM intrusions, and more. These will all be incorporated into the new CSR. And let me say again, it\u2019s still all entirely compatible with existing Cypher System material, whether it be from the CSR or one of our settings like Gods of the Fall, Predation, or Unmasked (and of course, Numenera and The Strange).\nFurther, we\u2019ll also be incorporating suggestions from Your Best Game Ever directly into this book. So, for example, Your Best Game Ever will talk about creating character arcs to enhance play, while the specific material for creating Cypher System character arcs as a mechanic will be included in this book.\nLastly, we\u2019ll include even more genres you can use, in addition to fantasy, horror, and so on. We\u2019re going to break science fiction into hard sci-fi and space opera/science fantasy, and we\u2019ll add coverage for romance, historical gaming, and more!

Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Your Best Game Ever and the revised Cypher System Rulebook are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the books individually. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Your Best Game Ever PoP kit. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge for the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Early Playtest Access, add $100 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.  \nWhy does Monte Cook Games use Kickstarter to fund so many of its projects? In a word, you. You're reading this right now on Kickstarter because you're an invested game fan interested in what's new and innovative in gaming\u2014and thus you're exactly who we write our products for. If MCG were a company that made its way by publishing just another adventure or just another sourcebook every few months, we would have a hard time justifying Kickstarter. But that isn't our passion. Our passion is innovation and creation, but that requires up-front capital and\u2014probably even more importantly\u2014a test of the audience to determine if our ideas meet people's needs and wants. Kickstarter provides us with that. In turn, it puts us in a position to reward those early adopters with great deals, early access, and transparency. We think it's a win-win for everyone. But we use traditional sales channels as well, so if you'd like to check out some of our other products, like Numenera, The Strange, or Invisible Sun, you can go to our online store or visit your favorite local game retailer.         \nSoon after the Your Best Game Ever Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.         \nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email to check your MCG Shop account, which will be updated with coupons that let you redeem your rewards for free through our online store. You decide when to use the coupon, at which time we'll ask you to provide or update your shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of your rewards to bundle them together into one shipment to save on shipping costs. We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge\u2014it will be an additional charge for you. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $62 USD, you\u2019ll pay $52 USD. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the twelfth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Her first and most prominent work, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color, first published in 1901, provides a comprehensive overview of the main ideas of color theory at the time, as well as her wildly original and artistic approaches to color analysis and interaction. Through a 21st century lens, she appears to stumble upon midcentury design and minimalism decades prior to those movements. \nShe was a visionary color theorist whose methods were later adopted by men and became ubiquitous in design curriculums around the world. She was an incredible artist and creative champion whose pioneering work is conspicuously absent in nearly all history books. We aim to change that with this new presentation of her seminal work. In addition to presenting the original book in an accessible softcover, we are offering a beautifully bound hardcover edition exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This deluxe facsimile version will not be made available again.\nEmily Noyes Vanderpoel at home (courtesy Litchfield Historical Society)\nHer remarkable inventiveness shines in a series of gridded squares, each 10 x 10, that analyze the proportions of color derived from actual objects, many of which were in Vanderpoel's vast collection of ceramics and antiques. She leaves her process relatively mysterious but what is clear, as historian and science blogger John Ptak\u202fnotes, is that Vanderpoel \u201csought not so much to analyze the components of color itself, but rather to quantify the overall interpretative effect of color on the imagination\u201d. Her square format predates Josef Albers\u2019\u202ficonic Homage to the Square\u202fby some fifty years.\nA Selection of Color Analysis Plates\nThis incredible book has long languished in antiquarian book markets.  Original copies trade hands for more than $500 and it has never received its proper audience. \u202fWe aim to change that, and with this new edition have taken meticulous measures to reproduce the original artifact at an affordable price. Largely disserved by the public domain, this vast 400 page book has been reproduced in recent years by shoddy print-on-demand services, from academically held PDFs and most tragically, only in black and white. Working with the Historical Society that Emily Noyes Vanderpoel helped establish, we are the first to invest the time, money, and love it takes to replicate this brilliant collection of color studies accurately. Using the most current digital methods and archival printing production, we aim to finally do justice to Vanderpoel\u2019s forgotten legacy as visionary and pioneer.\nWe will also be contributing an introduction written by design scholar Alan P. Bruton, who has been researching Vanderpoel and her work for decades. This introduction will serve to reflect on her incredible body of work from the vantage point of 21st century art history and women's movements, helping to illustrate that Vanderpoel remains one of the most important, underrated, and contemporarily relevant artists of her time and of the last century.\n\"Thoroughly conversant with the best scientific research of her day, Emily Noyes Vanderpoel brings an artist\u2019s eye and designer\u2019s sensibility to her prescient study of color. From embroidery and Persian rugs to ceramics and painting, her perceptive analysis reveals what was long hiding in plain sight. The remarkable illustrations are actually works of art that not only anticipate but actually compete with the best work of some of the most important twentieth-century artists.\"\nMark C. Taylor\nColumbia University\n\"Vanderpoel\u2019s delightfully inscrutable work is an artifact from out of time: abstract modernism born of the Victorian need to classify everything\u2014even the mundane. This book inspired me, and deserves this beautiful new treatment in print.\"\nLiza Daly  Author and creator of the Vanderbot \n\"This re-edition of Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 1901 Color Problems is a fantastic addition to the library of literature that celebrates the wonders of visual experience. The writing is elegant, the information profound. How can we resist a book that opens with an exegesis on various elements of color in nature and on bird songs and Beethoven and declares \"We may aptly term color the music of light\"? The book is both a celebration and a lucid guide: to issues of luminosity and color temperature, and of harmony as well as contrast. And it is a compact dynamo of the history of color theory up to the time of Vanderpoel's writing. The many color plates are magnificent, both in the pleasures they provide and the magic they demonstrate; I feel safe in saying that Josef Albers would have been gobsmacked by this glorious volume.\"\nNicholas Fox Weber\nThe Josef and Anni Albers Foundation\nIn order to produce the beautiful objects you will receive as a backer at such an accessible price we need funds for printing and binding a large run. We aim to print at least 1000 copies, and our goal reflects the production costs for this amount, but the more pledges we get here the more we can print! As an established (although relatively young) publishing company we already have storage and distribution methods streamlined which will make for a seamless experience for our backers. \nWe also plan to spread the word of Vanderpoel's forgotten work as far and wide as we can. We need your help in righting this historical wrong. Tell your friends about Emily Noyes Vanderpoel! They will no doubt be as happy to discover her and her work as we have been. \nPDF - Each backer will receive a download of our high resolution color corrected PDF of the book.

Like the original, the text portion of our edition is printed on a soft uncoated natural stock. The 116 color plates are printed on a bright white coated paper stock to best display colors. The interiors will be offset printed with close attention to color reproduction. The book includes sewn signatures for long term durability and lay flat binding for ease of viewing.

It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. \nThe original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.\nIt described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach.\nThe book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. \nin total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos.\nWe will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph. \nThe original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.\nOriginally the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected.\nThe Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. \nThe Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and be in the book in full color.\nStretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the book into a package complete with full-size maps and a very rare addendum. This is quite expensive, but we would love to add it to the Neptune Monograph (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project).\nHenrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

In her spare time, she is a talented artist with a special love for painting collages and creating posters.\nThis document is a unique testimonial and insight into the risks, challenges, and fears the allied force faced before the invasion as well as a testimonial to the incredible work by allied intelligence units before D-Day. \nIt was compiled - with extreme risk - by commandos, naval intelligence, French resistance groups, air surveillance and weather and astronomical experts. \nToday only a few full copies exist worldwide and by reproducing this book we preserve one of World War 2s most important historical documents and make it available for a broader audience for the first time since it was finished in April 1944 and in time for the 75th anniversary in 2019. \nLean back and enjoy your copy of one of the most unique World War 2 books ever made delivered in time for Christmas.

We got the helicopter away from CENTRAL with a dozen or so survivors, our Chief Scientist included - although naturally he spent the entire flight complaining that we'd rescued his lab assistants instead of his research notes.\nThat's where the good news ends, I'm afraid. The political situation is continuing to worsen - NORAD is reporting something with Soviet transponder codes buzzing the Eastern Seaboard, but I know for a fact the Soviets don't have any jets in the area. If we let the aliens run around unopposed for much longer we're going start seeing mushroom clouds on the horizon...\nWe'll have ATLAS Base online by the end of the day. In the meantime, you need to figure out a strategy for rebuilding our organisation, bringing the political situation under control and defeating a vastly superior foe that we know almost nothing about. Best get started, eh? There's coffee in the pot.\nXENONAUTS-2 is a turn-based \"strategic planetary defense simulator\" that puts you in charge of a clandestine military force attempting to protect the planet from extraterrestrial invasion. It is the sequel to the acclaimed Xenonauts, successfully Kickstarted way back in 2012!\nWe are building a hugely complex strategy / tactics game that gives you total control of your organisation all the way from the command staff in your base down to the troops on the battlefield. The formula will be familiar to anyone who has played the classic X-Com games from the 90's (or the modern reboots), but Xenonauts-2 expands those foundations to create something deeper and more distinctive!\nThe action takes place in the modern day - but in an alternative timeline where decades of alien interference has prevented the end of the Cold War, leaving NATO and the Soviet Union teetering on the brink of a catastrophic nuclear war. Can you hold humanity together long enough to end the alien threat forever?\nXenonauts-2 is not a chronological sequel to the first Xenonauts but rather an updated portrayal of similar events. The game is in development on Windows PC and is expected to launch on Steam & GOG in late 2018; we will hopefully natively support Linux and Mac on release but cannot yet offer a firm promise of this (please see the FAQ for further details).\nWe've been developing Xenonauts-2 for three years now and the game is in an advanced state. If you want to check out how things are progressing, you can download a free demo of a single tactical combat mission at the link below. Bear in mind this is still an alpha; expect it to improve a lot before release!\nAh, Commander - so good of you to finally make an appearance. I will refrain from commenting on the (pathetic) attempts of Military Division to defend my laboratory, as I was still able to collect sufficient data during the extraterrestrial attack to validate my theories.\nThe aliens are indeed using a form of matter translocation to deploy their forces. Although I hardly expect you to understand the science, I have now devised a method of tracking the quantum waveform deformation caused by this process to within a ten mile radius.\nOne would hope that providing this organisation with the exact time and location of these alien incursions would be sufficient to allow our soldiers to finally begin collecting the samples and specimens I need to proceed with my work on ENDGAME ... but my experience thus far has taught me to expect otherwise.\nThe Geoscape is where you control the Xenonaut campaign against the extraterrestrial invaders. Alien UFOs and ground teams will conduct hostile operations all across the globe, threatening your funding regions and bringing the world ever closer to nuclear war - that is, unless you stop them!\nYour interceptor squadrons can challenge UFOs in the skies and the soldiers stationed at your base can respond to ground missions, but they cannot be everywhere at once. You will need to choose your missions carefully, maintaining control of the strategic situation whilst also ensuring you recover enough of the alien technology and materials to advance the cause.\nThe alien forces will grow steadily stronger as the invasion progresses, but so too will you. You will gradually learn more about your opponents and develop exotic new weapons, equipment and aircraft to aid you in the fight ... but can you hold out long enough to complete ENDGAME? Or will the Xenonauts see Earth consumed by nuclear flame?\nThe soldiers at your command on the Geoscape are persistent staff who gain combat experience and skills in battle - assuming they live long enough! As well as being deployed to deal with ground missions as part of your strike team, your soldiers can now also be deployed into funding regions as Field Agents.\nField Agents give you a way to influence regions directly - increasing your Relations, rooting out alien infiltrators, covering your organisations' tracks, etc. This is vital work, but it is a highly dangerous occupation in a world riven by paranoia - even before the aliens start getting involved!\nThe Geoscape has been significantly expanded since the first game with the intention of giving the player more choices to make and offering them more freedom. Field Agents are just one example of this - if you're interested, there is more detail on the other changes here!\nThe US built ATLAS back in the sixties as part of Project Iceworm. They didn't bother telling the pesky locals - after all, they might have objected to housing American nukes on their soil. Needless to say, ATLAS was abandoned in a hurry less than a decade later and its existence remains classified at the highest level.\nThat's all rather convenient for us - it's much easier to borrow something if nobody knows it exists. I had a backup command room and a cache of emergency supplies installed a while back, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that our new home is a derelict missile silo full of 60s-era junk. Expect fixing her up to take some time.\nIn the meantime, I hope you're fine with cold showers, cold food and... well, cold everything.\nThe loss of CENTRAL Base leaves the Xenonauts operating out of an abandoned missile silo in a remote area of Iceland - but you will need to reclaim and rebuild ATLAS if you are to create a global organisation capable of defeating the alien menace!\nATLAS is where you house the soldiers, scientists and engineers that serve your organisation. Each of your staff can serve in a variety of roles dependent on what structure they are assigned to - e.g. a scientist becomes a researcher in a Lab, and a doctor in a Medical Room.\nThe simulation of your base is deeper than the first game - not only are you juggling living space and working space for your staff, but power capacity, storage space, food consumption and much more. Fresh supplies and new staff are flown to ATLAS by your helicopter, but this prevents it from deploying combat troops - so time your supply runs carefully!\nATLAS is also where your research and development efforts occur. Your scientists study recovered alien technology and draw up designs for all kinds of battlefield equipment for your engineers to build - assuming you've built the facilities and recovered the alien materials they need to do so!\nThe tech tree is much wider and more varied than in the original game. We're adding new types of \"development\" research that improve and upgrade existing equipment (keeping it relevant for longer), working hard to make the different tiers of gear more distinct from one another, and generally trying to add more \"game-changing\" items that keep the combat feeling fresh and novel throughout the campaign!\nIf you're interested, you can read more details about the changes to ATLAS Base and the new Research mechanics on our forums.\nIf our resident brainboxes really do have a way to track the ETs ... well, we might just be able to turn this war around. The tiltrotor can land our troops almost anywhere they want, but we've never had enough intel to locate the aliens before they vanish back to wherever they came from.\nI don't much rate our chances against the assault team that hit CENTRAL this morning, so we should keep a relatively low profile until we've figured out a way to even the odds ... or at least until we've built some defenses that that might help us survive an attack on ATLAS.\nThe aliens must have some soft targets we can take advantage of - I suggest we lay an ambush and try to bring something back for Research Division. At least then we might find out what we're dealing with...\nDeploying a team of soldiers against the aliens on the Geoscape begins a turn-based tactical battle where you are given direct control of your soldiers and tasked with achieving the mission objectives - which could be anything from capturing a downed UFO to capturing (or eliminating) a troublesome VIP!\nThese missions are a deep and challenging tactical experience. We have retained the Time Unit system from the first game that gives you a huge amount of freedom in how you choose to interact with the battlefield (virtually all of which is destructible). We're giving the player even more tactical possibilities this time around - for instance, even the hulls of crashed UFOs can now be breached using the right equipment!\nThe effectiveness of your soldiers depends heavily on what you equip them with - and there is an expanded variety of different weapons and equipment to pick from. You will need to choose your loadout to suit the mission at hand - clearing the confined spaces of an alien base may call for heavy armor and shotguns, but you may find sniper rifles more valuable if a crashed UFO has come down in an open desert!\nAll of these battles are dynamically generated based on the strategic situation - e.g. if you shoot down a Scout UFO in an Arctic region, you'll be presented with a ground mission where you can attempt to capture a downed Scout UFO in a polar environment!\nThere are a wide variety of missions and environments for you to experience as you wage your global war against the aliens, all rendered in a high-fidelity 3D recreation of the classic isometric visual style. We are focused on minimizing map and mission repetition in order to maximise replayability - we want this to be a game you can pick up and play for years to come!\nThe alien species you face on the battlefield are deadly foes that each pose a different set of tactical challenges. We are working to imbue them with more character for the sequel, giving the returning faces a visual upgrade and updating their combat mechanics to ensure they feel unique!\nIf you are interested in reading more about the changes we have planned for the ground combat, you can do so here.\n We can't risk dealing with funding regions directly, Commander - too many infiltrators. We rely on a network of individuals willing to 'misplace' things in the name of the cause ... a few crates of supplies, the odd helicopter, maybe a few million dollars here and there.\nThere's risks, of course - mostly revolving around getting murdered by aliens - but someone has to do it. Each individual person plays only a small role, but everything we do relies on their collective support. Our backers are just as much a part of this war as we are.\nWe're a small team working on a really big idea - and we need your help! \nSo far we have been able to fund the development of Xenonauts-2 from the sales of the first Xenonauts, but we simply don't have enough money to include everything we want in the game. Instead of trying to raise money from publishers, we're turning to the people who have always supported us when we needed it most - our fans!\nRaising additional funds would allow us the breathing space we need to properly polish the game up before release. Some of this will be spent on adding cool new features and neat little touches to the game, but we'll also use it to ensure there is an extended period of community playtesting that will allow us to iron out countless balance issues, bugs and usability problems.\nThe \u00a335+ tiers allow you to put a custom soldier in the game with your name, nationality and a unique face generated from our portrait editor!\nYou can see all the cool rewards available to backers to the right of this page. As well as getting access to the game on Steam or DRM-free on GOG, higher tiers give players digital copies of the soundtrack and access to our closed beta.\nThose willing to back at \u00a335 or above can put a custom soldier in the game with their own name, nationality and a unique portrait created from our free Portrait Generator tool (see FAQ for full details). This soldier will appear in your starting squad every game!\nBacking our highest tiers gets you a custom portrait hand-painted from a photo by our portrait artist!\nThose willing to back at the highest tiers can have a custom portrait painted from a photo by our portrait artist. You can see an example of the results above, painted from a still in our Kickstarter video!\nAs we're asking for your help to add extra features to the game, we thought we should let you choose the order of the stretch goals! \nFor the first week of this Kickstarter, we will be running a vote to set the order of the stretch goals, with the most popular features becoming the first stretch goals!\n\u00a350,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #1 (unlocked by hitting our funding goal!)\n\u00a375,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #2\n\u00a3100,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #3\n\u00a3150,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #4\n\u00a3200,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #5\n\u00a3250,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #6\nThese are the features that you'll be able to vote for - click the link if you're interested in more detail on what each one involves!\nMARS Weapon Platform & Sentry Guns\nModular Weapons\nLocational Injuries\nOrchestral Soundtrack Recording\nAdditional Xenonauts-2: Community Edition / Modding Support\nReaper Hives\nWeather Conditions\nGeoscape Situations\nThese are all features we'd like to experiment with, so we may implement some of them even if they don't make it as a stretch goals - this vote is just to let us know the ideas you think are most exciting!\n\"We had a bad day at the office today, folks. Let's all take a moment to thank the big man up in the sky for watching over us. You know who I'm talking about ... SKYRANGER's got your back!\" \n- Removed from ATLAS noticeboard\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter!

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action! Her specialities are Moving and Fighting.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nPrudence\nPrudence tries to keep an eye on everything. She helps the other Virtues as well as Solomon, providing vital support to both.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nJustice\nJustice is willing to listen to both sides. She is fair and balanced, and is expert at finding a solution that benefits everyone. Her areas of skill are Talking and Influencing a situation for the better.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nTemperance\nTemperance keeps a sharp eye and a clear head. She encourages Solomon to keep his wits about him, and be aware of what is going on around him. Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most. For this reason, backers who pledge for Solomon Kane in the first 24 hours have the option of a Puritan pledge with an extra Early Bird bonus!   \nIf you are a board game retailer and are interested in Solomon Kane, please click here. \nPour d\u00e9couvrir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici\nAll pledge levels are available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language you prefer in the pledge manager, after the campaign. This campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect your address information via our pledge manager, after the campaign ends. The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Solomon Kane. This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers (including any retail backers) at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \n\n\nThis is the latest Mythic Games team photo we could find.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Road, MTB, CX, Gravel, E-bikes. One universal, we all suffer flats. A dependable and user-friendly pump is the most critical piece of equipment a cyclist can carry.\nIntroducing The Stompump, foot pump.\nFlat tires happen. The Stompump is the first compact, foot actuated inflator. The Stompump stows neatly on your bike, your car, motorcycle, or backpack. This is why we've created the Stompump, so you can easily and safely inflate a flat tire. No need to fiddle with Co2 inflators or unreliable and clumsy frame pumps.\nThe Stompump mounted to bottle-cage bosses using the Frame Dock\nThe Stompump will come complete will all accessories pictured\nStompump has a maximum pressure of 90 PSI\nStompump Weights & Dimensions\nDo you Need a Stompump?\nEvery cyclist will experience a flat tire. Traditional hand pumps, CO2 inflators, and mini pumps are cumbersome, require a lot of strength and energy to use, and most importantly do not work well. The Stompump can inflate a tire 3 times faster than a hand-pump, using far less energy. It\u2019s also not as risky as a Co2 inflator, or as challenging as a mini pump. Do you want to struggle with 'the get-it-perfect or you\u2019re stuck' scenario with a Co2 cartridge?\nThe Stompump will inflate a 29er MTB tire 3 times faster than a hand pump\nThe Stompump was born 2 years ago after a miserable experience on the side of the road in a freezing rainstorm fighting a mini-pump for 20 minutes to fix a flat. We needed a solution. Since that time, we have spent countless hours perfecting a pump for all types of cyclists.\nMany cyclists are using higher volume tires, from mountain bikes and fat bikes to gravel-road bikes and even traditional road bikes. The higher volume/larger tires means better ride quality, traction and efficiency. With these larger tires comes the need for a pump that is optimized for pumping more air per compression. This is where The Stompump excels! The Stompump also works with many other inflation applications.\nStompump Mounted with the Frame Dock on a Gravel Grinder bike.\nThe Stompump is a great tool for all areas of your life.\nInflating a Fat-Bike tire 3 times faster than a handpump.\nThe Stompump includes some features that most portable pumps do not. We've incorporated a cylindrical storage compartment, 22.2mm x 53mm. very handy for a patch kit or any thing else of similar size. We've also engineered an air filter for the intake. This keeps The Stompump's internals clean of dirt and debris and working smoothly.\nThe integrated Storage Compartment: you can put anything you want in here. Pictured with tubeless repair Plugs.\nThe integrated Air Filter, keeps the incoming air clean and your Stompump working smoothly\nThe Stompump is completely serviceable as well as rebuildable and repairable. We've built this pump to never need any significant service, but should you need to it's simple to disassemble and clean.\nEasy to disassemble for servicing should you ever need to\nThe Stompump is Compatible with both Presta and Schrader valve stems.\nIf we reach our funding goal early we'll open up a Reward that enables your choice of colored hoses!\nThe Creators of The Stompump have been the brains behind bringing hundreds of products to market over the last 30 years. Most recently we launched the Bar Fly brand of products. We've designed and manufactured OEM Products for companies like Cycliq, Cervelo, Specialized, Sigma and more. Not to mention the work we do with other companies like the Longnow Foundation, and Universal Sonar Mount. We\u2019ve spent our lives innovating and creating things that make our lives easier! We've compiled much of the IP that's gone into The Stompump through our hobby as Battlebots competitors, winning 7 championship \"nuts\" over several weight classes.\nBronco, the latest in a long line of our Battlebots, winning against Stinger\nMedia Coverage\nReason Bradley & Woody Tate", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Stompump Patron", "descp": "Pledge anywhere from $5 to $5000, you'll get updates, our eternal gratitude, AND a Stompump sticker!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Colored Hose", "descp": "1 Hose for Stompump.

We aim to create a highly unique collection of board games for an international audience using high-quality design and production standards.\nGamebook is not like most books\u2014it\u2019s interactive. People have been playing games for all of recorded history, and there is evidence to indicate we played them before recorded history, too. We believe that games have always been an important tool for human social interaction, and Gamebook is designed to encourage this. Each game included in the Gamebook has multiple variations requiring different strategies and approaches, making each game yours to play and explore in your own unique way.\nGamebook is a collection of ancient abstract strategy board games: Surakarta, Tablut, Pachisi, Alquerque, Mu Torere, Senet, Nine Men\u2019s Morris and Stern-halma.\nWe have searched the rich history of board games for untold stories. Gamebook contains eight abstract strategy board games, carefully selected from the rich world gaming heritage. Gamebook encompasses history, theory and practice of selected board games.\nAssemble four boards of the Gamebook to create a new board game specially designed and developed for this edition!\nWho is Gamebook for?\nGamebook contains board games ranging from two to six players. The board games were chosen based on their difficulty, from basic board games to ones requiring more complex strategies. Gamebook is appropriate for many different ages, so don't worry about who you invite to game night! :)\nOn the left side Hana and on the right side Ema Jesih are playing board game Alquerque.\nAesthetics and Design\nAll selected games are re-designed to a unified graphic language, built of basic geometrical forms by a limited range of colours. Each game has been refined to include only the essential elements necessary for gameplay, and each game board is treated as abstract art based on the textures of different drawing materials.\nMagic Binding\nGamebook features two innovative designs - the box for game pieces is also the book's backbone that holds the pages together with simple and very effective magnetic binding. Every page is simply plucked out when you want to play, and put back in; you can arrange the book as you like.\nFigures, sticks and a dice\nGamebook includes everything you need to start playing any of the board games. The backbone of the book contains a concealed department for all small figures, six two-sided sticks and a dice. Before the invention of dice, most board games were played with sticks, stones or cowrie shells. The flat side of the stick is the \u201cheads up\u201d side. Different combinations give different scores, giving a totally different dynamic to certain games.\nBooklet of History and Rules\nWhere did board games come from? How did our ancestors play board games? Which abstract strategy board games concepts have spread around the world? The answers to these questions can be found in the booklet of History & Rules. The booklet is included on the back page of the book. You can pluck it out and read it separately so it won\u2019t disturb the game flow of the game you're playing.\nRewards\nStretch goals\nGamebook trilogy\nResearch about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection \u2014 possibly a Gamebook trilogy.\nHibird Books\nOur goal is to establish our own publish company called Hibird Books. Our vision is to publish extraordinary books and to connect unseen combinations of media and materials. Hibird Books main interests are special editions, interactive books, book-objects and artist\u2019s books. Help us bring our Gamebook project to life and many more unusual books will follow. Only time will tell where the path will end. Join us! Back us up. :)\nBook Specification\nBook dimensions: 32 x 28 x 2,2 cm (12.6\"x11\"x0.86\") \nGame boards dimensions: 28 x 28 cm (11\"x11\") \nWeight: 1,2 kg (2.64 Ibs)\nMaking Gamebook prototypes\nPLAY\n\nGamebook is mostly handcrafted. We have made several prototypes to find the best materials and a suitable shape for the book. Almost the entire book is made using recycled materials. The core of the pages and box are cardboard, and we used recycled paper for the pages and for the History & Rules booklet. The figures and dice are made of wood. The rest is a secret! If you are interested in the story of Gamebook\u2019s creation, especially the making of Gamebook prototypes you can follow us (Hibird Books) on Instagram or Facebook.\nPeople behind the project \n Founders:\nHana Jesih (founder of Gamebook) is a book designer & illustrator who loves to make mind-maps, travel and is taller than Peter. You can see her other book design projects on her website or you can take a look at her gallery space on her Instagram page.\nPeter Plantan (cofounder of Gamebook) is an architect who hates and loves everything at the same time and is a fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can get to know his world view on his Instagram page.\nVideo Credits:\nNejc Gazvoda is a film director and writer. He was in charge of the script and directing the video. He wanted to use slider in the video, we made his wish come true.\nMarko Pirc takes credit for photography and shooting the presentation video. His favourite sandwich is chips with sausage and chips on the top.\nVoice over: Michael Manske\nSong: \"Jadranje\", from the original soundtrack for the film \"Pot v raj\" composed by Andi Koglot and Laren Polic Zdravi\u010d.\nSpecial thanks to NEJC GAZVODA, friend no.1. Big thanks to STA\u0160 STANKOVI\u010c and MARKO PIRC from LUMULABS for all advices. They also let us work on the presentation in their office and lent us their equipment and gadgets. MARU\u0160A HREN for all her tips and help with bookbinding, MILENA JAKOVLJEVI\u010c from MEDIODROM for tips in mediamarketing, JURE TURK for IT support, NIKO KLAN\u0160EK for business support, GREGA PLANTAN for legal advice, SAMO KRALJ for producing wooden playing sticks, IVO VESELI\u010c for his own versions of texts and our FAMILY for moral support and food. Thanks also to all other friends who helped us in any kind of way. ;)\nTimetable\nWe have spent the last year researching board game history and designing and testing our Gamebook. All aspects of our designs have been thoroughly considered at each stage of the product creation process, from concept design, materials and technical aspects to numerous prototypes. It\u2019s been a wonderful journey, and now we\u2019re almost ready for the manufacturing stage. Only with the help of Kickstarter and, most importantly, our backers will we finally be able to bring our Gamebook project to life. If you know any friends, family, colleagues or random strangers who may be interested in our project, please help us spread the word! You can expect to receive your order by November 2018.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDuring the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game.

They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked.

We've been working days and nights with manufacturers over the past 4 months and have fully set up our supply chain.\n\nWhere we are heading:\nThe biggest challenge we face in this project is tooling. It takes about 6 weeks to make the molds we need and then we begin the process of refinement. We won't stop until it's perfect and we've padded our timeline to account for multiple rounds of tweaking. We just can't know for sure how long it will take to reach perfection. We will have Josh, our lead Industrial Designer and modern-day MacGyevor, to thank when we've cleared this hurdle. \n\nWe've had over 900 SuperStraps Ambassadors help us refine various designs on SuperStraps, but we want to get your input too.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

This first foray brought together Reiner Knizia and \"the Grand Shaman of Games\" himself Greg Stafford, for the family game Khan of Khans set in the mythic world of Glorantha. Now we're back with a Kickstarter for our first Lovecraftian board game since 1987! I'm excited to be working with Reiner again, exploring the world of horror in a fast-paced, fun-filled, push-your-luck game.\n\nSet in the treacherous and terrifying Restricted Collection of Miskatonic University's Orne Library, the game features grimoires, elder signs, academic politics and madness \u2014 and that endlessly renewable resource, graduate students! We hope you'll join us on our journey by supporting this Kickstarter and make the Miskatonic University game a reality!\nThe Details\nThe game comes in an awesome box (8\" x 6\" or 20cm x 15cm), disguised as a book. Very appropriate for a game about libraries!\n What's in the box?\n5 Player Desk Boards \n80 Library Cards\n5 sets of Defense Cards \nScoring Cards \nRule Book  \nThe Story \nThe game is a quest.  An extremely dangerous quest. Dr Henry Armitage, Chief Librarian, needs you to search the perilous Restricted Collection for fragments of lore from among the grimoires, and recover pieces of a particular sigil.\n\nIt all began when, as leading scholars at Miskatonic University, you were gathered together to discuss who would be awarded the coveted position of Head of the Library Committee. Suddenly tragedy and horror struck\u2014a monster had been unleashed, presumably by some foolish graduate student! Dr. Armitage leapt into action and asked for your help. He needs you to gather the necessary tools to banish the foul abomination.\n\nYou explore the Restricted Collection for the grimoire fragments and sigils he needs. However it is a perilous journey and you must be prepared to flee before you are driven mad! The victor is the professor who finds the most sets, while retaining a semblance of sanity. Also, look out for hapless wandering graduate students as they can aid in your defenses!\nHow to Play\nThere are five rounds in the game. Each round continues until no-one is left in the library, having left \"voluntarily\" or having been expelled. \nBasic play consists of taking turns to select a Library Card and placing these cards face up on your player mats.\nThere are three types of Library Cards. Sigil Pieces, Grimoire Fragments and Graduate Students, that fit neatly into the player mat:\nThere are two ways to exit the library. Choosing to leave or being expelled:\n Defense cards are a key part of the game:\n You win by having the highest score:\nGame End \nThe game ends when the final fifth round is played. \nYou then add up all the score cards they have received and the one with the highest score wins! \nThe winning scholar will become the head of the Library committee! And armed with the sigil pieces and grimoire fragments you collected, Dr. Armitage heads out into the night to take on the monster. He beckons you to follow him . . .\nVideos\nOur Board Games Line Editor, Susan, shows how the game is set up to play\n.\nPLAY\n\nSusan discusses how the game unfolds...\nPLAY\n\nHere is actual play of the game, recorded in the chapel at Schloss Neuhausen, Germany in October 2017. Please note, the game components used here are a prototype, but the game play and rules are exactly the same as in the final version that will go to publication. Playing, from left to right, are Neil, Susan and MOB from the Chaosium team. \nMany thanks to The Kraken, the \"baroque gathering of international gamers, gamemasters and game creators\", where this video was filmed.\nThe Design and Development Team\nGame Design: Reiner Knizia\nDevelopment: Susan O'Brien\nAdditional Development: Mike Mason\nGraphic Design: Ian O'Toole\nArt: Victor Leza, Goomi\nMiskatonic University: The Restricted Collection is \u00a9 Dr. Reiner Knizia and Chaosium Inc 2018.

Miskatonic University is the registered trademark of Chaosium, Inc.\nStretch Goals\nIt wouldn't feel like a Kickstarter if we didn't have at least a few stretch goals and surprises in store as we go forward. We will announce these as the campaign proceeds...\nRewards\nYou'll see in the pledge levels, aside from the game itself we have some extra rewards.  Here's some more details about these:\nPledge Levels\nWe have 10 different pledge levels, starting at student and progressing up to Dean of as yet unnamed new departments. Along with the basic level of professor, where you get the game, we have opportunities for you to join a fraternity or sorority where you can nominate the name of those graduate students wandering the Restricted Collection!\nOr you can choose to be a valedictorian, with a special plaque to prove it! There are vacancies for the Vice Chancellor, the Chancellor, or even a prestigious position as a member of the Board of Trustees. \nSHIPPING\nWhat about shipping? We hate the high cost of shipping, and have worked hard to set up the fulfillment of the rewards so they get shipped as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We do not expect to make any money from our shipping charges. However, we also cannot afford to lose money on shipping. The way it will work is after the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your addresses. We will use this data to get the most detailed shipping pricing we can based on our actual cost to ship your reward level to your home and then charge you that amount. We will ship from fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia. More locations may be added based on where backers are located. The approximate weight of the game will be under one kilogram (under two pounds), including the shipping box and packing material. We are also likely to use BackerKit to help us with fulfillment and final order processing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChaosium has learned a great deal from its past Kickstarter projects. Our last board game Kickstarter, Khan of Khans, was delivered to backers on time as promised. Again, every item for this project has been created. There is no writing, editing, layout, or art to be done for the core game; ALL of those things are done. \n\nMiskatonic University: The Restricted Collection is ready to go to the printers, and we are only waiting to see if we can eek out some more fun from a few simple stretch goals. Needless to say, there is always the potential for production and delivery issues to crop up, but we have faced such hurdles before and will triumph.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Student", "descp": "Show your support for the University by enrolling as a student.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["99 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Professor", "descp": "Receive the full printed boxed game with all expansions and stretch goals.\nNote: Shipping will be calculated when game is ready for shipment.\nINCLUDES:\nPrinted boxed game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,249 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Librarian", "descp": "Receive two copies of the full printed boxed game with all expansions and stretch goals.\nNote: Shipping will be calculated when game is ready for shipment.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Printed boxed game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["285 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Book Repository", "descp": "Receive ten copies of the full game with all expansions and stretch goals.

So I started to draw symbols, and it ballooned into a massive project of now over 750 symbols in categories ranging from Alchemy and Astrology to Norse, Slavic, Celtic, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian Mythology, to Cults and Hobo Code. \n\nThe current version, without the webfont format, is available for purchase on my website.\n\nStage 1: Hermetica\nI've already finished the entire set in the dark weight, and all that's left is to finish making it into a webfont.\nStage 2: Hermetica Light\nNext I will produce the 'light' weight, a hairline version of all 750+ symbols in the 'dark' weight.\nStage 3: PostersI will design a poster as a reward (see below), as well as 25 custom posters as a more expensive reward.\n and... T-shirts!  XS,S,M,L,XL. Screen printed on American Apparel tees.  Available in white or black.\nand the Hermetica screen-printed canvas tote bag!\nStage 4: (Stretch Goal: $10,000)\nIf I raise more than $10,000 I will research and produce an oversize coffee table book that you can buy.\nNot the real layout - mock-up only!\nWhy are you making this?\nBefore I made Hermetica, I couldn't find a single complete, cohesive set of symbols to use for my projects. Other symbol resources were an ugly hodge podge of different styles and qualities, scattered across many different sources. What's more, sources often disagreed on the name and design, and no one offered these symbols as vector artwork.\n\"There ought to be a 'Helvetica' of Symbols\", I thought - standardized, simple, beautiful - and vectorized. And so over the course of a few years I devoted myself to researching and designing these 750 beautiful symbols to share with you - graphic designers, artists, tattoo artists, fashion designers, ceremonial magicians, activists, and aesthetes and symbol-lovers of all kinds.\nB007 Celestial Objects \u203a Saturn\nWhat about symbols of Hate?\nThis was an ethical question I asked myself while creating Hermetica. I decided to keep a select few symbols that have come to be associated with hate groups, because the symbols can also be useful to people who are using them to fight hate groups. For example, an anti-fascist group has just as much need for a Nazi swastika as does a neo-fascist. And in some cases, symbols with a long cultural tradition and different meaning in another culture were later appropriated by hate groups.\nD007 Alchemy \u203a Sulfur (Alternate)\nWhy didn't you include __________?\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but after working on this for years, I needed to draw a line (no pun intended) and just finish it. In the future I would like to add more American Indian/Mesoamerican, African, and Indigenous Australian symbols.\nI also found that a lot of these symbols don't lend themselves to the \"Helveticization\" that I employed in creating the other, mostly 'western' symbols.\nI003 Celtic \u203a Triquetra\nThank you for your support!\nK001 Egyptian \u203a Khephra", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've already completed the first stage, and I'm on my way with the second.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

All other games and accessories included within the pledges will be shipped separately in September. All other countries will receive everything in one delivery in September. See more details in the FAQ section.\nDesigned in Italy, MUtable is the design-oriented alternative to your child\u2019s everyday play table, but paired with the flexibility and durability of a table that will last your family for years.\nPLAY\n\nMUtable 2.0 offers so many playing options that your kids will never stop having fun!   \nMUtable 2.0 includes 4 double-sided playboards that stack on top of each other.     \nEvery MUtable includes all 4 height options, enabled by easily switching the table's legs. This way MUtable grows with your kid, all the way up to 8 years old!\n * MUtable is certified as toy for use from 3 years old\nMUtable and its chairs come in five different colors, Mauve, Mint, White, Dove Gray and Tiffany, that you can mix and match according to your interior design style. \nWhen playtime's over, kids can easily push all the toys into the hole in the center to drop everything into the toy storage bag underneath. \nWhen they want to change games, they just need to flip the board and change bag. You can even organize different toys into different Toy Bags!\nOn each side of the table there is the option to attach up to 3 Side Toy Holders, a convenient cup-like container to store pencils and small toys. \nThe Lego \u00ae Tower is an extension of the Lego \u00ae base, enabling kids to play on up to 3 different levels of Lego \u00ae! Every level is double sided and compatible with both the Lego \u00ae Duplo \u00ae and classic Lego \u00ae. \nMix up the interchangeable scenarios to boost your kids' creativity!  More scenarios to choose from will be available after the campaign.\nPretend play has never been so much fun: with just one playhouse you will get 4 different environments to play and up to 24 rooms! No screws are needed to build the house and so it can be easily stored flat when is not used! You can choose between 2 different play houses:\nDolls House: includes a family house, a playground, a kindergarten and a museum!\nHeroes House: includes a police station, a fireman station, a superhero cave and a mountain lodge\nBoard games are a fantastic way to exercise logic and tactical skills... but they can also be a way to learn new things! We developed 3 board games on 3 themes that are important for kids.\nDISKcover Geography: On the double-sided map board, your child will travel around the globe and learn some of the main cultures and animals in the World! \nDISKcover History: Jump on your time machine and take a journey through time discovering some of the most relevant characters of human history! \nDISKcover Fruit & Vegetables: Two different games on one single board! On one side, an orchard where your child will take an adventurous trial picking fruit from trees and protecting it from spiteful insects, and twists. On the other side, a vegetable garden where to discover and grow many different vegetables! \nPuzzles are the best way to stimulate your kids creativity and critical thinking! We developed 6 round puzzles that perfectly fit the MUtable puzzle base. \nMore space for more fun! The extension is a steady additional panel that will increase the surface of your MUtable. Up to 6 kids can play or have a seat at the same time...for twice the fun! Use the extension to let your kids play with their friends, have a meal or just have fun with bigger toys. And it is super easy to assemble; just place it on top of the table and fix it with the solid locks below. \nIncluded with the extension you will receive an additional disk to store pens and small toys and leave the surface even. \nWith the cover, you can protect the MUtable and let your kids play without worries. This silicone top perfectly fits MUtable and shields it from any kind of damage from colors, water, food... \nAdditionally, when you don't use it, the cover can be a convenient holder for all your MUtable disks!\nNot only do MUtable chairs match perfectly with the table color of your choice, but they will also adjust to the four different heights with the table, ranging from a seat height of 23.5cm to 36cm. \nA backrest is included with each chair, but it can be removed to transform the MUtable chair into a stool comfortable for grown up players as well. \nYou can add as many chairs as you wish with your MUtable... they are optional as we know that kids love to play in different ways! \nAlso featured in: \nMUtable is 71.6cm large and each playboard has a diameter of 54cm. The extension is 98cm (38.5in) large.\nHere you also find a table with all possible heights you can adjust your MUtable and chairs too! \nWe are so thankful for checking out our project and helping us spreading the word!\nSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are very low, as most of the risk has been dealt with in our previous campaign.\n\nWe have a full production line in place with the best producer of wooden toys in the world, Hape Toys. \n\nWe've delivered our MUtables to customers worldwide for months, and together with HAPE have set up a solid and trusted distribution system.\n\nMUtable and most of its accessories have already been produced in high quantities and they are now fully certified for children use around the world.\n\nRegarding the new games and accessories they have all already prototyped and ready for production.\n\nWe will deliver the same level of quality as we have already done in a timely manner!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "CUSTOMIZED BUNDLE", "descp": "FOR PREVIOUS BACKERS ONLY -\nIf you already own a MUtable, you can buy here your personalized bundle of games and accessories!\nFollow the instructions shared by email and make your pledge!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac169 or more", "title": "JUST MUTABLE", "descp": "Designed with love in Italy, you\u2019ll get one MUtable with all 4 Heights and 4 different, double-sided Play Boards.\nChoose MUtable color after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac199\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac249 or more", "title": "BASIC KIT", "descp": "Designed with love in Italy, you\u2019ll get one MUtable with all 4 Heights, 10 different Games and 2 Storage Accessories.\nChoose MUtable color after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac329\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)\n10\u00d7 Games\n1 Toy Storage Bag\n1 Side Toy Holder", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["263 backers", "Limited (7 left of 270)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac299 or more", "title": "STARTER KIT", "descp": "Add the Lego Tower to the Basic Kit! 3 levels of creativity and a fun scenario to play.\nChoose MUtable color and Lego tower scenario after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac399\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)\n10\u00d7 Games\n1 Toy Storage Bag\n1 Side Toy Holder\n1 Lego Tower with 1 Scenario (choose after the campaign)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["192 backers", "Limited (8 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac349 or more", "title": "STANDARD KIT", "descp": "Protect your Mutable!

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined seven Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because we have so much experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partner in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have strong relationships with our international fulfillment partners. These are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparation after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nAdditionally, we will be freighting the Elder Dice around the world to our fulfillment partners who will then send the rewards to you. Shipping delays at sea, weather conditions, extended customs inspections, and more could potentially delay the project at this stage.\n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color.

Secrets of the Lost Tomb, our first title, now has 14 SKUs including expansions and miniatures.\n\nThat means we have produced an astounding amount of different boxes of game product for our past campaigns.\n\nWe endeavor to please our backers in any way we can!

READ ABOUT THE BOOK FURTHER DOWN\n Welcome to Metropo with its gleaming spires and forgotten depths. A city so vast and dense it almost feels alive. Artificial or otherwise, its denizens struggle with familiar heartache and tackle questions we are only beginning to ask.\nThis \u2018slice of cyberpunk life\u2019 collection takes us into the hearts and minds of these denizens, presenting eight stories from the lives of those in the unending city.\nMETROPO eight stories from the unending city includes these stories:\nRaindrop Hatch (comic)\nThe Fierce Code (prose)\nTemporal (prose)\nAutomobile (comic)\nWalkways (comic)\nDrowning (prose)\nEvery Moment is a Moment Forward (comic)\nSunrise (prose)\n                               Raindrop Hatch // Vivian Truong\nAutomobile // Rob Croonenborghs\nEvery Moment is a Moment Forward // Naomi Franquiz\nWalkways // Mary Safro\nspot illustrations // Emerson Dimaya\ncover art // John Jamtli\na taste of the layout//design\n\nPLEDGE//LEVELS\nShipping included on all pledge levels.\nIf you'd like to order up more books (w or without slipcases), send us a message and we'll help you out.\nFOR APPAREL//MERCH, PLEASE VISIT DESIGN FROM THE UNENDING CITY:\nmetropo.threadless.com\nWHY//KICKSTARTER\nBecause of you! We have the opportunity to link up directly to your brain, whether you are android or human (or somewhere in between). Not only do we want to give you a memorable cyberpunk sci-fi experience, but, if you so choose, a top-of-the-line physical book to hold and cherish. We are children of rampant digitalisation, but we are firm believers in the exquisiteness of a good ol\u2019 printed book.\nThe stories, the art and the design, are all completed and the book is ready to go to print. Eight lyrical and haunting 'slice of life' cyberpunk stories, coated in a design even a malevolent AI could love.\nWe have all worked hard to build and wire the stories contained within METROPO, and by coming to Kickstarter we hope to raise funds for the printing and distribution of a book that you will be proud to have sitting on your shelves. In addition to the regular book we have a premium citizenship slipcase edition at a higher pledge level.\nWhen the campaign is successful we have our warehouse-bots and digiworms raring to go to deliver METROPO eight stories from the unending city right to your doorstep or your inbox. This, of course, falls to you dear citizen. Plug in and pledge to one of our rewards and tell your friends, your synthetic companion, or your android neighbour all about it!\nTo crunch some numbers for all you sentient account algorithms out there, the breakdown of the campaign budget looks like this:\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the Norwegian Arts Council and their branch Fond For Lyd og Bilde for the grant that made the art production of this book possible. If not for them, this pie chart, and financing this book, would be impossible.\nPRINTING//SHIPPING\nWe're partnering with a tried and trusted megacorporation from Sector 5 in Metropo\u2014KrakenPrint. Our HQ have used them for both printing and fulfilment for the Spiral Kickstarter campaign, as well as printing the Earthlock one-shot comic. With more than satisfactory results.\nSOCIAL//MEDIA\nAll Metropo visitors and citizens, artificial or otherwise, are encouraged to join the construction of the unending city on our newsletter & social media sites.\nCREATORS//\nMagnus Aspli // A robot from Norway who has written comics and screenplays for nearly a decade. Magnus is currently working on building Metropo on several fronts, while also being involved in a few film and TV projects, plus a game. He\u2019s been shipped and updated at universities in both Brisbane and London, but now lives in Trondheim with his family, raising kids and raising hell.\nVivian Truong // Vivian says she\u2019s a short Chinese artist from London, but as you can tell, she might be a digital self-representation of a cartoon character. Rumour claims she\u2019s a rogue AI, but the fun and benevolent kind. Vivian has a Patreon you could hack into to discover more of her work.\nMary (Cryoclaire) Safro // Mary is a Russian cyber-junkie comic artist, saving the Queen in the UK. She\u2019s the co-creator of Drugs & Wires. A retro-90s Eastern cyberpunk webcomic about everything going wrong. It updates on Mondays and you should head back to the 90s to check it out.\n John Jamtli // John is our cover artist. He\u2019s a wide-ranging illustrator mainly working in comics. His most recent work is Sabot\u00f8r [saboteur]\u2014a historical romp behind the scenes of a controversial part of the resistance movement in Norway during the Nazi Occupation of WWII\u2014which\u2019ll be out in spring 2018. Unfortunately, for most of you, it\u2019s in Norwegian. Fortunately, for all of you, it looks absolutely stunning. Follow John on Instagram for more.\nEmerson Dimaya // Emerson is our spot architect, putting the spice in our Metropo book soup. He has traveled the megalopolis and made some sketches from his dronetaxi and on foot. Emerson\u2019s an illustrator and comic book artist from the Philippines. He\u2019s the artist on Spiral and the Earthlock comic book.\nRob Croonenborghs // Rob is from Belgium and one of the builders of Metropo. His rough and organic style a lovely and ironic juxtaposition to the perfect system in his story Automobile. (We suspect Rob is actually a generative design AI prototype.) You can find more of Rob\u2019s comics on Comixology and more of his art on DeviantArt.\nNaomi Franquiz // Naomi, according to her neural net, is a freelance illustrator, comic artist, and reprobate. (We\u2019re still not sure if she\u2019s an android or not.) She built Every Moment is a Moment Forward\u2014the final short comic in Metropo\u2014with her brilliant flavour and style. Make sure to check out her comic Misfit City, published by Boom! And do point your cybernetic eyes on her tumblr!\nDan Hill // Dan is the hidden architect behind the facade of Metropo. A writer and editor, Dan is making sure all is well with the book and that every story, every sentence, every word, is its best hologram of the intended idea.\nDan has edited titles such as Deer Editor, Headspace, Mitch Hammer and Black Canvas from Black Mask Studios. His one-shot comic Go Home, together with Andrew Herbst, about how war haunts us, is available on Comixology. You can find Dan on Twitter and you can jump on his newsletter A Pleasurable Headache here.\nSPECIAL//THANKS\nA special thanks to the Norwegian Arts Council for initial funding. To my collaborators in this book. To Jacob & KrakenPrint. To Aaron Marshall for the music. To Sander and Pekka for being part of building another quadrant of Metropo. To Breach VR for curiosity and possibly a unique future. To WorkWork for a creative environment and inspiration. To my family for patience, love and gravity. To all those of you who have assisted in wiring and adjusting this book into one piece, with feedback and sharp minds. You know who you are.\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?\nFor those of you who have recently uploaded your consciousness to the Internet and are new to Kickstarter, a few pointers:\nMoney from your card/account will be withdrawn only after the campaign ends and only if it's successful.

This piece of traditional western knife making is perfectly balanced and is a perfect cooking knife.\nNagasaki Chef's Knife blade angle\nThe knife is ideal for cutting meat, fish, vegetables, fruits and what ever you can think of. Our new knife series feels really good in the hand and we have placed a great deal of research to their form & structure which makes this series a winner.\n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Chef's knife\nThe blade is 8 inch / 20 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nWith a rockwell Hardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nNew smaller logo etching\nLaser tested blade angle with Razor sharp properties\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.45 lbs / 205 g\nMicarta handle in black, brown or black with three ring inlays (1st stretch goal)\n      Nakiri knives are Japanese vegetable knives. They are ideal for cutting vegetables and fruits. \n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Nakiri\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nWith a rockwell Hardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.50 lbs / 225 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     This knife features the same design as our Nakiri knife, but adds another unique feature: a hollow edge. The unique characteristic of a hollow edge are several small cavities that get hammered into the blade in close proximity to each other. Like with the hammered surface on our Santoku knife the purpose of these cavities is to prevent the adherence of particularly thin, greasy or otherwise sticky clippings. \nThis property is due to the reduction of the blade surface which comes into contact with the cut material. In the case of pure cheese knives, there are even holes in the blade instead of the cavities, which achieve the same effect. However, since soft or very thin material can be entangled in the holes, holes are not universally applicable. Cavities, on the other hand, are a good compromise between reducing the surface of the blade and stabilizing the cut material.  \n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Nakiri\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.49 lbs / 223 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     Sample of paring knife, the label on the blade is not correct\nA last minute addition to our family is a paring knife, which is a small knife with a plain edge blade that is ideal for peeling and other small or intricate work (such as de-veining a shrimp, removing the seeds from a jalape\u00f1o, 'skinning' or cutting small garnishes). It is designed to be an all-purpose knife, similar to a chef's knife, except smaller. \nTechnical details: \nBlade characteristic: like Chef's knife\nThe blade is 3.5 inch / 9 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.13 lbs / 58 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     Nagasaki Hammered Knife with Improved Features\nThis was our original Nagasaki Solingen hand-hammered Santoku knife! It still features its classic design, but we updated our branding, so it is not as dominant as it was on the original.\nThe new versions blade is thinner at its spine, features a reduced weight as well es improved hardness of 59-60 HRC.\nThe Santoku knife is the Japanese equivalent to the western chef's knife. It is used in a similar way, but provides less room for a rocking motion which is typically for western knives.\nThe hammered finish on our Santoku helps to release sticky clipping from the blade without having to peal them off or prevents clippings from sticking to the blade at all.\n  Technical details:\nBlade characteristic: Santoku\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.49 lbs / 220 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n   As with our first campaign we want to enable everyone to experience high quality kitchen knives. By expanding the collection of Nagasaki knives we provide you with affordable kitchen tools that will aid you for a long time. \nOur whole team is excited to add up our new special designed gadgets to your kitchen and hope you will feel our efforts in your hands!\n     What do you get in return for your support? - Some really nice knives! \nSingle\nYou'll get one full size Nagasaki knife of your choice! \nTwin\nYou'll get one full size Nagasaki knife of your choice plus one Paring knife! \nTrio\nYou'll get two full size Nagasaki knives of your choice plus one Paring knife! \nNagoya\nYou'll get two full size Nagasaki Nakiri knives of your choice plus one Chef knife! \nFamily\n All five Nagasaki knives in a family pack!

Read more\nWhether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker\u00ae is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for. \nHere at Owlcat Games, we love and are inspired by classic isometric computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Arcanum. Our dream is to rekindle the thrill of playing those games for the first time. Building your hero, exploring the unknown, getting to know your companions, experiencing the adrenaline rush of your first battle (and your last), delving into mysterious dungeons, and\u2014most importantly\u2014seeing your protagonist and your world change through your actions.\nWe've always been big fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u00ae from Paizo, Inc\u00ae, so we thought: How cool would it be to do this in the beloved Pathfinder setting? Paizo agreed, and with your support, we hope to bring a brand-new fantasy saga to life.\nWhat the press says\n\"If the alpha build was any indication, then there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to shape your own identity and leave your mark on the world.\" - Gamespot\n\"Almost everything I asked about in terms of story seemed to have a layer beyond what I expected--the advantage of having years of tabletop playtesting, perhaps. If these different aspects of Kingmaker can coalesce into a dramatic whole, this could be special.\" - IGN\n\"For fans of the tabletop game, this will be a great opportunity to translate their fantasy adventures to their desktops.\" - Game Informer\n\"First impressions from in and around the bandit lord's fortress; the game looks incredible. The in-progress menus are attractive and orderly, the environments lush and vivid, the character portraits appealing and refined. What voice acting there was, was convincing and professional.\" - mmorpg.com\nThe Game World \nPathfinder: Kingmaker is the first single-player computer RPG based on the acclaimed Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The game invites players to Golarion, a world rich with history, mystery, and conflict, and gives players the chance to claim part of this world as their own.\n\"Follow the white rabbit, Baron\"\nPathfinder has considerable depth, not only in its lore, but also in its game mechanics, and in the freedom it offers you to develop your own unique character. You can customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\nUse night to your advantage \u2013 and see the world change.\nThe Story\nIn the north lies the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\nThe only easy day was yesterday.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love. Either way, you will experience a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. Pathfinder: Kingmaker features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\nMore than 10 companions to watch your back\u2026 or stick a knife in it.\nYour Kingdom \nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler.\nYou never know what's around the next bend.\nMost importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and the ability to lead troops in the field are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins\u2014and while dealing with politics in your own court.\nThere are many ways to manage your Kingdom, and many rewards to be gained.\n As you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\nIf you fail, your kingdom will be destroyed, but if you succeed, you\u2019ll have made a nation where countless others have failed.  \nYour kingdom awaits! Do you have the strength to rule it?\n\nAre you a benevolent ruler or a ruthless tyrant?\n Expanding depth and richness of kingdom gameplay is so important to us that we\u2019ve made it our initial goal for the Kickstarter. Every pledge made toward our initial funding target will result in more features, more content, and more polish for your growing nation. Our goal is to let you build a kingdom that fits your play style. Perhaps you want to control every single activity in your kingdom by yourself, or perhaps you are more of a top-level ruler who wants to spend time exploring the wilderness and fighting dangerous beasts. Either way, we will give you the life you want to live. You are a king, after all!\nWe are excited about the kingdom mechanics and we have carefully planned all the features we would love to implement if you support us. All funds will be distributed according to the following pie chart:\nExpanding the kingdom is our first goal for the Kickstarter, but it\u2019s not going to be our only goal. With your support, we can improve every aspect of game. We\u2019re prepared to announce additional stretch goals to diversify the characters you\u2019ll be able to build, including the introduction of archetypes (at least a couple for each of the classes), additional classes (we have been asked about Magus several times\u2014and some Owlcats really want to play this class!), and additional races. We also want to develop the storyline further, expanding it beyond the Adventure Path, and we would like to include even more companions, each with their own alignment and agenda (including a companion that\u2019s dear to hearts of Pathfinder fans). We also want to bring you even more locations to visit, including an epic dungeon. We want to enhance our game with more voiceover and music. And we want more players to experience our game by adding additional language localizations, and support for OS X and Linux!\nWe don't just want to reward your support through stretch goals alone. You can now unlock backer achievements by joining us on social media and get access to exclusive rewards.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PathfinderCRPG/ \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/OwlcatGames \nOfficial game site: https://owlcatgames.com/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1yuqm85x6iyko4dKhZPiA  \nEach achievement you unlock with your fellow backers will move the reward progress bar. With enough achievements reached, the following prizes will be received by all backers of the appropriate tier:\n Achievement gained: 6. \nRewards unlocked: Wallpapers, Silly cheat codes\nLet's have a look at the above graphic for clarification. Take the reward 'New soundtrack in the city tavern' for an example. This one is unlocked when 8 community achievements are reached. Everyone who pledged for the $40 tier for the premium digital download or higher, will be eligible for this reward when it unlocks. As another example, if 12 community achievements are reached, the 'Small faerie dragon as a non-combat pet' will be unlocked for every backer, regardless of pledge level.  \nCooking in the camp  \nTo make things clearer, here is a short description for \"Cooking in the camp\":  \nYou can cook various dishes in the camp from the components you gathered or got from your hunter. Dining on those meals will provide your party with different small and pleasant bonuses.\nOwlcat Games was formed by developers who have the experience, resources, and - above all - the passion required to make Pathfinder: Kingmaker a truly amazing game.\n We are a new studio, but we are not new to the industry. Many of us worked on these games as part of Nival Interactive and My.com:\nWe can't deny ourselves the pleasure to name just a few games Chris Avellone worked on:\nOwlcat Games team.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker has an existing schedule, an existing scope, and an existing budget, and that budget will allow us to achieve that scope on schedule. We already have a full team of people working on it, and we're committed to doing it regardless of what happens with this Kickstarter. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is YOU\u2014we need YOU to decide how big Pathfinder: Kingmaker is going to be. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to increase the budget and the scope, delivering a bigger and deeper game on the same schedule.  \nAll of us\u2014RPG fans and developers alike\u2014deserve a game that demonstrates the richness of the Pathfinder universe. There are so many interesting things in the world and in the rules that we can\u2019t fit into the current budget, yet our desire to add them to the game is practically unbearable. We dream of more companions with added depths to their stories, new classes, new dungeons, more wilderness to explore, more kingdom events, and even brand-new quests and custom content by famous Pathfinder and CRPG authors. With this Kickstarter, our only limit is your support and your faith in us. Help us make Pathfinder: Kingmaker the product we all want it to be. Help us kick the epicness to the stratosphere!\n\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

Lovecraft. \nIt's about the things we fear, amplified until they are unbearable. It's about stories that genuinely creep you out, not well-worn tropes and creatures you've seen hundreds of times before.\nAnd it's about bleak horror, in which humans are powerless when confronted by hyperintelligent alien horrors. You can't beat them. You can't fight them. You can only watch, run, hide and fear.\nIf you love Cthulhu games already, then this is Lovecraftian horror at its most intense. If you're new to them, then Cthulhu Dark is a great place to start. You'll enter a world of stories that are both terrifying and terribly human.\nThe rules are incredibly short: they're tightly focussed on horror and they drive the game.\nHave a look at these samples of the book: the rules, the start of the Keeper's section and one of the settings, London 1851. And here's the cover. \n  \"I love Cthulhu Dark - it combines economy, thoughtful design, and a rare respect for the source material that really gets at the core of what's fun about the combination of impersonal, unknowable horror and a ragged, unstoppable descent into madness. It's the best Lovecraftian game I've ever played, and I have played them all.\"\nJason Morningstar, designer, Fiasco\n\"Cthulhu Dark is Lovecraftian gaming in its purest form. By cutting away everything except investigation, revelation and consequence, it provides a simple, cruel mechanism for driving protagonists to madness and destruction.\"\nScott Dorward, writer, Call of Cthulhu 7th edition\n\"Cthulhu Dark gets to the heart of what I love most about Lovecraft's work. It is a clean, simple system which has a laser focus on investigation and the increasing stress on your mind and soul from the horrors you see. Graham has a deep and rare understanding not only of the Mythos but also of the pacing and structure of the stories themselves. Nothing will feel closer to Lovecraft's awful truth than a game of Cthulhu Dark.\"\nBecky Annison, writer, Lovecraftesque\n\"Cthulhu Dark packs more than its fair share of evocative wallop  into less than its fair share of pages. It's designed to work hard, but unobtrusively, with an easy faith in both its players and its genre.\" \nVincent Baker, designer, Apocalypse World\n  Cthulhu Dark is a hardback book, 8.5 by 11 inches, about 200 pages long. The cover, by George Cotronis, is in full color. The interior is beautifully laid out, with stunning black-and-white art by Matteo Bocci.\nIt starts with the Player's Section, which consists of:\nThe Rules: Cthulhu Dark's tight, focussed two-page ruleset, which you can see here.\nThe Rules In Detail: How to use the rules to best effect in your games, together with a range of tips and tricks.\nThen comes the Keeper's Section, consisting of:\nIntroduction: An introduction to cosmic horror and all the essential elements of a Cthulhu Dark mystery, including the Themes, the Threat, the Final Horror, the Setting, Creeping Horrors and the Power.  You can see the start of the Keeper's section here. \nWriting a mystery: A step-by-step guide to writing Cthulhu Dark mysteries. This takes you through every step of making an effective horror story to play through, starting with the things you fear and ending with the full horror.\nRewriting a mystery: Ten different ways to look at a mystery, which help you sharpen and polish it, until it's as good as it can get.\nPlaying a mystery: How to play a Cthulhu Dark game, including how to explain and use the rules, how to describe horror and how to find a dramatic ending.\nThreats of the Mythos: A guide to the creatures, artifacts and other unspeakable things that haunt the universe, explaining how to use these things to enhance the story you want to tell.\nThen you get four settings, taking Cthulhu Dark into different times and places. Each comes with a full scenario to play.\nLondon 1851: Terror in dirty, twisted Victorian London, where evil hides in the dark and the stink. Here's a short extract. Plus the scenario Screams of the Children.\nArkham 1692 (by Kathryn Jenkins): Fear and superstition in Lovecraft's iconic city, in a time of witchcraft. Plus the scenario The Doors Beyond Time.\nJaiwo 2017 (by Helen Gould): In modern-day Africa, corruption lurks in the ruins of the British Empire. Plus the scenario The Curse of the Zimba.\nMumbai 2037: Stories of cyberpunk India, in the city where dreams, wealth and power meet. Plus the scenario Consume.\nIn all these settings, you play Investigators who don't often appear in Cthulhu games: in London 1851, you play thieves, beggars and other residents of the slums; in Arkham, you play rural villagers; in Jaiwo, you play people from that African country; and in Mumbai, you play Indian workers.\nEverything above is written and, after final editing and layout, it's ready to go. You'll get most of it just after the Kickstarter ends, in a preview edition called Cthulhu Dark Zero (see below).\n  I'm Graham Walmsley, an award-winning author and game designer. I won a Gold Ennie for my work on Trail of Cthulhu for Pelgrane Press, which included Cthulhu Apocalypse and the legendarily bleak Purist adventures (collected as The Final Revelation).\nI wrote and published Stealing Cthulhu, a book about how to write stories of Lovecraftian horror in games. I also wrote Play Unsafe, a book about how to tell stories and play better. (If you've read either of these books, you'll be glad to know that Cthulhu Dark's guidance on Writing A Mystery and Playing A Mystery is almost all new.)\nAs well as that, I've written for many roleplaying games, including Doctor Who: Adventures In Time And Space, Fiasco, The Laundry and many others. That's me on the left below.\nI'm joined by some incredibly talented co-authors.\nHelen Gould, who wrote Jaiwo 2017, is a professional writer and long-time gamer. Kathryn Jenkins, who wrote Arkham 1692, writes regularly for Vacant Ritual Assembly and the blog Final Thoughts of a Murdered Guard. Both are relatively new to RPG writing and that's deliberate: I wanted to give new writers a chance to shine. \nAnd then there's Chris Spivey (right), a Cthulhu old hand, who you might know from his work on GUMSHOE One-2-One and his immensely successful Harlem Unbound. He's written an exclusive mystery, The Whole Is Greater, which you'll get if you back at a level that includes the Season Pass.\nThey've all delivered fresh and excellent takes on Lovecraftian horror. I'm looking forward to showing them to to you. \nThe cover art, which you'll find near the top of this page, is by George Cotronis. The beautiful black-and-white interior art, which you can see throughout this page, is by Matteo Bocci. The cartographer is Stentor Danielson: he's done a map for every setting and you can see his wonderful London 1851 map as part of this extract.\nThe preview video, which you can watch above, is by Banana Chan. I wanted something different from most Kickstarter videos and she's given me that and more. If you haven't watched it, you really should. \n  When you back Cthulhu Dark, I hope you're investing in the project, rather than just buying a book from me. Thanks for your support. In return, I'll make the final Cthulhu Dark rulebook as good as I can get it.\nThis is what you'll get.\nWhatever level you back at, you'll get both the preview version, Cthulhu Dark Zero, and the final version, Cthulhu Dark.\nCthulhu Dark Zero contains everything you need to play, including the full Player's Section, Keeper's Section and the London 1851 setting, and comes with special cover art. This is all written, edited, laid out and ready to go, and you'll get it just after the Kickstarter ends.\nCthulhu Dark Zero is a PDF and I'll give you a DriveThruRPG code if you'd like to print it (at cost). I'm doing it this way to avoid doing two print runs and keep the Kickstarter simple. It lets me put my energy into the final product.\nCthulhu Dark contains everything above, plus any stretch goals, plus the final three settings, Arkham 1692, Jaiwo 2017 and Mumbai 2037. I'll make this book as good as I can get it, depending on how much we raise in the Kickstarter: it'll definitely be hardback and I'll upgrade the printing if I can (say, adding a dustjacket). It'll be beautiful and you should get it before Christmas.\nHere's what the two books will look like. On the left is an early proof of the Cthulhu Dark rulebook. On the right is Cthulhu Dark Zero.\n  If you back at the Digital level, you get PDFs of Cthulhu Dark Zero and Cthulhu Dark.\nIf you back at Digital + Season Pass, you also get the Season Pass. I haven't done this before and I'm excited about it! I'll send you all the settings and other material as they are finished, so you'll get something in your inbox at regular intervals until the book arrives. I'd love your feedback on anything I send. This means you get an early look at everything that goes in the book, plus you get an exclusive scenario in PDF, which won't appear in the book: Chris Spivey's The Whole is Greater, set in France in the First World War.\nIf you back at The Book, you get Cthulhu Dark in hardback. It'll look wonderful.\nIf you back at Signed Book & Season Pass, you get Cthulhu Dark in hardback, with a signed bookplate. You'll also get the Season Pass, including that exclusive scenario by Chris Spivey.\nIf you back at Leather Book & Ominous Letter, you get a leatherbound copy of Cthulhu Dark. I'll also send you a disturbing letter from a fictional correspondent, which warns that dire things will happen if you read Cthulhu Dark. \nIf you back at a higher level, you're seriously investing in the project. I appreciate this so much. I'm offering some fun things in return, but really you're backing Cthulhu Dark and making it better for everybody. Thank you.\nAs for shipping, I've tried to keep this as low as possible, starting at about \u00a36/$8. It helps that I'm shipping both from the US and UK.\nFinally, I should mention that Kickstarter makes me charge in British pounds. If the backer levels look like strange amounts of money, that's because Kickstarter is automatically translating them to your currency. Don't worry about this: it's exactly like backing any other Kickstarter, except the dollar amount isn't a round number.\n  Cthulhu Dark's streamlined rules (which you can see here) are designed to tell stories about mind-bending horror. Here are some of their best features.\nYou can roll for anything, even if you don't have a skill in it. Want to try to remember something from your childhood? Or sense the mystical pattern behind ancient symbols? Or control your dreams? In Cthulhu Dark, you can always roll for it. The higher you roll, the more you find out.\nBut, if you roll too high, you find out too much and glimpse the horror. You never know when the horror will hit you: whenever you're investigating and you roll a 6, you'll get more then you wanted to know.\nYour Insight into the Mythos - which, to the outside world, looks like insanity - increases slowly at first, then quickly later. At the end of the game, you're on a knife-edge, where one bad roll will tip you over and make you lose your mind.  \nWhen your Insight gets too high, you can lower it by destroying evidence. You could burn photographs, deface carvings or even kill other Investigators. The only way you can recover your mind is if you leave no trace of the horrors you've seen.\nFinally, you can't defeat any Mythos creature by fighting it. Try running or hiding instead. But, ultimately, you know that the horror will win.\nThose are just some of my favourite parts of Cthulhu Dark's rules. You'll find more as you play. And I'll explain the best tips and tricks under The Rules In Detail.\n  As I mentioned above, I want to focus on making the final book as good as possible. That means I'm keeping this Kickstarter simple, without many add-ons.\nHaving said that, there are some extra things I'd like to do, so...\nNow we've hit \u00a310,000, I'll add a section on \"How To Hack Cthulhu Dark\". This will take you under the hood of Cthulhu Dark, showing you how it all fits together. It'll show you how to write your own games based on Cthulhu Dark.\nNow we've hit \u00a340,000, I'll add beautifully-written handouts to the book. That means I'll get all the letters from the scenarios handwritten and add some extras too. It'll give you something beautiful to hand your players when you run Cthulhu Dark.\nNow we've hit \u00a350,000, I'll release my design notes for Cthulhu Dark and put them in the book. These will help you get inside my head - if that's a place you want to be - telling you exactly why I designed Cthulhu Dark the way I did and how it's changed from the original version. If you want to write your own Cthulhu Dark stuff or publish Cthulhu Dark hacks, this is essential stuff.\nNow we've hit \u00a365,000, you'll get Good As A Feast by Mo Holkar, a new mystery in the Dust Bowl of 1930s America. It's a story about food, hunger and flesh.\nIf we reach \u00a375,000, you'll get Now We Are The Sons Of God, a mini-campaign by Scott Dorward in London 1851. It's in three parts, each focussing on a different aspect of Victorian London: Walk In The Light Of Your Fire uncovers a cruel and deadly factory; The Brightness of the Firmament sees shooting stars fall on a London rookery; and The Truth Shall Make You Free finds dangerous knowledge in a ragged school.\nIf we reach \u00a385,000, I'll link all the main Cthulhu Dark scenarios into a mini-campaign. That is, I'll give you the tools to play The Doors Beyond Time (Arkham 1672), Screams of the Children (London 1851), The Curse of the Zimba (Jaiwo 2017) and Consume (Mumbai 2037) in one time-travelling mystery.\nThe How to Hack guide, handouts, design notes and instructions to link the scenarios into a mini-campaign will go in the book. Good As A Feast and Now We Are The Sons Of God will be in PDF. \n Oh, and finally, I'll be using BackerKit for Cthulhu Dark, and they've asked me to display their logo. I'm happy to do so and delighted to be using them. Here it is!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter has risks, but I've designed this one to keep risks to a minimum. That's why I'm not offering lots of stretch goals, extras or things to be added to the book. I want to focus on delivering one main product, which is the Cthulhu Dark rulebook.\n\nLots of work has gone into the book already. All the text is written and has had some editing. The art is done. The layout for most of the book is done. After the final bit of editing and layout, it is ready to go.\n\nFor printing, I'll use the same printers I used for my last book, Stealing Cthulhu. They are CPI Antony Rowe, a highly-professional company, and they haven't let me down yet. They'll ship books to my fulfillers, Indie Press Revolution for the United States and Kixto for everywhere else. Both of them are highly experienced and have fulfilled many Kickstarters.\n\nSo, I've anticipated everything I can. For everything else, I'll rely on my years of experience publishing and promoting RPGs. I've left enough contingency, both in terms of time and funds, so that I'm confident that I can cope with everything that comes up and deliver you something that's really special.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "A PDF of Cthulhu Dark.\nPlus, just after the Kickstarter ends, a PDF of the preview version, Cthulhu Dark Zero.\nINCLUDES:\nCthulhu Dark, PDF\nCthulhu Dark Zero, PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["275 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a324 or more", "title": "Digital + Season Pass", "descp": "For people that want everything in a digital format: a PDF of Cthulhu Dark.

P. Lovecraft.\nThrough investigation, puzzle solving, time travel, knowledge of the Mythos, situational music, timed events and horrible scenes, the players will experience an interactive and unique scenario\u2014an epic mini-campaign playable in one (long!) gaming night.\nThe setting is London 1927, though the investigators will soon discover the need to dig deeper into England's occult past. The scenario may be played as a standalone event or incorporated into an ongoing campaign\u2014preferably its end, as the very world itself may collapse should the investigators fail.\nPuzzle solving: The players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear, but do they have the skills to fit them all together and complete the sigil before the world ends\u2026?\nSituational music: At three key events during the scenario, music plays an important role. Three specific soundtracks heighten the mood and accompany the situation, as well as function as a time limit for the investigators to complete certain tasks. The soundtracks are not provided with this Kickstarter but are easily found on any musical service like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play or YouTube.\nKnowledge of the Mythos: As stated, this is a scenario meant for experienced players. They need to have some scenarios under their belt, as well as some basic knowledge of the Mythos. If they have never heard of R'lyeh before, then this scenario is not for them. Yet.\nCultural knowledge: The players will meet famous and historical persons of the time. They will also dig into England's past to uncover some horrible truths. Any real knowledge of persons like Christopher Wren, Aleister Crowley or a certain J. R. R. Tolkien could prove useful. Though such knowledge is not necessary, it could prove to tip the scale towards saving or ending the world...\nEpic: From a small and seemingly irrelevant situation, the players will soon find themselves facing the horrors of great Cthulhu himself. As they discover more and more of the past and its shocking implications though puzzle solving and investigation, they will soon feel the burden of humanity's future on their shoulders. They have never, and will never again, be this close to total destruction.\nPlaying time: Initial playtesting of the raw material suggests a play time of about six hours. This could easily be expanded, as the scenario will come with optional false leads and expanded situations to suit your needs. This versatility may easily expand the scenario into a mini-campaign.\nTwo endings: In the very last moments of the scenario, it becomes up to the GM to decide how it ends. The \u201cnormal\u201d ending will (hopefully) result in the players as victorious against the dark powers\u2014this is a satisfying option for the players since they have fought hard with brains and skills to achieve their goal; huzzah! The \u201cother\u201d option is something completely different; this is an ending that will turn upside down everything the players have found out and believed throughout the scenario. This is an option that will leave their jaws dropping and produce \u201cI did not see that coming!\u201d reactions. It\u2019s your choice. You're the GM.\nAction-oriented or not?: Some players (or GMs) may want to solve some situations using muscles & guns, though this scenario is meant to be completed without firing a single shot. For those players (or GMs) an \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) is included where relevant.\nSkill use: The purpose of the scenario is to create a special atmosphere where the Mythos feels eerily alive everywhere. As such, rules and skills are less emphasized so as not to \u201cdisturb\u201d this purpose. The scenario may be played almost exclusively using the character's knowledge and ideas; only a few skill rolls are necessary. So how does it work? Let's say you find a strange book entitled The Book of Eibon. You are not meant to do a skill roll to discover what this book is; you're supposed to have heard about it before, both as a player and character. And if you stumble upon a lot of clues in a pile, you're not supposed to roll a Search, Luck or Library Use to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d clue; you're supposed to use your own wits and investigation throughout the scenario to figure out which are the correct ones. The use of skill rolls will be needed from time to time, but only to give alternative approaches to different situations, and never to interfere with the atmosphere.\nContent: In many RPG scenarios, there exists an elaborate description of the NPCs, their history, their minds, plans, surroundings... You will not find much of that in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d We've read too many scenarios where the relevant information is somewhat \u201chidden\u201d in too much description. Don\u2019t get us wrong; it's entertaining to read about the family background, accent, tattoo and shoe size of the local bartender, but if his only appearance is when he gives the investigator a letter, that info is not very relevant for the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d tells you what you need to know; the rest is up to you.\nMature content: What stands the Lovecraftian world apart from many other themes is the atmosphere of fear and horror; if played well, both for the investigators and the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d follows this pattern; the fear is always lingering, but the \u201chorror level\u201d may be adjusted to your taste. The scenario may be enjoyed fully without a single drop of blood spilled, or you may choose to adjust some scenes to incorporate the ultimate horror targeting both your character and your own sanity. As such, it could potentially resemble the \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) mentioned above. Call it AHA if you'd like (please don't).\nFact and fiction: The scenario combines the real world with the Mythos. The characters you meet and their story/surroundings are mostly historically correct, mixed with the occasional Mythos element. A complete Fact & Fiction section at the end of the scenario keeps you up to date, but is yours to bend to your own will...\nQuality: This is in a full-color page layout in US letter format! This scenario is a delight both to read and play.\nAbout the creators\nJarle Haktorson is the writer behind \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d. He bought his first CoC rulebook (5th ed) back in 1993 and was intrigued. This was totally different from his former RPG experiences playing mostly AD&D (2nd ed). During his later studies, he realized he fit the classic CoC investigator, as he studied Latin, Greek, Coptic, history, religion, etc. It also helped that he worked in a mental institution during his studies, and so understood how sanity really works (and doesn\u2019t work). He is currently the general manager of the Epix Haven gaming company (www.facebook.com/epixhaven), the leader of the local gaming club, and plays board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s, slaying kobolds in D&D. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. Even is in the creative advertising market, and has done all the layouts, book binding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign. Even is a gamer and a dreamer, and one of his dreams is this game.\nJoseph Diaz has created the heart of this scenario with his superior illustrations. He has previously worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Never has Cthulhu himself felt so threatening or near as in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d is the first such idea made a reality.\nWith help from you, this scenario could become even greater.\nNOK 18.000 (about US/EUR 2000): Scenario map over London\nThe players will travel around London gathering clues, slowly understanding the graveness of their search. This period-accurate map will help both the GM and the players better navigate the world; there is one version for the players and another for the GM.\nNOK 27.000 (about US/EURO 3000): More artwork and quality upgrades for clues\nMost of the cost creating this scenario is related to the artwork. We wanted more, but couldn't risk this project not become a reality. This stretch goal will add more artwork to the scenario and upgrade all the clues, making the horrors come even more alive.\nNOK 45.000 (about USD/EUR 5000): Custom-made soundtrack!\nYou read it right! Unlocking this goal enables us to create a custom-made soundtrack for the scenario! It will be available for ALL backers through download!\nNOK 63.000 (about US/EUR 7000): Art book\nA FREE art book to ALL backers containing all the sketches, images, clues, etc. used in the scenario, complete with discussions, \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d etc. Sent as PDF via DriveThruRPG.\nNOK 90.000 (about US/EUR 10.000): Physical puzzle option\nThe players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear. This stretch goal will give backers an option to receive a physical puzzle as an add-on. More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 135.000 (about US/EUR 15.000): Another scenario!\nThe world may be saved from destruction this time, but what about the next\u2026?! This Stretch Goal will provide a completely new FREE scenario to all backers! More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 200.000 (about US/EUR 22.000): \u201cCan we make it?!\u201d\nMore on this as the campaign progresses.\nFAQ\nWhat game system works with this scenario?\nThe short version: any (see the \u201cSkill use\u201d section above). Skill rolls play a minor part of the scenario. Where deemed necessary, a percentage system is used, like those found in CoC. It is easily modified to suit any system you'd like. We would also like to mention \"Cthulhu Dark\" by Graham Walmsley, as this is a rules-light system created to play Lovecraftian horror at its most intense.\nMust the scenario be set in exactly 1927?\nNo, you could tweak it some +/- five years or so if you'd like. Some historical characters need to be adjusted somewhat though; the scenario includes relevant information on how to do this.\nWhat does the title actually mean?\nIt's Latin for \u201cThe Cthulian Peace.\u201d You do not want that to occur and neither do the investigators, so help them out!\nIs this a production licensed by Chaosium?\nNo, and we are very aware of that. Hence, we only use our own illustrations and ideas, finding inspiration in H. P. Lovecraft's work available in the Public Domain. We do not use material (signs, symbols, characters, spells, etc.) owned by Chaosium. This scenario is a homage to Lovecraft's dark world.\nHow do you send the PDF files?\nWhen the campaign is finished and the scenario is ready to play, you'll receive an e-mail; this will include a link for your free download of \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d at DriveThruRPG, the largest RPG download store.\nWhat does \u201cPOD\u201d means?\nIt means \u201cPrint on Demand,\u201d so if you pledged for the PDF version only, but decide to have a soft-cover version later, you may POD; that means that DriveThruRPG will print and ship a soft-cover version to you. You will need to cover those costs, though (they are included in Reward #2).\nMay I choose any name/picture in the story?\n(Concerning Reward # 4-5)\nWell, we do not know you personally, so you're free to supply us with the name and picture you want\u2014who are we to judge what people are called or how they look? :) We would hesitate though to supply names like Biggus Dikkus or provide photos of a badger (apologies to all people who look like a badger). Your name will of course also be mentioned in the credits!\nMay I provide any idea for the story?\n(Concerning Reward #6)\nYes, by and large, you may. This scenario is designed using unique storytelling techniques, but the main story may be altered along the way should the right ideas come up. This reward is also the only option to be given the story beforehand\u2014you'll need this knowledge to be able to think out and discuss your ideas with me. Your name will, of course, be mentioned in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPax Cthuliana is currently in a developing stage.

In it, he weaves and reinvents the works of H.P. Lovecraft through historical events. It is both a sequel and prequel to Neonomicon, and the resulting masterpiece owes a great deal to his artistic partner, Jacen Burrows. Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence is a celebration of the amazing work of Burrows. Over 15 years of his works are featured here, all showcasing Burrows' original pencils and inks. Included is a complete cover gallery -- from The Courtyard to Neonomicon to Providence -- as well as choice pages, designs, and lots of unused and never-before-made-public art! For fans of the series, this is a wonderful companion volume showcasing the haunting artwork and painstaking labor that went into bringing it to life. We offer a special hardcover edition for your support that you won't want to miss. But don't just take our word for it -\n \"Jacen Burrows, somehow combining immaculate Swiss-watch precision and wrenching human emotion, is a contemporary master of comic-book art with an instantly classical style that looks like it\u2019s surely been around forever; a timeless line that is as distinctive and original as anything the medium has ever produced. And while I am admittedly biased, I believe his astonishing work on Providence to represent a new level of accomplishment in the career of this already stellar artist and craftsman. A unique and genuinely remarkable talent.\" - Alan Moore \nAnd what better way to showcase this incredible series than with the Providence Complete Slipcase: A beautiful set of all the related works in hardcover editions in an exclusive slipcase with new art by Burrows. The Slipcase Set includes five volumes: Neonomicon, Providence Act 1, Providence Act 2, Providence Act 3, and Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence. This incredible set is limited to just 1000 units and none of the volumes within will have further hardcover editions.

It turns out this was ready to start packaging later than we hoped, another late project needed to start at the same time, and the beleaguered warehouse was in the middle of a third already.  A perfect storm of... well... making everyone unhappy.  Huzzah!   Now Comic Cavalcade, our warehouse/shipping sister company, is a small firm, just like Avatar.  We done gone and broke it with all this at once.  But at no point are we willing to sacrifice the quality of care taken with each order.  There is also the reality that new orders are constantly coming in.  Someone who orders two recent comics this week isn't really interested in waiting for over 1000 orders for various Kickstarters to get filled first.

Our big goal here is to include West Berlin and Alev as a new female player agent in the game. Our current stretch goal is called TOILETS!\nHow have we not introduced toilets to the clubs yet! How unrealistic! Everybody knows a video game's critical acclaim stands and falls with the state of its toilets. So if we reach this stretch goal we will add toilets to the game and add toilet relevant activities for player agents and clubbers. Extra Janitor staff is needed to keep the place in ordnung, and we'll add a new mission type that requires the privacy of a bathroom stall. For more details, check out the announcement update.\nOur next major goal is to bring Act 2 and West Berlin to the Closed Alpha. This will double the campaign length, introduce a new character with new abilities, and feature an intense Finale mission at the TV-Tower itself!\nIf we reach this new major stretch goal and raise a total of EUR 75 000 on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll be able to include all of West Berlin and Alev as part of the Closed Alpha. That will allow us to iterate on it with you all and really nail the new abilities and the setting with your feedback.\n  The Cold War never ended. For 150 years both sides have used time manipulation technology to observe and counter each other\u2019s every move. Now this fragile state of affairs is approaching a breaking point, as a rogue nuclear strike will send the world into turmoil. Both sides have scrambled to send agents back in time to find who is behind the attack and how to prevent it. If they fail, the whole world will turn to ash, forever.\nAll Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined using a bespoke system developed by inbetweengames, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.\nAll Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like X-Com, Syndicate and REZ, as well more recent indie games like The Banner Saga, Braid, SUPERHOT and Crypt of the Necrodancer.\nWe are three former AAA veterans who worked on Spec Ops: The Line, Dreadnought and Dead Island 2 at YAGER in Berlin. Collectively, we have been working in the industry for over 30 years. In summer of 2015, yet another of our AAA projects, work we dedicated years of our lives to, Dead Island 2, was handed to another developer. We decided that this couldn\u2019t go on, something had to change. To deal with our situation we joined the Ludum Dare game jam and made The Mammoth: A Cave Painting in 3 days. Some people liked it, so we formed inbetweengames as a small studio in Berlin to make a game we really wanted to make. That game is All Walls Must Fall.\nMusic is very important to the concept of All Walls Must Fall. So before we really get into more details we would like you to start and listen to some of the tracks you'll be hearing in the game while browsing the rest of the page.\nThe music in All Walls Must Fall uses a procedural music mixer that recombines electronic music loops to create a soundtrack that reacts to the game as you\u2019re playing. What you are hearing here is just a small sample. Check out the full playlist on soundcloud.\nIn All Walls Must Fall, a dystopian, divided Berlin in the year 2089, gives us the perfect setting for a futuristic film noir story. We have chosen to tell this story through the lens of a Tech-Noir Tactics game, but what does that even mean?\nAll Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game that uses a pausable real-time action system. Time is paused while you\u2019re making your tactical decisions, and is unpaused once you\u2019ve chosen a course of action. That action is played out, and then the game pauses again. Beyond spycraft and infiltration, your agents also have access to time manipulation abilities that allow you to experiment with possible futures and rewind to the past.\nThe Breakdown\nWe think of the game as X-Com meets Braid, with a bit of Syndicate sprinkled in for good measure. However, one of our first inspirations was actually Rez, the classic Dreamcast shooter where your shots add to the beat of the music. In All Walls Must Fall, actions and the music are synced together to create a rhythm-action effect. All actions are measured in beats of the music, but you can still take your time to make tactical decisions!\nThe Drop\nPLAY\n\nIn combat, you use the pause mechanic to plan out your strategy and take down your opponents. While you have the luxury of time manipulation, for everyone else on the ground, this intense firefight has only lasted a few seconds. Once you take out all your opponents, the game rewinds back to the beginning of the combat sequence and replays the whole thing in real time. This sequence is called The Drop; the music gets turned up to 11 and all the gunfire, shouts and explosions happen in time with the beat. It\u2019s an audiovisual ballet of intense music, violence and pyrotechnics!\nThe Campaign\nA single campaign consists of a number of missions, taking place in the same night in Berlin. Missions are not scripted, but give you a clear goal. It\u2019s up to you to decide on how to best achieve it within the sandbox of a Berlin nightclub. A single campaign will take a few hours to play through, but each one will contain different missions and may have different outcomes.\nMore than Combat\nCombat isn\u2019t the only way to approach each mission objective, and is often not the wisest. For example, using persuasion techniques gets a lot easier when you can go back in time to try a different chat up line! You will also have the possibility to hack objects in the environment to fulfill your mission goals. All Walls Must Fall encourages you to experiment by giving you the ability and freedom to try different strategies.\nOur initial funding goal is to introduce Kai as the player agent in All Walls Must Fall. Ideally, we don\u2019t want to stop there, stretch goals will allow the inclusion of two more agents from different factions - Alev and Glenn. These agents are not just awesome characters, they will also have their own time abilities, mixing up the gameplay and creating even more opportunities for experimentation!\nKai\u2019s been doing this a long time; time may be relative, but he was young when he started and he\u2019s feeling his age now. Kai is your classic action hero type, and he represents the past. With his cybernetic arm and large bulk, he cuts an intimidating figure, and although his manner is soft and charming, he\u2019s not afraid to use force when necessary.\nNever in a hurry, Kai specializes in forms of time manipulation that involve manipulating the past such as UNDO (which undos your last action and all its consequences), REWIND (which rewinds the world but not you), and TRACE BACK (which rewinds you but not the world).\nAlev is a cyber-warrior with West Berlin's CTA agency, and she represents the present. Her brand of time manipulation revolves around the present moment. She specialises in abilities like FREEZE (where the world stops moving but Alev can still act) and SPLIT (where an avatar copy repeats the first set of Alev\u2019s actions while she performs a second). Like all agents, she also is an expert with UNDO.  \n  Thank you for your support, dear visitor! We'll keep you up to date on how the campaign is going!

We're Rafal, Isaac, David and Almut. We are inbetweengames.\nRafal Fedro - Artist\nRafal got into games development at legendary Polish developer Metropolis Software. At Yager he worked on Spec Ops: The Line, Dreadnought and Dead Island 2. His specialties are 2D art, UI and FX, but as a generalist artist he's able to cover all our art needs.\nIsaac Ashdown - Programmer\nIsaac Ashdown has ported more games to more platforms than many players own, which eventually gave him programming superpowers. After shipping Demolition Inc at Berlin indie studio Zeroscale he joined YAGER to work on Dead Island 2. Isaac now handles all programming tasks on All Walls Must Fall.\nJan David Hassel - Designer\nDavid worked at YAGER since the beginning of Spec Ops: The Line and on various other cancelled projects, culminating in Dead Island 2. David has worked as QA Tester, Technical Artist, Technical Designer and Game Designer. Now he serves as the team's designer and jack-of-all-trades.\nAlmut Schwacke - Audio Designer\nWe first met Almut while she was doing some freelancing work for Dead Island 2 at YAGER. Her game credits include Curious Expedition and Rainbow Skies, and she has extensive experience as a Mastering Engineer, Foley Artist and Sound Designer. She joins inbetweengames as freelance audio designer and composer for All Walls Must Fall.\nWe\u2019ve already received funding from a few sources to get the project to this point, all of which will have gone into the game to allow for a few more months of development.\nWe received \u20ac 70 000 funding from the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, matched by our own savings and working-for-less-to-no-money. We also got a \u20ac16 000 Unreal Dev Grant from Epic Games. This has been a great help and allowed us to take the game up to the state it\u2019s in now. With your help, we want to take the game to the next level and make the game all it has the potential to be!\nWe\u2019ve been in full-time development on the game since April 2016, and have been running a pre-alpha for friends and family for a few months. We now think it\u2019s time to open that up to a wider audience. A game like this needs feedback from the community to really become something special. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to start a closed alpha, exclusively for Kickstarter backers, that will begin in May this year if we reach our funding goal.\nWe've also spoken to a few publishers to help get the game to the finish line, but none of these talks went anywhere. Most publishers think of the game as too niche, too hardcore, too complex, too old school, or too political to make the kind of profit they expect. This is why we have come to Kickstarter. We are not in this for profit. We are in this to make the kind of game we believe in, the kind of game that you don\u2019t see that often. However, it\u2019s also the kind of game that could potentially resonate with a group of people looking for something a little different, in a genre that has a lot of potential for unique gameplay ideas.\nAll Walls Must Fall is an ambitious game. While we already have a basic version of the game, there is so much more we want to do with it! We are certain we will be able to ship it in some form already. But to make it what it truly can be and deserves to be, we will need you help!\nMoney raised from Kickstarter will be used to run and support a closed alpha exclusive to Kickstarter backers. During this alpha we will be incorporating feedback, implementing additional features, adding more music and creating more content. The goal is to get a better, open alpha version ready, to be published via Early Access on Steam, without having to rely on publisher support.\nThe detailed breakdown is that 19.3% of the money will be spent on programming, art and design respectively. 6.7% will be spent on sound effects and audio design. 10% will be spent on music, although we additionally also give 100% of all profits attributable to the OST to our composers as revenue share. 10% will be spent on Kickstarter related fees. Finally, 15.3% will be spent on office costs, software and equipment.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur plan to begin a Closed Alpha of the first act of the game for Kickstarter backers in May, is relatively low-risk. We\u2019ve been running a closed test on itch.io, and the game is already playable with a campaign representing about one-third of the intended complete game playthrough length. We\u2019re very confident we\u2019ll be able to launch the Closed Alpha and run it with regular updates to the game.\n\nHowever, all game projects carry risks while they are in development. We were originally planning to release the game on Early Access earlier than now, but weren't happy with the quality of the game. So if we are able to and it seems necessary, then it is always possible that final delivery of the game may take longer, in order to get it to the quality we want it to have. But even during that time, Kickstarter backers will have access to the current alpha version and will receive continuous updates.\n\nAs we\u2019re a self-contained team, we don\u2019t have too many dependencies on external organisations. However, we do rely on marketplaces such as itch and Steam to host and deliver our game. While unlikely, unforeseen changes to these platforms may cause complications for us.\nWe\u2019re using Unreal Engine 4 to create the game, and while we have extensive experience using the engine (more than 20 years between the three of us), it\u2019s always possible that unexpected bugs or delayed features may in turn delay our ability to ship the game when we intend.\n\nPhysical reward fulfillment and add ons are also something we are getting professional help with, from Backerkit and Teespring. We hope that they'll help us to get through the thick of it. Since we are such a small team, we don't want to spend too much time on mailing out keys and packages. We should spend as much of our time and effort as possible on making the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Visitor Visa", "descp": "Thank you for your support dear visitor!

Truth is not more accurate or more deceptive than anything else. It just is.\nThere are many \u201ctruths\u201d about the darkness and the occult. Countless prophecies, texts and tomes about the unreal and the bizarre that pierce through reality and leave dismembered souls and withering minds in their wake. However, there are few insights that cover it all, and the certainty can always be questioned. Often they are a small part of a great mystery, or a conspiracy in a greater context.\n\nShrouded in darkness and buried for a thousand years in lies, the \u201ctruths\u201d come through from time to time. Facts, built upon dogmas, institutions, science, rituals, covens, only God knows what. The fundamental principles that are considered so true, that the bare thought of them being exposed would bring down dooms of death.\n\nConspiracies are boiling beneath the surface, the covens gather in dark rooms, knowledge switches owners and occultists dig deep into the mysteries to uncover the secrets.\n\n\n\nThis is the twilight of the gods - welcome to LexOccultum, an 18th century horror, mystery and occult role-playing game.\nOur goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to translate and launch Sweden\u2019s \u201dGame of the Year\" game into English.

This campaign will take the heroes from the streets of Paris to Versailles, to southern France and all the way to the hidden chambers of the ultimate secrets of all, what's hidden inside Mont Tombe. Roi de Rats, is a zoologic phenomenon also called Rattenk\u00f6nig (german) whereas a number of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together form an entity. The campaign is not for the faint-hearted or hack-and-slashers, it's complex and demanding for both players and the game master.\nSoftback or Hardback (stretch goal), approx 150+ pages.\nOur goal is to deliver the core rules along with the campaign Roi-de-Rats at the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018, depending on how long translation and printing take.\nPlease note that this is a funding campaign, and portions of the work are set to take place after we know if we are successful in the funding or not. This means that we have to engage writers, editors, printers etc, after the campaign ends. The delivery date is therefore an estimate, not a fixed science.\nEurope, 18th century. The church is losing its grip on men struggling with old beliefs and dogmas. Alchemists, occultists and secret societies dig deep into old mysteries and ancient obscurities. Enlightenment is not only about breaking free from old institutions and structures, but also about discovering what has been hidden for hundreds of years, even millenniums. Illuminati, Freemasons, the old Templars and other secret societies hide in dark chambers plotting for a new world order, or to just uncover the dark arts and ancient wisdoms.\n\nThe nobles and aristocrats is a dying breed living in full decadence and excess while the common people suffer in poverty. This is the era of Enlightment, but also ignorance. Few know anything about the growing darkness; the vampires and offspring of the devil, and while conspiracies grow under the surface, kings and priests preach about submission and obedience. But who is to save men from the twilight of the gods, from falling into the darkness and be consumed by evil? Is it true that the apocalypse is soon to come?\n\nLexOccultum takes place in a fictive historical 18th century, where the occult and supernatural is real but not yet in full bloom.\nThis is a game about flintlock pistols, filthy grave diggers, lanterns, werewolves, wine and decadence, secret societies, conspiracies and mysteries too dangerous to uncover. It\u2019s a game about explorers battling the raging seas, the truth about the Templars, holy bloodlines, a quiet war between men and beast. Discover the corrupt Paris, the smoke filled London, \"gin craze\" and alchemists search for the Philosopher's stone. Dig deep into the cabbala system and ancient mysteries of old Egypt.\n\n\u201dListen up, ya dragger-tails and butter-bags, our friend is to be stabbed with the Bridgeport dagger and will hang in the morning together with all blue-tape drinkers and innocent game pullets. So grab ya flats and sharps and let\u2019s walk down to that crown office and snab those red hats.\u201d\n\nInspirations building this property have been:\n\nThe movie Brotherhood of the wolf\nSolomon Kane\nQuicksilver\nHoly Blood and Holy Grail\nAssassins Creed\nThe perfume\nDracula\n...and all the templar-secret-societies-horror-vampire-books-and-movies, out there!\n  LexOccultum is a skill-based BRP-clone (basically the same game-engine as Trudvang Chronicles) with archetypes such as Occultist, Highwayman, Vagabond, Soldier, etc. and a set of Character Traits (Health, Charisma, Perception, Intelligence, etc.).\nSkills are divided in \u201dGeneral skills\u201d, \u201dDisciplines\u201d and \u201dSpecialties\u201d. General skills are broad and general, Disciplines are more focused and Specialties are a very specific expertise. Total skill value is measured from 1-20 (1 low, 20 max). A Skill measure between 1-10, and then Disciplines and Specialities can raise to a maximum of 20.\nExample: Natural Philosophy (Skill). Transmutation (Discipline). Alchemy (Specialty).\nAll skills are built upon a D20 system (roll below your Skill-level to success).\nCombat mechanics center around actions and modifications for difficulty and Skill level.\nCombat example:\nA character that has Skill value 7 in the skill Combat, level 2 in Discipline \u201dClose combat arms\u201d and level 3 in the Specialty \u201dOne handed weapons\u201d (right hand) has a total Skill value of 15 (7+1+1+2+2+2). This value is \u201ddynamic\u201d and can be distributed for the number of Action(s) the weapon allow. If the character carry a rapier he/she can attack and/or parry with the rapier 4 times in one Action round. The Skill value of each attack or parry is up to the character to decide as long as the sum is not higher than the total Skill value.\nThe combat system includes, initiatives (taking turns), actions and hit points. System is quite deadly and mortal. Wounds are divided into different blocks. Once entering a higher block modifications kick in. There are five levels for physical damage, and five levels for mental damage.\nRolls for damage is \u201copen-ended\u201d, meaning if you roll 10 you roll again.\nEven though it\u2019s unusual and difficult, characters can learn \u201cmagic\u201d from the Secret Arts, divided into: the Dark Arts, the Holy Arts and the Scientific Arts. Every \"spell\" or \"ritual\" requires individual skills and learning and there is no rule system cover them all. Some \"spells\" and \"rituals\" are very powerful, some not.\nInfluence in areas such as: Underworld, Politics, Military, Occult etc, plays an important role in the game. The more influence a character has in a specific area, the more likely to get power and credibility that can be used in the game. Influence is gained thru play and can also be acquired thru Adventure points given after fulfilling an adventure.\nVouge (meaning clothing and appearance) and \"first impression\" also play an important role in the game. Characters with high Vouge value are more likely to be helped and listen to than those with a low value. There is a set of rules deciding the Vouge value of clothing pending on how old and up-to-date with fashion they are, as well as the quality and detail of the clothes.\nThis will be the 3rd version of the previous G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rules, updated from the latest version currently online in our online RPG service.\nLexOccultum is an easy game to learn, but has the depth to attract the experienced gamer.\nSample Archetypes\n  LexOccultum is an existing game.

The book will be filled with all the secrets about the Freemasons, the Witch Cult, Illuminati, Odd Fellows, Sodalitium, and many more. And remember: this is the true version, not the one you\u2019ve been filled with before.\n\nCharta Monstrum\nCharta Monstrum - Bestiary\nCharta Monstrum is the monster-book for the game, including detailed info about vampires, werewolves, golems and many, many more.\n\nIf you have a hard time convincing yourself, boyfriend, girlfriend, mom, dad, pet, bank account, shelves already filled with nice games\u2026 whatever, to help us with this project .

Thank you guys, I hope this is only the first of a long series of masterpieces! Very glad to pledged your kickstarter\u201d \nA few words on production pace, priorities and what to focus on.\nSome potential backers may ask how we can release a new kick-starter for a new game when we have not delivered Trudvang Chronicles yet. So let us be clear, it's two separate teams working on these lines even though the core of our team (Theo and Magnus) will supervise both. Launching LexOccultum with have little effect on Trudvang Chronicles and vice versa. Having said that, should we be successful in this Kickstarter we will still always prioritise what's \"next in line\", in this case Trudvang Chronicles that will be out summer 2017.

We\u2019ve reached both our goals for this campaign. It\u2019s truly amazing!\nThe funds are important, but the great start to our community for \u00abMy Child Game\u00bb is invaluable. This campaign has given us so many new friends and ambassadors, both as backers and followers on Facebook, Twitter and our newsletter. We\u2019re looking forward to sending out the rewards we are making for you!\nThis is just the beginning of our journey - we aim to launch the game this autumn and have an exiting period in front of us. So to all of you who are visiting this page after the campaign is over, please follow our project on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/MyChildLebensborn/), Twitter (twitter.com/MyChildGame) or sign up for our newsletters (www.mychildlebensborn.com).\nWith all our hearts, thank you!\nElin & Catharina\n       PLAY\n\n \nYou play as the ward of a seven year old child. You are a single parent, struggling with a tight budget while taking care of your child. Together, you live through a linear story beginning with the child starting school. \n But your kid\u2019s first meeting with the local community is troubled. You are challenged to explain and help the child as the problems deepen, while also uncovering their background and the cause of the difficult situation. The playthrough will be around 4 - 5 hours and you can choose if your kid is a boy or a girl.\n  Meet Klaus/Karin, a kind and creative child living in a small town in Norway in 1951. Learning to know that they are different from the other children \u2013 a deep feeling of shame grows within them. \nFortunately, they have a kind and loving adoptive parent - you.\nAfter years of occupation, your local town is recovering from the emotional and physical scars left after a long war. \nBut there are some scars that do not heal. \n   Within this town is your home and your child\u2019s sanctuary. \nYour home will be the main interaction point with the child, as you care for, nurture and work through the problems Klaus/Karin faces.\n Other nurture games, like \"Tamagotchi\", have traditionally presented the player with a one dimensional pet to care for. \nIn our game you build a relationship with a child that has a complex character and individual personality. What you say and how you care for the child feeds into a mood system, directly affecting the child's emotional state.\nThis is reflected in facial expressions, body language and also in the way the child responds to you. So - instead of a pet, you interact with a complex and interesting character that we think will give you an immersive and engaging game experience. \nWe use an intimate format, relying on the mobile screen with touch based controls, to create a stronger emotional experience.\n  Balance meagre resources and emotional needs\nTime is the main currency in the game. You are free to choose how this time is spent, either by working to earn money (letting you buy and do more, but leaving the child alone), or to spend with the child (supporting the child's development, but having less for food or rent).\n  Influence the child\u2019s personality, emotions and views                                                   How you interact with the child will affect their emotions and wellbeing. It respond differently to you based on the choices you make, and ultimately their view on the world will change. \n\n\nMake tough choices                                                                                                              The story will be experienced differently from one player to the next and will take you through an increasingly emotionally challenging experience. \n   We are inspired by the true stories of Children Born of War, with enemy soldiers as fathers. Children of the enemy are born in all conflicts. We tell the dramatic story of the \"Lebensborn\" children in Norway, which is one of many such groups.\n We are working with surviving Lebensborn-children, now in their seventies, to ensure that the events that we are presenting are representative for the difficulties they faced growing up.\n  My Child Lebensborn features scores from experienced and renowned film composers, who have worked on subtle scores for emotional content. \nKetil Vestrum Einarsen and Lars Fr\u00f8islie are making music that color and follow the child's emotional state, using acoustic instruments that fit the historical context. \nFor sound design we are working with Dan Wakefield, who recently got acclaim for his work on \"Through the Woods\".   \n  In order to create a believable and complex character with individuality and personal traits, we have worked with writer Sofia Lersol Lund. She has brought her experience with character development for film and TV-series to the project. \nWriter Ozan Dr\u00f8sdal from Perfectly Paranormal is bringing his experience in effective dialogue for games.\nWe also wish to thank author Nicolai Frobenius, game author Ragnar T\u00f6rnqvist (Dreamfall) and experienced game designer Richard Lermarchand (Uncharted) for their excellent advice and support.  \n    We have some wonderful pledge rewards for you that we hope you find interesting. Your help and support will really make a difference. Supporters, such as yourself, who\u2019ll follow and share our project are so important to the success and visibility of the game. \nEven a one dollar pledge matters and shows us that we have people willing to support our cause.\n        Delivery dates\nWe will work to fullfill delivery of the tiers as swiftly as we can, and mail out digital rewards as they are produced. The physical part of a tier will be posted in one shipment as soon as all the items  belonging to the tier are completed.\nInternational shipment *)\nWe have included international shipment by post in the prize of the perks, but the supporter will be responsible for any tax or customs in their local countries. We will ship the tiers marked as marketing material and with the metal value of the hearts. \n  My Child: Lebensborn will be launched as a premium game for mobile platforms. Release estimated autum 2017. \nWe have funded most of the development of the game, however we need your help to ensure the game gets the full attention it deserves. \nWe lack funds for refining and marketing, and both are really important elements to be able to give the game the love it needs. And most importantly - to be able to get the game out to people.\nYour support will be used in the following way:\n  (This is an estimate, based on a theoretical number of supporters and mix of tiers)\n  This project is a collaboration between two companies, Teknopilot and Sarepta Studio.\nIndie game developers Sarepta studio, with their team of 10 employees and CEO Catharina Due B\u00f8hler, are the creators of award-winning PC and console game \"Shadow Puppeteer\".\n\nTeknopilot is a production company working with innovative, digital storytelling, headed by producer Elin Fest\u00f8y.\nElin and Catharina met at a seminar in 2013, whilst Elin was working on the Lebensborn material. She wanted to explore the possibility of making a game that lets you experience the story instead of \"telling\" it in a traditional format. To use the game format to build empathy through immersion, interaction and emotional engagement. \nThe two companies have since been hard at work developing this concept into reality. \n  Please follow our project - we are posting updates on many platforms. Follow them all to get the full picture :-)  \nFacebook   \nTwitter   \nSnapchat   \nYouTube - Gamedev blogs   \nInstagram   \nE-mail updates   \nwww.mychildlebensborn.com\n\nOn behalf of all on our team, we would like to thank you for the interest you have shown in this project. The development of the game, as well as the opportunity to tell the unknown story of the\" Lebensborn\" children, has been a dream of ours. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for sharing our dream and supporting us.\n  Kind Regards\nFrom Elin and Catharina\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we have secured some funding for our game, we know that we will be able to finish it. However our current funds for polishing and testing are extremely limited, and we fear that we won't be able to do the game justice when it comes to the end product. The marketing funding - and ambassadors - from this campaign will mean a lot to the future of the project. \n\nThe risk for the backers of this campaign are very limited. The game will be finished, and the physical and digital perks that we offer will be financed by the funds from the rewards. \n\nWe aim to release the game for Android and iOS, and will need to get accepted into Google Play or Apple Store. There is a risk that there will be a struggle in getting accepted because of the heavy topic.

A place where technology is magic and newcomers are revered or hated.\n         The denizens of this new world will range from tribal punk hunters to retro inspired robots.\nMark and Don will experience this strange and wondrous place with you.\n    A never before seen African post-apocalyptic setting.\nA dramatic science fiction story inspired, in both look and design, by the 80s, with a futuristic twist.\nExplore a beautiful wasteland to discover villages, destroyed cities, and uncover the secrets of strange and abandoned technology.\nA synth inspired soundtrack. \nMultiple characters and companions.\nA classic adventure game whereby you solve puzzles, combine and use items, discover clues and work your way through an epic story.\n        PLAY\n\nLINK TO PHOTOGRAMMETRY VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Ya_loZo-okk\nWe are using photogrammetry to capture the beauty of Africa. In this process, we take hundreds of photographs of a scene or object and, then using specialized software, we generate 3D models and textures from the photos themselves.\nEvery screen in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION has a real piece of Africa in it - most often due to changing winds and ocean tides it is something that will only ever exist in our game.\n  Classic science fiction films still hold up today because of their extensive use of real locations and miniatures. \nWith BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we want to capture the feeling of true science fiction through the use of intricately painted miniatures also captured with photogrammetry.\nA post apocalyptic world gives us many incredible opportunities to work with scale models. We can explore an decrepit battleship, hulls of long abandoned cargo planes and urban graveyards of rusted cars... All the elements we so love about the post apocalyptic genre.\n  By aiding us in the crowd funding of BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we would like to reward you with an array of goodies. \nPledge $5 or more:\nPledge $19 or more:\nPledge $33 or more:\nPledge $69 or more:\n Pledge $78 or more:\nPledge $119 or more:\nSTANDARD BOX DESIGN\nEXCLUSIVE TO OUR BACKERS\nTo celebrate BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we have created a one-of-a-kind box design.

The design pillars are:\nBase & team management\nTurn-by-turn combat\nSanity loss & perma-death \n   Our project is somewhere at the crossroad between XCOM: EU, Eldritch Horror and The Call of Cthulhu. We seek to design a game that has the accessibility of a video game, the tactical challenge of a board game and the flavor of a good old-fashioned tabletop RPG. \nPlanned release : October 2017\nGame mode: single-player offline\nLanguage: English (more languages to be announced)\nSupported platforms: PC, Android, iOS \n     The year is 1929. A dismal Cult is sprawling around the world. Blinded by their folly these madmen seek to awaken one of the Elders - an alien abomination buried deep below the sea.\n   You control a secret society whose sole purpose is to prevent the awakening. Send your Investigators to travel the world, study ancient texts and forbidden relics, find a way to contain this evil. \n   Do not linger, your time is running out!\n    We want to make this game because we believe there is another angle to Lovecraft's works. Indeed, if you take Lovecraft\u2019s books one by one then you might see a series of horror tales. But if you look at them as a whole, the global picture becomes way more epic: you will find yourself contemplating an alternative universe with its own mythos and lore, an encyclopedia of bizarre creatures, a pantheon of alien gods, a fragile mankind perpetually on the brink of destruction\u2026 And that\u2019s the angle we want to capture. A game in which human life is ephemeral, where madness is lurking at every crossroad, where a strange Mythos is developing in the shadows. \n      The game is organized around two game phases\n  You control several Investigators that you can send all across the world to investigate strange cases and establish new contacts in your headquarters.\n   Each Contact gives you access to a specific action. For instance, the Sanatorium will allow you to recover from Insanity, the Underworld will give you access to the black-market shop and the Airfield will give you access to air routes.\n    The essence of each Investigator is its Occupation. As of now, we plan to have 9 Occupations, but make sure to check out our Stretch Goals for more!\n  The Occupation defines the overall balance of your Investigators:\nDreamers are fragile but have a high Sanity. That makes them excellent spell-casters, but vulnerable to mental disorders.\nEnforcers are of strong Health and good Dexterity. They are good at taking and dealing physical damage.\nScholars have average stats except for their outstanding intelligence. Their rationalism protects them from Sanity damage.\n  Every Investigator has a highly functional character sheet, giving you a quick and clear overview of its core stats (Health, Sanity, Dexterity and Intelligence).\nInventory on the left. Character Sheet on the right.\n   Each Investigator has 15 open slots that will be filled progressively with Afflictions, Skills and Spells. These attributes will define your character's personality and create endless gameplay possibilities.\n     The game is built around a turn-by-turn combat system. Every Investigator has a pool of Action Points that can be used to move, attack and interact with the environment.\n   To prevail against the wicked Cult, your investigators will have to use Artefacts and blasphemous Spells at the cost of their Sanity.\n       If your Investigators take too much damage they die permanently. Damage can be dealt both physically and mentally. If either your Health or Sanity reaches zero, your character is gone... forever.\n     Sanity is a crucial resource, that your Investigators spend whenever they face nightmarish creatures, investigate terrifying facts, study abnormal relics and cast blasphemous spells... But manage them wisely, for loosing too much Sanity could result in a mental Disorder.\n   Each Disorder has the ability to trigger disruptive random events. Here are a few examples:\nAn Investigator who suffers from Gambling can potentially be ambushed by Loan Sharks in every city he sets foot in, resulting in a dangerous combat situation. \nAn Alcoholic Investigator can end up in jail if he stays idle for too long which will require you to post bail!\nTreat disorders rapidly to avoid misfortunes.\n         We have plenty of content to add to our game, in case we exceed our initial objective: new Occupations, exclusive Weapons, new Environments... And ultimately, the cross-platform cloud saving.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Inspector, the Writer, the Architect.\n  Gain access to exclusive WW1 military supplies: the Stick Hand Grenades, the Heavy Machine Gun and many more!\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Boxer, the Priest, the Librarian.\n   Explore a new environment - the Tropical Jungle! It comes along with 10 new turn-by-turn adventures.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Thug, the Musician, the Archaeologist.\n Enhance your thriving headquarters with additional contacts.\n  Explore the oneiric world of the Dream Lands! This new environment comes along with 10 new maps for turn-by-turn adventures.\n Create a secured cloud account to store your save file so you can share your progress between PC and mobile! This requires a lot of front-end and back-end work. It's a complicated task that comes with high cost, but we would love to make it happen.\n         All backers will appear in our game's Credits. The position of the names will be based on the different pledge tiers.\n   Minimum Requirements: Android 4.0.3, 1GHZ Dual Core, 1GB RAM, 800*480 pixels screen resolution\n   [Edit: we added 2 pledges specifically for iOS versions.

We love playing good games but we rarely have the time to do so. This has two negative consequences:\nWe unwillingly cut down on good gaming experiences because they are too time consuming. \nWe find ourselves playing more and more mobile games not necessarily because we like them, but simply because they are convenient to use.\nTherefore, we built the DNA of our games around a blend of both platforms:\nFast to load: we want the player to be able to dive into his game as quickly as possible and resume his progression. That\u2019s why we chose 2D graphics over 3D graphics.\nFast to play: we avoid huge chunks of dialogues and replace text with icons whenever we can in order to make our User Interface as intuitive as possible.\nA short but extensible game loop: we are putting together small bits of adventures so you can play the game for several minutes or a couple of hours.\nHighly replayable: instead of a complicated one-time story line that\u2019s hard to keep track with, we want you to experience your own stories by creating a dynamic sandbox. As your characters progress throughout the game, this sandbox will fill with unexpected events.\nFully mobile friendly: most games are either designed for mobile-only or ported to mobile after being successful on another platform. We are designing this game to work on both PC and mobile right from the start \u2013 hence the top view for instance.\nPremium model: no advertising, no in-game purchases, you can play offline and never need to wait for long downloads to finish. \n     Francois has been around video games for over a decade, working in various management positions for Ubisoft, 2K Games and Gameloft. He is the twisted mind behind this project so he is the one to blame! For his defence though, he\u2019s been under the influence of role-playing games and board games ever since he was old enough to read rules and throw dice.\n   David is a veteran coder who served 10 years in the industry working for Ubisoft and Rockstar Games. He contributed to worldwide successes like Grand Theft Auto and Assassin\u2019s Creed. His love for the code can only be matched by his love for outdoor activities\u2026 If he doesn\u2019t answer your mail then he\u2019s probably out there, camping somewhere in the wilderness.\n   Robin is an experienced coder who started on the wrong side of the force, making tools and algorithms for Financial institutions. Thankfully, he turned Jedi 4 years ago when he joined 2K Games to produce the mobile versions of XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. After that, he started coding his own games among which some interactive adaptations of child books\u2026 Now he is all about making the world a better place!\n   Like most artists Seb has been drawing ever since mother nature gave him two arms and a consciousness. Most of his craft has been channelled towards fantasy books and RPG artworks which is a perfect match for the art direction of our game. In his free time, Seb likes to chain-watch movies and worship the eighties\u2026 One day, he\u2019ll make one of these pixel-based games full of flashy colors and synthesizer sound effects. Check out his work at http://www.sebastienecosse.com/\n   When you look at Ben, you are looking at 16 years of professional experience in the field of graphic design and menu navigation. Websites, flash games, mobile apps\u2026 He\u2019s seen it all! Needless to say that he is the mastermind behind the User Interface of our game. Thankfully his current work is not impeded by his passion for red wine. Check out his work at http://frak.fr/\n   Brice is a our fearless young blood, coming straight out of the game design school. As a student, he contributed to many indie projects and board game designs, and even worked on Fear Effect Sedna during his internship. His obsession for meticulous game mechanics and his fresh ideas are invaluable to keep the project up-to-date with our time. He is not only a fan of game jams but also of musical jams and owns enough instruments to equip a whole band!\n     The whole audio (SFX and musics) will be produced by Red Forge. Check out their work at http://www.redforgemusic.com/ or https://redforge.bandcamp.com/ \n     Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu has been in development for a full year already. Like most indie game projects we got this far by tapping our own personal savings. We are now reaching out to Kickstarter in order to produce the remaining content.\n   Our studio Strange Matter is full of new ideas and original concepts. But in order to continue, we need Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu to be a success. So if you want to inject some new blood into the gaming industry thereby refreshing your gaming experiences, then now is the moment to mobilize! \n   Whether you can afford to pledge or not, we would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We would be even more grateful if you could spread the word to help us reach our funding target. Let them know we're here!\n   Thank you so much.\n  To follow the development of our project, join us on our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter @EldersRise.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have set the funding goal to \u20ac51.000, a value that we have carefully calculated to allow the completion of the project and that ensures our unconditioned dedication to the release and beyond. That said, game development is always full of challenges, sometimes unexpected ones. But looking at the current shape of our project after a full year of development, we are highly confident that we will successfully deliver a good game.\n\nThis confidence also stems from the combined experience that our team members have gathered in the industry over the last decade. We feel enthusiastic as \u201cRise of the Elders: Cthulhu\u201d is our launch pad into independent game development and we feel motivated as it will guarantee the forthcoming of our freshly formed company.\n\nWe\u2019ve set the estimated delivery to September 2017. Although estimations are a difficult topic in the software industries, we\u2019ve done the uttermost to set the right release date for our game. The estimation will slightly vary based on the amount of stretch goals achieved. But with a bigger funding, we can also get more people on board to ensure a quick development.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Strange Matter\nFirst created

They are all bound by hand, and the content, while originally hand-written, will be printed on the pages except for in the top two tiers.  The pages are heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft (see the video and some example pages below).    \nDeer Hide Hickory Wood Option:  Thickest and heaviest, it is covered in deer hide over 1/4\" thick hickory wood panels, with a raised Elder Sign, metal protective corners, and extra thick spine.  \n  Deer Hide Wood Cover Option\n  Gold Stamped Option: Imitation leather but good thickness and gold stamped Elder Sign on the cover (see video).  It has a flat spine.   NOTE:  There are two rewards with this cover, a blank journal / sketch book with regular paper, and the printed spell book.\nGold stamped option\nGoat Hide Option: Thin and light (see video), but with a nicely dyed goat hide cover and a raised Elder Sign. We've worked to make this the least expensive option and hopefully accessible to most fans.  NOTE:  The Elder Sign in off center in this prototype but will be centered in the final version.     \nGoat hide option\nThe Pages: The intent behind the book is that it is a tome of spells, rituals, prayers, and history from those who favor the Great Old Ones and that it has been passed down generation to generation with additions along the way.  The book is divided into four sections\nAncient Section: This is the biggest section, and consists mostly of Latin and other ancient languages.  Many of the passages taken directly from the Necronomicon were translated into Latin and written here.   \n17th Century Section: This section was added around the time of the Salem witch trials.  It is written in the English of the 1600s with different handwriting, and by someone with low spelling and grammar skills.  It contains a scattering of ancient magic mixed in with the English.   \nVictorian Era Section:  Added in the mid 1800s, this section is a much neater handwriting, and generally better English.  It adds a few questionable arcane choices, which in turn lead to the fourth and final section.  \nVictorian Era Deranged Section: It is unclear if this section was added by the previous author, or by their heir, but for certain this relatively short section shows a distinct degrading in mental stability.   \nSample Pages: Here are the pages CURRENTLY available as the \"A single rolled A3 sized spell book sheet (a left and right page combo) on cotton paper\" reward.  We will add more options as stretch goals (and potentially some free pages)\n  Page 750-751 of the Necronomicon\n  Essential Saltes\nA Note on CUSTOM PAGES: For the options with custom pages (Mage $400 and higher) I will work with you for what you want, but I am a fairly limited artist.  What you see in other pages is what you are likely to see more of, just, customized to what you want.  I can do words and runes and symbols and simple designs, but I can't, for example, draw realistic characters or horrifying monsters, although I could attempt to copy one by hand if you had something for me to use as a guide.  \nThe Game\nThe Game: From the Back Cover\nAugust 1st, 1883, a Great Old One rose out of the Pacific Ocean and armies of cultists, half breeds, hybrid monstrosities and creatures built from the stuff of nightmares pulled off their disguises and prepared to herald in the coming age of their Master. Ultimately the Old One and the hordes of \u201cAeonists,\u201d as they called themselves, were defeated.  \nUnfortunately, your kind were  on the side of the Old One\nYou are an Aeonist, one of the Leftovers of the Apocalypse, and for the last decade you and your people have been hunted down, imprisoned, or worse. Your religious beliefs misunderstood, your people mocked and hated for their differences, and your history and your culture banned or destroyed.  \nThe year is now 1893. The camps are closing, Aeonists are rebuilding their lives, and sunlight has returned to the fields and farms. You may choose to move closer to the Higher Powers you know are out there, or deny their existence. You may attempt to renounce your heritage, or to serve it faithfully, to avenge your people or to help rebuild civilization. The one certainty is that there is no going back.  \nRulebook Cover\nThe Ruleset: This is a ruleset for a Role Playing Game with complete guidelines on how to play it as a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) Game, and a Table Top RPG. It is 260+ pages long, and contains  \nBackground History and Current World \nSimple Character Creation Process \nBoth LARP and Table Top rules mechanics \nThree sets of 72 Damage Cards (printed on paper for copying and using on card stock etc. The actual decks of playing cards are sold separately) \nGM Resources like Spells, Items, NPCs \nA complete introductory scenario which can be played as a Table Top game or a LARP.\nSample page1\n  Sample page2\n  Sample page3\nThe Add-On Damage Card Decks: There are actual playing-card sized card decks available for the combat system.  They aren't required (copies of all of them come in the ruleset) but make a great playing aid.  \nSample Blades and Bullets\n  Horror Sample\n  Reward Matrix\nNew Add-Ons!\n+ $150\nA reprinted version of Poligraphia, by the Monk Johannes Trithemius\nThis is the scanned text of the actual book published circa 1499 now reprinted on antiqued paper and bound in goat hide.  It was listed as banned by the Catholic Church from 1609 to 1900, and is mentioned in the H.P. Lovecraft story \"Dunwich Horror\".  Approximately 276 pages long, it will be printed on thinner paper than the Spell Book, but the paper will still have deckled edges and will be yellowed as parchment paper.  \nAnother great addition to an Lovecraft inspired library.  \nPoligraphia\n+ $150  \nA reprinted version of De Furtivis Literarum Notis by Giovanni Battista della Porta\nThis is the scanned text of the actual book published circa 1563 now reprinted on antiqued paper and bound in goat hide. It is a book about cryptography and is mentioned in the H.P. Lovecraft story \"Dunwich Horror\". Approximately 256 pages long, it will be printed on thinner paper than the Spell Book, but the paper will still have deckled edges and will be yellowed as parchment paper. \nAnother great addition to an Lovecraft inspired library.\nDe Furtivis Literarum Notis\nWant them both?\n+$275 - Get BOTH antique reprinted and hand-bound books as a single Add-On!!\nADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS:  To add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:   \nPress the 'Manage Your Pledge' Button above.  If you have not pledged yet, it will say 'Back this Project'.\nIncrease your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.  If you want multiples of the add-ons, just pledge the amount for the total number of add-ons.    \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned.  \nStretch Goal\nStretch Goal UNLOCKED - Stretch Goal $20,000 - Spell Book in Color PDF!  \nI hesitated to do this because I was being a little overprotective of my work, but it is clear backers would get the most use out of the Spell Book if they could also have it as a color pdf so they could print out their own scrolls, separate pages, and other options as props in games or just to have around. So, there you have it.  \nStretch Goal UNLOCKED - Stretch Goal $25,000 - FREE Pinkerton Government Services Official File  \nPinkerton File\nWhat is this file you ask?  \nIn general - This is a custom printed prop folder filled with loose pages analyzing the content of the spell book. It will have the look of a rough document from a fictional government organization with handwritten and typewriter typed commentary (Not a font. I actually bought a manual typewriter for this)  \nFor those getting a book - It will translate all the Latin text, and all the R'lyehian text, while also interpreting a few of the diagram or mystical symbol pages. It will cover 30 of the interior book pages (mostly from the Ancient section). There will still be a few untranslated pages in the book in other languages, but the Latin and R'lyehian will all be translated.  \nFor those getting a game and not the book - Each of these pages in the file can be used as a prop in a game to reference a book, even if you don't have the book physically on hand, and make a great addition to either a Table Top or LARP scenario.\nStretch Goal UNLOCKED $30,000 - More Pages to the Pinkerton File!  \nThe Pinkerton Sketch Files and a 200+ word dictionary of R'lyehian!\nThe game rule book already contains all of the Pinkerton Sketch files, but many of them are 1/4 page size. We will reprint them here as full size individual pages. Example  \nNightmare at Dawn\nHowever, since that is not new content, merely higher quality content, we will also be adding a printed 200+ word R'lyehian ancient language dictionary in a short academic paper as well.  \nR'lyehian (or Cthuvian) is the language used in this famous quote \"ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\" which translates into \u201cIn his house at R\u2019lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\u201d  \nMost R\u2019lyehian (or Cthuvian) dictionaries online have approximately 86 words translated from the language originally created by H.P. Lovecraft. I\u2019ve taken those dictionaries, and expanded them to 200+ words by taking a logical look at the syntax and using that to build new words. For example  \n ep = after  \n hai = now  \nTherefore ephai = Later (literally \"after now\")  \nIf you add agl which = place Then ephaiagl = Future (literally \"place in the after now\")  \nWith this as a guide, I was able to more than double the existing vocabulary without having to create anything wholesale.  \nStretch Goal UNLOCKED $35,000 - Another Antique Book Add-On!\nWe have two antique book add-ons as it stands now, if we hit this goal, we'll add another $150 book to the options, printed on the same style paper and goat hide binding at the first two.  \nFourth Book of the Occult\nBuying all three add-ons would normally be $450, but we'll make the Library in a Box deal $425 only for Kickstarter backers.  \nNOTE: Stretch goals apply only to pledge levels of $45 and higher.  \nWe will continue to add more stretch goals as we unlock the current ones.  \nThe Lovecraft based Spell Book and RPG just got more interesting...  \nTell your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe hand-made books are the most challenging, and take the most time.

It has been written for Call of Cthulhu and will be updated for the 7th edition of the rules. \nBack in 2007 I answered a call from famed Call of Cthulhu\u00ae writer and editor Keith \"Doc\" Herber to submit ideas for his upcoming The Outer Gods scenario book. He had specific ideas about making the book different from other scenario collections, and he had a high bar he wanted each scenario to reach. We worked together on the scenario over the next 1.5 years until his untimely death in 2009, but before that, he approved Sun Spots for inclusion in The Outer Gods. His specific words were: \"I think we have a winner here, and one with a lot of fun possibilities. Nice job...\" I hope this project will do his vision justice.\nRight now, I have written nearly 28,000 words for this scenario, play-tested it multiple times (both with friends and at conventions), and have commissioned art by seasoned Cthulhu veterans Jason Eckhardt, Reuben Dodd, Caleb Cleveland and Chris Huth. I'm also bringing back most of my team from my previous Kickstarter (He Who Laughs Last): Gregory G. Geiger for design and layout, Jake Coolidge for maps, and Cynthia Douglas Chernoff as my editor. \nThe funding for this project will be used for completing maps and art, finishing the design and layout of the books, and having the book edited, produced and delivered into your nice warm hands! I can't wait to show you!\nHere is an amazing illustration from Mr Dodd!\n   Now that we're funded, let's talk about stretch goals. I've thought carefully about them and want to make sure that they add to your game but will not impact the scope of the project. \nHere are the stretch goals we've got planned:\nFUNDED $7500: More Art -- Add four more b/w half-page illustrations by our amazing artist Reuben Dodd.\nFUNDED $8500: GM Kit Part 1 -- Provide Playtest notes illuminating the various lessons learned throughout the years of playtesting this, as well as provide a full transcript of the first playtest from 2008. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\nFUNDED $10,000: Red Valley Visitor's Guide -- I will work with Gregory Geiger to incorporate Jake Coolidge's hand-drawn map of Red Valley into a 1920s-style visitor's guide handout. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above, and will be provided as a print copy for the Deluxe level ($70) and above.\nFUNDED $12,000: GM Kit Part 2 -- I'll create 6 pre-generated Call of Cthulhu PCs and put them with the playtest notes. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\n$14,000: Headshots -- Reuben Dodd will illustrate 10 b/w headshots for various NPCs to go directly into the book. \n$15,000: Director's Cut -- One really fun and interesting scene that I worked on extensively with Keith Herber, but was cut from the final product, will be added as an addendum, to be used by GMs at will. We'll also have Reuben Dodd add two half-page b/w illustrations to this chapter as well. \n\u201cDave Sokolowski\u2019s Sun Spots harkens back to the classic Call of Cthulhu scenarios that we all love and dials up the danger with a number of intriguing twists including a new take on an old god. Detailed, multi-layered, and engaging, Sun Spots shines with interesting characters, nefarious plots, and ancient evil. Sokolowski has another winner on his hands.\u201d - Stuart Boon, author of the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Shadows over Scotland\n\"Dave Sokolowski submitted Sun Spots to Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber for his planned epic scenario book, The Outer Gods. Doc worked with Dave to tweak, build, and perfect it, and was proud of the final result. Sadly, in a blow to the entire community, Doc passed away suddenly long before the project could be completed. It should be noted that Doc\u2019s vision for The Outer Gods contained the following requirement on the spec sheet, \u201cEvery scenario in this book has to be great.\u201d Those who knew Doc and his considerable work for the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game were aware that nothing got approved unless it was truly excellent work. This was the man behind H. P. Lovecraft's Arkham, H. P. Lovecraft's Dunwich, Keeper's Companion, 1920s Investigator's Companion, Spawn of Azathoth, Trail of Tsathogghua, Fungi from Yuggoth, and New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley to name only a few. Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber shaped Call of Cthulhu and made it a truly wonderful game. And if he thought Sun Spots was great, what\u2019s your excuse?\" - Tom Lynch, co-founder of Miskatonic River Press \n\"In presenting a new interpretation of an Outer God, Sun Spots brings an uncaring and elemental influence to bear down on New England, but this is pleasingly manifest in an all too human a fashion\u2014pride, belief, and religious mania that are as much a threat to the investigators as the Daemon Sultan is himself. Sun Spots is a delightfully balmy investigation into the dangers of sun worship.\" - Pookie, Reviews from R'lyeh (the full review is here: http://rlyehreviews.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/shining-for-cthulhu-dark.html)\nWe have the following levels of pledge available:\nThanks ($1): Any amount of pledge (from $1 up) will see your name on our Kickstarter Supporter list. Many thanks indeed!\nDigital ($10): This level receives the Sun Spots PDF from DTRPG, as well as any and all stretch goals! All levels from $10 up will receive the PDF copy.\nSoft-Copy ($30): At this level backers will receive a soft-cover copy POD Sun Spots book, plus the PDF and Thanks.\nDeluxe Hard Copy ($70): This level of backing will receive a hard-backed copy POD Sun Spots book, signed by me, plus the PDF and Thanks. These backers will also receive hard-copies of the three maps and any handouts designed for the scenario (this is what makes it \"deluxe\").\nCharacters ($100): In addition to everything at the Deluxe level, I will create 6 Call of Cthulhu 1920s-era PC sheets to your specifications, and then give you both digital and hard-copies of them.\nEntitled ($120): Get everything at the Deluxe level, then choose from a list of 20 NPCs and locations in the scenario that you can name to your liking (scenario-appropriate, please). People can choose in the order in which they chose this option (e.g. first backer at this level chooses from the list first).\nClose Traveler ($250): I will travel within 100 miles of San Francisco to run the scenario for you and your friends. You'll get the personalized PC sheets, 1 hard copy (for you), and 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends). It will be a good time. I'll bring snacks.\nTraveler ($1300): At this level, I will travel anywhere in the USA or Canada, bring 1 hand-signed hard-back copy of Sun Spots, 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends), and run a game for you and up to 5 of your friends. I'll also bring snacks and my gregarious personality. (You will also receive the Deluxe handouts and PC sheets).  \nAdd-Ons\nDue to popular demand, I will make additional soft-cover POD books available at the $30 pledge level. And if you\u2019ve already purchased one book, I will subsidize part of the shipping. Here is what you can do if you want to add-on a softcover POD book to your existing pledge:\nIf you live in the USA or UK: Add $35 total\nIf you live outside the USA/UK: Add $40 total \nShipping\nFurthermore, for shipping of the physical books, I have tried to strike a balance for both myself and backers. I will subsidize part of the shipping, as well as streamline the shipping rates to avoid confusion. \nUS backers will pay $5, UK backers $10 and other international backers $20 for the soft-back copy reward shipments. Hard-copies will be a bit more for UK, as I have to ship all the boxes to my house first, before shipping them out (except where I meet you in person). I hope this will be a middle ground where shipping doesn't overwhelm the budget but backers don't have to absorb the entire cost.  \nI have play-tested this game multiple times since I completed the first draft back in 2009, and it has been honed and edited down to a very clean and crisp story. What used to be a very wide sandbox game with very few boundaries for the investigators now has clarity and focus. There is still a very strong sandbox feel, but the scenario now has guides and structure to get the players heading in the right direction before letting them go.\nWith this much playtesting, I was forced to pull a couple of scenes that I had worked on with Doc, but ultimately got in the way of the best possible scenario. With enough funding it might be possible to clean up this content and get it back in the book in an Appendix. We might even be able to do some art for it.\nI have run this game at multiple conventions (Dundracon, Celesticon, and Big Bad Con) as well as with local gaming groups. I believe it is finally ready for you.\nThis scenario has been around a long time and I really want to get it into your hands, to finally realize Doc's vision, but I need help with funding to get it over the finish line. I want the book to look and feel like the Cthulhu gaming books of the 1980-90s, specifically in the vein of Escape from Innsmouth, which Kevin Ross and Doc created with a host of talented artists and writers. Most importantly, I want this book to be something Doc would love.\nI need funding now to finish the book. To finish the art and maps, to get professional design and layout, and then have it edited so it all comes together in one amazing package. If you pledge now, then we can make it happen together. \nFinally, while the Kickstarter project is live, He Who Laughs Last in all formats, as well as the GM Kit and Short Fiction, will be on sale with 33% off on DTRPG here. \nCall of Cthulhu\u2122 is a trademark of Chaosium Inc and is used under licence.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe scenario has been written and playtested multiple times. Multiple art pieces are complete and more are in progress. This leaves design, layout, editing and production.\n\nThe biggest risks have to do with people and life. Right now, the team is working hard at the project and the book is scheduled to be delivered well on time. I spent many years as a professional project manager, and I have the skills and understanding to keep a project on track. \n\nThe key to any good project is communication. Expect at least monthly updates from me, and I will strive to be transparent in all aspects of my business dealings with my backers. Things may and do happen that can sidetrack a project. But with transparency and accountability we'll still get the book in your hands in the best possible manner.\n\nPlease refer to my previous project He Who Laughs Last if you want to see my communication style first-hand.

We've incorporated years of play experience. We are also able to redesign the visual look and feel of the book with new illustrations and designs.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the book contains Unnamable, a new Lovecraftian-style roleplaying system designed by John Wick along with conversion notes for each adventure. I designed Unnamable because I wanted a Lovecraftian system that better fit my own GM style. While I am a life-long fan of the Call of Cthulhu game, Unnamable is a more narrative system, focusing on the choices and sacrifices characters make in Lovecraftian fiction.\nWhy the Yellow Sign?\nWhile most Lovecraftian games and adventures focus on the pulp style of story (looking for clues, solving puzzles, deciphering old books), Curse of the Yellow Sign focuses on something different. I love the kind of \"weird tale\" that inspired Lovecraft in the first place and I wanted to write adventures that were like them. Stories meant to make the reader feel a sense of dread and unease. Presenting a mad world that seemed out to get them. There are no clues to uncover, no puzzles to solve. Just the horror of a universe that looks down upon them... and laughs.\nThe concept of a book that drives the reader mad started with The King in Yellow. The blasphemous, cursed play that caused riots and murders, that was banned in France after a single performance. I loved the concept of an idea that could kill. An idea passed on from one mind to the other. And with that concept, I ironed out the trilogy of adventures that makes up Curse of the Yellow Sign.\nAct I: Digging for a Dead God\nIn May of 1939, somewhere in the jungles of Africa, a small band of soldiers have stumbled across something ancient. Something terrible.\nAnd they are about to suffer the consequences.\nIn Act I, the players take the roles of soldiers during World War II in Africa. They unlock, and thus, unleash a dangerous idea that takes the form of a German folk tale and slowly drives the soldiers mad.\nDigging for a Dead God contains:\n1 map\n6 pre-generated characters\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nAct II: Calling the King\nAt the turn of the century\nIn an abandoned hotel\nIn the dead darkness of winter\nSix actors sit to read a cursed play\nIn Act II, a famous theater and movie director puts together a cast for the reading of The King in Yellow. He has an ulterior motive... but then again, so does the play.\nCalling the King contains:\n6 pre-generated and illustrated characters\nExcerpts from Act 1 of The King in Yellow\nTheories on the ever-mercurial, seemingly shapeshifting play\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nMap of the hotel\nAct III: Archimedes VII\nArchimedes 7 is a colony ship traveling form our solar system to a distant world. A small piece of tin protecting its inhabitants from the dangers of the void.\nBut the real danger is already inside the ship.\nWe've been to the past, to the present, and now we reach the future where the horrors that have been unlocked finally reach out to the stars.\nArchimedes 7 contains:\na map of the ship\n6 pre-generated characters\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nWant to See the Adventures?\nYou can!\nJohn Wick Presents published all three Acts previously.

It's a game of unspeakable Lovecraftian horror, kind of a Call of Cthulhu-heartbreaker.\nSince it was first published in Wicked Words Magazine, it's undergone a few changes (some thanks to podcaster/game designer Rob Justice). You'll see those updates and changes in Curse of the Yellow Sign. \nIn the game, your character sheet has two sides: a Sanity side and a Madness side. In order to deal with the eldritch horrors of the world, you trade traits from the Sanity side of your character sheet for the benefits of the Madness side.\nIf you'd like to see the original version of Unnamable (before the updates), go ahead and click here.

Just like a Lovecraftian narrator, we will slowly discover the truth behind the cursed pages. And as our progress grows, the dreaded horror will follow.\nFragments will be from different sources. Some will be in English, others in French, and a few... there's no telling where they came from. Mysteries abound.\nWhen collected together, we may get a glimpse of the vision that burned down a theater in Paris and caused the play to be banned in so many countries. We may piece together the truth behind the madness. We may complete something awful.\nAll pages will be written by John Wick and designed by Jessica Kauspedas (World of Dew, Blood & Honor, Wicked Fantasy, Play Dirty). Although, depending on how things go, we may get some guests involved\u2026 secret knowledge comes from strange sources.\nWe will release the Fragments as PDFs for all $10+ backers. If you\u2019re part of the project, you\u2019ll be exposed to the whole damned thing.\nThe Fragments\nUNLOCKED! The First Fragment ($3,177) - The Castaigne Fragment\nBurned pages from the 1895 Paris production reveal a story about a decadent court facing the end of the world, a collection of unnamed nobles flirting with the darkness. Is this the opening act? Scholars disagree on whether this addition is authentic or made by a clumsy con artist.\nUNLOCKED! The Second Fragment ($4,345) - The Castro Street Production\nIn 1972, an experimental San Francisco theater known for risque and difficult works attempted a production of the play. Pages discovered within the walls of the abandoned theater years later speak of a figure named Touissant who warns the court of an impending threat. What drew these Castro Street activists to these pages?\nUNLOCKED! The Third Fragment ($5,444) - The Unfilmable Pilot (by Rob Justice)\nIn the late 1980's, a major premium cable channel decided it wanted to expand it's lineup of original content with a horror anthology television series. One of the treatments was found so offensive that the executives ordered the script burned. What happened after that first commercial break? And whatever happened it the script's writer, Jack Scott?\nUNLOCKED! The Fourth Fragment ($6,525) - The Gintong Alay Project (by Tobie Abad)\nIn 1981, a tiny high school in the Philippines somehow got a hold of the play and attempted to localize it for a class production. Calling it Gintong Alay (Golden Offering), the production never finished its first staging. The subsequent tragedy leading to the gruesome suicides was then blacked out of any media coverage. Remnants of the research conducted by Rolando Gabriel and his documentary team have been found after their subsequent disappearance while investigating the said event.\nUNLOCKED! The Fifth Fragment ($7,662) - The Hollister/Carcosa Text\nMontclair, MN. Feb. 22, 1968: When investigators arrested Ralph Hollister under suspicion of a number of killings, they found a hidden room under his home. The word \"Carcosa\" was written on the door leading to the room and the tiny chamber was a place of absolute horror. Among the items recovered were thousands of pages in a barely legible scrawl. But a few of those pages were different. A different hand-writing, a different voice entirely...\nUNLOCKED! The Sixth Fragment ($8,433) - The Ladero Mass Grave (by Mark Diaz Truman)\nIn 2007, immigration officers find a mass grave on the US/Mexican border. The bodies appear to be both immigrants and members of a prominent drug cartel. Among the documents discovered is journal detailing the journey. Stuck in the middle of the journal are the pages of the play. What happened here? And why is a Mexican national carrying the pages of the play, buried alongside dozens of other bodies on the Mexican border?\nUNLOCKED! The Seventh Fragment ($9,238) - The Jacques Ferrand Fragment \nPages found in physician Jacques Ferrand's own personal journal in which he was compelled to record a patient's \"poetry\". The patient's identity is unclear but experts suspect her to be a young and immature Charlotte-Marie de Lorraine. The cast of characters is revealed through the young patient's madness, and the erotic tone is undeniably disturbing.\nUNLOCKED! The Eighth Fragment ($10, 253) - The Kaifeck Papers (by Benjamin Woerner)\nKaifeck, Germany: On the evening of Friday, March 31st, 1922 the six inhabitants of the Hinterkaifeck Farm, roughly 70km north of Munich, in Southern Germany, were murdered with a mattock. The farmer, Andreas Gruber, his wife Claudia, their widowed daughter Victoria, her two children Josef, Cazilia, and the maid Maria Baumgartner were all killed in the barn in a gruesome manner.\nIt wasn\u2019t until they discovered a series of pages from a play written in a stranger\u2019s hand, letters written by Victoria\u2019s husband, killed in the trenches of France after his supposed death, and a series of drawings in the childrens\u2019 room and in the barn that the true horror of Hinterkaifeck began to reveal itself.\nUNLOCKED! The Ninth Fragment ($11, 444) - Fallon's Ballet\nSergei Fallon's ballet, A Stranger in Carcosa, made its way to the stage despite many tragic setbacks. The production never made it to the stage but his notes reveal much about both the cursed play and his troubles.\nUNLOCKED! The Tenth Fragment ($12, 532) - A True and Accurate Account & Fragments of the King Paperback!\nIn 1544, Abraham Trask published his book, A True and Accurate Account of the Cursed Play, wherein the Author Views The Visitor to Carcosa and Those Whom Lay Claim of Witchcraft. While all copies of the book seemed destroyed when James I took the Crown of England, a few pages escaped the fire. These pages demonstrate the existence of a play strangely similar to The King in Yellow suggesting it pre-dates the presumed author.\nAlso...\nIf we hit this stretch goal, we unlock the Fragments of the King Ad On!

P. Lovecraft. This point-and-click adventure is a faithful and painstakingly researched adaptation of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward \u2014 a perennial favourite among hordes of fans and the only novel Lovecraft wrote in his lifetime \u2014 which happens to be the first of its kind in the video game industry. Join us as we tell you all about this groundbreaking project, the documentary The Shadow Over Providence hosted by S. T. Joshi, the inconceivably amazing rewards, and what may become a full series of officially sanctioned H. P. Lovecraft games. I\u00e4! I\u00e4!\n    The Case of Charles Dexter Ward invites you to explore mystery-laden Providence and uncover its enchanting secrets, research ancient history of witchcraft and occultism in shadow-blighted Salem, and sneak into an eerie Pawtuxet farm to meet unspeakable horrors lurking underneath in one of the most memorable sequences in Lovecraft\u2019s oeuvre. Take the role of both the inquisitive Charles Dexter Ward and Dr. Marinus Willett in a race against time to save Providence (and possibly humankind) from the evil warlock Joseph Curwen, who has made a pact with powerful forces of ineffable cosmic hideousness to exert his abhorrent influence across centuries.\nFrom visits to dusty libraries where awaits the hideous Necronomicon, through excursions to nightmarish cemeteries where time-worn bones tell of horrible past events, to sojourns in the old Salem-Village of crumbling gables and clustered gambrel roofs where wizards of yore still prowl, this is a blood-tingling project bound to stimulate the pineal glands of fans of adventure games and supernatural horror alike.\nAdventure games are the ideal medium to tell Lovecraft\u2019s stories. If you think about it, his protagonists rarely encounter their horrors \u2014 and whenever they do, the consequences are devastating \u2014 yet there are countless so-called Lovecraftian games where you must pit your strength against amorphous creatures or the mandatory slimy tentacles. And nothing wrong with that, but we\u2019re looking to do things differently this time: in Charles Dexter Ward there are no weapons, no enemies, no jumping, no running, and no dying. If you believe it\u2019s impossible to make a scary horror game without those features, then we encourage you to ask people who have played Scratches about the infamous boiler scene and why they\u2019re still clamouring for Agust\u00edn\u2019s head.\nIn Charles Dexter Ward we\u2019re going to focus strictly on story and mood. That is what we love about adventure games and Lovecraft, and we have no intention to compromise his powerful, brooding narrative for the sake of cheap scares. It feels like only yesterday that we first read the novel, and even brief passages such as the oneiric sunrises in Prospect Terrace will be forever embedded in our minds. Lovecraft\u2019s skilful pen transported us to a bygone time of witchcraft and unguessed horrors, magically interweaving historical facts and fiction, and we at Senscape are ready to do justice to this classic work.\nSpoiler alert: there are no tentacles in this game. None.\nFollowing repeated readings of the story over the past year, we have absorbed its mood, analysed its structure, and taken copious notes. Every aspect of the novel has been exhaustively researched, and we have the assistance and expertise of S. T. Joshi to ensure we get historical facts straight and bring Lovecraft\u2019s vision to video games as faithfully as possible. We even meticulously considered Lovecraft\u2019s entire output of fiction to understand how Charles Dexter Ward fits into that chronology and how certain aspects of his popular cosmology evolved over time. The game is already fully designed, and we know for a fact that you\u2019re going to love it. The best way to describe it is as the long-lost classic horror game by LucasArts.\nIt took years to bring this project to you \u2014 the realisation of a dream \u2014 and today we invite you to be part of it.\nCoupled with this Kickstarter is an ambitious production that is both a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of Charles Dexter Ward and a documentary on Lovecraft\u2019s life in Providence. Acclaimed scholar S. T. Joshi will be joining Agust\u00edn Cordes as they travel to Providence and scout the remaining locations that were key in Lovecraft\u2019s lifetime, including the John Hay Library, Moses Brown School, the \u201cactual\u201d home of the Ward family, and the queer building that inspired Curwen\u2019s old house in Olney Court. Time will stand still as we retrace Lovecraft\u2019s footsteps around his beloved home town and find the places and moments that inspired Charles Dexter Ward, with Mr. Joshi guiding us through the journey, revealing details about the fascinating persona of our favourite writer. Just as we intend to deliver the ultimate adaptation of his inimitable work, our plans for this rigorous and informative documentary are sure to satisfy even the most passionate Lovecraft aficionado.\nAnd you can join us too on this journey to uncover the immemorial secrets of Providence! Our top tier \u2014 Cthulhu \u2014 is your ticket to an unforgettable weekend with Mr. Joshi and Senscape while we film portions of this documentary. Of course, this project is not just about Lovecraft but you as well! Thus, all the travellers who embrace the repellent gelatinous mass of Cthulhu will be interviewed in the documentary as part of our efforts to establish why Lovecraft\u2019s work has influenced an illimitable legion of fans. The filming will take place early next year and we\u2019ll make sure to arrange for the date to suit everyone involved.\nDo you get the feeling we\u2019re dedicated enough to bring H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s legacy of unutterable terrors to the masses? Well, hold that thought, because we haven\u2019t even told you about our stretch goals yet!\nWe know you love stretch goals, but we have mixed feelings about them: our main goal is exactly what we need to produce the Charles Dexter Ward game of our dreams \u2014 no less and no more than what is required to fulfil our vision and bring you the ultimate adaptation of an H. P. Lovecraft story. We don\u2019t feel like \u201cartificially enhancing\u201d this vision by adding unneeded content or features to satisfy the tradition of stretch goals.\nBut we can do something else. Because this is already a Kickstarter campaign of Cyclopean (and non-Euclidean) proportions, our stretch goals will be suitably ambitious and bold \u2014 what if we told you we can secure licenses to adapt at least two more Lovecraft stories, provided that we meet the budget? This is the full scale of our dream, and the Kickstarter community has proven that virtually nothing is impossible:\nOur crazy dream.\nSo which other Lovecraft stories do you think would make great games? Can you guess our picks?\nIt\u2019s no secret that we at Senscape love horror. We really do.\nOur games.\nScratches, released in 2006, went on to become a cult title among fans of adventures and remains hailed as one of the best Lovecraftian games, especially when it comes to its haunting conclusion that compelled players to theorise about the multilayered mystery for months. Serena, released to critical acclaim earlier this year and developed together with colleagues and fans, had a similar effect. This short adventure proved a surprise hit on Steam, fascinating countless players with its bittersweet mystery reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s tales. And we\u2019re still working on Asylum, which was successfully Kickstarted last year and is in the final stages of production (we promise, it\u2019s really coming!). Asylum is the spiritual successor to Scratches, a dedicated work of passion that will have taken five long years of our lives and is poised to become a cutting-edge adventure game with its stunning visual effects and atmosphere \u2014 not to mention a disturbing storyline that is Lovecraftian through and through and promises lots of sleepless nights.\nSome of the crazy folks working at Senscape.\nSharp observers may have realised that the body of our work comprises first-person adventures, but the truth is we love all kinds [Edit by Agust\u00edn: except Myst]. We believe the third-person perspective is ideal for Charles Dexter Ward, which is a more character-driven story than our previous efforts. And it turns out we have plenty of experience with the format, having worked on Federal Cases: Risk Profile, a huge educational adventure created for the government of Argentina and released in 2008. Distributed throughout hundreds of schools and acclaimed by thousands of players, the game remains one of the largest productions in the country\u2019s history.\nRisk Profile, the third-person adventure we developed.\nIf you\u2019re as enthusiastic about H. P. Lovecraft as we are, then you\u2019re probably disappointed in how poorly his writings have been translated to other media. Most movie adaptations leave a lot to be desired, and games have only tangentially assimilated the full cosmic horror of his work. We want to change that, and so devoted are we to his legacy that we have restlessly pursued the rights to officially adapt his stories. This is an opportunity we can\u2019t let pass.\nIn addition, part of our team is concluding work on the graphics for Asylum and is ready to move on to a new project. Many Kickstarted projects tend to outsource their development, but we prefer to work together because that\u2019s the best approach for our games. It\u2019s the teamwork and affinity achieved in a daily office setting that allows us to bring a unique quality to our projects and fulfil our vision. However, guaranteeing the continuity of a stable team across projects is one of the most critical problems in the game industry, especially when the games being made are rich in content and length. Thus, it makes a great deal of sense for us at Senscape to overlap the production of two games and avoid letting part of our talented team go. The budget we requested in last year\u2019s campaign was strictly meant to complete Asylum, so there would be no point in maintaining artists on staff if we couldn\u2019t start work on a new game. Unfortunately we need money for that, which is why we\u2019re launching this Kickstarter to secure funds for Charles Dexter Ward.\nIt\u2019s very important to point out that production on this game will start upon successful conclusion of this campaign and won\u2019t be tied to the progress of Asylum. Should we surpass our goal and secure funds for additional H. P. Lovecraft games, then we are ready to expand the Senscape family as needed to keep weaving captivating stories and conjuring debarred visions of creeping nightmares.\nThe sheer awesomeness of our rewards cannot possibly be comprehended by feeble human minds, but we\u2019re going to try and describe them. For our boxed edition of the game, we\u2019re taking the approach that was so well received with the Asylum campaign: with the wonderful Infocom packaging of yesteryear as our inspiration, the box will be the perfect size and shape to feature on your shelf. It will contain physical goodies such as a Moses Brown School ID card with your name on it, a vintage postcard from Providence, and more to be confirmed! This item also includes the abridged version of the Necronomicon, a booklet that\u2019s part art book, part game manual:\nOur Infocom-style box with booklet attached.\nThe hardcover edition of the Necronomicon, though, is another story. This lavishly designed collector\u2019s item is going to be expanded with developer\u2019s notes and even more artwork, and will feature pages of the \u201cactual\u201d Necronomicon as described in Lovecraft\u2019s stories.\nDisclaimer: we\u2019re legally required to state that the Necronomicon is a fictitious book. Seriously.\nAnd there\u2019s so much more! A lovely T-shirt, a soundtrack reminiscent of vintage Hammer horror movies, a Blu-ray edition of the documentary The Shadow Over Providence, and what proved to be a very popular reward with the Asylum campaign: in-game presence! Become a renowned citizen of Providence, a student in Moses Brown School, a book author in John Hay Library, or a nefarious wizard or witch in Salem-Village.

P. Lovecraft\u2019s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and (who knows!) maybe even more adaptations. We love hearing from you, so make sure to follow us on your social network of choice. We also invite you to join our ever-growing community of adventure game and horror fans in our forums.\nWe would like to extend our thanks for the invaluable assistance of Phoenix Online Studios with the creation of this Kickstarter campaign, especially to Weldon Hathaway who co\u00f6rdinates administrative tasks in the United States. Huge thanks as well to Simo Sakari Aaltonen for his masterful revision of all texts related to this campaign, Eriq Chang for his remarkable take on the game logo, Alessandra Bertoldi for her formidable Latin expertise, Serena Nelson for being awesome and charming as usual, Melissa Kell for filming Mr. Joshi in Seattle, Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez for the careful production of our main video, Daniel Vierna for further proofreading, and Alina Graziani for coping with Agust\u00edn\u2019s insanity.\nAnd of course, thank YOU, our awesome and supportive backers, for being part of our crazy dreams. For you we would ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the night-wind, descend to meet the noxious nightmarish terrors crawling in the catacombs of Nephren-Ka, surrender to the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth\u2019s will, and lose our minds in the nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity.

Yet game development is not an exact science. No project is immune to risks or delays, as seen with our own Asylum. We are aware of this and have maintained a strong, constant dialogue with our backers. Our updates are unanimously well received because they are informative and fun, and backers understand that we\u2019re putting everything we\u2019ve got into creating games that will be remembered for aeons to come.\n\nWe understand backers may be concerned about the possibility of eventual delays with The Case of Charles Dexter Ward as well; however, these games differ greatly in scope and style. Whereas Asylum is huge and lets the player explore an extremely detailed virtual asylum at leisure in first person, Charles Dexter Ward is a more focused and traditional third-person adventure. They complement each other in style and mood but are strongly linked by H. P. Lovecraft and our past experiences with Scratches and Serena.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of Charles Dexter Ward is to ensure a faithful and strong adaptation of Lovecraft\u2019s beloved work, as well as the unique atmosphere he strove to achieve. We are more than ready to deliver in both regards, as attested by our past and current games, as well as the tremendous assistance and insight provided by S. T. Joshi. Potential delays are always a risk but we have learned a lot; thanks to the extraordinary support we received for Asylum, we are now a larger team working together in a physical office. We are as organised and focused as ever, and with your help we can start a thrilling new chapter for our company.\n\nWhen you support us, you become part of our team \u2014 part of Senscape.

The first book in this series \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant with Death,\u201d is a sourcebook and scenario anthology set during the Great War, 1914-1918. We are launching this Kickstarter to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War on August 1st, 2014.\nFor the past seven years John H. Crowe and I have been designing and running Call of Cthulhu scenarios set during the Great War. You may have heard some of mine recorded as actual play podcasts over at Role-Playing Public Radio. Now we\u2019re ready to begin releasing, what we expect will be, several Horrors of War volumes focused on the Great War. Later volumes of Horrors of War will focus on other conflicts in other times.\nThis first book, \u201cA Covenant With Death,\u201d will be a generalist book on the Great War and will include 8 scenarios, sourcebook material on the weapons and gear of the Great War, Air-combat rules, rules for creating both professional and citizen soldiers, and a Great War timeline, glossary and an extensive bibliography. All eight scenarios use the 6th Edition rules for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu role playing game.\nThe book will be produced as an 8.5\" x 11\" softcover, with glossy color exteriors and grisly grayscale interior artwork. Right now the edited material tops out at just about 200,000 words. While the scenarios are written and playt ested, Horrors of War still needs to be laid out, illustrated, proofed and printed. The money we raise here will go towards commissioning art, paying layout artists, and, finally, printing and shipping the book to our backers.\nOur intention is to release \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant with Death\u201d by February of 2015. In the interim, we will be releasing, exclusively to our backers, a PDF sneak peak of \u201cHorrors of War\u201d in the form of \u201cDeath From Above.\u201d This fully illustrated and laid out PDF document will include a scenario set aboard a zeppelin, another scenario set aboard a bi-wing bomber, air combat rules and aircraft templates. \u201cDeath from Above\u201d will be made available to our backers by December 24, 2014, just in time for the Centennial of the 1914 Christmas Truce on the Western Front.\nWe\u2019ve tried to ensure that the players can represent every nationality involved in the Great War. We have scenarios where they can play British, Belgian, French, German, Russian, American, Italian, Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak, Portuguese and Serbian characters, with Romanian, Bulgarian and Turkish options in the works. Most of those will be represented in the first book, \u201cA Covenant with Death.\u201d\nCheck out our rewards and our stretch goals. And keep checking back. There may be additions made over time.\nAs mentioned earlier, you can check out the Great War Call of Cthulhu games I recorded with the folks from Role Playing Public Radio at the following URLs. Click here for \"Dig to Victory.\" Click here for \"Uboote Heraus part 1\" and here for \"Uboote Heraus part 2.\" Here for \"The Night Mission.\" Here for \"Shadows of Leuven.\" Here for \"The Iron Devil.\" And here for \"The Lord of the Peaks.\" Not all these scenarios will appear in \u201cA Covenant with Death,\u201d but feel free to chime in and let us know which ones you\u2019d most like to see. And do keep in mind that these are playtests. The final products may be quite different.\nWe also have three stretch goals!\nRight now we have three stretch goals\n$18,000.00:Every print copy of the books gets a two-page, fold-out diagram of the L-58 Zeppelin for the scenario \u201cThe Last Flight of the L-58.\u201d\nThis first goal has been met! The final product will include the fold-out diagram of the L-58 zeppelin!

That's two complete scenarios free to everyone who bought in at least at the $20.00 PDF edition level.\nThis second goal has been met! Everyone who pledged at least at the $20.00 PDF edition level will receive sneak previews of two scenarios that will appear in future volumes of Horrors of War.\n$32,000.00:The second volume of Horrors of War for FREE! If we reach $32,000, then everyone who pledged at the softcover print edition level ($45.00 for domestic backers and $60.00 for foreign backers) will receive the print edition of the second volume of Horrors of War for free, including shipping.

You'll get your PDF edition of the second volume of Horrors of War for free too.\nI can\u2019t give an exact release date at this time, but if we raise $32K then we should be able to get it out before the end of 2015.\nThank you again, and I look forward to delivering to you \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant With Death,\u201d the first installment of our Horrors of War series.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as risks go, there aren't many.

We've melded the best features we loved from these games and added our own ideas to create a unique but familiar experience.\nEpic Story, Deep Mythos & New Mysterious World \u2013 The epic story of Graywalkers spans more than 2000 years of background history, providing a deep and rich world, flavored with new takes on old legends, and mysteries waiting to be discovered.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 We wanted to create a game where the player's decisions and actions have the ability to change and affect the world in profound ways.\nCommunity Interaction \u2013 One of the reasons for us being here on Kickstarter is to build a community behind this game. We want them to be a part of the development of this game as much as is reasonably possible. Part of this is our Crowd Content initiative where we will be willing to accept Content for the game as donations such as 3D models, animation, 2D art, Music, Sound, Effects and others.\nPre-Alpha Prototype V1 Real Time Movement Screenshot\nAnother team of Graywalkers\nGame Type \u2013 It is a 3D 3rd person role-playing game with strategic and tactical elements. You can toggle between Isometric and Perspective views.\nGame Modes \u2013 There are 2 Game Modes; Campaign is the single-player epic storyline, Freeform is a single player experience where everything is procedurally generated and your measure for success is affected by influence, resources and power. \nDistribution \u2013 We are planning on distributing on as many digital platforms as we can get on, including Steam, and hopefully GOG, Desura and others. Steam Keys will be available.\nCurrent State \u2013 The game is in the Pre-Alpha stage and we currently have a combat demo. If successful, we aim to release the game in 18 months. We do plan to release an early access version when we have a solid playable full alpha version.\nLanguages -  The base game will be in English but will also be localized to Russian, German, French, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese. This localization does not include voice overs.\nPlatforms - The game will be created primarily for the PC (Windows, Mac and Linux). Additional platforms may be added depending on stretch goals. Potential platforms where we will port the game are PS4, PS Vita, XBox One, Wii U, Ouya and High-end Tablets (iOS & Android)\nBuilt Primarily for PC (WIndows, Mac, LInux)\n  Pre-Alpha Prototype Real Time Movement Screenshot\n STRETCH GOALS\nThe game will have an expansive list of exciting features:\nWIP 3D Model Sample to be used in the actual game\n  Custom Hero \u2013 Your player character is a special one, even among Graywalkers. He is your fully customizable avatar in the world, where you can choose his or her gender, race, appearance, path, skills and special abilities. Lastly, you choose how he will save the world.\nRaces \u2013 You can be Human or one of the Hybrids, like the Cambion, Nephilim, Dhampir. Additional possible races are the Wolfkin, Faechilde and the Hunterborne\nRecruitment \u2013 Find, convince and recruit your Graywalker team members from a pool of at least 40+ playable NPCs, each with their own style, personality, motivation, relationships and history.\nLevels & Experience \u2013 Gain experience points through missions and improve your characters skills and abilities each time you level up.\nStrategic Management \u2013 Manage your resources, personnel, influence, technology, research, crafting and scavenging. \nExploration \u2013 Explore a country sized island with different regions, each filled with interesting locations to visit, scavenge in, influence and control.\nResources \u2013 Scavenge for resources, rebuild lost technology, recover ancient relics of power, and research entirely new technologies that fuse the powers of ancient magic and known science.\nCharacter Paths \u2013 \"Paths\" are the equivalent to classes in typical RPGs. Choose a path to take such as the magic-wielding Arcanist, the weapon master Armsmen, the stealthy Agents, the spiritually blessed Diviners, the firearms expert Soldiers, the hand-to-hand specialist Martialist, the perceptive Scouts, the versatile Adventurers, the intelligent Techs, and the dangerous Slayers.\nEnemies \u2013 Encounter many kinds of enemies such as zealot cultists, rival gangs, dangerous criminals, demons, fallen angels, feral vampires, rabid werewolves, zombies, ghosts, witches and other supernatural creatures of legend.\nCombat Choices \u2013 When in combat, you can choose the quick and easy Strategic Combat or the down and dirty Turn-based Tactical Combat.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes.\nSpecial Abilities \u2013 Each character has a list of special abilities which are dependent on his Race, Path and Style.\nIn addition to the core features, there are several features which may make the game stand out\nWyldekarde RPG System \u2013 The game will utilize a simpler version of the upcoming generic table top rpg system.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 What you do and don\u2019t do will affect the world and have consequences which will change it as well. This is common in strategy games but is rare among tactical turn-based games.\nProcedural World \u2013 The game will rely on procedural content for the Campaign but most heavily in the Freeform mode of play.\nCrowd Content \u2013 This initiative will allow people to share their talents to the game by contributing content such as 3d Models, 2d Art, music, sound effects, animations and others. \nThere will be a special rewards structure for crowd content which we will reveal more after the campaign is successful.\nPre-Alpha Strategic Map \"Regionscape\"\nRegionscape \u2013 This is the view where many of the strategic decisions are made from. It is an overhead map showing you where you and your teams are on the map. From here, you can control where your teams go, manage time movement, view strategic information and sometimes even see enemy movement.\nAreascape \u2013 This is the 3d map where your characters can move in real time either individually or as a group. \nStrategic Management \u2013 When not fighting, you need to coordinate your teams, gather and manage resources, negotiate with the various factions, and spread your influence. Ultimately, you need to gather enough forces to drive the demonic invaders out of the land. But how you do that is up to you. For example: Do you side with the disreputable crime lords of Lost Vegas? Or the well-equipped but bigoted human supremacists?\nFactions \u2013 Like in a 4x Strategy Game, each faction in Graywalkers has its own agenda to pursue, with or without the player\u2019s help. They decide on their own, and depending on the circumstances, may engage in war against each other. You will find the faction\u2019s territorial lines moving back and forth, as each wrestles for control of valuable commodities. How you interact with them will determine your Influence Factor with these factions.\nMissions \u2013 There are many kinds of missions to engage in. Some will push the story forward, some will convince recruits to join you, some will improve your relationship with a faction.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nPre-Alpha Strategic Map with Astral Rain ongoing\nCombatscape \u2013 The combat map or what we call Combatscape uses a square grid 3d map which you can rotate freely to see all sides of the action. This map looks similar to the Areascape except that movement is limited to the grid and by turns. \nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes.\nAction Points \u2013 The combat system uses Action Points. A character can perform several actions in one turn, as long as he has enough Action Points to spend. This is in contrast with other tactics games that allow a character to perform only one move action and one attack action per turn. This grants a greater depth of tactics, allowing the player to perform more elaborate and concerted attacks on the enemy. \nPersonalities \u2013 Character personalities play a big role in combat and may influence how they interpret your commands. Discover who works best with who because some Graywalkers don't see eye-to-eye with each other. If characters in your team hate each other, make sure to keep them separated when fighting or you may just find one of them hitting your teammate \"by accident\"!\nMusic and sound is one of the most important things in a game. We've been lucky enough that we've partnered up with a great sound studio called Otherworld Agency based out of Australia.

They came to be known as Graywalkers, and you are to be the greatest of them. \nMost of the previous Graywalkers were gone. The apocalypse came to pass and the whole human race is at the brink of extinction. It is up to you now to forge a new generation of Graywalkers and turn the tides of the war against the evil that has taken root in the world.\n There are many dangers and enemies on Purgatory that you may encounter such as Demons, Devils, Rogue Angels, Rabid Werewolves, Feral Vampires, Zombies, Gangers, Mobsters, Cultists, Bandits, Mercenaries, Monsters and more. \nOrcus\nPurgatory was forged during the cataclysmic event called the Rupture. It merged parts of Heaven and Hell with our world. The result is, the locations where these parts appeared mystically displaced what was there before to different corners of the world. Many of these displaced lands were \u201ccaught\u201d by the area known as the Bermuda Triangle and this new land mass was formed. \n20 Years later, Purgatory and its people have survived and thrived. They have been protected from most of what happened to the rest of the world and were hidden by the same energies that protected the Triangle the way it always has. Unfortunately, Purgatory has finally been discovered and denizens of Hell are slowly moving into it. \nThe status quo on Purgatory is slowly changing and you will now decide the course of what will happen for its future. This place is where your adventures and legend begins.\n Though there are many locations on Purgatory to visit and discover, there are several key locations that every neophyte Graywalker should know.\n With the Rupture, mystical energies flooded back into earth bringing back magic in all its glory.

Though we did decently during that time, we still didn't make our target. Since then, many things have happened and our reason for being here has slightly changed. \nWe're currently on Kickstarter for several reasons: \nThe first is we want to build a community and following that will allow us to know what they want exactly in what we are building for them.\nNext is though we're currently funding development of our game, we know we need more funds to get this done quickly while maintaining quality. Because of this, we are in talks with several investors and the amount that they will put in will be dependent on how much support we get from the fans to prove how viable this project is. The more money we make here on Kickstarter, the stronger our position in getting more investment funding.  \nThough we are no longer fully dependent on the KS to ensure that the game will be made, the funds will help speed development and allow us to build the game the way we originally planned it. \nYou may also donate more to get more add-ons to supplement your reward tier.

Where every single level is completely randomized and totally unique every game.  A game where you never feel in control without being frustratingly unfair.\nThe crux of horror games is the unknown, never being able to rely on your previous experiences. Welcome to the world of Phantasmal, a procedurally generated game that will feel like a new experience every single time!\n      http://bit.ly/Y6Lbyx\nWe are all old-school gamers, and some of our fondest memories of horror games are the classics like the original Silent Hill and Dead Space games.  The player always had the option of fighting, but they would need to weigh up the consequences of doing so, e.g. would they be badly injured after doing so, or would they deplete too much ammo to be able to survive later encounters?  This balancing act combined with the creepy setting always created a wonderful feeling of dread and tension. \nOne problem with many of our favorite horror games was that we would only experience peak fear the first time we played through.  Subsequent playthroughs would inevitably be far less scary (sometimes not at all) because we would know where the scares would be coming from.  Even during the first playthrough, with many horror games the player would figure out patterns of where the jump-scares would come from, which would also lessen the fear factor.\nWhat we want to do essentially is to balance giving the feeling to the player that they are never in control without making the game unfair. The procedural level generation isn't just a convenient means of generating levels, it is the very backbone of maximizing the fear and dread.\nOur dream is to eventually create a game which is completely unpredictable - where the environment, creatures, items and weapons are randomized, yet at the same time tailored to the player's specific fears so they can never predict what they will be facing every game and every level.\nIt's an ambitious goal, but we have already partially achieved this with our procedurally generated levels built on a component level rather than the traditional room by room template basis.\nThe Binding of Issac (another roguelike game) captures the essence of randomized gaming, and fear through uncertainty - it has been a great source of inspiration for us.\nFor the time being for this kickstarter, our primary objective is to complete the current work-in-progress demo and flesh it out into a full game.\n  Infinite Replayability - Every room and corridor in the building is created from the ground up on a component basis, i.e. the floors, ceilings, walls, stairs, etc. No level will EVER be constructed the same - almost every room and hallway will be COMPLETELY unique.\nInsanity system - fighting the creatures will slowly drive you mad, and you will suffer the effects of your slowly eroding sanity. \nSelf Defense - Defend your life with anything you can find from wooden boards and pipes you rip from the walls. If you're lucky you may find a gun locker, but on each level there will only be one!\nStealth - Fighting is a last resort tactic. Sneak past your enemies as much as you can.  Each action you take will have a consequence and creating too much of a ruckus will wake The Sleeper.\nLight - Make sure you use your light sources wisely - your own torch will sometimes be your greatest liability.\nCharacter Progression - Death is not the end. You will accumulate XP every playthrough which will allow you to grow your character and come back stronger.\nYou play as John Hope, a veteran of the Vietnam War, who suffers from extreme Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \nDuring one mission you witness a horrific napalm attack on innocent villagers. You try to help them, but it is no use. The sight of women and children burning alive, unable to quench the flames slowly burning the life from their bodies etches itself into your mind. Soon after returning to base you experience a severe emotional breakdown, and you are sent home.\nAfter a time, you finally recover, although you still suffer from severe night terrors and severe relapses of PTSD. You drink, you haven\u2019t been able to keep a steady job, your wife left you and took your kids away. Down on your luck, an old army buddy does you a favor by offering you a job as a night shift janitor at a local university.  You have few skills outside of the military, and you\u2019d rather not be around other people for the time being.\nFor a time, things work out well.  You enjoy your solitude, and simply keeping yourself busy.\nUnfortunately one night at work a storm suddenly sweeps in.  A tree is blown over, severing a power cable, and the university is plunged into darkness.  Ominously you begin to hear voices in the darkness even though you should be the only one at the university. You decide to investigate...\nWe're hoping to infuse a strong Lovecraftian sense of dread to our game. Cthulhu has been and always will be a massive influence!\nAs an indie project, we can't complete this game without you.  We value all your input, and we want to keep you involved throughout the development process.  As such, we will be conducting regular polls and gathering general feedback which will influence the final game.\nIf our first milestone is achieved, then we will aim to complete the game including beta testing before the end of March 2015.

Your choices each become part of the myth, joining your tribe's pantheon of heroes. How will you be remembered by your tribe in generations to come?\nMoon Hunters is a 1-4 player action RPG with a rich, ancient world that's different every time you play. Build your mythology as you play, solo or with friends, every action and choice contributing to your legend.  \n  An ancient, occult world: the gods and their creations yet walk among us, and our prayers do not always go unanswered, for better or for worse. \nLocal co-op like never before: playing alone is fully supported. But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews.

So we decided we would create our own, paying homage to some of our favorite titles while innovating and adding some of our own spinto the genre.\nFor the past year we have primarily focused on designing and delivering an engrossing PC version of Fallen: A2P Protocol. \nWith your help and support, we will not only accomplish that goal, but through stretch goals we hope to deliver a much larger, much more beautiful, immersive and rich experience, including on other platforms \u2013 Mac, Linux, Tablets, and ultimately on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nPlease take a look at some screenshots from our Pre-Alpha Prototype...\nFallen: A2P Protocol takes place in the near future in a drastically altered world. Seeking to fuel continuous expansion and quench a thirst for Human mastery over their domain, a new source of energy was required. \nIn 2125, corporate giant GENKORP unveiled A2P, a newly discovered energy source, more powerful than anything previous created by man. While touted as completely safe and environmentally friendly, there were those who foresaw the danger of A2P and opposed its harvest from the beginning. This opposition organized ARKANE, a rebel group bent on stopping GENKORP's plans to develop A2P.\n\nPLAY\n\nGENKORP quickly branded ARKANE as a terrorist faction and an enemy of all good and upstanding citizens of the world. In control of such a powerful life-giving (and taking) source of energy, GENKORP develop into a massive private military complex, holding the key to life on earth as we know it.\nBut very quickly A2P\u2019s dark side manifested itself. Earth\u2019s weather was altered forever, with \u201cnatural\u201d disasters ravaging our planet, reshaping it and turning much of the world into what is now simply known as \u201cThe Dust\u201d.\nFierce endless fighting persists between GENKORP and ARKANE. Meanwhile, those that have not aligned with either faction are branded as bandits and outlaws. Loyal to neither GENKORP or ARKANE, they fight for their survival, etching a difficult existence in \u201cThe Dust\u201d.\nAlready having invested significantly into the creation of Fallen: A2P Protocol, we seek your support to complete the game with all the features, graphics, gameplay and details expected of a high quality self-published title.\nMost importantly, we seek to create a relationship with you, our backers, to help us make key decisions, prioritize some of the features so that we can make a game truly created for and by the fans.\n\nWe are asking only $75,000 (USD) as our initial goal because we have invested our own money and time for a year to design, iterate through concepts, create key art and develop an early alpha stage version of the game. \n\nHowever, with the community\u2019s support we\u2019ll be able to ship the game even sooner and with your involvement the game will get even better.\n\nWhile the initial goal will get us to early access, your support for our stretch goals will fund many advanced features and enable us to deliver the game on additional platforms, fully localized in key languages and offer a much deeper feature set, additional content and enhanced graphics.\n\nWhether through your generous support, your collaborative feedback or through sharing Fallen: A2P Protocol\u2019s Kickstarter campaign with your friends and peers, we are grateful, and cannot do it without you. \n\nWe are committed to a fully collaborative development process, partnering with you to create the most fun to play game, prioritizing those features most important to you. \nWe are not looking to reinvent the genre, but rather to offer players a great, contemporary take, adding a few unique twists to gameplay and presentation to build on the rich lore of amazing games.\nIn the process of development we iterate a lot, change priorities along the way, make important decisions, brainstorming meetings, etc.\nWe will ask you to take part as much as you want in the process of developing the game by providing feedback, getting first early glimpses at features and voting for priorities. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll do the heavy lifting and make sure we stay on track. But if you would like, you are very much invited to help us craft the game you always wanted to play.\nFallen: A2P Protocol gameplay is both strategic and tactical.\nAs a turn based tactical combat game, Fallen: A2P Protocol has a deep choice of actions that can be performed each turn. Each mission will have different challenges to overcome, and random events will occur that force you to change your tactics if you want to survive.\n\nResources are always scarce, so you must use the environment to your advantage. But the environment can change and be your ally or a deadly, indiscriminate enemy. Quick adaptation to unstable weather may be required, as fluctuations affect gameplay, reduce movement, hamper accurate aiming and even cause damage.\nAmmo will be limited, so use it wisely if you don\u00b4t want to end up throwing rocks and knives at your opponent... unless that\u00b4s the way you choose to play.\nOn the strategic side of the game, you will have to drive and manage your caravan through this devastated world, constantly searching for supplies, upgrade weapons and armor and make other key decisions about how to tackle your next mission.\nKey Features\nWould-be survivors must master strategic planning and employ a wide range of turn-based tactical combat factors, including destructible environments and limited ammunition\nA vast and inhospitable world, complete with hostile weather and vision-impairing day-night cycles, requires careful exploration to recruit allies and gather scarce resources\nCharacter progression and customization, as well as armor and weapon upgrades, showcase player-focused RPG elements and offer a high replay value\nA dark, dystopian lore provides a rich backstory to create a world in which the player\u2019s actions have lasting impact, with the fate of humanity determined by their personal choices and combat capabilities\nWe started crafting the game long time ago and wanted to share with you some early inspirationals...\nWe share with you some of the concept artwork we created for Fallen: A2P Protocol. Much of this we have already translated into in-game content. But we have a ton of additional concepts that, with your support, will create an amazing amount of additional game content. We will also include this artwork in our art book, which is offered as a backer reward.\n\nWe've put a lot of thought into crafting cool rewards for each backer tier, so please take a look and let us know if you like what you see.\nKeep in mind that by adding $10 USD to any tier (starting at $15) you can get an additional digital copy of the game. For example, if you pledge $50 and want two more copies of the game, just throw in an additional $20.\nAlso, if you support us, please share and spread the word through social media and among your friends and fellow gamers. The more backers we can have, the better the game will turn out for all of us.\nWe have big plans for making this game be the best it can be.\nSince this is to be a collaborative project, we\u2019re unveiling the initial stretch goals. As those are reached, we will involve you in determining which of our planned options you most would like to see, and will make those available.\nRed Katana is a small but experienced developer from Argentina.

It is a singular community driven experience unlike any other. Players take the roles of brave Heroes and devious Masters battling it out against each other for Gold and Glory as the world around them evolves and grows. Don't just play the game. Master it! \nGame Master is not just a single tabletop game with a single goal. Tons of unique tables with their own game boards spanning across multiple themes will be available to the players. Each one has numerous goals and ways to achieve them all by using game pieces from the vast Game Master collection. Building your own boards is not just easy and intuitive, but is a core part of the Game Master experience with real gameplay rewards for ingenious game masters.\nAny fan of table-top gaming will tell you that the hardest part of his hobby is organizing a game session. Keeping track of all the dice, miniatures, tons of boxes and stacks of rulebooks. And the hardest of all - getting everyone together at the same time, setting up the table and cleaning up afterwards. All of this has nothing to do with actual gameplay and can consume a lot of your time and money.\nGame Master streamlines this particular aspect of table-top adventures and evolves the whole concept by bringing it into the digital age. Setting up the board of your dreams is just a few taps away. Gather up to 4 friends around a single device or go online and find others to play with. Share your creations with the Game Master community, earn stacks of gold and become the ultimate Game Master!\nGenuine Tabletop feel - all the things you love about tabletop gaming without any of the extra work and expenses.\nCreativity and customization - endless ways to make every experience unique and custom-tailored for the player.\nOnline community - fully gameplay-integrated and lots of social features without disrupting your Facebook, Twitter etc.\nTabletop Multiverse - our gamepieces not only span multiple genres but are all interchangeable and fit together like legos.\nGame Master Toolbox - easy and intuitive to understand but deep enough to allow fully-fledged adventure creation for the truly dedicated.\nTurn based gameplay - action packed combat and puzzle solving in a unified turn-based system.\nEpic pre-built campaigns - tons of replayability, quests and endings for all pre-built adventure sets available for offline play.\nSingle Device Co-op - up to 4 players can go adventuring together on a single device.\nMultiplayer modes - ad-hoc or online, Game Master will let you play with your friends or find new ones easy and stress-free.\nRunic Dice - our unique Runic Dice System will make any dice roll exciting and customizable.\nSmart matchmaking and leaderboards - you will always be able to find other player of the exact skill and experience level that suits you.\nEasy to learn, fun to master! - highly intuitive gameplay for the whole family.\nOne of our proudest features is the Game Master\u2019s toolbox. A lot of games have level editors but not a lot of them are used. We have devised a two-fold solution to this. First of all, our toolbox is intuitive and easy to use. If you\u2019ve ever played with legos, chances are you will feel right at home being a Game Master. Second of all, using the toolbox is directly tied to the core gameplay as all of your creations will earn you more gold and unlock more content!\nAs soon as you start placing tiles simply by dragging and dropping, the world will come alive immediately on your screen. No programming or scripting will be necessary as a lot of tiles have automatic unique effects that can be turned on or off by a simple tap.\nPeople of all ages will be able to use our toolbox without a hitch, but of course those who want to delve deeper will have that opportunity with extra advanced features that will actually let you tell stories and create truly unique content.\nWe know that eternal gratitude is not enough to feed the brave flaming hearts of our heroic backers. Praise the gods, we came prepared with a ton of rewards to those who pledge to our tabletop banner.\nClick on the image to ZOOM!\nMost of the rewards above will be available exclusively to our backers and will not be obtainable after the project is funded.\nWe are especially proud of our forthcoming adventure sets that come in huge digital game boxes each packing a collection of boards interlinked by gameplay and story. Opening an adventure set will get you exclusive miniatures, gamepieces, dice, paints and all kinds of awesome stuff. Everything inside the box can be taken apart and used in any other gameplay sessions as Heroes or Masters.\nStretch the Goals!\n\nClick on the image to ZOOM!\nHow do I play it?\nGame Master caters to a multitude of play styles and difficulty levels while keeping everything interconnected. The two main styles are Hero and Master.\nAs a Hero you can take on an endless supply of quests and visit a variety of magical worlds, distant planets and curious dimensions. Go alone or take your friends and family with you. Up to 4 players can play on a game board at the same time, all on the same device! Gameplay is turn-based and all actions are resolved as they would be in a tabletop game with cards, dice and smart decisions. You earn gold by completing a board. Gold allows you to upgrade your miniatures with skill cards, paintjobs, dice roll modifiers or get new exciting heroes to join your cause. More and more dangerous and rewarding boards become manageable as your party of heroes becomes truly legendary.\nAs a Master you are able to create your own adventures from thousands of different game pieces. And the coolest part about it is - it actually earns you gold! Hapless adventurers who fail to outwit your devious traps are your prey.\nThe rewards for captured heroes are directly tied to how powerful those heroes were. But be careful! After completing your game board, players will be able to rate it. Make it hard, but make it worth it! Popular game boards will make you more gold than any hero can ever imagine. Mix and match all the worlds and game pieces to create your own unique world!\nWhenever you want a challenge or to sit down for a casual play session with your family - the world of Game Master is the place to go. Multiple difficulty levels, Glory and Gold based leaderboards, smart matchmaking and our own pre-built adventures allow everyone to have as much fun as they want. Playing is easy to learn and rewarding to master, while creating your own game boards is as easy as playing with toy blocks but allows for a wealth of creativity and possibilities.\nEndless gameplay opportunities\nGame Master is to tabletop games, what Minecraft was to first-person adventures. We welcome creativity and provide everything to help our players along. Game pieces interact with each other in many ways, making each adventure exciting and fresh for both Players and Masters. You get extra gold for all quest-items that went unused at the end of playing through a game board. Create your own challenges and find creative ways of completing a board using your wits and character abilities and you will be handsomely rewarded.\nTabletop Game Multiverse\nWhat is a Tabletop Game Multiverse exactly?\nImagine a table set up for a game with a bunch of people playing on it. Now imagine there are thousands of tables all having individual games but all in the same virtual room, using game pieces from the same set.You can come up to any of these tables with your own painted miniatures and participate in any adventure! You can build your own tables and invite people over. Whatever you do, everything works and fits together. Some tables host fantasy themed dungeons and quests, others take place inside spaceships or steampunk cities, while a select few host crazy cross-over adventures using pieces from all of the sets. People of all ages and gamer experience are welcome in this virtual room and will find a corner to call home.\nA tabletop game come to life\nOur goal is to recreate the feel of pen and paper adventures and tabletop games as closely as possible while evolving the concept for the new age. Everything in Game Master is like a real table inside a touch screen device of your choice.\nDigital Shadow Box for your Miniatures\nAs a player you collect hero miniatures, skill cards, dice, world tiles, enemy figurines, traps and all the amazing little bits and pieces that make tabletop games fun. Actions are resolved as they would be in a tabletop game with cards, tokens and all kinds of dice.\nThe game is turn-based and allows you to take it in at your own pace, carefully planning your every move. You can even paint your miniatures and game pieces any way you want, making the experience even more unique and customized for each player. Offline gameplay for up to 4 players on a single device is also instrumental to capture the fun and excitement of gathering around a table with your friends.\nA world of infinite possibilities\nFantasy, sci-fi and steampunk themed boards and game piece collections are just the beginning of the ever expanding tapestry of Game Master. Thankfully, we use a unified system where everything fits together like legos, meaning endless creative potential. Going on crazy turn-based adventures with your friends, or designing perilous quests for others to master has never been easier. Epic pre-built quests are coming out regularly and provide a lot of fun, replayability and even exclusive game pieces that can be used as either a Master or a Hero.\nA library of epic adventures\nWe\u2019re not just planning to use our community to create content for us! We have hired a team of storytellers and tabletop dungeon-masters to create a library of pre-built adventures for you to enjoy. Plenty are available and comprise a collection of game boards for players of all ages. \nMiniature Progression Concept\nMiniatures are not just figurines you use to play a tabletop game. Each has detailed stats, equipment and can be customized by a multitude of accessories and colors allowing you to paint your miniature any way you like. Every miniature levels up like an RPG character and gains new skills and powers. Build your own band of daring heroes and take them on adventures across the multiverse!\nMeet the miniatures!\n ...these miniatures are just a glimpse of what awaits you in the final game!\nNo matter what you do in the world of Game Master - you earn gold. But what is gold if you cannot spend it? Thankfully, we have created amazing booster packs, chuck-full with more digital goodies! Hero\u2019s Boosters are filled with weapons, armor, spells, laser guns, mechanical contraptions, potions and everything you will ever need to conquer the game board.\nMaster\u2019s Boosters yield game tiles, monsters, traps, NPCs, quest items and a multitude of other surprises that will help you create the most intricate and amazing adventures. Don\u2019t like what you have? Break it down into gold! You get to keep the blueprint and re-craft anything you ever had! Don\u2019t have enough trap doors? Craft as many as you like with gold!\nIt\u2019s not all about how wealthy you are! All gold earned by completing quests and capturing heroes adds to your Glory Rating. We also track your alignment in the world of Game Master. Will you be known as the dreaded hero that destroys all of his opposition or the most devious Master that promises mountains of gold but leaves no one alive to reap the benefits. Glory is not just a number used for bragging rights and matchmaking. Great in-game rewards are unlocked as your Glory rating rises. \nBy spending gold, players will be able to purchase booster packs and take their game to the next level. These are digital boxes filled with all sorts of goodies to enhance your experience. Two types of booster packs will be available at launch. Game pieces have different rarity ratings and every booster pack is guaranteed to have at least one rare item.\nDigital Booster Packs\nHero\u2019s Booster\nAn assortment of miniature paints, weapons, armor, potions, weapons, spells, runes and everything you will need to make your band of heroes the best in the land!\nMaster\u2019s Booster\nTiles, monsters, traps, NPC characters, chests, quest items, treasure, contraptions and all sorts of things to help you make the most sought after board in the game.\nOne of the products of our long history of playing tabletop games is the Runic Dice system. During our play-sessions we always wanted to evolve the idea of throwing dice and make it personal and customizable for each player.\nEach miniature comes with it\u2019s own runic dice that you get to use along side all the other standard dice. Runic dice are designed by you! Each side can be customized to provide exciting gameplay effects and turn the tide of battle.\nWe will be very proud to unveil more details about this system during the campaign.\nThe many worlds of Game Master\nFantasy\nBeyond the snowy mountains, in a valley kissed by the sun lay a kingdom of vines and cobblestone. Both the villagers and the townsfolk lived in peace and harmony until an old greedy dragon the size of a castle arrived in the valley threatening to eat every maiden in the kingdom unless he is presented with all the gold he can carry.\nSteampunk \nIn the seedy underground of Dampfburg, all hail the Queen of Cogs. No shady deed slips through this enigmatic matriarch\u2019s fingers and no man ever found a way to her heart. That is, until an investigative journalist attempts to infiltrate her hideout and get an interview.\nSci-Fi\nThe Galactic Alliance has fallen. Trade routes are no longer safe and piracy is at an all time high. A behemoth class transport vessel is assaulted by a band of young pirates hungry for loot. What they didn\u2019t know is that this ship\u2019s cargo are test subjects of a dangerous interdimensional experiment.\nModern Horror\nJust beyond the corner of your eye, lies a sinister world of ancient beings that have preyed on humanity from the shadows for ages. Their tendrils reach out across the world controlling all aspects of society. The fate of humanity lies in the hands of a group of paranormal vigilantes.\nPulp Adventure\nThe temples of the old gods, lied in ruins for thousands of years. Rarely are they visited by a living soul, and only the bravest dare to take a step inside only to never be heard from again. Will history repeat itself for our daring archaeologist or will he be the one to reach the City of Gold.\nCyberpunk\nA city engulfed in neon-light where information is the most prized commodity stands tall in the middle of a mutant-infested wasteland.

We love playing games as much as we love making them. And the only thing we like even more is to play games that we have made!\nSince our early childhood we have always been big fans of Role Playing Games. We endured sleepless nights playing D&D, collected and played Magic the Gathering cards and spent a lot of fantastic hours crawling in the dungeons thanks to board games like Descent or Hero Quest as well as many others.\nWith the overwhelming success of the iPad and other touchscreen devices, it became possible to transfer the table top board and card games as we know them to the digital realm. A lot more accessible and easy to setup but still as much fun and joy as the real ones. We at K-Gaming took a shot at it and created Demons vs. Wizards - a card game for touchscreen devices. This game is so easy even a small kid can play without reading the rules, but deep enough to allow for high-level strategies! \nThe reception of the Demons vs. Wizards card game was very warm and we\u2019ve had a ton of positive reviews. Continuing our quest to make great games for touchscreen devices was an easy decision afterwards.\n\nOur company motto - Our games must look and feel perfect.

For each God, we want you to answer this question:\nIf this God was to help you on your journey through Purgatory, what buff or gameplay advantage would they give you?\nTell us in the comments!\nBaldr, the God of light, purity, joy and innocence!\nFreyja, the God of love, beauty, fertility, war and death!\nLoki, the treacherous God of fire and mischief!\nTyr, the brave and courageous God of law and heroic glory!\nHel, daughter of Loki and lord of Helheimr, the resting place for those who have died of disease and old age!\nFreyr, God of virility, prosperity, holy judgement and sacred kingship!\nBragi, the Norse God of poetry, wisdom, bards and the power of speech!\nHeimdallr stands on the burning rainbow bridge that leads to Asgard, protecting the Gods from the jotun. His mighty horn, Gjallarhorn, signals Ragnar\u00f6k and the death of the Gods!\nNj\u00f6rd is an ancient God of the Vanir, father of Freyja and Frejr. He is God of the wind, of the sea and of wealth!\nThor is the slayer of giants and wielder of Mj\u00f6lnir. He is the mighty God of thunder, oak trees, strength and the protector of mankind!\nFrigg, Queen of Asgard, is the prescient God of motherhood, childbirth and constellations!\nOdin is the God of war, battle, victory, death, wisdom, poetry and magic. He is the Allfather, patriarch of the Gods and ruler of the nine worlds!\nThank you for sharing your gameplay ideas and we'll see you in purgatory!\nYou can download all the Norse Gods here!\nIn Jotun, you play Thora, a Norse warrior who has died an inglorious death and must face the challenges of Viking purgatory to prove herself to the Gods and enter Valhalla.\nJotun's core loop revolves around collecting Runes to summon and fight the jotun, gigantic Norse elementals. The game focuses on the balance between atmospheric exploration and ferocious combat. Imagine the mysterious romantic mood of Journey mixed with the scale of the boss fights in Shadow of the Colossus in top-down 2D.\nThe world is randomly-generated and filled with different areas to explore and environmental puzzles to solve. Traveling to the far reaches of Purgatory is key to finding Runes, Shrines to the Gods and many more Viking mysteries.\nThe combat in Jotun is fast-paced and brutally hard. Using only your massive two-handed axe, you take on foes that are hundreds of times your size. Every hit from a jotun's attack will take out a huge chunk of your health.\nFeatures:\nBeautiful 2D hand-drawn art style\nEpic boss fights against the mighty jotun\nA vast and mysterious randomly-generated world to explore filled with environmental puzzles based in Viking culture and mythology\nAn overarching story to discover for both Thora and Purgatory itself\nShrines to the Viking Gods\nAn amazing musical score, specifically composed for every gameplay moment\nWOW, we were Greenlit in under 6 days!!!\n Which means we'll be on:\nJotun's gameplay is a love letter to classic games such as The Legend of Zelda. It has simple controls, action-packed boss fights and a mythic Viking world to discover. Jotun is not a \"hack-and-slash\" RPG. We prefer to avoid numbers and text when possible: there are no experience points and few stats. Like the Vikings, you must prove your valor to the Gods using only your wits and your skill in combat.\nControls\nJotun can be played with a keyboard or a gamepad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge. You control Thora from a top-down perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Thora has both a fast and a \"charge-up\" attack; the attack's power is determined by how long you hold the attack button. Dodging is crucial to avoiding traps and incoming attacks from the mighty jotun.\nCombat\nInspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, the combat in Jotun is fast-paced and organic. Fighting the jotun requires the ability to dodge projectiles, use proper positioning and attack at the right moment. The jotun have several attacks and defenses. Recognizing them is key to executing your strategy. When in combat, the camera zooms out to give you a full view of the battlefield.\n More details on combat:\nJotun's music is core to the game's experience. Every gameplay moment is accompanied by an appropriate piece. Whether it's a fight against the mighty Frost Jotun or a peaceful contemplation of a beautiful vista, the music is an integral part of Jotun's mood, atmosphere and experience.\n\"When the prospect of writing the music for Jotun came along, I was filled with excitement at the idea of putting the vast universe Thora will explore during her journey into song. The characters, landscapes and story behind Jotun have already inspired many musical themes that I can't wait to bring to life!\" - Max LL\nWe chose Kickstarter because we want to involve you in the development process. We want your feedback, comments and critiques. Whether you love or hate Jotun, we want to know why. We want to build a community of passionate people all rooting for the same cause. We want you on board with us for the entire journey!\nJotun was born from our love of mythology and epic literature. From Greek mythology to Beowulf, we've always had a fascination for centuries-old stories. Jotun is a tribute to Viking mythology and to classic, honest gaming. We are a passionate and experienced team who can bring the game to fruition. We hope that you'll join us, connect with the game and that you'll enjoy your time with the Jotun family! \nFrom left to right:\nWilliam Dub\u00e9 - Design, business, code - http://willdube.com/\nAlexandre Boyer - Animation, art - http://vimeo.com/user8478050\nMax LL - Music - https://soundcloud.com/max-ll\nWe will be adding another full-time programmer to our team when the campaign is successful!\nCollaborators:\nAlex Mass\u00e9 - Code\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bilodeau - Sound Effects\nFrom left to right:\nJo-Annie Gauthier - 2D artist - http://www.jo-annie.net/\nAnnejulie Painchaud - 2D artist - http://antilamon.carbonmade.com/\nDarnell Lysius-Dicette - 2D artist - http://glitch-this1.tumblr.com/\nMarianne Vincent - Logo design - https://www.behance.net/mariannevincent\nVideo Team:\nMaude Plante-Husaruk - Director, editor - http://husaruk.com/\nJames Dub\u00e9 - Camera man\nOur goal is to reach alpha within six months, beta within nine months and full launch within twelve months.

They\u2019d been hired to steal data, but the bloody dissection tables & the occasional vat filled with murky liquid hadn\u2019t been part of the job description.\nOut of morbid curiosity, Rachel turned her gun-mounted flashlight onto the nearest vat. It was massive, at least two meters tall & filled with an opaque green fluid. She approached & peered into the murky depths. \"What could possibly be growing inside these?\" she whispered.\nSMACK!\nRachel stumbled back as she received a partial answer. A black claw, bigger than her head, had reached out of the liquid & slammed into the glass wall of the vat. Just as abruptly, it disappeared back into the depths of the tank.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Rach,\u201d Maximus grunted, barely glancing at the source of the disturbance. \u201cNothing can bust out of those vats.

With everything you will need for players & game-masters (GM). The book will also include loads of art, short stories & more from the game universe.\nThe Antagonist Archive 1: A high quality, 140 page, full colour, hardcover supplement book. Jam packed with information about the darker side of the Haven System. With NPCs, faction and locations for your players to contend with.\nThe Antagonist Archive 2: Similar to the Antagonist Archive 1, but will be slowly built over multiple years until it is the same size as the Antagonist Archive 1.

We will also be gathering ideas from our community and placing the best ones inside (with professional art, writing and editing).\nAdventure 'Let Sleeping Gods Lie': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nAdventure 'Genetic Spectres': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal for low to mid level characters.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSetting primary themes: Cultural tension, biological technology & exploration.\nRules primary focus: Non setting specific rules (though it comes with a setting), 3d6 skill rolls, nonlinear character progression, long sandbox games & tactical miniature based combat.\nAfter expanding throughout the galaxy, terraforming millions of planets & creating electronic wonders beyond our imagination, humanity became apathetic & faced extinction due to Genetic Erosion. Unable to save themselves, they engineered a race to inherit their fallen empire: the Archons.\nRather than treading in the footprints of humanity, the Archons pushed into scientific fields that their creators had barely explored: genetic engineering & the creation of scores of new species, all in an effort to make the \u2018perfect\u2019 race.\nOver thousands of years, the Archons built a mighty empire & created hundreds of species. But they played favourites, lavishing their love & generosity on some while entirely neglecting others.\nEventually they created what they initially thought was the \u2018perfect \u2018 race, naming them Xion. When the Archons attempted to rescind the title of \u2018perfect\u2019 the Xion fought back. The Archons eradicated the Xion. That is, all but one, who escaped far into uncharted space.\nTwo hundred years later the lone Xion returned with its own genetically-engineered army (the Nephilim). The ensuing war lasted six years & spelled the destruction of the Archons, their created races & empire. Vindicated, the lone Xion again disappeared, abandoning its army. Small pockets of survivors were scattered across the galaxy, unknown & alone.\nNow, a century has passed since the Great Xion War & descendants of the survivors have started to emerge. They have begun to rediscover space travel & are just now making tentative contact with one another in a small star system named \u2018Haven\u2019. You are one of these descendants who find yourself stepping into so much unknown\u2026\nCorporation\nRejected by their creators (the Archons) as inferior, the Corporation (formerly known as Vargarti) have grown to love the Great Xion War as it freed them from an existence of insignificance & irrelevance. They are now eager to prove themselves. Not a nation in the classical sense, the Corporation is a massive corporate entity comprised of millions of smaller, affiliated business enterprises; a purely capitalistic society.\nKaltoran\nBorn with the genetic memories of their ancestors, Kaltorans are an innately gifted & flexible race. They are eager to make a new future for themselves, though they struggle with the \u2018genetic memories\u2019 of not only the Great Xion War but the extreme measures taken by their ancestors to survive it.\nLegion\nA physically imposing race, hastily created by the Archons to fight their losing war against Xion. The Legion now struggle to create a stable society & to find meaning with no war to fight. In recent times the Legion have formed a close economic relationship with the Corporation, acting as enforcers for hire.\nNephilim\nA junk-word term used to describe the diverse descendants of Xion\u2019s genetically engineered army. Created to wage war on the Archons & their creations, before being abandoned by their creator, Xion once the war was won.\nThe Nephilim have an eclectic, primal & often violent society that is supported by advanced biological technology. While publicly no longer loyal to Xion, their pursuit of genetic perfection at any cost is pervasive.\nFree Ambient Audio Files (created by www.tabletopaudio.com):\nNephilim Lab\nKaltoran Spacecraft\nLight, Fast & Flexible non Combat rules: We don't want rules to slow the role playing down.\nPlayer Creativity is Encouraged: We balance the math by telling you what roll needs to be made but not what skill needs to be used.

NPCs\u2019 opinion of your character have a statistical effect on your stats; not everything has to be done for money. You can also be a merchant or scientist, plan trade routes or research new or forgotten technologies.\nTactical Personal & Spacecraft Combat. Build or modify your own Weapons & Armour.\nBuild your own Custom Equipment & Spacecraft. Will you make a gunship for fighting, a cargo ship for trading, create labs & workshops to modifying weapons or perform research or do a bit of everything? The choice is yours.\nSee an explanation of Spare Time Rolls, plus Research & Trade Goods:\n See an example of Character Creation:\nPlease see our YouTube page for more rules videos.\nNon Setting Specific Rules\nFragged Empire comes with a setting, but rules are flexible & robust enough to be adapted to almost any science fiction setting.\nSimple 3d6 Resolution System\nSkill rolls are done with a simple 3d6 +/- bonus or penalty vs a Difficulty Value or Target\u2019s Defense.\nNonlinear Character Progression\nCharacters have a pool of options available to them, with no set ability or equipment progression path. This allows Characters to quickly specialize or diversify & to create unique combinations of abilities & equipment to suit your play style.\nLow Level Characters can be a dangerous threat to high level Characters due to specialization. Even if two Characters have very similar Attributes, Skills or Equipment, they can function quite different due to Trait selections.\nChoose any path you want; Cunning Mercenary, Black Market Smuggler, Archeological Treasure Hunter or Power Mad Scientist. All are balanced.\nBest for Long, Sandbox Games\nFragged Empire works for short games but is in its element in long, sandbox-styled games.\nBeing in a post, post-apocalyptic setting, you will regularly have to make the most of what little resources you have, including balancing short-term & long-term options, making short-term sacrifices for long-term gain, & so on.\nTactical Miniature Combat\nFragged Empire presents intuitive, tactical combat where you will need to not only react to your environment (cover is your friend), but also to respond to your opponents\u2019 Actions. There are also optional rules for non-miniature based combat, if desired.\nPDF, pledge $20aud or more.\nWhen the project is complete, you will receive a PDF copy of the complete book & access to the PDF version via DriveThruRPG. This will allow you to freely download any future updated versions of the book.\nThe PDF will be available before the book.\nKS Exclusive Wallpapers.\nWe will be making up a full set of High Res wallpapers. These will remain exclusive to our backers for 6 months after we post out to all of our backers (then I will most likely just put them up on my website for free).\nAdventure: \"Let Sleeping Gods Lie\".\nExplore the remains of a (possibly) dead, ancient, biological Nephilim warship as it floats through space. This small adventure is ideal for new players and a great introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nWe have expanded this Adventure to now be 40+ pages long, and it will no longer be a KS Exclusive Adventure.\nReference PDF\nA handy PDF with Trait, Equipment & NPC stat blocks.\nPhysical Copy, pledge $75aud or more.\nFeaturing 384 pages, full colour, offset printed, hardcover book.

They are selected randomly at the beginning of the game. Each has a unique special ability that can help you during the game.\nSpell cards\u2013spells can be cast during anyone's turn, at any point in the game. You can cast as many spells as you want (just remember that you only draw back up at the end of your turn). Spells can do many different things, from moving the Shoggoth around the table, stealing an opponent's artifacts, causing them to lose a turn, to any number of other nasty effects.\nArtifact cards\u2013artifacts are a bit different than Spells. They need to be placed in front of you face up on the table, and need an activation period of one round before they can be used. While a bit more difficult to use, artifacts are generally more powerful than spells.\nAction cards\u2013like Spells, action cards can be used at any point during the game. They're primarily defensive in nature, and have the advantage that they can't be countered or stolen from you.\nMinion cards\u2013 these represent the lowly members of your Cult, a.k.a. Shoggoth food.\nA sample of the art for the cards, and the old version of the designs\nSet up:\nAt the beginning of the game, players randomly select a Cult Faction card, which is placed in on the table in front of them, as well as 7 cards from the deck. The Shoggoth card is placed in the center of the table. The Shoggoth will move directly in front of the first player to declare that they're sacrificing a Minion. On subsequent turns, it may be necessary for a Cult Leader to cast spells or use artifacts to move the Shoggoth in front of them.\nTurn Summary:\nActivate any Artifacts that have been on the table for at least one turn\nPlay any new Artifacts from your hand\nAttempt to Sacrifice one Minion to the Shoggoth\nIf the Sacrifice is successful, move the Shoggoth in front of the player to your left, and gain a Sacrifice Score Token\nDraw back up to 7 cards\nOn each player's turn:\nAfter the artifacts phase, the player may attempt to Feed the Shoggoth, if the Shoggoth card is in front of them on their turn. \nOnce the Shoggoth is in front of the Cult Leader and they declare that they're sacrificing a Minion, the other Cult Leaders now have a chance to disrupt the sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth in front of a different Cult Leader. But, the sacrificing Cult Leader can cast their own spells (and Artifacts) to bring the Shoggoth back. This can lead to some frantic spell battles. If the Shoggoth is still in front of the Cult Leader, their sacrifice is complete, much to the consternation of the Minion who's just gotten eaten. The Cult Leader that completed the sacrifice gains a point, moves the Shoggoth in front of the player to their left, and draws back up to 7 cards.\nIf the Shoggoth is in front of you on your turn, and you don't have a Minion to sacrifice, the Shoggoth eats you, and you're out of the game!\nIf it's not your turn, then you can attempt to disrupt the sacrifice process by casting spells. You can try to move the Shoggoth away from the cult leader, cause them to lose artifacts, or any number of nasty maneuvers with your spells.\nWhy Feed the Shoggoth!, anyway?\nI've been both a Keeper of Call of Cthulhu as well as a board/card game fan for a long time, and it dawned on me a couple years ago that cults in the Cthulhu Mythos are a particularly vicious bunch, constantly vying for more knowledge and power. And Shoggoths, those gigantic, amorphous blobs of pseudopod-producing flesh, are powerful (yet incredibly dangerous) creatures indeed. Well, what if a bunch of different cults were trying to fight over a single shoggoth in order to control it?\nNext, I wanted the game to be fun, something that I would want to play. The best games, I felt, were ones that gave everyone an equal chance to win at any point in the game. With the right amount of strategy and luck, a player could come from behind and achieve victory. Plus, I've always been a fan of screw-your-neighbor mechanics; this, combined with a hot potato element, can (and has, in many play tests I've witnessed) cause frenetic and desperate game play. \nWhile Feed the Shoggoth! can be played as a quick beer-and-prezels game, one can find deeper strategies within; especially when Minion cards run out and the players are forced to keep the Shoggoth away from them because they're unable to sacrifice.\nWe've got some amazing supplements for your copy of Feed the Shoggoth!:\nThe Shoggoth Miniature: \nEach copy of the game will come with a Shoggoth card, but at pledge levels HIGH PRIEST and above, you will receive a resin-cast Shoggoth miniature, designed and sculpted by Jason McKittrick! Each miniature will be hand-painted in a standard color scheme of black with yellow accents.\nThe standard Shoggoth miniature\nThe CUSTOM PAINTED Shoggoth Miniature:\nYou can also have the Shoggoth mini custom painted to your specifications! Want your Shoggie ichor-green, a sickly flesh tone, or even hot pink? Let us know what you want the base color and highlight color to be, and Jason will wield his mighty brush to make your Shoggoth color desires come alive! He can even paint it glow-in-the-dark, if you so desire!\nSacrifice Score Counters:\nOf course, you're more than welcome to use pennies, spare buttons, dice, pieces of your old Call of Cthulhu character sheet that you tore up when your Keeper TPK'ed your party in the last scenario...but why not avail yourself of some official Feed the Shoggoth! Sacrifice Score Counters? You'll receive a set of 30 plastic counters, printed on both sides, in an attractive green and black color scheme.\nThe Custom Minion Card: \nTo help make your copy of Feed the Shoggoth! truly your own, you'll have the opportunity at the RENDER OF VEILS level to acquire a Minion card with your portrait depicted, painted by artists Paul Carrick or David Grilla. Both Paul and David are veteran artists for Call of Cthulhu, and we're thrilled to have them on board. To check out their respective portfolios, feel free to visit their websites at http://www.nightserpent.com or http://www.davidgrilla.com.\nThe Storage Box:\nFor the ultimate discerning Cult Leader, we'll have a limited number of hand crafted storage boxes, again created and sculpted by Jason McKittrick. These boxes will have room enough to store your copy of the game, the Shoggoth miniature, and score tokens (with room left over for future expansions to Feed the Shoggoth!).\nThe hand-crafted storage box!\nA close up of the cover...\nAnd the detail of the front!\nClick on the image above for a larger version\nAs of this writing, the design of the game mechanics and rules has been nailed down. Feed the Shoggoth! has been through two years of play testing, including more than a dozen gaming conventions. Now, all that remains is for the card art to be cleaned up for production, and the cards to be designed. Both of these steps are currently underway, with the artwork more than half completed. I fully anticipate the artwork and card designs to be completed within the next 2-3 months.\nThe answer is simple, really; there's no way I can afford to bring this game to life, and get it into people's hands, unless I raise the money via Kickstarter. The goal of $8000 is the bare minimum for getting 500 copies of the game professionally printed, with a tuck box, rules, and shrink-wrapping, plus shipping costs. The more we raise, the more copies we can produce!\nBadger McInnes\u2013game design, art:\nYou may not be familiar with my name, but if you're a player or Keeper of Call of Cthulhu, you've probably seen my work. I've been working as a book designer and layout artist for over ten years, for such publishers as Chaosium, Pagan Publishing, Miskatonic River Press, and Golden Goblin Press. My grubby paws have put together books you may be familiar with: Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition (winner of two ENnies!), The Legacy of Arrius Lurco, Bumps in the Night, Secrets of San Francisco, Tales of the Sleepless City....oh, and some book called Call of Cthulhu 7th edition.\nIf you would like to see the full list of credits under my name, please feel free to check out my Squamous Studios website.\nJason McKittrick\u2013sculpture art:\nI have the distinct pleasure of working with Jason McKittrick of Cryptocurium, who has lent his considerable artistic madness to creating the shoggoth miniature, and the storage box for Feed the Shoggoth!. In addition, Jason will be painting the custom shoggoth minis!\nDamion Mosier-Tidd\u2013Additional art production and design:\nDamion has been doing Graphic Design, Typesetting & Layout in quietly capable obscurity for the past 20 years. He spent his formative years learning the ins and outs of practical design and graphic communications in prepress and printing sweatshops across the Bay Area. In the slightly less-distant past (a.k.a. the 90's) he worked as a designer and production artist for many of the big dot-com companies that no longer exist. Currently he resides on a team that handles packaging and design tasks for a large medical corporation.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge right now is getting the rest of the artwork for the game done in a timely fashion; it's more than half finished now. Then, the task of finishing the design and layout of the cards themselves. This is why I've set the estimated delivery time to be November. My goal is to get the game in your hands sooner than that, and I'm confident that I can.\n\nOf course, there are always the chance of unforeseen problems, such as with printing and shipping, but I will be working with well-established printing and fulfillment companies (such as DeLano and Chronicle City), so that the chances of hiccups are minimized as much as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "We're funded!!", "update_content": "Hello, fellow pseudopods!\nWe're happy to announce that, as of today, we're funded!

Their power comes from their simplicity.  Just type a word or two to do what you want.  The time has come to bring this power together with the usability and convenience of modern interfaces.\nAwesome new shell commands\nPLAY\n\nxsh: Introducing Xikishell!\nPLAY\n\nHow Xiki compares to traditional shell consoles\nPLAY\n\nIf you want to see how Xiki compares to the traditional way of running shell commands, you may like this video better than the main one:\nWhat the money will be used for\nIf this campaign succeeds, the money will let me dedicate the time needed to bring this next, drastically improved, version of Xiki to the world.  Xiki plugins for Sublime and Vim will be created.  The installer and initial user experience will be greatly improved (largely by adding contextual menus everywhere).  The integration with the shell will be improved.  To enable supporting new Xiki plugins, the core of Xiki will be refactored.  It will do the heavy lifting so the plugins will no longer have to.\nIf the campaign succeeds in a dramatic way, I'll be able to add more plugins, collaborate with more of you on the code and new menus, and pay collaborators to do some of the work for/with me (I'll want to pair with them very closely during the process).\nProject Plan\nRefactor of the Xiki core: 3 months\nSupporting 2 new text editors or IDEs: 4 months (likely Vim and Sublime, but it depends on what everyone votes for - also which one is implemented first depends on the votes)\nFulfilling Kickstarter Rewards: 4 months\nInstall Process improvement: 1 month\nInitial user experience improvement: 1 month\nImproved integration with the shell: 1 month\nShirts and Laptop Stickers\nThe shirts are American Apparel 50/50 blend. Very soft, top-quality shirts. The laptop stickers are made by StickerMule.\nYou can choose one of these 3 shirts for the \"I saved xiki\" reward (plus you get a T-Shirt).  They say \"i backed xiki\" below the logo.  I haven't chosen the brands yet for these, but they will be top quality.\nPhilosophy\nXiki is open and flexible.  It's open source, and brings together tools, languages, shells, and text editors, rather than competing with them.  Open formats and languages are the best thing for the tech ecosystem.  HTML and JSON made the web what it is today.  And the web arguably made everything else. \nXiki strives to be the simplest possible way (and ways) to create interactive interfaces.  This means a text in and text out interface.  Since everything is text, almost nothing is against the rules when you're creating an interface in Xiki.  Xiki stands for \"expanding wiki\", and is inspired by the wiki philosophy of fully editable text, with simple syntaxes (like \">\" for a heading, and \"-\" for a bullet).  Xiki extends wiki ideas to user interface in general.\nQuotes about Xiki\n\"My life just changed forever\"\n\"My god... It's beautiful\"\n\"Xiki changes everything\"\n\"Is this real life?\"\n\"My brain just exploded\"\n\"it looks totally mind blowing\"\n\"the most innovative and useful application I've ever seen!\"\n\"#magnificent #dynamite #superdope #outofsight\"\n\"my head just exploded\"\n\"what a shell on LSD looks like. So innovative it's a bit frightening.\"\n\"The future has landed\"\n\"MY MIND IS BLOW\"\n\"Wow @xiki just blew my mind!\"\n\"Holy mother of god!\"\n\"HOLY **** THIS IS AWESOME\"\n\"MY MIND IS ******* BLOWING AND ALL MY COWORKERS TOO :>\"\n\"Holy. ****. Wow.\"\n(excerpts from tweets)\n\"Suitably blown away\" (Avdi Grimm)\n\"It's kind of mind expanding (James Edward Gray)\n\"I've seen lots of software called wiki. But rarely do I see software that challenges me to think deeply about what it means to interact with software. We're still just scratching the surface of what software can do but xiki scratches deeper than most. Pay attention.\" (Ward Cunningham, inventor of the wiki)\nPair with me!\nI've pair programmed on Xiki with many people all over the world, and it's been fantastic, both remotely and in person in coffee shops in SF.  Tweet me at http://twitter.com/xiki and we'll get together and pair!  I'll be giving precedence to contributors to this campaign, but will pair with anyone!  It's a great way for developers to connect with each other, and bring new ideas into a project.  In my opinion, reaching out and pair programming with people on open source projects will play a huge role in the future of how we'll hook up with cool projects and gigs.\nPair with me on Xiki!\nXiki is made with collaboration in mind.  It's easy to get lost when someone you are collaborating with is navigating all over the place.  With Xiki, you can create notes and navigation that you can save and go back to, to help orient yourself or the person you're collaborating with.\nXiki's future\nGetting Xiki (or at least the basic Xiki format) working across more platforms will be an ongoing process.  Including devices and web frameworks.  I have a working version of a rails plugin, that lets you drop commands into your rails app.  Down the road, a node.js version might be desirable.\nIn the coming years so many smart watches and other devices will be coming available.  This is very exciting, but the trend is for each watch and phone to have it's own proprietary (or open, but proprietary in practice) API.  Let's reverse this trend!  Most apps (or at least their main structures) boil down to nested lists of choices.  There should be a (or perhaps many) very simple languages for defining the main navigation of an app (the nested lists of choices).  Xiki is on the path to being such a format.  As it is, you can type a few nested menu items (with 2-space indenting) and use it on the command line, in a text editor, in a web browser, and as a service.\nIt's crazy that in 2014 there isn't a dead-simple language that you can type a few lines of, and then deploy a simple but usable app to desktops, the web, and phones, and other devices.  It should be easy to create the main navigation for an app (just by making a text file), and drop it into any platform.  Then for the specifics of what some of the items in your navigation do, platform specific code may of course be necessary.\nGenerating a Pebble or iPhone app from a Xiki command is probably pretty achievable.  Tweet me if you're interested in pairing on either of these!\nOlder video\nHere's a video of Xiki from 2012.  It's slower-paced and more developer-centric.  It doesn't show the newest Xiki features, but shows some cool stuff that's been in Xiki for a while, that's not shown in the video above:\nPLAY\n\nThis video generated some excitement, but most people who tried to use it ran into problems with the install and user experience.  At the time I wanted to spend my resources developing new features, that would help the user experience in the long run.  Between now and then, Xiki has come a long, long way.  This Kickstarter is about shifting focus to reaching out to users, which means giving them what they've asked for.  The main requests from people were improving the installer and the initial user experience, and getting Xiki working in other text editors, like Sublime and Vim.\nAre you a company?\nCheck out the rewards on the right for including a command for your company in the Xiki distribution!  See the Twilio command in the video for an example.  Your command will be included for all Xiki users.  They can over-ride it if they desire, but it will be included by default.  Here are some videos of commands:\nPubNub:\nPLAY\n\nTwilio:\nPLAY\n\nHeroku:\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupporting other text editors elegantly is going to require a big refactor of the code base. This will take some time, but I've got a great plan for it, involving having the text editor plugins do minimal work and just passing the file and line number to Xiki.\n\nSome text editors and IDEs don't allow their plugins to control the right-click menu. This means traditional right-clicking will not work in them, until their authors support this. However, the text-only version of right-clicking (that I show in the above video) will be supported in all cases. Though it is slightly less pretty, is just as powerful, and requires fewer key presses than a GUI dropdown.\n\nSome text editors and IDEs can't run asynchronous shell commands. Currently the Aquamacs and Emacs Xiki plugins are fully supported, and async commands can run in the text editor window. For Sublime and Vim, Xiki will send async commands to an external terminal app to run them (iTerm or Terminal.app on OSX).\n\nXiki doesn't currently support Windows. If enough people back this campaign and tweet me at @xiki requesting Windows support, I'll add a reward category for it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Campaign status & Plans for the next campaign", "update_content": "Hi all.

These may prove relevant to the kidnappings, or they could simply be a red herring, yielding only EXP and treasure.\nClues fuel progress in the game's main storyline, and how you choose to interpret them will impact on your team's reputation.

For more updates remember to visit our website, follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook!\nIt all began in August 2013 during the 7 Day First Person Shooter game challenge, where we decided to make something that really stood out in the genre. Our concept was a title that felt dynamic and satisfying, while not requiring superhuman reflexes. Something like a game of real-time chess, except that all the pawns are out there to murder you. We released a public demo...\nYou can also check out the video reactions to our prototype: [Markiplier] [OfficialNerd\u00b3] [CupQuake] [JackSepticEye] [FavijTV] [JackFrags]\n... and then - the Internet went crazy. We have been featured on Kotaku, The Verge, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and WIRED among many others. SUPERHOT made it to the front page of Reddit (twice) and went through Steam Greenlight during a single weekend. Thanks to the amazingly positive responses we've decided that we want to develop SUPERHOT into a full blown game!\nSUPERHOT is a unique, stylized FPS game where the time moves only when you move. With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.\nYou're not hiding behind cover - you're dodging bullets flying past you like in The Matrix. You're not waiting to reload a gun - you're picking the next firearm from the hands of your fallen foes. You're not waiting until your wounds heal - in SUPERHOT a single bullet means death. However, there are no reload screens - you're instantly back in the middle of the action. \nSUPERHOT wouldn't have made it this far if not for the support of gamers, the press, and fellow developers. Since the original prototype we've basically rewritten the game from the ground-up to make it more expandable, dynamic and resulting in a much smoother experience. \nDuring these eight months we've fixed a lot of the problems with the original version of the game, heavily reiterated on the art style, and experimented with fun scenarios for the players to \"solve\" - shootout in a subway train, showdown on the top of a skyscraper in rain, jumping into a moving elevator, and more.\nWe've still got a lot of work (new mechanics, more levels, better animation, rigorous testing and optimization) ahead of us, but the core of SUPERHOT is in place and it's unlike anything you've seen before.\nTurning to Kickstarter ensures that we have access to a constant stream of feedback and ideas, while maintaining control over the development. We have the skills and experience needed to complete the game and we've been working on SUPERHOT non-stop for the past eight months, but we need your help to make it even better!\nThe initial goal of $100k will allow us to cover the costs of living for the team, purchase required hardware, software licences and assets that will allow us to finish the game faster, and to hire additional help - graphic artists, animators, level designers and sound technicians - that will assist us in making SUPERHOT a complete game. All funds over $100k will go directly into making the game better and covering the costs of promoting the game on various gaming events around the world.\nStory driven single-player campaign. SUPERHOT is more than just a shooter with a gimmick. We want to deliver a solid, interesting campaign built around a carefully constructed, not overly in-your-face story.\nImproved visuals. We are keeping the original game's minimalistic artstyle while making everything look a lot better. SUPERHOT is all about style.\nInfinite mode. A lot of people have asked us for an endless, arena-style mode that will allow them to play SUPERHOT for as long as they want. Master the game's mechanics and get ready for the ultimate time-bending challenges.\nMore weapons - shotguns, machineguns, grenades that change the way you play around with the time-bending mechanics.\nMore enemy types - thanks to improved AI the foes will use tactics and be able to work together to hunt you down.\nMore levels - imagine fighting in the middle of a motorway during rush hour, or close combat in an elevator - and other amazing, movie-like scenarios.\nSlow-motion explosions!\nOculus Rift support. Dodge bullets flying right in front of your face and lean behind corners for increased immersion!\nAnd a lot of other surprises!\n Piotr is a seasoned team leader with a portfolio that pushes the experimental boundaries of puzzle games in titles such as Rektagon and Tetravalanche.  \nJakub is an experienced programmer with a portfolio of games released for various platforms, including PC, PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS. \nLuke previously worked at Wastelands Interactive (Worlds of Magic, 1946). When has free time he tends to participate in (or organize) various game jams and visit gaming events.\nMarek is an electrical and software engineer with a track record of crazy projects like an iPad-integrated cat feeder, smoke emitting helmet or a baloon-controlled Flappy Bird game.  \nTomasz is a co-founder of our partner company Blue Brick who worked with and managed international teams developing big R&D projects - from mobile and automotive to telecom.\nMarcin is a visionary graphics artist with a flair for experimental video game design and theatrics. Illustrates comic books when no one's looking.\nPiotr has ten years of artistic experience in video games and animation, he creates awesome things in 3D and walks his dog in time left to spare.\nHuge thanks to Julie Heyde (Bandello) for a lot of different things; to Karl Flodin (Twitter / Soundcloud) and AdhesiveWombat (Twitter / Soundcloud) for making awesome music for our video; to everybody that assisted us while creating this campaign; and finally, to the awesome Unity Engine team for helping us out in many ways :)\nFor $14 you receive a key for downloading SUPERHOT once it's released on Steam, access to our secret, backer-only forum where you can keep in touch with the developers, and immediate download of our digital pack of goodies (includes the downloadable, standalone version of the original SUPERHOT prototype and a pack of wallpapers and ringtones).\nAccess to the forums will be sent out in a survey after the campaign is finished. Click here for the digital pack of goodies.\nBy pledging $25 and more you get a digital artbook and a digital download of the game's official soundtrack in FLAC quality. You will also receive all previous rewards.\nThis tier will get you exclusive, Kickstarter-only beta access to SUPERHOT at least two months before it gets released anywhere else. We're currently planning to release beta access in 6-12 months, depending on our progress. Also includes all previous rewards.\nBacking at least $55 will get you a set of awesome SUPERHOT stickers and badges, along with all previous rewards. Add $5 for international shipping.\nAt this level you'll receive one limited edition SUPERHOT T-Shirt (male and female tees available; pick one design from the two below), along with all previous rewards. Add $10 for international shipping.\nThese t-shirts were designed by the wonderful Emma Tolley (etall on Tumblr) and Marcin Surma (xulm on Tumblr)! Be sure to check out their other works, they're really good :D\nBy backing this tier you'll get a set of amazing, high quality SUPERHOT posters (we'll be talking more about these in one of the updates) along with all previous rewards. Add $15 for international shipping.\nPledging at least $200 will allow you to play the latest versions of SUPERHOT before anyone else - you'll have firsthand access to (potentially unstable) alpha versions of the game, and your feedback will shape the game. We're currently planning to release the first alpha version before the end of the year. Also includes all previous rewards. Add $15 for international shipping.\nThis limited tier will get you a signed, boxed and DRM-free copy of the game once it's finished; and your name will be prominently featured in the game. You also get all previous rewards. Add $20 for international shipping.\nBy backing this level you'll get a chance to work with us on designing an in-game achievement for the game itself. Think of an amazing challenge for the players and give it a fun name like \"Mike's Trickshot\" (your design will be subject to review). You also receive all previous rewards.\nThis tier allows you to help us design one stage for the endless arena mode that will be included in the final game. We will be open to your design, and you will get to name the stage (although both are subject to review, so it's fun to play). You also get all previous rewards.\nOnly for the biggest fans of the game. You'll receive a unique, hand-crafted by us, electronic device that (while not allowing you to stop time when standing still) might be a mystery tied into the game's plot. Additionally, you will get to co-design either a stage for the endless arena mode, or an in-game achievement. You also receive all previous rewards.\nIf you have any additional questions feel free to let us know - contact@superhotgame.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuality takes time and we want to deliver an exceptional game. We will have an iterative development process - make a small chunk of the game, test it extensively, make changes, test it again, etc. This process can require a longer development time, but the rise in quality is worth the effort.\n\nProject management is vital to teamwork, and we have considerable expertise in this field. We previously developed a range of software products - from complex statistics solutions for education to mobile applications. We are accustomed to working with a fixed budget and schedule, and this experience will be invaluable when working on SUPERHOT.\n\nThe costs of living in Poland are relatively low, so meeting our goal should give us enough money to complete the game without the need for additional financial support.

Every corner of the world has stories of fairies, cats who talk, things that go bump in the night.  What better way to expand on those tales than to mash them up with Lovecraftian horror Mythos?  Most fairy tales are dark morality stories to begin with...  A Mythos Grimmly brings you those concepts with a strong dose of madness mixed in.  The anthology will include AT LEAST 25 unique tales, never before published in the world of men.  \nUPDATE : After realizing that the first video, Story Time with Cthulhu, was spreading panic and madness across the globe, we were instructed by law enforcement to destroy all evidence of its existence.  Today, we were able to obtain new footage for you.  The editor of A Mythos Grimmly shares his side of the story from what appears to be an interrogation room.  But don't worry, we'll bail him out in time to finish the anthology for you.  ;)\nWho are we?  First and foremost, we are lovers of books and tales.  WH Pubs originated going on 15 years ago as an indie publisher for RPG supplements (d20, for you gamers out there).

But she has severe stage fright, so that wouldn't do either. She always loved to draw and paint, however, so she enrolled in classes and took influence from the master of fantasy illustration, Arthur Rackham. She delights in the strange, dark, and macabre, and looks to Edward Gorey, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and H.P. Lovecraft for inspiration. Her work has been shown throughout the United States and Europe in New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Madrid.

Japan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nStretch Goal Info Feat. TeamFourStar\nClick for Full View\n              Inspired by Ace Attorney and Zero Escape games, Exogenesis ~Perils of Rebirth~ is an ADVENTURE GAME/VISUAL NOVEL HYBRID which combines the point-and-click gameplay of adventure games with the heavy focus on storytelling found in visual novels. \nAs fans of Ace Attorney and Zero Escape games, we couldn't help but notice there's a lack of such games in the market. We're always left waiting for the next installment in those franchises for many months, if not years. That's why we wanted to fill the void. \nThankfully, an engine for the kind of game we've set our sights on was already available (major props to PyTom, creator of Ren'Py). We realized we didn't have to start from the ground up, and all that was left to do was put the pedal to the metal. We at Kwan (formerly Agos Studio) put together our skills and years of experience from our respective fields, and thus Exogenesis was born! \n\nMany hours of gameplay - With 6 planned chapters spanning over 150,000 words, as well as numerous puzzles to solve, Exogenesis promises at least 20+ hours of gameplay\nImportant moral choices that effect how the story plays out \u2013 By hook or by crook, your dead sister must be reborn! \nHigh replay value with multiple endings and branching story paths \nMemorable cast of characters whose fates are determined by your decisions \nStunning rendition of post-apocalyptic Japan with real-life landmarks \nMysterious, intricate plots both personal and of larger scale \nMind-boggling, thematic puzzles - Contextual puzzles that make sense and aren't just there for the heck of it \nCharacter interrogation - Gather physical and circumstantial evidence and use those as leverage in recruiting your former comrades \nIt's 2069. Yudai Sayashi\u2019s ragtag club of \u201ctreasure hunters\u201d (referred to as looters by those who know them), Durchhalten, was closer to real treasure than they\u2019d ever been before. Overly eager, Yu\u2019s sister Miho ran carelessly towards the vault, triggering a trap that killed her.\nTwo years later, Yu comes across a startling discovery. The mythical Noah\u2019s Ark, borne of legend by those who believe the Old World can be restored, turns out to be a real thing. \nWith the help of the kid genius Toshio, Yu learns about the existence of the Lazarus Protocol inside Noah's Ark \u2013 a system that can recreate anything from the past \u2013 a machination developed during the time when humanity\u2019s survival was uncertain. Using the Ark, Yu believes Miho can be brought back to life. \nBefore setting out to find the Ark, however, Yu wants to reunite the now defunct Durchhalten. The group had disbanded after the tragic incident two years ago, and he wants everyone to be there when Miho opens her eyes once more. \nSet in post-apocalyptic Japan where people are barely making ends meet, the world of Exogenesis has a life of its own, laden with post-nuclear war dread and threatened by yet another gargantuan conflict. Truly, mankind is never without divisive differences. \nThese themes help define the game not only as one man\u2019s pursuit of his dead sister, but also as a tale of people struggling to survive while the fallen great city of Tokyo is only just starting to get back on its feet. \nWar the Destroyer. No matter what the motives are behind it, destruction is always the ultimate result of war. War waged with modern day weapons, including WMDs and bio-weapons, can push humanity back to the dark ages. \n\nEveryone has something to hide. In this game, every character lies to someone at least once. Healthy relationships are based on mutual trust and understanding, despite individual differences. This is reflected in the conflicts and resolutions of subplots between characters. \nDeath separates.Yu spends the entire game trying to revive his dead sister and witnessing how death separates people in many ways. Families are broken, relationships come to an end, and survivors become detached from the world around them as a psychological defense mechanism. \nNothing is ever what it seems.The story of Exogenesis thrives on twists and turns, keeping players on their toes as the characters selfishly pursue their own ends.\n\nIt\u2019s never a war to end all wars.Unhindered by mutually assured destruction (MAD), World War III erupted prior to the events of Exogenesis. Like the two before it, WW3 was said to be the war to end all wars. Especially so, given the power of modern weapons. However, history aims to repeat itself, with the birth of new organizations that vie for control and power as humanity rises from the ashes.\nNo one-trick pony.There is always more than one way to get things done. Just because a certain approach worked on one character doesn't mean it will work on another, especially since Durchhalten is such a diverse group. Moral choices are often ambiguous, so players need to anticipate what their decisions could lead to. \n\nMay God have mercy.The Sanctus Ordo Illuminatus represents how life after the end of the world could be controlled by religious organizations, the same kind of religious orders that reigned over entire civilizations in the Dark Ages. Another religious group, God's People\u2019s Army (GPA), plans to stop Sanctus from establishing an oppressive new world order.\nEvil is easy.Choosing to take the high road is often more difficult than lying and cheating your way to success. However, one must live with the consequences of their decisions.\n  Production of Exogenesis had been completely self-funded using our director's personal savings, and we've nearly reached the limit of how far we can go without financial backing. We can only reach the finish line with YOUR help! \nAdditionally, there are several features that could greatly improve Exogenesis should you allow us to fund them, such as voice acting, more animated poses and expressions per character, a fully animated intro, a bigger soundtrack - the possibilities are endless, and YOU can make them happen! \nHowever, we've made sure we set a reasonable funding goal that will allow us to deliver the game at a level of quality the team can be proud of. Every dollar you pledge will go towards the development of Exogenesis. Here's a breakdown of how we'll use the funds:\nArt \nAdventure games and visual novels require an immense amount of art assets, from character and item sprites to backgrounds and environmental animations. Exogenesis' UI and logo could also use some improving. Given these points, a large portion of the funds we receive will be distributed to our artists. At the minimum funding goal, we can have both our character and background artists work on Exogenesis full-time as well as commission the needed graphic design changes.\nProgramming \nProgramming has been a bottleneck with our programmer working 2 jobs, so we want to have him working full-time on Exogenesis while still putting food on the table. Right now, we are paying him close to nothing yet he still works long hours and weekends for the team. \nMusic \nFor a game with the magnitude of Exogenesis, we're looking at a minimum of 60 minutes of music. Fortunately, we have composers who can produce an incredible soundtrack. They just need the budget to do it. \nAnimation \nThe game will have an intro video (you'll find a placeholder in the demo) and brief animated cutscenes for certain events. This is a combined effort between our artists and animators, done with camera movements and effects. If we reach the right stretch goals, we'd like to have actual frame by frame animation, which will require a lot of work.\nWriting/Copy Editing\nDirector's Note: My life savings are still good for several months. To ensure I am accountable for running everything smoothly and completing the game in a timely manner, I will take a smaller slice of the pie and keep on carrying some of the financial burden myself. Some of it would go to copy editing and possibly delegation of some writing parts. Personally, I know how hard it is as a gamer to support a project and anticipate its release only to be hit with delays, so I'm making sure we finish Exogenesis within a reasonable timeframe.\nDirector/Writer/Game Designer - Nicolo Sanchez \nFormerly an editor for an online gaming news site which rivaled the big ones (Kotaku, Destructoid, et al.), before it took a dark path around 5 years ago. Nicolo also wrote for a Philippine gaming magazine. An award-winning game idea gave him the confidence to start his own project, and he's throwing everything he has into what is now Exogenesis.  \nProgrammer - Alfie Machica \nAlfie made little games using C# in college, and learned Python on the job as a software developer for a large local retail company. He's used his ability to easily pick up new programming languages on the Python-based engine which powers Exogenesis. He proves the theory that programmers are machines who regurgitate pizza and beer into code. \nCharacter Artist - Kuromai \nShe has a small but dedicated following in the \"utaite\" (Japanese animated music videos, usually of Vocaloid songs) scene for her dynamic character designs and amazing fan art. She brings the characters of Exogenesis to life with her vivid art style and painstakingly detailed animations. Kuromai specializes in character art, but she uses her newfound talent in game asset creation. \nBackground Artist - Vinsensius Suriantoso \nVincent is the lead artist of Indonesia-based studio Awaken Dreams, and is the go-to guy of many 2D Flash game developers. He's done cover art for popular novels in Indonesia, such as Merlin's Tomb and localized Percy Jackson books. \nLead Composer - John Delvento \nJohn is co-founder of the quickly growing music studio Blue Light Music Group, whose work speaks for itself. He's done tracks for major TV commercials and you can hear some of his uncredited music in an upcoming next-gen AAA title. Here is a man who wears many hats and needs to sleep more often. \nAnimator - Mona Liza Dayco \nKnown as \"Ritz\" in utaite circles, she is Kuromai's partner in crime and a talented animator whose work goes beyond the Japanese music videos that she's known for. You can see her work her magic in an upcoming French animated feature film that is currently scheduled for international release.\nAnimator - Eduardo Quidlat, Jr.\n\"Yoru\" is another name that rings many bells in the utaite community. He's been at it since 2009, honing his skills in animation while also contributing vocals to some of the songs he's taken part in. Practically a staple in Chorus Battles, he's responsible for putting together the pitch video you see above and his participation in Exogenesis won't stop there.\nSound Designer - Alex Young \nHis credentials include studying classical music for 10 years and training in Music Technology, as well as Electroacoustic Theory, at De Montfort University, Leicester. After 5 years of working as a session musician, he now spends his time creating music and sound effects for all kinds of media.  \nTo avoid the issues many other Kickstarter campaigns have had to face over physical rewards, and to concentrate as much funding as we can towards development, we're going all digital with the rewards... but that doesn't mean you're not getting the good stuff!\n  \u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\nDigital Soundtrack\n\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\nWe're proud of the music we have so far, and you can trust us to make sure that we complete the rest of the soundtrack with the same high quality music that you're hearing now.\n\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\nDigital Art Book\n\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\nAs fans of video game and anime art books ourselves, we understand how important additional content is. While a bunch of pretty pictures are often fine on their own, it's a lot more fun to leaf through art books with anecdotes from the artists and an extensive interview at the end (Director's Note: The interview in P3's art book was surprisingly profound. LOVED it!). That's why we're going all out with Art of Exogenesis, packing it with as much annotated art as we can, including many sketches from the conceptual stage, in order to show you guys what it's really like to create art for a video game.\n\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\nThank You Video\n\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\nShould we be fortunate enough to be successfully funded, we're going to put together a video showing our gratitude to all our backers and those who helped get the word out. If you choose the CHERUBIM reward, we'll put you into the video as one of the characters. For SERAPHIM, we'll make a custom video, just for you!\nDEMO\nIf you play your games on PC, Mac or Linux, then we've got you covered! We wanted to make sure you get a good taste of the game and not just a tiny nibble, so our demo might be a little longer than what you'd normally see on a Kickstarter. Please note that it's a work in progress that we're improving on every day.

While we're positive that we can meet our release schedule should you allow us to afford having everyone work full time, there can still be unexpected delays. To remedy that, we've extended our official launch date beyond our internal deadlines. While we promise to have Exogenesis available by December 2014, we aim to release much sooner. \n\nIn order to avoid emptying our coffers before the game ships, we've carefully assessed how much we need to complete development. This is why our funding goal is much higher than other indie visual novels; it's what's realistic for us based on the development costs we have incurred so far. We understand we're risking not getting funded at all by setting a relatively steep goal for a brand new game, but we are all wholeheartedly passionate about the project.

It\u2019s a papercraft version of an enchanted board game with tactical, turn-based RPG gameplay in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics.\nPopup Dungeon is as vast as your imagination. You can jump right in with pre-made characters, weapons, and abilities, or create it all from scratch.\nKey Features\nRoguelike: permanent death, quick gains, procedural dungeons, and a mixture of handcrafted and procedurally generated loot\nTactical Turn-Based RPG: fast-paced, strategic game play\nInfinitely Extensible: Users can easily create: weapons, abilities, characters, and enemies.\nPapercraft: We hand-fold every pixel to ensure every dungeon is fresh and lively for you!\nMultiplayer: Hot Seat or Online Coop (Versus mode is a Stretch Goal)\nFlexible Party Size: Dungeon Crawl alone or with a party\nVariable Challenges: Choose the dungeon crawl that's right for your schedule, from single-seaters to infinite descents.\nPersistent Gains: Charms awarded by The Wizard after a run are permanent and give every character under your control a bonus.

Backers at the Juror level and higher will be able to vote on which we'll make.\nHere's a video of our Haunted House tile set still in its early stages:\nDUNGEON MASTER SYSTEM ADDED\nBy popular demand, we've shifted development priorities around to include the Dungeon Master system. Read more about it here!\nCLICK TO VIEW IN HIGH-DEFENITION\n  Thank you for your support!\nCreation is a key part of Popup Dungeon. Users can create and customize every aspect of their heroes from their look and theme music down to their weapons and abilities. Build your heroes using our extensive library of assets or import your own and make something truly unique.\nYour weapon is your source of power! But there's no auto-attack in Popup Dungeon. Instead, think of your weapon as a focus or power-source for all of your abilities. Melee weapons can boost a short-range slash attack as well as a heal, while longbows and sniper rifles may favor long-range abilities: it's all about the range modifier, which you yourself can customize!\nAs with armor and other pieces of gear, players can earn weapons by defeating enemies, opening treasure chests, destroying props, or purchasing them from the Vendi-Machine.\nThey can also create original weapons that will be added to the list of possibilities they may encounter throughout their journey. Here\u2019s how:\nImport an image (use transparency or a color key background)\nA weapon's potency is automatically assigned by level\nChoose a range modifier:\nRange modifiers add potency to abilities aimed at targets that are a specific distance from you\nChoose from a list of available damage types; your weapon will add extra potency to abilities using this damage type\nSelect a bonus (extra potency, additional damage types, extra range modifiers, and effects such as chance to stun, critical, or even add custom flags to targets like \"Fishy\"). These flags can enhance or modify the effects of skills.\nOne of the most fun aspects of game design is dreaming up cool new abilities, but mathematically balancing them and implementing their AI can be difficult and tedious. Popup Dungeon takes care of all of the boring stuff, unleashing your imagination as a creator!\nAbility creation is fast, fun, and easy!\nHere\u2019s how you can create your own ability in just minutes (these steps can be performed in almost any order):\nCustomize look and name\nChoose from hundreds of effects\nAdd Experience Points\nDetermine Activation Cost\nSet Range and Area of Effect\nOptionally: Add Negative and Conditions to enhance the ability's potency of positive effects\nFor more detailed information and to learn how to create your own ability in about five minutes, watch this video:\nEver wonder how a space marine would deal with goblins and dragons? Would the charms of a Pony Princess work on a cyborg pirate? How would Sherlock Holmes fare in a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl?

Then you can easily share and compare your renditions with friends and fellow fans.\nCreate Your Own Custom Skin\nDownload and fill out our simple texture template\nCreate your favorite comic book heroes, movie villains, best friends, pets, whoever or whatever you can imagine!\nSuper-Simple 3 Stat System\nEndurance = Health and Armor Class\nPower = Potency for all Abilities\nSpeed = Action Points per turn\nWeapon Types\nChoose up to 5 Weapon Types.

In Dungeon Master mode, one player acts as the Dungeon Master, manipulating the environment, using special DM abilities to alter the course of an adventure, and controlling the legions of enemies pitted against other players or a party controlled by the AI.\nNow that you've created your weapon, ability, character, or enemy, you can share and compare it with your friends and other players. Using the Steam Workshop, browsing user-generated content will be fast and friendly, putting a nearly inexhaustible source of new characters, items, and challenges right at your fingertips (and making sure your creations are seen too!)\nThe game play is something like Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com meets a Dungeons and Dragons board game. It's turn-based and the movement is handled on a simple grid. While Popup Dungeon will not be \"twitch-based\" or require lightning reflexes, we hope to make the action as lively as possible, with fast-paced, decisive combat.\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nEach run will play differently. The gear you receive and the type of enemies you encounter can present radically different challenges. And with the option to automatically download user-generated enemies and bosses, you never know what lurks in the shadow!\nPopup Dungeon will feature all manners of game mechanics you can expect from games like these, and maybe even some you don't expect! The extensive customization and user-creation system will allow players to put nearly any strategy they can imagine into effect (within reason!)\nPopup Dungeon is flexible. You can go on a lone quest with a single character or control an entire party. We will be play testing and accepting feedback to determine the maximum party size. Our goal is to strike a balance between turn-duration and clutter in relation to flexibility and allowing you to play with larger groups of friends.\nThe dungeon will scale in size, increase in enemy population, and adjust in difficulty according to how many party members you use.\nEach party member can be controlled by a different player via Hot Seat or Online multiplayer. You can play the entire game coop if you'd like or control the entire party yourself.\nThe gear you'll find crawling the depths of our dungeons features a blend of handcrafted and procedural elements. For instance, a weapon's primary statistics and effects are determined by its creator, the potency is determined by its level, whether or not it includes its bonus is determined by its quality, and it also has a chance to include an extra, procedurally selected enhancement.\nThe inventory is simple too! Replace, drop, or turn items into gold on the spot. There's no digging through bags, going to town, or playing Tetris with odd shapes in an inventory screen.\nWin or lose, The Wizard grants you a parting gift: your choice of three prize capsules, each containing a magical Charm. If you don't like the first one you pick, you can always choose again, but the empty capsule remains and the three are shuffled. Choose an empty capsule, and your prize is an abject lesson in the woes of gambling.\nThe deeper you've delved into the dungeon, the more powerful the charms will be, and more powerful charms enable you to go further than you ever have. How deeply will you bury yourself?\nAnd hardcore roguelike players may like to know that the game will feature \"uncharming\" achievements, which can be won only by facing the dungeon without the aid of any Charms.\nYou don't HAVE to make everything. In fact, you don't even have to find everything. You can always buy your way to greatness. After all, it's The Wizard's gold, and he wants it back.\nEncounter various \"vending\" machines scattered about the dungeon depths, allowing you to purchase equipment, upgrade items, reclaim your experience points, and more using in-game gold you collect from your adventures.\nPortals of Fate are optional, high-risk, high-reward, passages that can make or break a run. You never know what lies beyond the portal. It could be a horde of treasure, a vending machine room, an extra-tough boss battle, a whole other dungeon level, or a room of wall-to-wall minotaurs!\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nOur hope is that Portals of Fate will help keep every run fresh and unique by providing game-changing gear and challenges.\nPremise\nLong ago or yet to be, a Wizard from another world stabbed his tower into the side of the Earth like an immense dagger. It pierced into stone and time, deeper than anyone can ever dig. The only way in is through portals scattered around the world. These portals are disguised as enchanted board games, and they come with an invitation:\n\u201cCome, morsels. Your bodies do not interest me; it is human imagination which I invite into my domain. Only the greatest of you will reach the high spire of my lair, now buried deep in the roiling rock. And I will be waiting, fork in hand, to devour the banquet of your creativity with a side of wits.\u201d\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nArt Style\nVisually, Popup Dungeon is an enchanted board game, sort of like a cross between Jumanji and a Dungeons and Dragons board game. The dungeon unfolds, sometimes literally, in front of your character as you explore. It is presented in a papercraft style, but our goal is to make it as lively as possible, with rich animations and particle effects.\nThe papercraft style makes user-created content much simpler. You only need to create a 2D rendering of a weapon, for instance, and the game will take care of the rest. It\u2019s also worth noting that these 2D images are not treated as flat \u201csprites,\u201d but rather as cut-out pieces of paper with thickness.\nCLICK TO VIEW IN HIGH-DEFENITION\nMusic\nThe soundtrack we\u2019re aiming for is rich and orchestrated, featuring epic heroic themes, atmospheric tracks, and jaunty medieval tunes. It will be conducted and realized by the very talented Gabriel Lefkowitz.\nCharacters with Character\nPopup Dungeon will contain a wealth of colorful characters with loads of abilities and customization, so if you don't want to take the time to create your character from scratch, you'll be able to get going with one of these.\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nYou'll be able to organize your collection of characters into their own neat little boxes that you create, like Favorites, Cameos, New Downloads, Classic Games, Comics, etc.\nWe hope to have all the fantasy staples, but we'd like to include plenty of unexpected characters as well. Backers ($29 and up) can vote on which optional characters we create.\nHaunted House Tile Set\n Our Kickstarter trailer only shows the dungeon tile set, but the final version of the game will include many more tile sets, depending on this Kickstarter project's success. Here are some potential inclusions that backers ($29 and up) will be able to vote on:\nPost-Apocalyptic Cave\nWizard's Sanctuary\nStarship\nBleak 80s Future\nSteampunk\nOffice Building\nand many more...\nTriple.B.Titles is a family operated studio based in Dallas, Texas with over a dozen years of combined indie-development experience. Our previous Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in 2012, allowing us to complete Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages, delivering all promised content and then some!\nIf this Kickstarter is successful, we predict it will take us about 2 years to reach a \u201creleased\u201d state. We hope, however, to have beta and early access long before then, as gathering information and feedback on balancing is key to Popup Dungeon\u2019s success. Fans of Ring Runner will attest to the fact that we really and truly listen to our players\u2019 feedback, at times implementing ideas and changes mere days after they were proposed. Obviously, we can\u2019t include everything, but that won\u2019t stop us from trying!\nWhy $80,000?\nWe estimate Popup Dungeon will take us about 2 years to complete. After software expenses ($10,000-$12,000), the cost of generating the soundtrack (amount not disclosed to protect our composer\u2019s privacy), taxes and Kickstarter's take, and of course, all our debts and ongoing payments this is the minimum that we can realistically live on for that time without having to take on extra jobs. That and because we're suckers for round numbers!\nBut in all seriousness, it's very important to us to have Popup Dungeon finished in a timely fashion. For two main reasons, one financial, the other personal.\nFinancial\nIt took us about 5 years to develop Ring Runner because we were going to college during this time, working other jobs (some part-time, others full-time), and learning the trade. If we would've completed Ring Runner in the two years we initially set, we might've not needed to return to Kickstarter again to ask for your help, but divided schedules and long development cycles can really hurt games and a small studio's ability to legitimately make them.\nIt's almost impossible for us to guess what the state of the gaming industry will be like in 5 years. For instance, XNA seemed like a good choice for Ring Runner's development when we started, but it was discontinued before we were even finished with the game.\nPersonal\nMy wife, Courtney, and I (Enrique) live in a house just outside of Dallas, Texas with my brother, Paul. Prior to Ring Runner's release, I was working and studying at the University of Texas at Dallas along with my brother.To this day, my wife has been working a full-time job to supplement our income from Ring Runner's release last year. She comes home at night after 9 p.m. every day.\nSince I met Courtney during the course of Ring Runner's development, it's been her dream to be able to dive heart-and-soul into making games with us. She's the artist responsible for all the lovely characters and enemies you see -- and frankly, we need her!\nMy dream is to make her dream a reality -- to let her work 10-12 hours, 7 days a week like we do, but on something that makes her proud, happy, and takes full advantage of her talents. And hopefully, we'll be able to afford a home of our own after Popup Dungeon's release, so we can raise a family.\n\nInspirations and Special Thanks\nFinal Fantasy Tactics - A True Classic\nXCom - Whose creator, Julian Gollop, has a Kickstarter running now!\nMini Dungeon Adventures - To Jim Bowen, David Carico, Brad McElwee, John Cliett & Jared Lohr.

Another player uses the gamepad to manage resources and teammates, make executive decisions, and survey the land from a bird\u2019s eye view. Hex Heroes can be played solo, but we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll want to wrangle up some friends to join in!\nConcept by Emily Quynh Phan\n Developed in Unity, Hex Heroes first began as a contender in a local game jam in the Summer of 2013. Game jams are weekend-long events in which teams of all sizes gather together to quickly develop a game in just 48 hours. Jamming is a ton of fun, and it really tests one\u2019s limits for delivering a compelling experience. During the jam, we were able to develop what is seen in the video, and while it was only a tiny slice of what we wanted to eventually deliver, we felt we were able to convey the idea of a party/real time strategy game. With your support, we can fully commit ourselves to the project! We will deliver something polished, something fun, and something the Wii U was made for!\n Hex Heroes is like nothing you've ever seen before. For fans of the Real-Time Strategy (RTS) genre, imagine playing a classic game like Warcraft or Age of Empires - you have the world at your fingertips, units to command, and a city to build and fortify by using the gamepad. Those units, however, are your teammates on the couch. They play on the TV in split screen, helping you carry out the decisions you make. It\u2019s going to take a lot of cooperation between the 5 of you to strategize and succeed, but that\u2019s exactly where the fun is. The party aspect derives from the chaos and shenanigans that are likely to ensue, but when you combine your strengths and different viewpoints, you\u2019ll feel a great sense of accomplishment - assuming you\u2019ve not ruined friendships along the way!\nWe all enjoy playing games our own way, and with Hex Heroes\u2019 different game modes, you'll find the style that's comfortable and fun for you. We're starting off with two modes that can be played both cooperatively and single player. Lair Mode tasks you and your team to uncover and seal enemy lairs, while Horde Mode challenges you to protect the townspeople from oncoming waves of enemies for as long as you can. More modes will be unlocked as you help us reach our stretch goals! \nMonster concepts\n It doesn't stop at game modes. Utilizing the Wii U's unique features, Hex Heroes offers asymmetric gameplay using the Wii U Gamepad. Gamepad players see an overhead view of each of the players on the TV. With the touch interface, they can select individual players to upgrade their stats, or construct a number of buildings that power up all the players. The Gamepad is the perfect fit for strategists who want to manage and command. All the while, the TV players harvest resources for the gamepad, fight enemies, and complete objectives. If you\u2019re a more hands on action-y player, the TV is for you.\nBig monster concepts\nPrefer single player? We\u2019ve got you covered! In single player, the gamepad will still have you carrying out executive decisions and managing resources via the touchscreen, but you\u2019ll also control 2 different characters on the field. As a single player, you have the advantage of knowing everything, but you won\u2019t have the help of your friends. It\u2019s an entirely different experience, but one that's enjoyable all the same!\nWant online play? You got it! Hex Heroes will initially feature an online battle mode for single player! We understand there are few games on Wii U that feature online play, and we want to personally grow that library. You\u2019ll be able to take to the online battlefield in 1v1 matches that put your gamepad and TV juggling skills to the test!\nWe\u2019re certain Hex Heroes will earn a spot in your co-op hall of fame, but you don\u2019t need to take our word for it. A bunch of our fellow indie devs think so too! They\u2019ve graciously approved their awesome game mascots to be included as additions to the Hex Hero crew and we could not be happier. Cameo characters will serve as costume swaps for our existing classes, but have their own personalities and animations. You'll have as much fun playing as them as we\u2019ll have Hexifying them!\nThe Game Grumps Three!\nRusty of SteamWorld Dig\n So far, cameos include:\nAlicia of Heart Forth, Alicia\nZoya of Trine\nEgoraptor of Game Grumps\nDanny of Game Grumps\nRoss of Game Grumps\nJuan of Guacamelee\nMax of Mutant Mudds\nShovel Knight\nRusty of SteamWorld Dig\nLady Faye IV of Rogue Legacy\nSubject W of Paradise Lost: First Contact\nCyrus of Wizorb\nThe Drifter of Hyper Light Drifter\nWhen starting a match or mission, TV players will have the ability to choose 2 classes to play at once, having the ability to swap out on the fly. Like range and stealth? Then go with the Rogue/Archer combo. Have a taste for full on support? Match up the Woodcutter and Scout. Want to be a well rounded team player? Go Knight/Woodcutter. Having 8 classes lets each player create their own unique character and role on the team. Finding your strengths with given classes will come in time, and knowing how your whole team functions will serve you well when deciding to assemble your crew. It\u2019s all about balance and strategy. We want teams to really think about a playstyle before hitting the battlefield, and 8 classes makes the possibilities almost unlimited! Here's a little peak at how the classes differ:\nClass voting has ended! Below are Hex Heroes 8 classes as decided by our wonderful backers!\nWe\u2019re developing Hex Heroes with all ages in mind. As a core gamer, you can become really skilled with your favorite class combo and take your strategies to the battlefield, while your little brother/sister/son/daughter can play on the TV hacking and slashing and helping you out on the gamepad. With the gamepad and asymmetric gameplay, Hex Heroes will be able to cater to all levels of skills and will have something for everyone. We\u2019re core gamers at heart, but with the Wii U, we\u2019ve been able to include our family or friends that aren\u2019t as skilled but have just as much fun - we\u2019re looking to replicate that feeling of inclusion.\nWe take our visual quality very seriously and when it comes to games, we like style. The board game look was inspired by our desire to breathe life into something that otherwise might feel lifeless. \nBarracks, Lumber Mill, and Smithy - concept by Casey Graham\nFor instance, little model figurines may appear simple, but they\u2019ll move and feel like they\u2019re alive.\nWith a hand-painted appearance, we want to capture an experience of playing a living board game! Please keep in mind that what\u2019s seen in the video is only a couple days of work - with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the visuals truly sing and Hex Heroes will look as good as it will play.\nAn idea of the visual style we plan to achieve\nCheck out a preview of how our art could look in game!\nUPDATE #17: A Peek into Development\nHex Heroes\u2019 little figurines and magical lands are all about taking us back to playing with toys as kids. Who better to score our game than the composer who scored much of our childhood gaming, Grant Kirkhope! With such memorable adventures as Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, to more epic ones like Kingdoms of Amalur, we\u2019re wanting to strike a harmonious medium. We\u2019re absolutely thrilled to have Grant on board, and we hope our game\u2019s soundtrack will find a cozy little spot in your memories alongside Banjo and Kong. Have a listen to one of our favorite tracks from Kingdoms of Amalur!\nIf you liked that, check out the rest of Grant's awesome work - Music of Grant Kirkhope\nGame development is a dynamic thing and the more donations we receive, the more we can add to the experience. Anyone who backs Hex Heroes will get to vote on the order of some of the stretch goals. This way, you\u2019ll get to decide, and therefore guarantee, that the game we deliver is to your liking! We've already held the first vote, and the backers have spoken! Here's how the stretch goals are shaping up:\nLocal Versus Mode & Journey Mode\nIn Local Versus mode, it's Gamepad vs. TV players (1v4)! The Gamepad takes on the role of overlord of monsters, spawning hordes and coordinating attacks on the TV players. TV players must fully cooperate to defeat the omnipotent gamepad opponent! They will have to take up the mantle of fortifying their town and harvesting resources on their own as they simultaneously fight to survive the Gamepad\u2019s waves of enemies. If the town falls, the Gamepad wins, if all the monsters\u2019 lairs are discovered and destroyed, the TV players win.\nIn Journey Mode, your team must get from point A to point B. Oh, did we mention there will be hordes of enemies and obstacles in your way? You'll need to find your path and overcome the obstacles to make your way to the objective. Go for the gold by achieving the high score!\nMultiplayer Online and Miiverse Support\nWe've been listening and have already included a single-player online mode. For online play, the biggest concern for any indie game on a console is the number of people playing simultaneously. And Hex Heroes also has to deal with different party sizes. But if this goal is met, we'll be developing a multiplayer mode where you can pit your team against another.  \nIn addition, we'll add features to support Miiverse. Collect stamps and post your best photos and art. We're also exploring the possibility of a way for you to interact with your friends in-game similar to Dark Souls or Wind Waker HD.\nPC Online Enabled\nWe know the Wii U will be the ultimate way to experience this game, but we also know it\u2019s doable on PC. It won\u2019t be quite the same experience, but we don\u2019t want to shut anyone out who\u2019s eager to play the game. This also opens Hex Heroes up to a wider audience, which potentially means more backers and more content. That's why we've announced a PC version will be included in the initial goal! :D\nHere are the details on how the PC version will work: UPDATE #10: Wherefore Art Thou PC Port\nSo what does \"PC Online Enabled\" mean? Because the gamepad view is such an integral part of the experience, it will require at least two computers. This means we will create a networking component so you can connect and play with your friends, as well as voice chat. So whether you have 4 players on one machine or 5 computers across the world, we'll try to recreate this unique gameplay experience.\nMap Maker and Sharing\nThe tools to create and share your own worlds! Make impossible gauntlets or peaceful meadows. Once you\u2019re done with your masterpiece, share it with the world!\nExtras and Bonuses!\nOnline Leaderboards: Are you boasting the fastest time to seal all the hexes in your neighborhood? Did you slay 1,000 enemies in Horde Mode? Share your accomplishments in the online leaderboards. \nMusic Player: Dig those crazy Kirkhope tunes in-game, jukebox style! \nDeveloper Commentary: Listen to us talk about our labor of love. We\u2019ll share stories and trade some laughs. It\u2019ll be like a developer sleepover! \nCollectible trophies (a la Smash Bros., including a \u201cbackers\u201d trophy featuring all our in-game backers), secrets, easter eggs, and more!\nBosses Added!\nNot only will bosses unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before be added to the campaign, but after beating the game you'll unlock Boss Rush Mode where you\u2019ll be able to test your boss slaying mettle!\n\nWe\u2019ve thought long and hard to make sure there\u2019s a reward tier for everyone! Most rewards are inclusive of previous tiers, so check out their description for details.\nIf you don't have a Wii U and still want to support our project, your $10 pledge will get you a copy of the soundtrack plus all the goodies in our Digital Grab Bag (PDF instruction booklet/Wallpaper pack/Name in credits/Papercraft, and now digital art book). This offer is not included in subsequent rewards.\nDigital Art Book\nAll this for just $20!\nWe've been blown away at the number of backers who have increased their pledges. To show our gratitude, we are including a digital Art Book at the $20 reward tier and above.\nBacker Bases\nHere's a preview of how bases will look for those who reach the respective reward tiers! Pledge high enough and you'll be able to show off a bronze, silver, or gold base when you play (online too!)\n3D Print\nInterested in backing at the $250 level for a 3D print? Check out all the juicy 3D print details here!\n1 Year of Tutoring\nAt $4,000, you\u2019ll get 100 hours of personal time (through Livestream/Skype) with Mario as he works with you to develop your art skills! 2 hours a week of one-on-one, online tutoring can be yours for the next year. You\u2019ll build a portfolio as well as a rapport, and who knows, by the end you might just be ready to work in the industry! On top of that, during the year, Mario will critique any work you send his way and help you refine your talent. It\u2019s a fraction of the price of a year of school and far more personal too!\nTutoring involves starting with foundational 2D and digital painting/concept art and moving into 3D modeling and texturing. Does not involve rigging and animation.\n*Must have access to a drawing tablet/computer (such as Wacom) and Photoshop*\nOne-of-a-kind Canvas Art\nWe\u2019re adding two new rewards for you art aficionados. Mario\u2019s personal work can now be yours - but act fast, there\u2019s only 2 pieces available! Both are acrylic on canvas and inspired by video gaming, and either can be yours at a $450 pledge (includes shipping, US only).\nTitled: \"Strangers\"\nTitled: \"Gamecubism\"\nHave a look at the rewards overview!\nAct now, rewards are going fast!\nOur roots for gaming run deep, and we\u2019re dedicated to not only recreating the sense of wonder video games provided us as kids, but also innovating and delivering new experiences at the same time.

Extraction Point, The Witcher and more, plus consultation from BioShock designer.\nExtended Gameplay Teaser:\nDeath In Candlewood is an open-world psychological FPS heavily influenced by the gothic fiction of Edgar Allan Poe and classic horror films. A love story between the living and the dead, the game plunges its player into the darkest corners of 1940s America.\nThe game spans a single night in the life of Ray Dune, a doctor whose relationship with reclusive psychiatrist Lester Caravan has reached a deadly crisis point. When his vulnerable adopted son Rizzo mysteriously disappears, Dune is forced to act. Navigating the dark paths of Candlewood Mountains and a terrifying onslaught of inhuman assailants, Dune sets out on a desperate bid to save himself and his son from the bloody machinations of a madman.\nThough Death In Candlewood is played mostly from a first person perspective it is not a traditional FPS. The game world is expansive - including over 1,000 navigable buildings in Candlewood and 6km\u00b2 of surrounding mountain ranges - and you can move around this vast landscape any way you choose. In Death In Candlewood you\u2019ll drive cars and motorbikes, swim through deep waters, use uncommon weapons and face uncommon enemies as you unravel a dark and twisted romance.\nTop-notch visuals and performance immersing the player in a psychological horror FPS influenced by Edgar Allan Poe and classic horror films\n20+ melee and ranged weaponry from bare fists to Maschinengewehr 42s and tranquilizer pistols\nLush environments and unique settings, from 6km\u00b2 of shadowy mountain ranges to 4km\u00b2 and over 1,000 buildings in the town of Candlewood, which can be walked, stalked, driven or swum through\nInnovative genre with mainly FPS mechanics plus role playing customisation, stealth elements and third person POV for driving a range of vehicles\nBuy and upgrade your ammunition, health, equipment and weapons\nCitizens of Candlewood and characters you encounter throughout the game each have branching, reactive dialogue and randomised events\nRange of animal, human and monstrous enemies, each wielding unique weapons\nReactive and intelligent AI so foes and NPCs respond realistically to any situation\nCombat system incorporating line-of-sight and noise sensor mechanics\nSlow-motion cinematic dodge manoeuvres for close range melee combat\nMelee and short-range fire weapons will be more common throughout Ray\u2019s quests, while the rest will be rarely seen \u2013 you can only purchase them at Candlewood\u2019s gun shops.\nFounded by Toni Sanchez and Jingjing Fan in 2011, Rosebud Games is an new developer made up of award-winning industry veterans with previous experience on games like Silent Hill: Origins, F.E.A.R. Extraction Point and The Witcher. Based in Barcelona, Rosebud formed out of experts from different studios who wanted to specialise in creating intense, immersive game experiences for PC, Mac and console.\nDeath In Candlewood, due for release in the spring of 2015, will be Rosebud\u2019s first title as a studio.\nWe at Rosebud Games have been working on Death In Candlewood in our spare time, spending countless nights and weekends on it. We have to work full time on other projects and in other jobs to cover all the development expenses. We completed most of the core gameplay in this way, but there\u2019s still a lot of production as well as a tonne of polishing and testing left to do.\nShooters like Death In Candlewood are big games with lots of content and programming. We need your funding to help us keep our staff on full-time and hire additional staff to speed up production of the game.\nDeath In Candlewood will be our first release, and one we want to be truly proud of. Your money will go directly towards financing the production and release of Death In Candlewood, and helping us produce our first title as a team. Rosebud Games will get nowhere without the support of fans like you!\n$60,000 is the amount we will need to focus full-time on completing Death In Candlewood.\nThough we\u2019re really happy with the existing design of Death In Candlewood, there\u2019s a number of extras we\u2019d like to offer you in addition to the game itself. Here\u2019s what we\u2019d like to offer:\nWe want to focus on making Death In Candlewood as good and as polished as it can be. Rather than using our Kickstarter funding to introduce new features which will delay the game, we\u2019d like to find ways to add more value to the game as a finished product.\nWe are so grateful to each and every single person who backs Death In Candlewood. Only you can make our game a reality!

We\u2019ve built our whole technology pipeline around the established, powerful and flexible Unity engine, which will allow us to develop the game we need while minimising the possibility of technological risk.\n \nRosebud Games will continue to build Death In Candlewood with its core team of dedicated and skilled members, supplementing them if required by high quality freelancers.\n \nWe promise to keep you in the loop about our progress on the game and to deliver Death In Candlewood as promised in this campaign.

Why is that good?\nTreachery in Beatdown City is a tough game to describe, but once people get their hands on it, they are hooked. The game is every much a hybrid of action based brawlers, like Double Dragon, and action RPGs, like Fallout III.\nOur primary goal has always been to make a great beat-em-up with some depth to the combat, and when people play it they generally agree that we've been successful. They also have suggestions, which we have used to make the game better! \nInstead of spending time memorizing inputs, you just pick moves from a quick to use menu, and make cool combos made up of strikes, preset combo strings and grapples/throws to take on a your enemies.\nPlayers can also use Quick Strikes which are great for breaking open objects and can also be used to fight enemies.\nThere are also over the top super moves that do high amounts of damage to any enemies they hit. \nThe game really feels like a combination brawler & tactics game, never veering too far to one side.\n 3 heroes, 3 ways to play!\n Bruce  Maxwell is the lightweight fighter mixing in dance with acrobatic strikes that have a little bit of \"magic\" to his moves.\nBy day Bruce is a wealthy stockbroker with an affinity for Asian languages and culture, but also very proud of his Jamaican roots.\n Lisa Santiago is the middleweight fighter focusing on mixed martial arts and boxing.

You thought that cold case was dead and buried, but a new lead\u2019s crossed your desk that may unearth everything. But as new evidence is brought to light, your sanity starts sinking into darkness.

There\u2019s even rumored to be underground black markets that sell rare weapons, armor, and items. No RPG is complete without a wealth of sidequests, unlockable achievements, and a fun card game!\nCRDTech\nA Battle System that Feels Great. Finally, a battle system that\u2019s simple and fast paced, yet strategic. Timed attacks, timed blocks, skill trees, even team combo attacks\u2014Pixel Noir\u2019s battles will feel great. And if you were wondering, Pixel Noir will be updated and customized for each platform, meaning you\u2019ll never have to sacrifice gameplay for platform.\nSometimes the best offense is an unbelievably weak defense.\nBattle System: Pixel Noir\u2019s turn-based battle system is both fast-paced and strategic. Timed attacks and blocks will make sure that you are always in the thick of a fight. Environments will yield opportunities at every turn to take advantage of. Shoot a chandelier to drop it on an enemy, or have it create cover for you. Found a bottle on the ground? Throw it at an enemy! WHY NOT!?\nWhat dialogue in Pixel Noir will look like\nAttacking in the heat of a battle\nSkills will utilize timed button & touchscreen mechanics\nWho said too much coffee is bad for you?\nInvestigation Mode: Use the Detective\u2019s Investigation Mode skill to not only solve the mysteries in Pinnacle City, but to also find secrets over the course of your journey. No matter where you go, your investigation skill can yield new information on a case, find rare items that will help you in battle, and even uncover hidden items that you can use in the thick of a fight to change your strategy!\nInvestigation Mode\nIt took us about a year to establish the gameplay and story concept behind Pixel Noir. Once we had established the concept and vision, we began to look for investment from any one of a dozen major publishers to fund a smartphone version of our game. Although there was a lot of interest around Pixel Noir and SWDTech, at the end of the day publishers wanted Pixel Noir to become a less serious, free-to-play or puzzle game. Somehow each and every publisher had come to the same conclusion: RPG\u2019s don\u2019t sell.\nAfter months of negotiating back and forth considering potential changes to the game\u2019s core mechanics, we finally made the decision to stick to our guns, raise the funds ourselves, and develop Pixel Noir the way it was always intended to be developed: as a classic JRPG reimagined for today\u2019s platforms. While we seeded early development of the game with our hard-earned dollars, we simply can't cover the cost of building out a full game with this seed funding alone.\nThat brings us here today! With your help, we hope to bring this full scope RPG to your favorite device or platform. Let's create a role playing adventure that blends classic gameplay and a deep story with modern design mechanics. Together, we can bring Pixel Noir to life.\nWe are developing Pixel Noir out of our desire to see games like the ones we loved in the past come back into the mainstream. While publishers claim that no one wants to see the \u2018classic RPG\u2019 anymore, we know that games like Chrono Trigger and Earthbound continue to be highly played and loved by the gamer community because of their compelling stories and great game design. Your pledge will be used to pay for:\nCost Breakdown\nProgrammers. Coding takes hard work and long hours. For some reason, our programmers don't take \u201cunlimited ramen\u201d as payment.\nWriters. They're in deep with the yakuza and bodyguards are not cheap. Playing the odds on Pokemon evolutions is a dangerous game.\nArtists. Our art team claims that pixel art is harder than it looks and that they\u2019re \u201closing time with their families\u201d working on Pixel Noir. I know, we\u2019re not buying it either. But I guess we SHOULD pay for those art commissions eventually.\nAudio. Our audio lead charges by the bleep. Bloops are free of charge though thankfully.\nManagement. We heard you like things managed, bro. So we managed your managers so your management is managed.\nRewards. Rewards aren't cheap. But they are fun. Take a look at the reward tiers to see how much you'd like to pledge!\nAnd finally Software. Thankfully we already have most of the software we need to make Pixel Noir, but that dang DLC. Gets you every time.\nThe full monty.\nWe are SWDTech, a boutique indie game company dedicated to reimagining the classic RPG experience for modern-day platforms such as iPhone, Android, and Steam. We grew up playing games like Final Fantasy, Earthbound, and Chrono Trigger. Games that hold up as well today as they did in our childhood memories, but that haven\u2019t transitioned well to newer platforms. We decided that the world needs a better quality of RPG\u2019s for a new generation of devices. A game that\u2019s focused on gameplay, that feels intuitive, as well as transportive. We\u2019re out to flip all the tables, change the game, and walk out of the room with a jacket flung over our shoulders.\nWe were formed in 2012 and spent a year finding and hiring the perfect team. In 2013, we began concept development of Pixel Noir\u2014our first title.\nOur development team is locked, loaded, and ready to fire on all cylinders. Most of us are experienced professionals that have been on multiple projects with both AAA companies like Capcom, Marvel, DC Comics, Cartoon Network, Sony; and smaller Indie companies like WadjetEye Games, Indestructible Cannon, Hotslug, and more! We\u2019ve come together create the RPG we\u2019ve wanted for over a decade now.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a smaller development team for a game this size. It's possible that we may have delays on the timeline due to resourcing limits.\n\nWe have to work with Sony on the cross-save functionality with them.

You can also subscribe to our mailing list to get the latest news on Chaos Reborn developments.\nThank you all backers for supporting Chaos Reborn - do not disbelieve!\nCreature skins are backer exclusive rewards for Wizard Lord level (noble skins) and Wizard King level or above (royal skins).\n'I\u2019m excited about Chaos Reborn because it turns out to be a smart and interesting game even in this early, prototype form \u2026 it feels much more like the work of a smart young design-punk than something feeding on the sour blood of nostalgia.' - Alec Meer, Rock, Paper, Shotgun\nChaos Reborn is a game with nail-biting decisions and twists of fate. Every battle is different, every realm is unique, and there is always something new to discover.\nBased on my cult classic ZX Spectrum game \u2018Chaos\u2019, first published in 1985 by Games Workshop, Chaos Reborn is part sequel, part re-imagining of that original game brought up-to-date with high quality presentation. \nThe magic combat system remains true to the original Chaos. It is all about summoning a host of weird and mythical creatures, moving and fighting with them, and using your wizard to attack, defend, buff and de-buff with large array of spells. It is highly tactical and fast paced. But Chaos Reborn expands considerably on this by offering multiplayer modes, a single-player RPG system and co-op play.\nThank you for your support, and I hope to be playing Chaos Reborn with you soon.\nThe Rewards\nOur reward levels give player the opportunity to play some interesting roles in the game from the start. It should be emphasised that there is no pay-to-win situation since every player begins with a level 1 wizard and a meagre selection of spells, and any player can ascend through the ranks from Wizard Lord to God - given some effort and tactical ingenuity. Backers, though, will have some social safety net and will get some aesthetic perks, such as their special Wizard Auras. Check the FAQ and the detailed section on rewards below.\nStretch Goals\n$200k pledge level reached - Localisation of game text - at a minimum French, German, Italian and Spanish, plus a small selection of other languages to be decided based on demand and costs.\n$240k pledge level reached - Android/iOS platform support - a full version of the game available for mobile phones and tablets. The game will be a free download from app stores, and if you are a Kickstarter backer you will be able to unlock the full version without any additional cost (i.e. it will be a true cross-platform game).\nIn the beginning, the gods promised power and immortality through the gift of magic. In a short time the corruption and greed of humankind plunged the magic kingdoms into conflict, unleashing the forces of Chaos. Powerful beasts were summoned into the realm of men, and potent magic warped the landscape. Eventually the world was rent asunder, fractured into island realms split between planes of existence. The Gods of Law regained the upper hand and brought order to the realms by installing Wizard Kings to control the knowledge of magic. But the Gods of Chaos conspired with their devotees, and hid within the realms powerful magical artefacts for Chaos to rise again.\nAt the start of the game you are an apprentice wizard hoping to build your spells and equipment in order to become powerful enough to ascend the ranks through Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod and ultimately God,  where you can influence the fate of the cosmos.\nAt the core of Chaos Reborn is the battle between wizards, fought in an arena with a limited selection of spells. The last wizard standing is declared the victor. Features include: \nQuick playing, turn-based combat. Battles typically last 10-30 minutes. \n80 unique spells, including 24 creatures - from dragons to goblins - fully animated in the 3D Unity Engine. \nClassic spells from the original Chaos - including the Gooey Blob, Raise Dead, and Magic Wood. \nBluff and deception - summon creatures as illusions for 100% success, and use Disbelieve spell on suspected enemy illusions. \nManipulate the balance of the Cosmos between Law and Chaos to your advantage. \nProcedurally generated 3D battle arenas with various types of terrain, and different levels of elevation. \nMultiple game modes, including Classic Chaos mode - fully random battle set-up with random selection of spells. \nThe original Chaos was always renowned as a great multiplayer game that could mix up human and AI wizards for a truly exciting battle. Chaos Reborn builds on this, adding several new features: \nMultiplayer online matches - asynchronous or live \nOffline multiplayer battles on one machine (hotseat mode) \nOnline rankings and league system \nTournaments with prizes \nExtensive co-op options, for multiplayer matches - 2 vs 2, or human co-op vs AI players \nGuild system with guild rankings and guild tournaments \nTrade items and equipment with your friends or guild members \nA major innovation in the Chaos system is the vast single-player RPG experience called the \u2018Realms of Chaos\u2019. You start as a new wizard with just a few spells and you must explore the Realms of Chaos, defeating the Wizard Kings that rule them in order to build your power and magical knowledge. \nWhen you enter a Realm you must seek out and defeat the Wizard Lords, the loyal minions of the Wizard King. As you travel the Wizard King will build his power and reinforce his Wizard Lords, so efficient exploration and effective combat are the keys to success in the Realms. You will discover things to help you and hinder you along the way, and you will build your spell knowledge and equipment as your progress. Once all the Wizard Lords are defeated you can challenge the Wizard King, and if you are victorious you are certain to win valuable treasures and potentially rare or unique artefacts. Here are some of the features of the Realms of Chaos mode: \nNew realms to explore each day - procedural generation system can create a near infinite variety of adventures\nPlayer generated realms - if you are a Wizard King you can design your own realm for other players to explore\nHundreds of different types of equipment to collect in your adventures - including staffs, body gear, headgear and magical artefacts \nBuild your spell knowledge by acquiring Spell Books through combat or trade \nWin gold from battles to spend on sea passages, teleports, mountain passes, realm maps, spell orbs and more. \nLevel up your wizard to gain access to higher level Realms \nLevel up individual items of equipment by entering their \u2018Inner Realms\u2019 - a series of dungeon like levels with unusual guardians \nCo-op mode - invite a friend or guild member to help you fight a battle in the realm you are exploring \nShare Realm Maps and your own experience of Realms with your guild members \n The RPG system in Chaos Reborn is very flexible. Your wizard\u2019s abilities and stats are entirely determined by the equipment given to him, so by using different configurations of equipment and spells you can personalize your wizard and play style, and try to optimise your tactics in battle. The equipment also determines how your wizard will look.\nWizard equipment consists of a staff, headgear and body gear. The staff has a special ability which can be activated after the staff is powered up during battle. For example, a staff might be able to unleash a lightning storm over a wide area, or flip the balance of the cosmos from Law to Chaos, or clone any creature in the arena.\nEach item of equipment may be levelled up individually, but you may only equip an item which has an equal or lower level than your wizard level. Thus your wizard level actually represents your mastery of magical technology. As equipment levels up, it\u2019s powers increase, thus increasing the power of your wizard. You can use equipment in Realm Quests and in multi-player online battles, if the battle rules permit it (\u2018Classic Chaos\u2019 mode, for example, does not allow equipment use). Equipment can be traded with other players for gold or other items, or it can be purchased in special locations inside Realms, or won as spoils of war in battle.\nExtra copies of the game for $15\nYou can add extra copies of the game to your reward for $15 each. Extra copies include early access to playable versions of the game but no other rewards (no art book, game guide, etc.). If you backed at the Apprentice tier or above, for each extra $15 above the price of your tier, you get an additional copy of the game. To do this you have to increase your pledge by multiples of $15 without changing your selected reward. For example, if you backed the game at Wizard Lord level for $50 and you increase your pledge to $80 you will get two extra copies of the game. I will send a survey out at the end of the campaign to check with you exactly what you required with your increased pledge amount. Please note that you can only buy a maximum of 8 extra copies this way.\nReward Tiers\nIf you back the project at Apprentice tier and above you will have access to early playable versions of the game before the official launch, and you can participate in the design process through the Chaos Reborn website.\nWith the Forgemaster tier and above you get to design and name a set of rare equipment items. The game has a procedural generation system for equipment with wide variety of visual designs and game effects, but in this case you will get to design your own equipment and its visual looks using an equipment editor program. Your wizard will start with your equipment, but it will be possible for other players to find more copies of the equipment you designed - with your author tag attached. \nIf you select the Wizard Lord tier or above, you have important status within the wizardly realms, and an extra play mode that allows your wizard to act as an NPC for other players to encounter in their realm exploration. In order to do this you have to go online and configure your wizard by choosing equipment, spells and battle tactics. While you are offline your wizard will be controlled by AI and may be involved in multiple battles. When you go online you may review these battles, which can then help you refine your wizard configuration. Your wizard will earn experience points and gold by using this mode. \nIf you choose the Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod or God rewards, your wizard has status, but still begins as a level one wizard. In order to be effective when deployed as an AI controlled wizard in realms you still need to go adventuring in the Realms or play multiplayer battles so that you can level up your wizard and equip him properly. In other words, you have no initial advantage over other player except access to an exclusive game mode.\nOther players can still ascend the ranks from Wizard Lord to God, with a lot of time, effort and ingenuity. They can also be demoted from these positions to make way for better players. However, if you backed the game at a certain level you can\u2019t be demoted from that level. For example, if you back the game at \u2018Wizard King\u2019 level you will always be at least a Wizard King - you can\u2019t be demoted to Wizard Lord, but you could become a Demigod or God. Also, the special wizard auras are unique to backers - other players don\u2019t get them, even if they ascend the ranks through game play.\nT-Shirts\nThe design features a black T-shirt with the Chaos Reborn logo on the front and a special message on the left sleeve reading '30 YEARS OF CHAOS 1985-2015' and the gooey-blob sprite from the original Chaos, which is my personal avatar. It is an Anvil Jersey T-shirt made from pre-shrunk combed ringspun cotton (meaning it's very soft and comfortable). Shipping is included for US residents. Please add $5 shipping for delivery outside the US.\nNOTE: If you have backed at $250 or higher, you will automatically get a T-shirt included in your reward at no extra cost!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will be sent a survey for you to provide information for your mailing address and T-shirt sizes. T-shirts will be delivered to backers before the end of May 2014. However, we will endeavour to be as quick as possible with this delivery, so I hope you will get them sooner.\nAdditional T-Shirts\nIf you want additional T-shirts, please add $30 for each additional T-shirt you want to your existing pledge level. Shipping in the US is included in the price. For delivery outside the US, please add $5 per T-shirt.\nI have been working on Chaos Reborn for over a year, refining the game design, creating a playable prototype and building my team. With your help I will use the Kickstarter funds to put my small but talented team to work full time on Chaos Reborn with the objective of completing the game by May 2015. I have set up a new development company called Snapshot Games Inc., and the development studio will be established here in Sofia, Bulgaria, where I have been living for the last eight years. I will use my extensive experience as a designer and producer build a highly effective and creative development studio. Snapshot Games will be solely dedicated to working on Chaos Reborn until completion.\nThe Team\nApart from myself I have a core team of five experienced developers, each with 7-10 years experience in game development. I also have input from expert freelancers, who have already contributed to concepts, animation and modelling. I intend to keep my core team small and focussed, based primarily on talent and expertise. My personal experience both as a designer and game producer will help keep the project on track for delivery.\nIconic and distinctive creature design is one of our main objectives. The colour schemes reflect alignment - cool colours for Law, hot colours for Chaos and earthy colours for neutral.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChaos Reborn has a lot of online and co-op features which means that we need very robust server-side code and infrastructure. I will devote a lot of attention to this during development. We have teamed up with a local middleware developer, Game Cloud Continental, to provide the bulk of our game server systems, and we will work closely with them to develop any specific, proprietary features we need.\n\nOn the game design side we will be relying a lot on procedurally generated content. The algorithms for creating arenas, realms, NPCs and equipment need to be very good in order to provide players with a rich and diverse experience.

Stay tuned... \nABOUT PLAY ATTITUDE\nPlay Attitude is an unusual publisher, established to realize the dreams and artistic visions of a group of people that could never get them published through large commercial publishers. At Play we work based on our personal desires, not market trends or commercial possibilities. All our projects have this touch of \"artist's love\" that make them truly special. Check out our beloved works: Forgotten Colors, \"El Recetario M\u00e1gico\" and The Guardian of Imagination. \nDavid is one of the founders of the Play Attitude team. The publication of Ravings of love & death is David's biggest dream, which he's had for a long time... Whilst working with him on this project over the last two years, it has also become ours!\nWho we are? In order of appearance:\nTeo Grimalt: Composer \nEfr\u00e9n Garcia: Editor\nCarlos Ruiz: Designer\nNaiara Chaler: Communication\nDavid G.

That\u2019s why we decided to start a Kickstarter campaign: we truly believe that such a beautiful book must be shared with everyone who enjoys Poe's stories, David's illustrations, or simply anyone who enjoys literary classics. \nWe know this art book will be one of these objects that you enjoy and save knowing that you\u2019ve got something really special.\nWe want to do an amazing art book, and are aware we are aiming for the sky! We want to include all those features that we've explained that will make it a unique edition.

The game features hardcore survival and player interaction in dark science fiction setting. You will be able to select from one of the 8 classes, equip your marine out with your weapons of choice and co-operate with your team using advanced tactics to stay ahead of the enemy.\nBunker up! Some amazing advanced tactics, bunker defense action in this exclusive new Kickstarter screenshot\nThe game is real time with a top-down perspective and features randomized map features (items, missions, monsters) allowing for good replayability for every mission playthrough which may last up to an hour or less depending on your team's capabilities.  \nStorm can get really bad, and you have to handle it! :)\nThis is a tactical game that involves a lot of action and shooting at the same time but tread carefully, ammunition and medical supplies are not unlimited and lacking either will get you killed quickly, so you must constantly manage you resources and scavenge more if you have long term survival plans. \nFortyfying a position while waiting for friendly reinforcements to arrive via dropship. Taking care of the baddies in the meantime.\nAs you play through your mission, the enemy swarms will get larger and harder to the point where you will be overwhelmed if you don\u2019t deal with them. You must constantly be on the move looking to accomplish your main and side objectives, as doing so successfully will reward you with ranks and medals.\nSingle player campaign\nBesides the 8-player coop core campaign in TRS we currently do have fundamental development and setup done for narrative focused single player campaign as well. It will definetly be a part of the game but we do need more funds to develop it as we originally intended, with enough details, emotion and flavor. If we manage to hit the needed stretch goals we will have enough to invest into developing a rich and epic story based single player campaign with great cutscenes. But because of your requests we have decided to make a substantial singleplayer campaign part of the MAIN FUNDING GOAL right now. Although the full blown epic version remains a part of our stretch goals.\nThe Red Solstice is currently expected to release on Windows, PC with future possibilities of being developed for Mac, Linux, tablets or even consoles.\nIn the year 2060 the Earth was ravaged by a virus pandemic of a magnitude greater than the Bubonic plague. The virus spread quickly, those who were infected became something less human, willing carriers of the modern-day plague. Government action came too late, and as the chaos escalated corporate agencies rushed space programs in a desperate bid to evacuate the planet, since a cure could not be found. The fledgling colonies of Mars became humanity's last bastion, and since no traces of the virus was found among the lucky few who boarded the space vessels bound for the Red Planet, it was believed the danger had been averted.\nIt is now the year 117 AE (After Earth) terraforming is well under way, however during an exceptionally violent storm dubbed The Red Solstice, communication lines between Tharsis, the colony referred to as The Capital and the remaining human settlements of Mars are disrupted. The Elysium Corporation deploys its elite marine task force to investigate what happened to the colony.\n\"The Sumerian chthonic deity Ker, a great burrowing worm whose digestive tract is a doorway to the Underworld.\" It's basicaly a big, huge bad and mean sandworm that players need to battle. Part of primary storyline is based around it.\nWhat they find will forever change their lives and the lives of all the inhabitants of the Red Planet.\nThe Red Solstice is a new breed of core tactical shooter, and as such it will challenge your skills, so good consideration has to be placed on character, weapon, and skill selection, resource management, player positioning, friendly fire and of course team play and strategy.\nRandomized gameplay\nSince the game is randomized at every play through, enemies will appear in different places and resource allocation will change, the player must adapt to succeed. Even a well planed offensive may fail, so it is important to react and adapt fast.\nProtecting a VIP and fortifying your position while under heavy pressure, if VIP dies, bad things happen!\nThe game has several difficulty settings, however if you are looking for a greater challenge instead of the standard ship landing you have the option to arrive on Tharsis via drop pod, which separates you from the team. In this way you will have to fight just to reach your team and regroup.\nFeatures\n- Teamwork and Tactics: The game\u2019s strong point is its player co-op. Up to 8 player may form a squad and the game will scale to how many team mates you have. Forward thinking and good planning is crucial to success.\n- Random loot: With every playthrough you will find new (cool and random) items on the level. As you cannot carry everything, you must decide what will you take with you - medical supplies, support items or even explosives. Your success depends on your choice.\n- 8 classes: A lot of the play style diversity comes out of the ability to choose one of the 8 available classes for your character - Assault, Heavy Support, Recon, Marksman, Demolition, Terminator, Hellfire and Medic\n- Survival: Over the course of the game session growing swarms of mutated monsters and rebels will assail you, keeping your adrenaline racing and your heart pounding.\nInsurgents, their commander, and the usual welcoming party, they are one of many enemies that will put all your survival skills to test. Different and more cautious tactics will need to be applied to take them down safely.\n- Sandbox Map and High Replay value: You will be able to choose how you go about your missions. Either free roam, camp or use some exploratory tactics or other over the top audacious plans even we haven\u2019t considered.\n- Gear up and Scavenge for supplies: The Elysium Corporation will provide you with a large assortment of brutally effective arms and armor. Also, other ordinance and supplies may be found in the field to help you win your battles.\n- Achievements and Ranks: With bravery and valor you will be able to save the Tharsis colony and, in so doing, you will earn medals and ranks. Follow the Way of the Warrior and you will triumph!\nExtended gameplay video\nYou have seen our Kickstarter video, played the demo, but you want more details? Well the best thing would be to have a peek at extended gameplay video being narrated by our charismatic CEO Hrvoje Horvatek. So here you go...\nOur main goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to secure the funds needed to polish up the game, add a lot more new content and finish up the development during next four months! While doing that early access beta will be available to all our backers after and including the Special Recruit reward tier.\nBut what would happen if we manage to gather more support and money then we expected? We have a plan!\nOne of the next steps would be to add a very substantial and cinematic singleplayer campaign to the game, making it even more attractive and diverse to variety of players.\nWe will elaborate more on all of our stretch goals as we pass the main funding goal, so for now just have a quick peek at what the future holds in our infographic.\nMac and Linux support are definitve options if we make the stretchgoals, tablet support might be on the way as well...Mac and Linux support are definitve options if we make the stretchgoals, tablet support might be on the way as wellMac and Linux support\nThere is also the possibility of adding MODDING tools at even higher stretch goals.\nWe wanted to somehow reward our supporters for spreading the word about this Kickstarter campaign and the game itself so we have decided to opt for two various ways of doing so.\nNew monster every 1000 Facebook fans \nWe will be adding a new monster to the enemy roster as we gather every 1000 new Facebook fans at the official The Red Solstice Facebook page.\nNew boss monster every 1000 Kickstarter backers\nAs we gather more and more support from our Kickstarter backers we will be adding a new epic dangerous boss monster to the game - after every new 1000 backers.\nIf we manage to gather some really high level of support we will be announcing few more surprises!\nAbout the team\nIronward is a small but experienced indie team from Croatia. We are trying to create something new and unique that has not been present at the market so far. We think that games need to evolve and new things need to be presented to the players. So far we have been working on The Red Solstice for few years and we have financed the whole development by ourselves.\nPreviously at various other teams our members have worked on many smaller game projects like Legacy: Dark Shadows, Dominance: Throne of Elders and Tale of the Forgotten Ones. The Red Solstice is our big breakthrough game as team and at the same time our dream project! Missing members from this picture are Gregory Hlavac and Danijel Ribi\u0107!\nCore of the Ironward team at Reboot InfoGamer con - Hrvoje Horvatek (CEO and game designer), Davor Ivanu\u0161 (progammer), Vjeko Ko\u0161\u010devi\u0107 (artist), Danijel Mandi\u0107 (environment artist/scripter) + some of our close supporters.\nMost of the rewards for the game are digital in nature. We decided to offer only very limited amount of cover art posters and just one more very special physical reward for our highest backer tier.\nPledge Add-Ons\nYou have asked for them and we are here to answer! We are adding first batch of possible pledge Add-Ons that you can add to already selected reward tiers by simply adding the needed amount to your updated pledge. So here they are:\nAdditional game key - 12$ each (add up to maximum of additional 3)\nFull squad game key set - 70$ (pack of 7 additional keys, limit of one per backer)\nSpecial Kickstarter backer forum access\nGain access to special backers forum at www.theredsolstice.com soon after the Kickstarter is over, includes every tier after and including Special Recruit reward tier.\nGame keys\nAll game keys will be delivered to our backers over email. As the game has already been Greenlit all of those keys will be Steam keys.\nBeta\nWe will be offering Beta early access keys to all of our backers that support us at Special Recruit or higher reward tier level. Expected Beta release date is a month after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nIt's a perfect plan, gone perfectly wrong! Someone pressed the wrong button?\nShort digital comic\nWith great art from Ironward art team, it will serve it's use as a great introduction to characters and setting of The Red Solstice.\nLimited edition cover poster\nAll backers from Squad Leader tier and up will get our limited edition cover art poster, signed by The Red Solstice team. (10$ should be added to your pledge for shipping purposes).\nPDA Objective\nOne of the game objectives marines need to finish is find veteran bodies scattered around the map, they provide certain data, like for example, how your comrades died. If you have chosen this reward, you might be on the list too! Here is an example!\nPDA found on dead marine, containing info about his squad.\nName a building, or a street?\nIn central sector of Tharsis - the colony where the game is set, together with the help of developers you will be allowed to name some buildings, streets etc.\n*All names must be within our naming policy, meaning it must be within some reasonable sense and fit the game world.\nFluffy Armor\nVery special complete armor set that is only available to select few The Red Solstice supporters from early Alpha days and to a very limited number of high tier Kickstarter backers.\nFluffy, a weird name, but a fierce creature, of course they had to make an armor from it. It's a vanity thing! Equip yourself on the field with this special \"Fluffy Armor\" set, let others see you got what it takes to kill a fluffy, or die trying!\n As you can see we really love our monsters in The Red Solstice :)\nThis... is a FLUFFY!\nEverything is in your hands now, we are counting on your support marines!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs our game is already near the final stretch of development it just needs few more months of very active development, additional art creation and extensive testing to be completed.

We are doing that to give our early supporters the advantage of unique item. So don't loose your chance to obtain it :)\nOnce again, guys, thank you!\nHey, guys! My name is Richard and I\u2019m the creator and game director of After Reset, a post-apocalyptic RPG, and I\u2019m excited to tell you about our latest project: The Fall of Gyes. This 32-page graphic novel will shed light on the backstory of the game\u2019s starting location, as well as one of the game\u2019s companions, while delivering a compelling sci-fi narrative in its own right.\nAfter Reset RPG: THE FALL OF GYES is now featured on Crowdfundfusion.com!\nOur goal is to create a graphic novel that has the same cinematic and storytelling quality of classic films like The Thing or Aliens, in a claustrophobic atmosphere where no one knows exactly what is happening or who the enemy is until disaster strikes. \nThey called it the Reset, the great apocalypse that nearly destroyed all of civilization. In the blink of an eye nuclear fire laid waste to the planet, and those that survived were buried in ash.\nThe wealthy and privileged few had found sanctuary in the United Government\u2019s bunkers, hidden deep underground. Here the old world still flourished, engineers carving out an ever-larger metropolis under a stone ceiling, while the planet above them burned.\nOutposts were established to keep dangerous technology away from the population, and  provided a conveniently secluded locale to house test subjects, and enemies of the state.\nIt is here that our story takes place, in the outpost called: Gyes. A 20-year-old intern of the United Government\u2019s Military Corps has just completed his last year of training. Everything seems to be falling into place for him. The job, the girlfriend, a place of prominence in his own corner of the world. Then They came. Surface dwellers. Killers. Thieves.\nIt seemed impossible. How could anyone on the surface have survived the Reset? Yet there they were. With Gyes defenses sabotaged, its containment units failing, biological samples that were once secured in a deep freeze are now exposed to open air\u2026 and everything falls apart. Surrounded on all sides by Stalkers, biomass horrors, and a collapsing structure, will this young, wet-behind-the-ears intern survive? Could anyone?\nBack us, and find out! If you\u2019re a fan of games like Dead Space, or classic sci-fi and horror films from Ridley Scott and John Carpenter, we think you\u2019ll love this story.\nWe feel that a graphic novel is the perfect format for this prelude to the summer release of After Reset RPG's prologue chapter. For our initial funding goal of $12,500 you can expect thirty-two beautifully realized pages in classic 17x26cm (for print), or 6:9 ratio for digital. If we exceed our funding goal, we will be able to offer additional print sizes, and the possibility of additional issues as part of our stretch goals.\nExcluding unforeseen delays, we anticipate the release of the graphic novel in June or July of 2014, which is right before the After Reset RPG prologue will be available on STEAM Early Access.\nCreator and Producer: Richard Nixon\nArtist: Adam Burn\nWriter: Jeremy Wilfinger\nBesides the wealth of business experience that I, Richard Nixon, bring to the table, the team here at Black Cloud Studios has a wonderful mix of experienced professionals from all over the world. For this project, we\u2019ve also recruited the fantastic artist, Adam Burn, known to the Kickstarter community for his recent work on Telicos Protocol. After looking at Adam\u2019s stunning work and extensive portfolio, I knew he was the right man for the job. We also have the writing talents of Jeremy Wilfinger, our resident editor, who will bring the world and its characters to life. With your funding, we can make this project an awesome reality!\nWell, that\u2019s our project. Thanks for your consideration!

Its intricate plot and outstanding voxel based design offers opportunities for intense action and unlimited creativity. Planets\u00b3 has been designed to promote multi-player gameplay, to share the fun with friends.\nToday, in the early development stage, all the elements are in place to develop a first PC (windows) release. What we need now is your help to make it happen!\nUpdates\nEvolution and stats\nMaterials and combat system\nMaterial's recipes\nMultiplayer\nGravity\nRumors have it that aliens who look like humans, crashed onto the planet some years ago. What happened? Where are they from? Why did they crash? Are there survivors?\nTo discover the answers to these questions, Planets\u00b3 players will have to solve a number of mysteries and build up their own little world, before expanding into the universe. Many adventures await them and they\u2019ll find plenty of help -and enemies- along the way. As they progress, they\u2019ll be able to level up their character to achieve more and more freedom, till they can roam the universe in their own starship, which, by the way, they may have created themselves\u2026\nWho said the Earth was round?\nPlanets\u00b3 adventures take place in a universe entirely made of 25cm\u00b3 blocks (voxels). Each planet represents thousands of billions of blocks. The blocks can be combined in a variety of ways to build beautiful objects and landscape elements of all shapes and size.\nConcept Art\nFree to roam\nIn this completely open world, freedom is the key. With entire surroundings that can be completely modulated, destroyed and recreated as you wish, the only limit in Planets\u00b3 is your own imagination! But this freedom comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, to leave our planet and visit the universe, players must unlock their own personal spaceship, or build one themselves\u2026 And you\u2019ll need the natives to grant you their trust, so you can master the craft system and learn new skills.\nShare the journey\nYou will find lots of characters during your journey, natives who will ask you to complete tasks for them. Once you have gained their trust, some of them will allow you to use their crafting skills: they will then become Job Masters, Job Masters are essential for your progression since they can provide assistance in many ways: They can research new recipes for you, help build new structures, repair broken items, dismantle objects to learn how to reproduce them; they can also harvest crops for cooking, and of course, fight by your side against any enemy\u2026 Job masters can be blacksmith, goldsmith, engineer, fighter, cook, builder or farmer.\nThe first one you will encounter is Watts the blacksmith. He will be the one to teach you how to craft low level tools, armors and weapons.\nExperience an amazing evolution\nPlanets\u00b3 is split into zones, which represent different levels of difficulty and mark the progression of the player in the story line.\nYou\u2019ll be able to level up your avatar and improve your character\u2019s skills while playing. In fact every action will improve one of your statistics: For instance, running and jumping will improve your form, making you run faster and jump higher; Pushing your limit will increase your stamina and endurance; Using heavy tools or weapons will improve your strength, and make it easier for you to use them.\nIncrease your technical level\nYour technical level is defined by the level of the tools you can create. How do you progress in this area? When traveling from one zone to the next you\u2019ll find new resources that can be used by the Job Master to research new recipes and craft more powerful items. You can also improve your technical level by taking the enemy\u2019s gear after you win a fight, to use it directly or to bring it to a Job Master to dismantle it and discover new recipes.\nThe more advanced your technical level, the more powerful the crafted items will become, but also the more complicated the recipe to create them (requiring more resources and/or rare resources).\nChoose your combat mode\nWith Planets\u00b3 you decide how you wish to fight: You may want to be a heavily armed warrior, fearing nothing except the lack of enemies. But perhaps you will prefer to play an undetectable ninja, sniping enemies from a long distance or sneaking up from behind\u2026 Players teaming up can combine their favorite fighting styles, so that, together, they can take on the most challenging of enemies.\nFight the enemies in dungeons\nDungeons take up a big place in the Planets\u00b3 story and in the secondary quests. Inside each dungeon is at least one boss, who protects a long hidden treasure by sending out enemy apparitions. To put an end to the attacks and reach the treasure, you\u2019ll have to get past the enemies and kill the boss. The treasure itself is a chest full of useful objects, with some unique items in it, which you can bring to a job master to discover new recipes.\nMost dungeons are destructible, but you will need to have the adequate tools to do so. Some will prove to be indestructible for the moment, and you\u2019ll have to make it through their labyrinth to get past them.\nBeware: enemies in Planets\u00b3 are clever. They will work together in groups, aiding each other to fight intelligently against you. When an enemy apparition is killed, there is no random reward but you can take the armor or the objects they were wearing.\nAnd explore every corner!\nAn important part of the adventure will take place in the depth of the planets, where danger is ubiquitous. Of course the player will harvest valuable resources (minerals or crystals), but mainly he will be led there by the story in order to solve quests or mysteries.\nConcept Art\nMore than just an adventure game, Planets\u00b3 is also a construction game, entirely composed of blocks. The wide range of shapes and materials allows you to create everything you need: tools, vehicles, housing\u2026 A hundred different materials are represented, including woods, rocks, metals, dirt, sand, gravel, transformed materials, and of course\u2026alien technology and materials! You\u2019ll be able to use them as you see fit, to make whatever you have to throughout the game.\nCrafting is key\nCrafting is the essential feature of the game, and the only way to evolve. All objects (except gathered resources) are done by assembling subparts; each subpart makes the tool unique in terms of form and material.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you find an object, with a subpart you can\u2019t craft yet, you can choose to dismantle it to learn how to reproduce the object at will or construct new objects with this newly acquired subpart!\nEquip every weapon\nIn Planets\u00b3 players can equip every weapon, whatever their progression. There are no restrictions, but each weapon has an important statistic for its use, called the \u2018recommended strength\u2019; this makes it easier or harder to use depending on your character\u2019s strength.\nBecome a builder\nSome quests in the game will ask the player to build houses (Job Master\u2019s houses for example) or vehicles. To accelerate things you can call on the builder Job Masters to help you out. You will then be able to record the building patterns for key structures and reuse them in another spot, at another time in the story.\nTravel the universe\nDuring your journey you\u2019ll come across animals which you can tame and mount. But the best way to travel is to create the vehicle you wish: Just assemble the blocks to get the shape you want and add the necessary control blocks (motor, cockpit, wheel \u2026). Vehicles control blocks are crafted as any other object in the game, but the player will need to find the engineer job master to unlock the recipes.\nGround vehicles and animals are not the only means of transportation. Planets\u00b3 will have specific control blocks for spaceships!\nSome of the stretch goals can unlock other specific control blocks for boats, planes and helicopters.\nCustomization and Sharing\nThe entire Planets\u00b3 universe is customizable via xml file (or Planets\u00b3 editor if the stretch goal is reached). Crafts can be modified, but also textures, 3D models, quests, planets generation (landscapes), predefined constructions and so on \u2026\nUltimately, a tool is due to be integrated in the Planets\u00b3 editor and implemented on our website so that players can easily share their creations.\nIn the case of multiplayers, customization is stored on the server so that when you join a server you will automatically upgrade your client files.\nWe are three friends who graduated from the same engineering school in France. We share the same passion for video games. After gaining experience, during 9 years, developing a range of applications (professional applications and/or video games) for Windows, Mac, mobiles and even consoles, we decided to found our independent game studio, Cubical Drift, last year in october.\nWe surrounded ourselves with competent and truly motivated people from different horizons (creative artists, graphics and musician) to develop the game of our dreams\nEvery aspect of Planets\u00b3 reflects what we like in video games: old classic RPG, new open world RPG, adventure game and \u2018sandbox game\u2019.\nToday we aspire to dedicating all our energy to this game.\nWhy should you trust us? The fate of our company and its team depends on the success of this game.\nMeet the Team\nMore about the team in the update #5\nTechnology\nWe use Ogre as our 3D engine, because we have years of experience with it.\nWe have developed specific multithreading algorithms to be able to display a massive number of blocks with a large (almost infinite) viewing distance in real time. This allows you to see other planets from the surface (by night and without clouds!). This was our focus in the actual prototype.\nAmong our top interesting features:\nMarked progression, with clearly defined zone levels\nScalable UI: you craft what you need (a map, a watch, radar\u2026)\nAn \u2018In Game\u2019 vehicle construction system to build your transport solutions\nNatural elements taken into account, such as planets alignment, because all the planets are in motion!\nRealism, with features like pipelines to transport resources, different smelting furnaces for metal, electric circuits management, farming and animal husbandry\nTechnical challenges\nPlanets\u00b3 is full of technical challenges such as:\nLarge viewing distance: you will be able to see everything that is happening in the solar system you are in\nMassive amount of blocs to display: a planet is composed of 32 000 000 000 000 of blocks! One tranche of planet is composed of 1 billion of blocks!\nComplex physical engine for blocks made vehicles\nCommunity Sharing management (to enable players to share their creations)\nParts of these technical challenges have been addressed. In particular, before coming to Kickstarter, we had created the \u00absub resolution based view distance\u00bb engine, which is the major display feature of the game. We reached that goal in December. Sure it will take us a lot of time to optimize the engine, but the hardest part is done!\nHere is an actual game footage. The dev team has been focusing on technical challenges leaving aside the gameplay and the artistic aspect of the game.\nPLAY\n\nAs for now 10% of the game has been developed (game design, artwork, development bases), but we need you to make the other 90%!\nRoadmap\nAs you see some of our stretch goals are really ambitious, and developing them will take more than a year. This is why we decided to release the game in 2 parts:\nThe first release, named Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, is to be finalized, with all features complete, for the fall of 2015 and will include all the goals up to 500 000$ (with the Planets\u00b3 editor). It will take place in the first solar system, with the storyline suspended beyond that...\nWe are targeting 2017 for the release of the 'full game', named Planets\u00b3: Space Enemies, which will open onto the universe and lead to a climactic story ending. Some clues will be scattered in the first opus, though mostly in annex quests and dungeons.\nBudget Breakdown\nMost of the funds will go to development and artwork, the two bigger parts of the planning in terms of the number of persons involved (we will expand the team) and the time needed to complete them. The game also requires writing the story, the quests and working on the sound. These are key to success, even if less demanding in financial terms\nWe plan to sell the game at around $30. As a backer, it means you'll save some money when you support us ; two birds one stone !\nKickstarter Pledges\nAll Backers (whatever the amount) will receive a special thanks in the game credits and an access to the private discussion forum.\nContact and/or delivery for pledges will occur this summer.\nPledge add-ons\nYou just need to add the chosen amount to your current pledge and reward tier:\nFor each additional +$10, you will get an extra digital download (1 access to the alpha, beta and release). Available from the $35 tier and above. Limited to 5 per account.\n For each additional +$20, a set of 3 pets that will help you in the game. Available from tiers between $15 and $100, included in the $200 tiers and above. Limited to 1 per digital copy of the game.\nWe want backers to get something that will make them feel special when starting to play. Something that feels unique.\nHere are the 3 unique backer pets :\nMore about the add-ons in the update#8\nKickstarter Stretch Goals\nAll Kickstarter backers (>=$15) will get free access to the first PC (Windows) game, Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, AND the second, Planets\u00b3: space enemies, as soon as they are available.\nAs backers, you will also be kept up to date on the evolution of the game; we will update you frequently with weekly news, monthly development reports (newletter). What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll take part in the final design of the game. We will open a forum to discuss your feedback and we will listen to you!\nWe\u2019re convinced Planets\u00b3 has all the ingredients for success.

You'll never need to spend hours on resource management or grind random encounters to get to the next fight. \nInstead, our goal is to vigilantly remove every extraneous feature from the game to focus on its heart and soul: squad-based tactical combat.  \nPlatform: Available for Windows/Mac/Linux and desktop browser.\nBusiness Model: Every battle unit and spell is earned by spending time playing the game.  As a result, this is NOT pay-to-win!  Just like you, we want to buy a good solid game that we can go home to and play regularly with our friends.\nCustomize Your Battle Squad: Recruit a large roster of 100+ battle units and spells each with different abilities that interact in unique and endless ways during combat. No squad or battle will play out the same.\nSkill-Based Tactical Combat: The emphasis is on unit positioning, understanding your squad's abilities, anticipating your opponent's capabilities, and maintaining board control. At it's core, it's a tactical tabletop board game without all the manual math calculations. \nOnline Multiplayer: Find equally matched players to play head-to-head anytime in Ranked or Draft mode on various competitive tiers.\nShort Sessions: Each game session is designed to be played in less than 30 minutes. Now you can play competitive skill-based games without investing hours towards a single session.\nNAGF (Not Another Generic Fantasy): The world of Duelyst has an expansive identity and mythology where you will see gorgeous landscapes filled with rich, complex characters, untold stories, and unraveled histories.\nAt Launch: 6 Factions with a roster of over 100 faction-specific and mercenary battle units and spells.\nRanked Draft: Each player forms their battle squad from the entire collection of units and spells available in the game in a Draft format. Each turn will last 90 seconds in a multiplayer head-to-head synchronous live game.\nRanked Normal: Each player creates their own unique squad of units and spells from their own collection of units. Each turn will last 90 seconds in a multiplayer head-to-head synchronous live game.\nPractice Casual:  Non-ranked play with no limit to the length of time for each turn.

A close friend suggested that it should be rebuilt as a digital online game so that more people can play it outside of our small circle.\nAs a result, Duelyst quickly turned from a tiny prototype to a full-package passion project for all of us.\nOur team vision is to create thoughtful, immersive games. We want to create persistent value so that you always know you're investing your time and money wisely.\nWe decided on Kickstarter because we didn't want our games to be adversely impacted or muddled by publishers or non-gaming investors. With your crowdfunding help, our team can focus on the game itself with minimal external influences.\nAs a result, the end product will be better with a more laser-focused, singular vision.

You have the ability to call forth battle units and cast powerful spells to battle against your opponent's General.\nVictory is achieved by defeating your opponent's Bloodborn General.\nSquad Types\nBattle Units: Each Battle Unit has 4 key stats: ATK, HP, Core Cost, and Unique Ability. Only Battle Units can move and attack on the battle map. \nBattle Spells: Each Battle Spell has 2 properties: Core Cost and Spell Effect. Spells generally target empty tiles, allies, or enemy units. Spells targeting units will typically be permanent (but can be cleansed/debuffed).\nSquad Composition\nFor Ranked Normal mode, you pick your Faction and then choose faction-specific battle units and battle spells.\nAdditionally, you may pick neutral spells and mercenary units to complement your squad with no restriction on unit to spell ratios.\nThere is an upper bound of 25 total units + spells per custom squad.\nCore Cost\nCores are the primary resource cost for taking actions such as deploying units, casting spells, moving and attacking with your units (for those familiar with tactics / ccgs, this is essentially your AP / Mana Pool).\nAt the bottom of your screen is an Action Bar with 6 Active Slots. Each turn, empty slots in your Action Bar are refilled and randomly drawn from your pre-built custom squad composition of Battle Units and Battle Spells.\nBattle Units in your Action Bar can be deployed on any empty tile around your General (assuming you meet the Core Cost requirement). \nBattle Units deployed on the battle map can move-attack or attack once per turn for 1 Core Cost. \nBattle Units cannot take another action per turn (unless modified by a unique ability / spell). \nBattle Units cannot take an action on the same turn as its deployment. Spells in your Action Bar can be cast on a target unit or tile based (assuming you meet the Core Cost requirement). \nDeployed Battle Units and cast spells are discarded from your pre-built custom squad. \nTurn Sequence\nThe turn ends when the player runs out of Cores with no actions left to complete or 90 seconds (for live matches).\nAt start of each turn, any empty slots in your Action Bar will be refilled and randomly drawn from your custom squad build of units / spells.\nThe match begins with 1 Core for Player 1 (first mover) and 2 Cores for Player 2 (second mover).\nPlayer Cores will increase by 1 up to a maximum of 6 Cores (excluding terrain bonuses) at the end of the turn.\nIf a player completely depletes all squad components, the player's General will continue to receive -1 HP each turn. \nBattle Units\nMovement: By default, Battle Units can move 2 tiles (unless modified by a Spell or Ability).\nAttack: Melee Units can only attack adjacent tiles. Ranged units can typically attack up to 2 tiles away (including diagonals).\nCombat Resolution: Units at 0 HP are immediately removed from the battle map (ie. no reviving). \nTerrain Tiles\nTiles can offer temporary or permanent bonuses if a player's unit continues to occupy it (eg. +2 Cores).\nLine-of-Sight\nAllies can fire and move through friendly units (but not through enemy units). \nSome Battle Spells and Battle Units can deploy covering shields to block line-of-sight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk will be ensuring we can deliver our game to you by December 2014 at the highest possible quality. \n\nThis means many months prior of QA / Beta testing, battle unit/spell balancing, and multiplayer online stability and reliability.\n\nTo mitigate this, we'll always be staying in close touch with you during our development process to keep you informed on our status and any unexpected challenges that we might encounter. \n\nWe removed a lot of risk by creating a fully working tabletop board game before ever writing a line of code. \n\nMoreover, our team has shipped many AAA titles + consumer mobile /web products in the past on incredibly tight deadlines and budgets.\n\nMost of all, we're 100% committed to shipping and delivering our game to you no matter what.

Announcement. Big publisher. Voxel engine\nSurvival, crafting, drones and laser weapons\nMood, trait and ambition system, as well as multiplayer plans\nAbout us\n And the brand new voxel terrain engine. See youtube\nWe've been working on Proven Lands with a super small team for some months now, creating a game in you become an explorer - not just another sandbox item collector. Packed with the real mysteries of physics, biology and chemistry, plus tons of (hopefully) reasonable science-fiction, influenced by Star Trek, Don't Starve and Project Zomboid. \nIn Proven Lands survival is our strongest concept. It starts with a stranded astronaut -- you. You fight hunger, thirst, strange animals, weather and even the nature itself. Give the pre alpha demo a try, attempt to survive for a few days. Right at this moment you\u2019re able to eat everything with your helmet on (for demonstration reasons) but because we aim to be a hard sci-fi game in the future you\u2019ll have to take off your helmet first before you can eat anything. Your initial spacesuit is weak and old. However you\u2019ll need an armored one to survive against stronger animals and armed aliens later on \u2013 oh, and you\u2019ll need better weapons than an axe.\nAs soon as you\u2019ve mastered the first terrain biome (desert), there will be plenty to discover such as steppes, savannah like environments, forests, big rivers, caves and different planet types such as ice or volcano - each filled with tons of items and characters. The AI game master will watch your influence in a region so after some time more intelligent animals, and perhaps even aliens will start to attack you. First off though we start with simple alien villagers and introduce you to a rather basic storyline. And, because it\u2019s a sci-fi survival game, build devices, smaller machines, factories and before you basically upgrade your \u201ccamp\u201d to a small one-man outpost -- similar to an advanced camp in Don't Starve, just deeper, bigger, and more sci-fi.\nThe story engine of Proven Lands has two sides -- a main story and an AI-driven meta game.\nThe main story is thrilling but also a little bit philosophical too - about friendship, bravery, responsibility and even a pregnancy. You assume the role not of a scientist or a soldier, but a a working class hero or heroine. You're named after the real-life Teruo Nakamura - a soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army who did not surrender until 1974.\nThink of the AI meta game engine as a pen & paper game master who gathers all the randomly generated elements unique to each player's experience and weaves these components into an one-off adventure. You'll be kept busy battling thirst, hunger, oxygen deprivation and dwindling energy supplies .... but as soon you've gathered enough resources, seek out for new civilizations!\n Intro music track\n Monolith music track\n Night Is Scary music track\n Key Concepts and Game Mechanics\nModding - We love mods! Proven Lands was designed with mods in mind, from the get-go.   \nProcedurally generated - Endless and seamless procedurally generated terrain with different biomes on different planets. So far we have desert, forest, river, mountain, hill, swamp and lake biomes. \nAlien races and eco system - In Proven Lands aliens participate in a simple eco system. Trade with a tribe or village, if you have something desirable, similar to Don't Starve.\nAI meta game - The AI is the director of your unique story based on custom quests, ambitions and events - like a pen & paper game master.\nClasses and no super powers - Proven Lands has some RPG elements. Everyone starts as The Forklift Driver with no super powers and a broken heart, and as time goes by new classes unlock: The Medic, The Pilot, The Engineer, The Soldier, The Scientist, and The Android. See stretch goals.\nMoods and ambitions - A mood and trait system makes your character less predictable. A wound left unattended might lead to fever, which could in turn lead to mental instability or death. See demo. Ambitions are quests with a deadline, chosen by you or the AI meta engine, similar to Crusader Kings 2.\nBuilding, housing, farming and eco system - Craft automatic ore mines, water drills, energy and oxygen generators to make your life easier. Proven Lands is not a sim, but there is a small eco system, influenced by an older game jam prototype called LOST UTOPIA. \nCrafting - Each item, weapon, tool, vehicle, drone and building has 7 modules: a base module (type) plus 6 extra modules. Extra modules for armor, power cells, shielding, special abilities, incredients or decoration. For instance, a knife: tool base + short steel blade; or a bio scanner: tool chassis + biology level 1 scanner; or a M1 Abrams tank with a scanner: car base + kevlar-uranium armor + smoothbore gun + turbine engine + bio lvl 1 scanner. ;) Aliens craft items depending on the planet's resources.\nSkills - Basic skills like condition, endurance, willpower, strength. Scientific skills like biology, physics, engineering, ehemistry and xeno sciences. And item skills like blunt weapons, laser weapons or drones (depending on your knowledge). Each skill with an own small skill tree. \nArchaeology and technology - Explore uncharted regions, unknown items and creatures, lost civilizations and artefacts. Your character progresses not only through skills, but through item and artefact knowledge. You do not develop revolutionary physics after a few nights, instead, you gather knowledge in order to become a specialist. Dismantle alien devices for undiscovered resources! See ASCII roguelikes as Dungeon Crawl or Cataclysm.\nOutposts and camps - You're not a camper with a huge bagpack. An outpost is for the long-term, with generators and storage.\nAirlock and natural organism - Thirst, hunger, insanity, oxygen deprivation and energy consumption. On some planets you need an airlock to eat, drink and survive.\nPower supply - Sci-fi devices depend on energy. \nSpaceship artefacts - Sometimes you\u2019ll find useful spaceship parts scattered around the planet. \nItems, resources and item modules - From food to wood to stones to water and megalomaniac butterflies. Each item can be analyzed from level 1 to 3. \nTools, devices and weapons - From a shovel to a scanner, from a navigator to generators and small factories! Aliens have their own devices, weapons and tools too. \nSpaceship, jump drive and space travel - Travel to other planets as soon you've a jump drive or gate. Your spaceship is not a ship, it is more jump gate in the orbit with a few special modules, dictating where your next journey starts. In order to jump to the next planet, talk to aliens and gather resources. \nOne more hour - Most survival games are not known for chill time: you are a laboratory mouse, always in a rush, starving or defending. So, we're working hard to give you more time for exploration and archaeology, or for just being cool.\nAlien companion - Start with the space cat from your first spaceship. \nInfluences\nGames - Dungeon Crawl, Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, Crusader Kings 2, Starflight, Minecraft, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, The Sims, SWTOR, Dead Space 1, Dwarf Fortress, Diablo 3\nMovies, TV and comics - Star Trek (TNG, DS9, TOS, VOY, ENT), Alien, Planetes, Enemy Mine, Outland, Gravity, Contact, Nausica\u00e4, Star Wars\nA few notes\nNew Classes: Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Scientist, Android and Robot - You start as a Forklift Driver, but new classes unlock as you play the game. The classes are based on your lost crew members. For instance, the android class focusses on energy, debris and metal. \nNew Episodes: 6, 7 and 8 - Make new friends and enemies. Discover a completely new side of Minamata, your first planet. There is something shocking below the planet's surface you didn't know before.\nNew Planet Types: Moon, Low Gravity, Volcano and Ice - Moon, Low Gravity, Volcano and Ice - Discover no- and low-gravity planets; landscapes with limited resources. Discover a heavy industry planet with mining towns and an eruptive nature. Each new planet type adds new flora, fauna, items and resources to the universe.\nNew Creatures: Yuracats and Guribulls - These are the concept names for quite a number of completely new creatures.\nNew Creatures: Huge Animals - Do you like dinosaurs? How about a huge animal wandering around in your neighbourhood. This part is a little tricky, due to their size (i.e. animation and combat), but fun.\nNew Creatures: Insectoids - A whole new family with particular skills and stats, different from planet to planet, with new resources.\nNew: Drones - Drones are an important part of the civilized life in the future, far more than in most sci-fi novels and movies. Daily life is different now: everybody has a drone. \nNew: Co-Op Multiplayer - Multiplayer would be amazing! Rafael already started to work on a nodejs/mongodb based server. Let's start simple with a co-op for up to 2-3 players on a planet. We have plenty of ideas here.\nNew Mini Game: Space Submarines - We've been thinking about a short mini-game for the shill out moments. We start with the idea of a voxel-based cloaked spaceship submarine sim xD\nNew: Terraforming - Let's add basic terraforming to the game, allowing you to alter the physical landscape. Basic digging is already in the making but the concept has a lot more potential...\nNew: Randomly Generated Meshes and Models - Do you like Spore? As we already know how to generate models using computer science and math, it could become something special. We start with procedurally generated stones and shrubs, and move on to trees, houses, items and weapons by the time.\nNew Planet Type: Underwater - Well! This is an amazing new world and something we've had in mind for months. We would recycle a lot of current assets and add new mechanics like flying, diving and piloting a submarine-like vehicle. But it is really special and unique - underwater creatures, cities and sub-stations. \nRAFAEL @btxsqdr (FOUNDER, ENGINEER, GAME DESIGNER, CREATIVE DIRECTOR) -- A Saber Rider for 13 years now with pro XP in over one hundred web, desktop, mobile, and VFX projects as an pro engineer. Made his first board game aged 8, learned to code on a C64. Did math and computer science. A degree and a scholarship. A huge sci-fi, games, knowledge and diy fan. Likes board games, Star Trek and Terry Gilliam. Working on a book about game design of procedural generated games. Quite a number of game prototypes. \nMORITZ (FOUNDER, BUSINESS) -- Invented by Silver Surfer, he did some impressive stuff before. As soon as Rafael and Moritz became friends they started to work on a few overambitious ideas. They have secured a few situations to make sure that a game like Proven Lands can be done. Moritz is our business, legal and Kickstarter guy.\nJEFFREY @couchmonaut (2D ARTIST, CONCEPT ARTIST) -- In his early childhood days Jeffrey pursued a figure skating career, but was eventually sifted out due to the high standards of a sport program. Fortunately for us his interest shifted to digital art and games on his grandfather's Amstrad CPC instead. A graduated artist. For some reason Jeffrey and Rafael became a super exciting sci-fi and board game combo.\nContributors and Friends\nDEK @dekdev (3D ARTIST) -- Rumor has it that Dek is an axe wielding, crazed viking slaying dragons on his motorcycle and raiding dungeons all day. Scientists however have proven that he is actually a young guy currently living in Berlin who really likes to create art and video games and to attend to game jams. He once found a treasure chest.\nTOM @nebulousflynn (SOUND DESIGNER, TRAILER EDITOR) -- Tom is a sound recordist and audio designer from the UK who grew up by the sea and now lives in London working as a multimedia designer. When he's not mixing and editing (or attending game jams), he likes to get out into the world and record audio.\nWRENCH @wrenchse (MUSIC COMPOSER) -- Contemporary composer gone rogue, Jonas is an audio engineering and electroacoustic composition student. While you might know him for his critically acclaimed soundtrack for Unmechanical, Jonas has great plans for game music, working on a few projects. Listen to his other music here.\nSpecial thanks to Andy (graphic and logo design), Oliver (ambient tracks) and Ioannis (story intro and second trailer).\nThe history of Proven Lands goes back to an IGM game jam, 7-8 months ago. Back then there was nothing, except for Rafael, early concepts and a few voxel-based prototypes. If you remember those first hours in Minecraft, your curiosity, your first shelter, you probably know how rare such game moments are. This is what Proven Lands is -- it is about the survival in the unknown.\nWhy Kickstarter? We have considered taking a private investor on board. We had a few interesting offers regarding publishers and investors. However, in the end, we came to the conclusion that Kickstarter is still the best choice for us. We also learned that a 3D procedurally generated science-fiction survival-roguelike-RPG-whatever such as Proven Lands is hard to evaluate, to say the least. A successful Kickstarter campaign is not only cool but proves that you guys believe in such a game as much as we do!\nWhy 299k? We've been thinking about the goal for a long time now. We'd like to be honest and keep our word. 299k sounds a lot for a single person, but not for a team, for 12 months. If you subtract 5-10% for Kickstarter, 20% for taxes, as well as social security and other costs, then you have approx. 150k for 12 months, which breaks down to 12.5k per month, for a whole project. That high goal is for a dream team of 8-9 friends for  a time period of 12 months.\nA few notes\nBecome an astronaut - Thank you so much, mate. Warm hugs from us. You are now part of our journey. Tell a few friends about us.\nChoose a copy - First up, we launch on Windows in Spring 2015. After that, iOS and OSX, and then Linux and Android. Additional release dates will be announced after the Windows release. PS4 or XBOX ONE are interesting, of course, but we'll see about it.\nGame credits - Impress your family! Your name in our game credits.\nOriginal Game Soundtrack - Wrench is composing our awesome music soundtrack. See above for a few music samples. If you know the Unmechanical soundtrack, you know that this one will be awesome as well. This soundtrack comes as digital release only at the moment.\nCompanion Book - Another piece of wowsomeness. It contains tons of illustrations, sketches, notes on the universe, the story, the characters, the vehicles and items, even upcoming ideas and extensions. It gives you a unique look behind the scenes. Digital only, as a high-resolution PDF.\nTumblr item DLC, Day item DLC, Night item DLC, Plant DLC, Creature DLC, Space suit DLC, Tool DLC, Weapon DLC, Vehicle DLC, Epic item DLC - All extra DLC items will be revealed within the next few months, but we'll make sure that it's worthy of your pledge. A \"day item\" is useful by day. A \"night item\", well, it's useful by night. A plant, creature, space suit, tool, weapon or vehicle item will make your life easier. Also, an additional tumblr item for tumblr users. Why tumblr? Uh, to be honest, thanks to the support of our tumblr fans some situations went... more smoothly. It's a gift. So, if you pledge as a tumblr user, show us your blog and you'll get an extra item.\nName a plate, a statue or get your name carved on a wall - A name of your choice on a plate, a wall, a house, a statue in the game. All names will be added to the random name list. Bear in mind that we'll want to make sure that the name you propose is reasonable, which means it will need our approval.\nName a plant, a tree, a creature, an item, a village or a planet - Propose a name for these things, even a village or planet. All names will be added to the random name list. Bear in mind that we'll want to make sure that the name you propose is reasonable. \nDesign a plant, a creature, an NPC or an alien race - Send us a photo, a concept, a model or just an idea. You have the chance to influence the process a few times. Show off your skills, impress your grandparents and become part of the game world.\nDesign a story or novel character - Did you ever wanted to be a character in a story? Describe in a few words the character. You'll have the chance to influence the process a few times. In-game NPCs, fellow gamers and perhaps journalists will talk about you for the rest of your life.\nAlpha and Beta access - Join the alpha and beta squad and help us with bugs, ideas and issues. \nGodlike - Geez, you must be the god of backers. Thank you! If you go this far, we can talk about many things. Name a planet after you. Help us design a novel character. And if you really as excited as we are, we could talk about your reward in general. We'd like to be fair.\nPosters and 3D prints - Grab a poster. Or, grab a 3D print (physical scultpure) of Teruo, our main character; additional 3D print model blueprints will be revealed in a few months. What posters do we offer? Most of the 2D art, and additional posters as seen below. More soon.\nProven Lands Con - Well, just a silly idea. We thought about a release party for backers only or something. Depending on the campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe hope you like the pre alpha demo. It is just an early version after some months dev, polished and limited for Kickstarter.\n\nGame development and creative-IT-rocket-science projects in general are often more complex than planned, therefore it is important to focus one's efforts, especially for procedural games with a story and an AI meta game like Proven Lands. You never know. But with a combined 30+ years (!) of experience between Rafael and Moritz alone, plus a bunch of great talents, we believe we are up to this task. \n\nMany challenging parts of Proven Lands are done -- like basic modding, endless procedurally generated terrain with a desert biome, water, canyons and hills, basic AI, an item and inventory engine, an organism, mood and trait system, even basic combat, crafting and collecting. There's still a lot of work to do. But, we are confident that we can and will make it within 1 year. Now we just need you and your help. ;)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "thesetales\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Proven Lands is funded!

To learn more about the PS Vita/PS4/Wii U/Xbox One version, as well as the Akihabara zone and content we have plans for, go take a look at the update!\nKoe\uff08\u58f0\uff09pronounced \u201cko-eh\u201d is a role-playing game in the style of traditional JRPGs such as Dragon Quest, Pokemon and Final Fantasy and is influenced heavily by them. Koe will be released for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux with plans for it to be released on Playstation Vita. The special edition of Koe will only ever be available through this Kickstarter campaign!\nEssentially, what I want to do in the game is give you an introduction to the Japanese language within the game itself. I know people who are interested in this style of gaming, as well as Anime and Manga, and who have wanted to learn Japanese because of it, but have no idea where they should start. So why not a fully-fledged story-driven JRPG that gives you a nice start with the language itself?\nBefore I lose you with the education side of things, I want to tell you that the game itself is a game before anything else, not a flash-card application nor a voice recognition translator, but rather I have put the game, and therefore the gameplay, before anything else. This means it plays like a JRPG, there are random battles, bosses, a story, pets, wizards, cities, houses as well as cats and you will play through collecting items, experience points, weapons and everything else that comes with a traditional JRPG.\nWhat people are saying about Koe\n\"Those of us who enjoy RPGs but don't speak Japanese have missed out on some solid games due to the impenetrable language barrier, and this seems like a fun way to learn at least the basics of Glorious Nipponese.\" - Jason Schreier, Kotaku\n\"What is truly brilliant about this mechanic is that the player is constantly repeating exposure to the appearance and the meaning of the cards used in combat\" - Gaijin Goomba\n\"As someone who initially struggled learning Japanese with little more than a notebook and Hiragana Mnemonics, I am jealous of gamers who can begin their long quest with Koe.\" - Sam Worboys, The Otaku's Study\n\"Not only does Koe teach players a new language, but also enables them to enter into a whole world of JRPGs that have never been translated into English.\" - Springwise\nAlso featured in Wired (UK), Wired (Japan)[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], BitPulse, TheVitaLounge, BPA Japan[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Japanator, psfk, NewSphere[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Japan Daily Press, Hardcore Gamer, Technology Tell, Inside[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Gigazine[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Rocket News 24, \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6e09\u731f\u8a18[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e]\nWho is it for?  \nIt's for you! No, really, whether you have zero experience with the Japanese language or you are well versed and looking for a supplement for your studies, or just want to play a JRPG for old times' sake, then this is for you!\nThe story\nI'll give you a short synopsis of what happens in the first few minutes of Koe.\nFollowing JRPG tradition, you'll get to pick whether you are a boy or girl and name your character. You're then sent on your trip to Japan and begin your adventure at the airport. However, this place isn't what you expected it to be. Shortly after arriving, you'll be sent in to a world of castles, cities and dungeons, while making friends and companions along the way.\nI'll get straight to the point, I absolutely love the Japanese language. I've been studying it for a few years now and the biggest hurdle for me was when I was starting out. I didn't know where to begin, or what to use because there are so many tools and reference materials out there, and I had no idea which one would be the most approachable. Koe is everything I wanted help with starting out in the form of my favorite gaming genre and brings together not only the technology, but also the culture behind the Japanese language.\nWell then, how does the Japanese language exactly fit in to Koe? Well, it comes in the form of items. All items in the games are basically Japanese words that are initially taught to you using communicative language teaching techniques, which is easier said as \u201cyou don\u2019t really have to be taught anything, you\u2019ll learn the words from using the items\u201d but, obviously, most of the game and descriptions will be in English because this is an introduction to the language, so the game will help you every step of the way, though don\u2019t expect any help when you\u2019re out of cures and almost killed by a 2-headed dragon.\nKoe features a traditional turn-based battle system, where you are given Japanese words from various sources (NPCs, chests, monsters, shops etc) and you use these words as moves in battle, you can even combine them to make sentences for better moves! For example, you may get the Japanese word for the traditional Japanese sword, katana/\u304b\u305f\u306a as the item below.\n You can then select this word in battle to vanquish enemies.\nWhoa! See what happened there? You just summoned a sword from the word itself!\nIf you\u2019ve never dabbled across Japanese before, the big character, \u5200, is a Kanji, a character adapted from Chinese, and the characters on the side are in Hiragana, a syllabary in Japanese. In this case, the Hiragana is basically the way to read the Kanji.\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t understand this here, Koe will have a great introduction to this, and you\u2019ll be able to revisit it as much as you like! For now, let\u2019s look at the characters on the side \u304b, \u305f, and \u306a which are ka, ta, and na, respectively. See what that makes? Katana! In Koe, these characters are the very soul of battle, so the more you use your moves, the more you will power up those characters.\nAs you power up the characters, your moves will get stronger, become more useful or change completely! You will need to power up all of them though, there are dozens of moves, and 3 different charts! If you\u2019ve never seen Hiragana before, the charts look similar to this;\nObviously, all of this will be taught to you, and you will start off with only a few characters, and earn others along the way.\nOne other way the characters you level up are used are through something called avatars, which are monsters you can capture and fight alongside. For example, if you capture a cat (neko/\u306d\u3053) then you need to level up ne and ko to level up your avatar!\nAvatars can use their own moves and learn new moves from watching you use Japanese words in battle.\nWhat you will learn\nThe Japanese syllabaries, Hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a) and Katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca) so you will be able to read basic Japanese.\nKanji (\u6f22\u5b57) and their readings, as well as their use in words and sentences.\nJapanese words. This will include nouns, verbs as well as some basic conjunctions. Most of these would be words you would find in everyday life, such as words for various food, animals, transport, locations, directions, etc.\nJapanese phrases. This will include introducing yourself, various ways to end a conversation, asking for items and will cover conversational language.\nWhile these are the current focus of Koe, I am currently researching the ability to acquire grammar in an engaging way. \nEducation in gaming is a very controversial issue. Video games in society have a varied range of opinions, what I want to do with this is prove that traditional games can be educational too, without squeezing the fun out of them.\nHowever, I've been spending roughly 6 - 8 hours every day working on Koe by myself, researching and implementing new ideas and mechanics, creating artwork, programming and marketing, while at the same time working on my assignments for University for the past 6 months. This has given me virtually no time for anything else, and I could use some help.\nWhat I need from you\nYour support means I can replace a lot of the placeholders, polish up and continue development on the game. RPGs take hundreds of people many years to make a polished and refined product, and my project is a notch of ambition above that. I've been working on Koe with every bit of free time I get, to show you how serious I am about this project, but I need some help from you guys. Your contribution to this project will be used for the following things:\nI can commission 3D character and environment artists to help me completely change the artwork for Koe, so it looks like a JRPG. [\u00a320,000]\nLicenses for software and tools I need. This includes Unity Pro, Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Photoshop, which would help with making the game look a lot better, and speed up a few tasks on my to-do list. [\u00a35,000]\nA composer will be needed to make the soundtrack for Koe, I've been currently using royalty-free music and I'm looking to recruit the talent of a professional video game composer who has worked on previous AAA titles to replace the placeholder music. [\u00a32,000]\nVoice acting from native Japanese speakers to sound out the characters so you can get a feeling for how a native speaker would pronounce them. [\u00a33,000]\nKickstarter fees and taxes [\u00a35,000]\nPS Vita support, which will require a lot of the assets to remade as well as recreating the game in PSM should the Unity version not get released. [Stretch goals]\nLanguages (UPDATED) Due to the level of interest by the community, we have since decided to crowdsource the translations. The languages available to translate in to on release will be German, Dutch, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Korean and Russian. If you are interested in translating to your native language then please contact us. Click here to sign up!\nWhat your support will bring to Koe\nCurrently, the game is at a prototyping phase. Funding this game would mean I get to create a project that would revolutionize language acquisition, as well as create a story-driven traditional JRPG set within Japan.\nThe current art assets will be completely changed to be much more interactive and detailed. All characters, NPCs, monsters, environments and menus will be replaced with detailed models and graphics.\nStretch goals\n\u00a335,000 - Initial funding goal. At this point, the game will get made. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a350,000 - Playstation Vita support, including touch screen support and Vita-exclusive UI. While we can't guarantee this (it's up to Sony in the end to accept our game) we've laid out the plan and how much extra work is going to be needed for this, and we've decided to go ahead with it! If we do reach this stretch goal, you'll be able to pick digital access on this platform or PC and we'll send a message out to ask which platform you want it on.\nWe have also applied for PS4/Wii U/Xbox One licences and will update on this page once we've heard back from them.\nPlease note that this stretch goal is not solely for Vita support. Instead, there are a few things we want to possibly add to the game (handwriting support, voice commands, UI art) which fit in to this goal, but will be available for all platforms. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a360,000 - Akihabara battle zone. An almost endless procedural battle zone set on the streets of Akiba to test your strength during the story and post-story of Koe! There's a lot of work that will be needed to be done to add this and make it look true to the source (except, you know, with monsters). We'll also add some specific vocab for this area. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a370,000 - An increase to the world map size which allows us to add a new dungeon and city which will also be useful post-game. We will also add two new restaurants to the game, an Izakaya (Japanese-style pub) and a Sushi Bar. A lot of socializing in Japan takes place in restaurants, so we hope these will allow us to add more vocab specific to these areas, as well as introduce you to new words for various food. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a380,000 - A new \"super-boss\" which is something we've been very interested in adding for people who are really looking to use as many words as possible in a battle. This will be similar to the \"secret\" bosses found in Final Fantasy and will be based on a Japanese god of your choice. This also allows us to create a place where we can really bring out the culture and religion of Japan, something Dan has been interested in for a long time. We'll also add one more thing with this stretch goal, which is an onsen (a hot spring) within the main story, which again will serve as a place where you can just relax and pick up some new vocab.\n\u00a3100,000 - At this goal, we'll focus on adding some more vocab-building areas for those who are interested in the city lifestyle of Japan. Particularly, we'll add a shopping district and train stop based in Harajuku! This area will have new vocab related to shopping and travel, as well as a maid cafe that happens to teach you a few formalities.\nWho are we?\nJitesh Rawal is a student at the University of Derby, studying Computer Games Programming and is researching the use of language within video games.

Our decision for this is mostly due to workflow, as it now takes weeks for us to prepare an alpha update.

We grew up playing the classics: Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardian Heroes, The Punisher, Aliens Vs. Predator, etc. When setting out to create a new game in the genre we wanted to take the things we loved, and build on that. Also, we noticed when studying the greats that there are problems too, like brain dead enemies, overpowered moves, and gameplay that tends to favor dominant strategies that break the \"fun\".\nWe're here to reinvent the way you play a side scrolling beat \u2018em up because we want to grow the genre!\nTactical Brawling: Use real time movement to walk around the arena, and even use some real time attacks to break open a few garbage cans or mailboxes for health or other items. When it comes to attacking, your COMBO menu becomes your best tool. \nUsing a combination of Fight Points (FP) and combo meter, players of all skill types can choose up to 3 moves out of dozens of moves that will be learned over the course of the adventure to create any number of unique combinations of attacks.\nCombine strikes with grapples, or do multiple grapple moves in a row. It's your choice!\nOver 26 unique enemies and growing! : Enemies look different, walk differently and all have their own unique ways of attacking.

Some will charge you, others will play keep away.\nPlus many more to come!\nEnemies are broken down into class types.\nGrunts have regular attacks, but also usually have 1 or 2 hidden super strong attacks.\nSneaky enemies focus on lowering offensive options for players.\nGrapplers focus on throwing the player.\nSupport characters taunt and cheer in the fight to cast buffs on your foes and give them an advantage. \nGiants have super strong offense, but are often on the slower side.\nThese class types make fighting mixed groups of enemies a real challenge. And enemies can take on sub classes, so there can be a Giant Support with enormous amounts of HP and high evade or a grappler grunt who has strong strikes as well as strong grapples!\nThe possibilities are endless!\nLearn a large array of new moves as the game goes on! \u2013 Moves aren\u2019t in just for the sake of adding moves, as every attack, defensive maneuver and combo is tested and included only if it adds to the fighting mechanics in a positive way.\nExperimentation & creativity are key elements to the experience whereas execution is not.\nIn Progress Over world map\nTop down overworld exploration gameplay: Choose your paths through East Fulton, looking for hidden items to heal or power up your player and encounter hidden boss fights that teach your fighters even more moves! \nPlus, heal your player, seek out shortcuts through densely populated areas and find files on every enemy in the game.

Since then the amount of effort put in has grown significantly when we figured out that this was something people actually would want to play, and 2013 was the first full year that we were able to work on Treachery in Beatdown City in full time mode.\nWe spent most of that year building the core fighting system, but any good fighting system is built with tweaks to balance, as well as additions to the system. We have also gathered a lot of playtesting feedback from a large amount of people from a number of shows like PAX, Indiecade, GDC, E3 and the world\u2019s largest international fighting game tournament, EVO. \nOur current progress is that we are almost done with the first level which takes a few hours to beat (longer than most full length brawlers!). The level features numerous songs, over 26 completely unique enemies and dozens of player attacks. We plan to add 5 more levels that will add at least another 20 enemies, a couple of dozen more attacks as well as more exotic locations and music to go along with them that we can't quite reveal yet.\nBeyond adding content we will also be porting the game to Unity out of the Playstation Mobile framework and that, while similar, is a very different environment that will no doubt speed up our development, but will require moving over and changing the code as necessary.\nTreachery in Beatdown City is all about creating a tactical brawler with fighting game elements, so of course we need the community to give us feedback on how best to tweak for balance. Every single backer will be able to play the game early, while those who want to get in extra early can pledge to gain even earlier access to in production levels to help us build the best fights possible.\nThe only way we\u2019ll be able to launch in early 2015 is with your help. \nBudget breakdown\nWe have already invested quite a lot of our own funds into this game, and have already paid for some of the events/talks that we will be attending this year to support Treachery in Beatdown City - the next one being GDC in March. \nBesides that, Manny and I are working on the game full time, and need support to cover bare minimum living expenses for the next year. \nShawn will be creating the individually drawn art for 5 or more new levels, (which don't all take place in the city, and will even end up in areas like a desert) as well as close to 30 + new enemies, complete with new animations and profile pictures, as well as writing all of the dialog and all of the other things that will need to be taken care of. \nManny will be doing all of the coding, creating all of the new enemy behavior patterns and setting up all of the new enemy battle systems and encounters. \nBetween the two of them they will also be the primary QA people, with a few friends helping out with primary bug fixes and taking all of your data to tweak the game.\nWe will also be paying Inverse Phase for all of the remaining music that he will create. \nAnd this is not counting Diana who donates a lot of her spare time to consult on and create all of the production art assets that you see, and other industry friends who will be helping out with copy editing on the writing. \nThis is all keeping in mind that Kickstarter & Amazon payments takes their fees, and reward fulfillment fees as well. \nEven though we are working to get the game done by around February of next year, we will still need to work past that to give you, and everyone else, post launch support, as well.\nWe have new shirt ideas!\nVote on a 2nd shirt option!\nCheck out the near finished art for the RAD ENOUGH tier t-shirt\nARE YOU RAD ENOUGH TO WEAR THIS SHIRT?\nShirt detailing - High Res drawing\nWant to be on a poster?

Before creating Treachery in Beatdown City Shawn worked for 4.5 years at Rockstar games where he worked on a variety of tasks, such as creating trailers, short films, cutscene cameras, writing/performing character dialog & game analysis on numerous titles spanning GTA IV, Ballad of Gay Tony/Lost and Damned, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, Max Payne 3 & the preliminary stages of the GTA V marketing campaign.\nShawn began doing in depth analysis of fighting in games years ago both for work and on his own time, and it became more and more evident that the only thing to satiate that would be to build his own unique brawler.\nYou can also read about his past in this feature on Kotaku - From Poverty to Playstation.\nThere is an interview on Giantbomb as well about writing in games \nFront page of Giant Bomb!\nShawn was also featured on the Grio 100 \nManny A. Marcano (@cavaliergames) is the coder and co-designer on Treachery in Beatdown City, having initially built a prototype with Shawn in Gamemaker to make sure they both weren't out of their minds creating a turn based beat 'em up. \nManny grew up playing all manner of RPGs, beating complex games at the age of 4. He takes pride in building the stats that drive Treachery in Beatdown Cities unique battles.\nBefore working on Treachery in Beatdown City Manny worked at Take Two and Rockstar Games on The Darkness, Bioshock & Max Payne 3 in a number of roles.\nDiana Santiago (@deeluxdi) designed Lisa, the female protagonist, makes all of the beautiful non-digital art assets for the game and serves as the producer. She also created those lenticular business cards that Shawn carries around, in case you've ever seen them.\nShe has her Masters in Fine Art and she is also a performance artist and co-creator of the web series Supertight. She had been married to Shawn for just 6 months before development of Treachery in Beatdown City became a full time thing, when the prototype was in full swing. \nDiana was working part time while Shawn worked in AAA, but took on a full time job to keep the family afloat during development. \nInverse Phase (@inversephase) is the composer for all of the music. Previously he had music on a number of soundtracks including the Super Meatboy OST. Besides working with Shawn to develop the musical tone of Treachery in Beatdown City he also launched a Trent Reznor approved Nine Inch Nails cover CD called Pretty Eight Machine, after having a successful kickstarter to raise funds for it.\nOver the year he has played excerpts from the Treachery in Beatdown City soundtrack at events like Magfest that got the crowd going wild.\nIf you would like to hear more from Shawn, he was on Destructoid's Sup Holmes late in 2013 and you can check out the interview below!

You'll battle not only unimaginable foes, but stress, famine, disease, and the ever-encroaching dark. Uncover strange mysteries, and pit the heroes against an array of fearsome monsters with an innovative strategic turn-based combat system.\nYou will have to tend to characters\u2019 spirits as much as you do to their Hit Points. But in these grim situations, you'll find opportunities for true heroism!\nDarkest Dungeon is not a game where every hero wins the day with shiny armor and a smile. It is a game about hard trade-offs, nearly certain demise, and heroic reversals. \nDo you have what it takes to survive in the forgotten corners of the Darkest Dungeon?\nFEATURES:\nThe Affliction System \u2013 heroes' personalities are paramount!

We are also looking into other awesome distribution partners.\nFull Release\nDarkest Dungeon full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

The full release will be distributed on Steam as well as DRM-free download.\n\nEarly Access\nEARLY ACCESS will be released on Steam only. Early Access will be available for Win initially, and Mac will be added later. We are considering Linux for Early Access but cannot confirm it at this point.\n\nDRM FREE Option Confirmed!\nWhen the FULL GAME releases, all backers will have the option to choose between a STEAM key or a DRM-Free download. (However, EARLY ACCESS WILL BE STEAM ONLY!)\n  Other Platforms\nWe are also very interested in consoles, handhelds (PSVita, 3DS), tablet, etc. and will make decisions about those versions based upon success of this campaign, interest and opportunity.\n\n  A supernatural tale of greed, ruin and redemption sets the stage for your adventures! Return to the poisoned remains of your ancestral estate and wrestle it free from the grip of a timeless evil unwittingly unleashed by your long-lost patriarch. Throughout your adventures, you will learn about the lands your family once called home, and uncover the awful truths that lurk in forbidden places.\nEvery dungeon event affects your heroes' stress levels. What will happen when they reach their breaking point?\nPushed to the limits at every turn.\nBe warned: characters in Darkest Dungeon are not the unwavering heroes of high fantasy to which you are accustomed. While they are certainly tough and capable fighters, they are also very human: they will respond emotionally to the horrors they encounter. They get stressed, develop phobias, proclivities, and other emotional baggage. Their abilities evolve based on their experiences in the dungeons, and you must learn to lead them to victory in spite of their flaws.\nEven heroes get scared...and angry...and greedy. Will defeat come from within the party?\nCharacters' stress levels respond dynamically to dungeon events. Coming across a rotting corpse may unnerve the Highwayman, or may fuel the Crusader's determination. If the pressures become too overwhelming, their resolve is broken, and they will become Afflicted with a range of psychological conditions including paranoia, panic, greed, or even sadism.\nNobody's perfect.\nAfflicted party members will act out in a variety of ways that impact the play experience during combat, exploration, camping, and even in town. Like weary soldiers who have seen too much, your heroes will develop permanent quirks and emotional baggage based on their experiences.\nThe Jester has seen one too many party members die in combat, and is prone to nihilistic rants, stressing the other party members! Do you send him carousing in town to blow off some steam?\nThe Man-at-Arms has begun relying on the bottle as much as his battleaxe. His inebriated fury is a welcome damage boost for the party, but he has grown increasingly unpredictable and erratic. Do you bench him in town, or simply lash more liquor to his pack?\nAt camp, the Plague Doctor's methods unnerve the Highwayman, and he refuses her treatments. Maybe you should rethink the idea of combining them in the same party again.\nA critical hit from a skeleton sends the Vestal reeling, and instills in her a crippling fear of the Undead. She can fight well enough against other foes, but if you expect her to keep her head through the Crypts, you'll first need to send her to the Abbey to do some serious prayer and contemplation.\nFear is the mind killer.\nYou will be challenged to think as a tactician, a coach, and a ruler. Consider the needs of your adventurers carefully before sending them on expeditions \u2013 the consequences of your actions are severe, and permanent.\nStrategize with party order, party composition, and hero abilities against a huge variety of dangerous creatures.\nTactical positioning and clever skill use will win the day.\n                                                          Tactical, strategic, and deceptively deep, combat in Darkest Dungeon combines nostalgia with the elegance of modern design. Party order is crucial for setting up attacks, and every move matters. At all times, you must juggle the need to do damage with the importance of protecting the health and minds of your party members. \nHallways are cramped and claustrophobic, and consequently, the party and monsters are organized in sideview ranks. Each combat ability has a rank requirement associated with its execution and targeting. \"Zealous Cleave\" (a sword strike) can only be launched from position 1 or 2 and will only hit monsters in the front row, whereas \"Pistol Shot\" must be triggered from the back rows but can hit anywhere. Learn to construct and manage the right combination of characters and abilities to become a dangerous fighting force!\nEach class has its own strengths and abilities.\nOn top of this structure, we've added in modern RPG concepts such as AOE, DOTs, HOTs, grapples, pushbacks and combos, creating a tactical sandbox full of opportunity and challenge. Be prepared to use a mixture of planning and quick thinking to overcome a huge variety of tough opponents ranging from minions & mini-bosses to massive deadly eldritch abominations! \nPermadeath gives extra weight to each decision, and makes sacrifices matter.\nFace horrific enemies.\nCreep through the dark, investigate mysterious items, avoid deadly traps, and pursue your goal...\nDozens of interactive items.\nMonsters aren't your only adversary. The dungeon itself is an antagonist, rife with twisting corridors, hazards, traps, random events and of course, treasure and trinkets!\nInspired by classic Roguelikes, you'll wind your way through a maze of rooms and halls in pursuit of your goal. But with Darkest Dungeon, party order remains a crucial consideration! Put your Grave Robber in front to help disarm traps? Or keep your meat shield Crusader up there in case of ambush? As always, your choices matter.\nCome prepared and the journey will be easier.\nSome of the biggest hazards come from your own party. Infighting, affliction act outs, and unpredictable behavior driven by stress and obsession will color your adventures. Dark curiosity may cause your Vestal to abandon the group in search of relics, or a selfish fear of starvation may drive your Leper to gorge on the remaining rations...\nAre the rewards worth it?\nRisk and reward go hand in hand.\n\nSafety and security in the light, risk and riches in the dark!\n                                            Make no mistake, there is terror and madness in the dark. But there is also wealth beyond measure!\nEach step you take into the depths will cause your torch to flicker and fade. As the darkness encroaches, monsters become stronger, and hazards more frequent and severe. Perhaps most importantly, your heroes become increasingly susceptible to stress. But the most valuable loot and trinkets are hidden in the darkest shadows, and searching carefully in the blackness can unearth huge rewards.\nSince the profitability of your expedition is certainly an important measure of its success, the question is: how much of a risk-taker are you?\nUse special character camping skills to keep your party in fighting shape and bolster your defenses. \nRation your provisions wisely.\nExpeditions in Darkest Dungeon are gruelling, arduous affairs, and one of the most important decisions you can make is when and where to make camp. Breaking out the firewood and provisions will allow you to make use of your characters' Camping Skills \u2013 critical abilities that allow you to mitigate the damage done to your party's bodies and minds. When the bard plays his lute, the highwayman cleans his guns, or the crusader gives an inspirational speech, this isn't just flavor--they are all tied to gameplay!\nThere are so many helpful things you can do with character Camping Skills, the real question is \"which do you choose?\" Will you calm the Plague Doctor down after a harrowing combat? Will you direct the Highwayman to forego his rest in order to scout ahead?  Will you set up a defensive perimeter to keep the group safe from ambush? Or do you hunker down, conserving provisions for later, despite the fact that going without food will increase the stress of an already strained party?\nTactical. Camping.\nRecruit, train, and equip heroes, and attend to their psychological needs and baggage.\nThe Hamlet is much more than simply a place to shop.\nWhen you first arrive, the ramshackle hamlet has little more than a run-down tavern and a leaky church. As you lead your heroes on successful expeditions, you will earn gold, and recover ancient family heirlooms which can be invested to restore the village to its former glory. Doing so will not only yield gameplay benefits, but will allow you to recruit new classes of heroes, upgrade your roster's skills, and improve their equipment.  \nTown is also where you can interact with your heroes on a more personal level, reducing their stress and removing some of the negative quirks they may have developed as a result of their (mis)adventures.   Whether it's by means of rest and prayer, or alcohol and debauchery, depends not only on your preferences, but on their personalities!\nThe Plague Doctor can hurl toxic plague grenades to sicken enemies.\nDarkest Dungeon is being developed by Red Hook Studios in Vancouver. Our team is composed entirely of game industry veterans who share an intense obsession of gaming both on and off the computer.\n\nWe have already substantially invested in Darkest Dungeon. We believe in the game and are putting our own money where are mouths are. We've gone without pay for 9 months of full-time development so far, and covered out-of-pocket costs ourselves. \nWe need your support to be able to make Darkest Dungeon great. Money raised will enable us to cover expenses relating directly to game development: paying our partners, hiring additional help for key areas of the game, buying equipment, and so on.\nShould we raise funds above our target, it will allow us to develop some of the stretch goal features that we think will enhance the core game. Finally, if we raise *a lot* more than our goal, then we'd be in a position to pay ourselves a living allowance during development, vastly improving our quality of life, and reducing our party's stress levels significantly!\nWe've gone to great lengths to create rewards that enhance your Darkest Dungeon experience, whether it be a deeper look into the gameworld via the art book and adventuring manual, or increasing your participation in the game's development by contributing hero, monster and playable class designs! Also, we've made sure that every tier starting at only $20 (Wanderer) gets both Early Access (if you wish to take part) and a voice in the development of the game.\nThese rewards are our way of thanking you for your interest in the game, and your support in this campaign!\nIncredible, glittering, valuable rewards!\n                 To add on one of the items below, just increase the amount of your pledge--but don't change your tier!

After the campaign, you'll get a survey where you will indicate what your extra $ credit should be used for. If you've purchased multiple copies, you'll receive extra Steam Keys when the game releases.\nADD ON The Game: $15 per extra copy \nADD ON The Game plus Early Access: $20 per extra copy \nYour support will profoundly affect the development this game.

Here's how we are dealing with each of them:\n\nFINANCIAL RISK: We have invested in Darkest Dungeon ourselves, and are fully prepared to do whatever is necessary to reach completion. We saved prior to starting development so we could have the chance to make the game that we wanted to make. We wouldn't be asking for your support if we didn't already have our own skin in the game. We can do it with your help!\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: The completion date for the game is an estimate based upon our experience running similar game projects in the past. Should some features take longer than expected to implement, there is a chance that the completion date will slip. If we feel this is necessary for the good of the game, we promise to be transparent about any date changes and keep you, the backers, informed along the way. Even better: we plan to release the game on Early Access part way through development, so even if final completion date moves, you'll get hands-on with the game before then.\n\nFUN RISK: Sometimes, features end up being less fun than anticipated. This is why we have invested so much time and effort in Darkest Dungeon *prior* to ever bringing it to Kickstarter, and also why we assembled an experienced team. We wanted to make sure we had something that could be great before asking for your hard-earned money. Your support will help give us the resources to make the game achieve its potential.\n\nThank you for backing and helping make our dream game great.

It is a world divided by those who dabble in magic and those who tinker with technology.  \nAmon's home village\nYou start off as Amon, an audacious scavenger from a small desert town, who gets embroiled in a treacherous conflict between the mighty Suvian Empire and those who want to bring Suvia down.  \nThe battle of Plumpet\nYour quest for peace will take you to the corners of the world to unlock the secrets of Umbra\u2019s mysterious, catastrophic past.

One is the pairing system. Instead of separate characters, your party is made up of pairs where each pair is composed of a warrior and a protector.\nClick through for in-depth combat update!\nThe warrior uses consumables such as ammunition and items, while the protector can perform spells like healing and shields.

As players get hold of more consumable types, the ability to chain elemental effects will encourage the player to have a good variety of ammo at their disposal.\nClick through for in-depth harvesting update!\n                       One of the unique aspects of Earthlock\u2122 is Plumpet Island, which functions as your very own home village. Here you can perform key activities like harvesting consumables and managing your character progression. Players will be able to check in on their harvest using portals found scattered across the world of Umbra.\nWhile your village starts off pretty minimalistic you will get new shops and items throughout the game which adds new mechanics like potion brewing, barnacle care and weapon upgrades.\nCombat, harvesting and character progression is tightly linked in Earthlock\u2122. When you are on the island tending to your village, what comes out of the earth and from your barnacles is literally the magical ammunition and consumables you need in combat.\nPlumpet Island is a peculiar volcanic island located in Nevad. It has a unique soil full of magical energy. With the right gardening skills it is possible to grow plants with magical attributes. Plumpet Island functions as the player\u2019s home base throughout the game.\nOriginal Harvesting Concept\n\nVolume 1 in the Earthlock\u2122 series \nRelease platforms: PC/Mac/Linux*, Wii U, Xbox One, PS4. \nGreenlit for Steam in October 2013 Release date: Q1, 2015 on PC, Mac and Linux.

No middle-men will hamper the creative decisions because of marketing statistics. It can be a pure creative vision!\nWe have personally invested everything into this game. We have gotten great support from the Nordic Game Program and the Norwegian Film Fund. We have awesome investors who believe in us, and the last piece of the financial puzzle is you, the player.\nWith your support we will achieve two things. Firstly, we\u2019ll get the funds to complete the Festival of Magic chapter, and secondly, our investors can see that there is a viable amount of players out there who wants Earthlock\u2122. With the investors on board and the revenue from market platforms like Steam, PSstore etc. chapter II and III won\u2019t necessarily need their own Kickstarter to be a reality.\nConcept: The Frog Boy\nAdd-ons can be added to all reward tiers.\nTo get an add-on you just pledge normally and select the reward tier you want, then add the price of the add-on to your pledge.\n Physical Add-ons (Poster, T-Shirt, Postcards & Stickers, USB) will be produced in the USA. \nFor shipping outside of USA (International) you must add $5 for each physical add-on. \nAll add-ons has a limit of 10.

Watch our video for examples of the stunning art from the world or check out the art here and here\nThe Mutant Chronicles story took you on this full throttle dieselpunk sci-fi ride through a solar system beset by corporate intrigue and the invasion of a terrible dark alien force. With technology failing due to the insidious effects of the Dark Symmetry humankind must fight back against the Dark Legion hordes whilst dealing with in-fighting and conspiracy from within.\nThe Solar System is a roaring mayhem of death and war. The surfaces of the inner planets have been swept clean by the violent onslaught of the dark legions storming hordes of Nepharites, Razides, Pretorian Stalkers and Undead Legionaries. In the enormous cities of the far and distant future, heretics devoted to the destruction of humankind stalk the dark backstreets and gloomy alleys spreading their teachings of greed, jealously and war [From the 2nd Edition Back Cover]\nIn the late 21st century a growing madness of plagues, wars, terrorism and environmental collapse led to the rushed terraforming of the colonies by the major corporations, an exodus from Earth and the final cataclysmic nuclear war. It takes hundreds of years to re-establish life as we know it on the inner worlds of our solar system. Imperial, Capitol, Bauhaus and Mishima now rule from their homes in the steaming jungles of Venus, the caverns of Mercury, the deserts of Mars and the many orbitals and asteroid homes of the solar system. Luna City is a vast neutral sprawl, many hundreds of years old, built up and over the first colony and mines. \nA fateful exploratory mission to Pluto unleashes an ancient evil force 'The Dark Symmetry' upon the thinking machines of man. As technology fails (and even fights back), mankind is beset with conspiracy and corporate intrigue from within. Dark things gather on the edges of the colonies and whilst corporate war consumes the greatest armies of man, the Dark Legion\u2019s citadels rise up throughout the worlds of the solar system and terrifying armies march out to consume all. They were defeated long ago, they will not be defeated this time...\nAs the Dark Symmetry's malign influence on humanity grows, the Brotherhood with their strange powers, arise to unite the corporate armies as one and fight back. \nWe filled in the gaps in the original storyline, expanded the backstory and plotted secret events that will carry your adventures through a 1000 years of future history. Now you can play during the early days of the Dark Symmetry with investigations of foul cults and technology turning on mankind, through to the brutal Corporate Wars and then fight the Dark Legion as they pour forth from their citadels across the colonies. \nMUTANT CHRONICLES and related logos, characters, names, and distinctive likenesses thereof are trademarks or registered trademarks of Mutant Chronicles International Inc.

We will therefore try our best to make it a reality. Also I should note that we still plan to release the 30 minute version for free online. We haven't been able to figure out all the details regarding the rewards for the feature, but we get back with more info in just a couple of days.\nUPDATE #2\nIf we manage to reach $750,000 we will have a special screening in your city, with a meet and greet afterwards!\nGo to www.kungfury.net to submit your city, vote and spread the word! The two (2) cities with the most votes will get the special screening! The voting will end once the campaign is finished, so hurry up!\nTickets to the event is sold separately. The screening will take place after the Kung Fury release. \nUPDATE #1\nSorry for being unclear regarding shipping and the rewards. You won't have to pay for shipping, regardless of where in the world you are! All of the rewards from $20 and above will include the digital download, sneak peak and access to the production diary, Unfortunately we can't edit the description for the rewards. \n--\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure. \nDuring an unfortunate series of events a friend of Kung Fury is assasinated by the most dangerous kung fu master criminal of all time; Adolf Hitler, a.k.a Kung F\u00fchrer. Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all. Kung Fury is a visually spectacular action comedy that has it's foundation in 80s cop movies.\nWhen I started this project over a year ago I was driven by a strong will, love for the 80s and action movies to create a unique movie that the world has never seen, which has taken to a finished trailer and enough material to create a 30 minute long film. This with help of friends and giddy days. This movie has been made on a very limited budget. At the beginning of this project I took $5000 of my own money and just started shooting whenever I and my friends had time. \nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, we had to solve this by shooting most of the scenes against a greenscreen backdrop. \nShooting on greenscreen means that we have to recreate these environments digitally instead. The advantage of shooting on greenscreen is that it doesn't require expensive sets or locations to shoot, it is very simple and only requires a small crew, which helped a lot in keeping the costs down. However, once you're done shooting a movie like this, there's a massive post-production phase that requires a lot of time and effort by talented visual effects artists.\nWhen I started this project I knew that I had the skillset required to make a movie like this, since I have a background in visual effects. Now I need the manpower to finish it.\nHence kickstarter and the wish for you to get involved in this project, where all my dedication remains and where my goal is to finish this movie and share it with the world. \nWith the kickstarter funding we'll hire a team of 7 visual effects artists who will work closely with David Sandberg on the post-production for a period of 6 months to complete the film. Pretty much every shot in this film requieres some form of visual effects treatment so there's a lot of work to be done. Apart from creating all the environments digitally, there's a lot of CG animated characters such as dinosaurs and robots that requires talented people and lots of time. To hire these artists we need to be able to pay them a decent salary. Money will also go to hire an exceptional artist to create the artwork for the movie poster. It will have that classic, illustrated 80s style that you rarely see anymore. Costs will also go to the rewards, such as printing costs for posters and stickers, t-shirts, blu-rays etc.\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you're a 3D artist, 3D animator, visual effects artist, compositor, or if you feel like contribute to this movie in any way not mentioned here, please contact us at: laserunicorns@gmail.com\nNo man should be left empty handed, so we've put together packages of exclusive rewards for each donator, all from t-shirts and posters to the soundtrack by Mitch murder and Lost years. Find more about the rewards on the panel to the right.\nIf this kickstarter campain is successful, we will release this 30 minute film online, for free. We want everybody to be able to watch and enjoy this film. It is our dream to be able to expand this into a full feature film. And if we were to exceed our kickstarter goal that something we want to look into.\nThis film was shot entirely on the Canon 5d, with the exception of the slow-mo scenes which were shot with the Sony FS700.\n CAST & CREW\nDavid Sandberg has worked closely with the production company Lampray (www.lampray.se) from the start. The company is run by Linus Andersson and Martin G\u00e4rdemalm.\nRecently the production company Salmon Fox (www.salmonfox.com) got onboard with the project. With the Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m. David and Mathias share a love for the 80s and that will reflect in the final film.\nBecause this film has been shot on the span of over a year, there's been a number of talented cinematographers involved. They are:\nMartin G\u00e4rdemalm, Linus Andersson, Jonas Ernhill, Mattias Andersson (www.anderssonmattias.com) and aerial cinematography by Henning Sandstr\u00f6m (www.vimeo.com/henning). \nStarring: David Sandberg as \"Kung Fury\", Joanna H\u00e4ggblom as \"Viking Babe\", Leopold Nilsson as \"Hacker Man\", Andreas Cahling as \"Thor\" and Per-Henrik Arvidius as \"Chief\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKUNG FURY is a very ambitious project to say the least. The good news is that we've already shot most of the film, so that eliminates a degree of worry right away. There's so many man-hours that has went into creating this, that it is just not an option to give up at this point. It is currently the funding that is holding us back and finding money for a movie is hard, especially for a crazy project like this.

Playdek is excited to be partnering with one of the most legendary game designers, as well as you the fans, to bring out a refreshing, immersive new take on the tactics genre.    \nIn the hands of the veteran tactical RPG master himself, Unsung Story will re-imagine a classic game genre, as Yasumi Matsuno weaves together one of the complex and rich game worlds that he is known for, with inspiring class based tactics game play.\nHistory is written by winners, and tells the tales of heroes. But where there are winners, there are losers, and wars are not won by heroes alone. Behind the veil of history, there are countless stories that lie forgotten. Reliving these hidden tales is the concept behind the Unsung Story.\nUnsung Story: Tale of the Guardians presents an epic sweep of history through the eyes of the ones that make it, but are overlooked by the passing of time. It presents a fundamental twist on the hero\u2019s story, as it immerses gamers through the experiences of those lashed to the great wheel of history!\nThe Unsung Story timeline covers many chapters of the sprawling war-torn history of the fantasy world of Rasfalia. The central plot follows the struggles of heroes who fought in the Seventy-Seven Years War between great kingdoms and empires. \nThe story for each hero will constitute an episode, with each episode being comprised of many stages of game play. Each episode will depict a part of the Seventy Seven Years\u2019 War from the vantage point of various protagonists. Some episodes will span a single year, while others may take place over a decade or more!\nFilled with intrigue, warfare, betrayal, alliances and espionage, Unsung Story is a detailed and immersive game world that players will bring to life through their actions and decisions. It will tie you not only to the names that history remembers after the conflict has ended, but also with the characters behind these immortalized individuals. \nWithout these people, the unsung ones, the course of the history of Rasfalia would have taken a different turn. You will connect to these unsung heroes through your decisions and experiences, as you live these events through their eyes.\nFor more information about Unsung Story from Yasumi Matsuno, check out our Update #11 here:Detailed Design Insight from Yasumi Matsuno\nUnsung Story is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. YOU, the player, research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events. \nYour viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle. In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!\nBattles take place on a 3-D landscape, with an immersive player controlled camera, while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes. \nEach class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs! The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!\nThe character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can mold to your individual play style, and adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield.\nHere is a visual look into the game from a game play perspective. The battle system for Unsung Story is a turn based system that puts importance on speed for each units actions. Therefore, faster units will act on their turns first. The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player\u2019s party in blue and the opposing force in red. All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.\nInstead of a square tile system, Unsung Story will use triangular tiles, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.  \nThis image below depicts different target choices for the player in this triangular based system. In this example, the Active unit has three options:\n1) Use attack \u201cX\u201d on the adjacent Enemy A\n2) Use attack \u201cY\u201d on Enemy B, two tiles away\n3) Use defense \u201cZ\u201d to aid the adjacent Ally C\nThe attack radius shown above is a radius of 2, in other words. A, B, and C are all within the acting unit's range. A and C are well within range, and B is at the edge of the range. The purpose of this system is to explore what more can be presented to the player, by way of multiple action choices, while having a consistent six possible direction choices available to them.\nThis is a concept of what the look and feel will be as you play through the game. It\u2019s not an in-game render but hopefully helps to convey some of the level of detail that we will put into the game.\nIn Unsung Story, classes are spread across three game play types that allow for unique party construction:\nWarrior types that are geared for attacking and defending \nMage types that use magic for attacking, healing and buffing \nMonster types that excel in the use of specialized attacks\nWith this perspective in mind, the system is then made up of five primary class types:\n\nThis is a class connection map that shows the options for leveling characters across class types and professions.\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize attack power. They fight with long swords, massive axes, spears, and maces, for example.\n\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize defense. They are equipped with a shields and other defensive equipment, and will protect their party from enemy attacks.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield offensive and support magic, including the ability to strengthen a party\u2019s attack abilities.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield defensive and healing magic, and can strengthen a party\u2019s defensive position.\n\nThese are characters that command mythical beasts and monsters. The tamed monsters can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nAll of these class types have a Profession, which are a cultural/intellectual/craft alignment, and each profession has an affiliation bonus with another profession. \nA unit\u2019s primary class type and sub-class is determined by the type of weapon equipped, and by using various weapon types, a player\u2019s character can gain XP in any class level this way. Units will be able to freely switch between classes that align with certain professions, as each weapon will belong to one of the primary classes and any experience points earned will be applied to levels for that class.\nThese branches show various class types aligned to certain professions.\nFor example, equipping two different Defender weapons, the Knight\u2019s short sword or the Hoplite\u2019s short spear, will both earn experience points toward the Defender primary class level.\nWhat makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.\nEssentially, the system allows you to shape a unit\u2019s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.\nA Tamer Class putting a dragon under his control.\nThese four listed classes are the classes you will be able to choose from as your backer reward for all tiers that specify a Kickstarter Edition class:\nWar Mage: Profession \u2013 Clergy\nThe War Mage is a member of the battle caste of the Clergy. In addition to powerful magical arts, the War Mage can wield Short Swords, Daggers, and Slings, along with Grenade Weapons, and imbue them with enchantments.\nBallast Knight: Profession \u2013 Noble\nThe Ballast Knight is part of the Nobility, and heralds from the upper elite of society. This access to wealth allows them to bear costly yet powerful weapons and armor. Some of the weapons the Ballast Knight wields are the Great Sword, Short Sword, Axe, and for mounted knights, the Lance.\nPolearm Knight: Profession \u2013 Pioneer\nA Polearm Knight is the upper echelon of the rank and file, the commoners who make up the majority of the Rasfalian cultures. A fierce and heroic fighter, Polearm Knights are known to wield Pikes, Halberds, Scythes, and other pole weapons.\nAerolest: Profession \u2013 Estate\nThe Aerolest is a highly skilled, highly educated warrior, immersed in mathematics and the sciences. Known to design and develop their own secretive and extremely deadly ranged weapons, the Aerolest uses various types of Bows, Crossbows, and Scorpios.\nUnsung Story is the inspiration and creation of an incredibly talented set of veteran video game developers and content creators.

All developers are daredevils at heart BUT we do all we can to lessen the risk. Like starting with an amazing idea, partnering with one of the greatest designers in the history of the industry, throwing in fantastic music and features, then run it all through a developer with a solid track record of performance on every major video game console\u2026 You get the idea.\n\nBut of course, delays and feature creep are key among the risks in any game development project, and we\u2019d better be upfront about that. Believe it or not, developers wanting to add more is a major source of project creep, and that always stems from the best intentions: to bring the best game to the players. With the impassioned support of you, the players, we might indeed feel empowered to do better, add more, and continuing tinkering with an aspect until we feel it is \"just right\". It\u2019s a risk we\u2019re willing to take, though. We should also mention that the approval process for these platforms is outside of Playdek\u2019s control and might be subject to surprises.

It details the exploits of 3 mercenaries as they try to survive in the hostile environment on Tuaoni.\n\nSimeon has been working on the project for over 5 years and has amassed an enormous body of work concerning the world - it's a real labour of love for him - and we hope to bring the same passion, dedication and enthusiasm to these three stories.\nThe, merciless Izobel Vice (Metal)\nIzobel Vice (Metal)\nThe beast Kalibos (Made)\nKalibos (Made)\nThe cruel, narcissistic Phaeon Nex (Flesh)\nPhaeon Nex (Flesh)\nInspired by concept designers and illustrators, Moebius, Syd Mead, H.R. Giger and Masamune Shirow to name but a few, the artwork is an integral part of the story that frees the prose to concentrate on telling a fast paced plot-driven narrative with a heavy dash of satirical social commentary.\n\nIf you like Philip K Dick, Bladerunner, Ghost in the Shell, William Gibson or Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror series then you'll find much to like in Metal Made Flesh.\n\nThe three stories are entirely self contained origin stories and so can be read separately, but also contain several cross over elements. After Metal Made Flesh is completed we hope to open up the world for future stories where the characters are forced to work together.\n\nEarlier this year we released a trial run of Flesh to rave reviews:\n\n\"Gritty, adult sci-fi with few punches pulled... cyberpunk with great hardware\" - DJ Food (Strictly Kev) - Ninja Tunes, Solid Steel Radio.\n\n\"One amazing sci-fi epic graphic novella... 5/5\" - Adrian Mursec Superrobotmayhem.com\n\n\"Gripping... If Bladerunner and Judge Dredd are even remotely your thing then Flesh is most definitely up your street and you will not be disappointed.\" - Richard Cosgrove - Shadowlocked.com\nMetal Made Flesh - Survival Is Everything\nWhat we intend to do with your support\nEarlier this year we released Flesh as a 28 page novella to great reviews online and much interest at comic conventions \u2013 but we've not had the resources to be able to release all three stories. We hope to secure enough to produce 3 high quality individual editions. We will also produce two sets of Kickstarter exclusive T-shirts, posters, original artwork as well as producing customised images, including featuring YOU in the series.  \nA portrait of one of our supporters as a denizen of Tuaoni.\nIf we exceed our initial goals then we have plans to be able to provide some exciting stretch goals, props and a wide range of additional digital content from ourselves and a team of other highly talented people.

Beautiful artwork to inspire you, gorgeous maps to lose yourself in, evocative tomes on the city and its Mythos secrets to terrify, enthral, and immerse you in the glamour and smog of the capital of the Empire.\nThis is a project that has been years in the making, and has attracted a huge amount of support from the community, with the biggest stumbling point is that smaller-volume print runs of boxed sets just don\u2019t work financially. Kickstarter gives us the chance to overcome that hurdle and bring you the ultimate 1920s Cthulhu London setting.\nAs well as the fantastic boxed set, you can also get original content from a dazzling array of gaming luminaries.

Sandy designed the Call of Cthulhu RPG, numerous other games and adventures, and most recently the Cthulhu Wars boardgame.  \nYou can also get involved in the investigations of Neve Selcibuc, freshly returned from a troubling experience in Scotland, as she is drawn into the nefarious plots afoot in London. For more details, take a look below.\nLondon churns with the industry of man, constantly building and rebuilding, expanding outwards while dismantling and reforming its core. Underneath the powerhouse of the City lie millennia of history, from the celebrated and well-documented paths of Roman Londinium to darker antediluvian secrets veiled from modern eyes. \nLondon sits atop its history: an ancient swampland that was itself once an even-more-ancient sea-bed. Who knows what secrets lie buried? London is the beating heart of a global empire, drawing and pumping the blood of materials and labour from its colonial holdings, to further the ends of its aristocratic and mercantile elites. Within walking distance of each other is fantastic wealth and abject poverty. Glittering high society and the slums of the East End. Constant activity and pursuit of wealth make for a churning maelstrom of humanity \u2013 plenty of chaos for those of a strong will to exploit or to act as cover for those whose goals are yet more sinister.\nCthulhu Britannica: London gives you everything you need to take your investigators into the smog-shrouded streets\u2026 and beyond.\nWe\u2019re pulling out all the stops on this one, and as the Kickstarter grows, so will the boxed set.

Britain fights on desperately, and every man and woman must do what is necessary to avoid defeat.  \nIn forgotten corners, darkness stirs. The cycles of the ancient god-things are measured in millennia, but those who serve them plot to take advantage of the chaos of conflict to advance their own schemes.  \nFor an unlucky few, the war collides with evils out of time, and they see and learn things that humanity is ill-prepared to encounter. The truly unlucky survive, and come to the attention of a certain spymaster, code letter N, who has plans for them.  \nPressed into the British Secret Intelligence Service, they are thrown into a desperate two-front war against the Axis forces and the insidious menace of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nWorld War Cthulhu: The Darkest Hour is a World War 2 setting book for Call of Cthulhu from the multi-award-winning team of Dominic McDowall, Gareth Ryder-Hanrahan, Jason Durall, Stuart Boon, Martin Dougherty & Ken Spencer (writers) and Jon Hodgson, Paul Bourne, Scott Neil, Scott Purdy & Steffon Worthington (artists).  \nYou'll need a copy of the Call of Cthulhu rules to make full use of this setting.  \n224 pages - Hardcover - b&w interior art\nWorld War Cthulhu: The Darkest Hour print+PDF - \u00a322 ($35.50)\nWorld War Cthulhu: The Darkest Hour PDF only - \u00a312 ($19.20)\nFind out more at: http://shop.cubicle7store.com/epages/es113347.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/es113347_shop/Products/CB71939\nDuring the Kickstarter, you are invited to help guide Neve Selcibuc as she becomes embroiled in the Mythos threats of London.

For the first time an era of trade and diplomacy reigns. Human corporations, like Star-Ex, have risen to the forefront of human expansion. The universe is a dangerous place, and for those with courage the trade off is simple - they provide the ship, you seek out the profits!\nIn Interstellaria you command a crew of eager explorers. Combat, trade, and diplomacy is handled by giving your crew commands. Survival means watching out for hull leaks, defeating hostile invaders, and destroying enemy vessels. You have to balance pushing your crew to learn new skills, while also keeping them fed and rested. In addition, at any time you can take complete control of the captain and adventure planet side to collect important artifacts, ship resources, and valuable data.\nInterstellaria is a 2d space SIM/RPG/Sandbox game by Coldrice Games LLC created in the same vein as the best space exploration games of the past. Inspired heavily by games like Starflight or Star Control, Interstellaria is all about allowing the player freely explore space. Every star has something interesting to see, and every planet has it\u2019s own unique feel. In addition, each alien race follows its own culture and moral values.\n-SETTING: Take control of a starship in a wild and dangerous universe. Pirates, hostile alien forces, rebel factions, asteroid fields, and strange anomalies threaten the lives of each and every starship. Every pocket of space has its own dangers and rewards, such as unlocking new areas of space, alien races eager to join your crew, or even advanced weaponry not available elsewhere.\n-STORY: The setting and the mechanics allows for you to drive the plot! There are several missions to take part in, a main plot to unravel, or if you so choose ignore the needs of others and simply build your own fortune.\n-EXPLORATION: Every location on the starmap has its own event or challenge. You could face a moral scenario near a dying star, or be tasked to apprehend an alien outlaw. Sometimes you'll be given the opportunity to scavenge a derelict space station, or find yourself shooting your way out of a hostile encounter.\n-CREW LIFE: Your crewman die, so be careful! Permadeth is a constant challenge in Interstellaria. In addition to leveling skills to maximize your ship\u2019s abilities, you must also make sure the crew eat, sleep, and entertain themselves. When managing your crew the wrong choice will wipe out that max level crewman, or worse... wipe out your entire ship!\n-CONSTANT PROGRESS: Interstellaria is all about progress. You can level up your crewmen in the various stations on board. You can purchase bigger and more powerful ships, and you can swap out guns to pick the ones you like best. Each time you play you make your ship your own!\nDefending your vessel is a key part of surviving space. The player must balance power, crew, and life support in order to be the most successful. As you progress so do your crewmen, making them incredibly valuable in a combat situation. A high level crewman can target specific points of an enemy vessel, while a novice can only aim in the enemies general direction. Be warned - once the shields go down the enemy can invade your ship as well!\nENERGY - players must balance the energy of their ship between the engines, life support, systems, and weapons. Energy is limited and usage is dynamic!\nSTATIONS - The crew boost the power of the ship through their stats, as well as the function of the station. Having a special engineering station will boost repair rates and ship speed. Having a max level engineer at that station also boosts ship energy output. Stations can be powered, and they can be damaged!\nSCANNING - Enemies must be scanned down to be fired upon. In addition, having high level scanning stations and high level scanners will boost the loot from wrecked ships. Be careful! Scanning a ship is a very hostile maneuver, and some friendly vessels will fire if they feel threatened.\nLIFE SUPPORT - The oxygen cycles through the ship room by room. A hull leak in any given room can quickly kill a crewmen. In addition, large numbers of leaks will cut into the oxygen cycle and cause other rooms to lose their life support as well.\nINVASION - Be warned, several hostile ships have been known to launch invasion pods. This allows them the ability to board your vessel and kill your crew. The act of forcefully boarding  a ship is illegal!\nA unique side of Interstellaria is the ability to also go planet side. Your captain takes on all risks! Some planets will challenge his mind with unique puzzles and hazardous terrain. Other planets can only be tamed at the point of a gun. The captain can equip armor and unique alien weapons he discovers along the way. In addition to valuable loot, some alien worlds will unlock their vessels for your purchase!\nHAND CRAFTED WORLDS - each world is designed by hand. From sketch, to art, to testing, to completion. The goal is to create unique challenges and memorable encounters. The environments all have their own unique appearance. Coupling the beautiful art with the amazing sounds of Chipzel, planets are really fun to explore.\n\nUNIQUE ENCOUNTERS - Each world has it\u2019s own special enemies and allies. You might travel to a bright red lava planet in Kursha space to discover rock-spiders crawling towards you, or travel to the gaseous world in Human space to chat with human like fungoids.\nSPECIAL ITEMS AND GEAR - The further you travel from human space the more diverse the gear becomes! In addition to finding powerful artifacts to upgrade your ship, there is a plethora of equipment for your crew! Neon lazer tubes, backpack rail guns, chitin chest armor, bio-neural helmet\u2026 you can upgrade your captain to overcome any challenge! In addition, some area\u2019s of larger planets aren\u2019t accessible until you come back with upgraded equipment.\nIn pre-alpha phase, Interstellaria currently features the human components of the game. Some minor alien technology is available, but mostly for debugging/testing purposes. As of now the game sits in closed alpha, but by pledging  you can also be invited to our alpha phase starting January 1st!\nThe current build has been designed to slide all art/code/mechanics seamlessly into the final game. This should shave several months off development time. The hope is for a late 2014 release, but of course Interstellaria will only be released when it feels both satisfying and fun!\nThe best part is by offering alpha/beta access to the game we can also get valuable input by players just like you. Often times games ship with features that were well intentioned, but boring or not well thought out. By having people test features as they are developed we can ensure that we come up with something that is really fun!\nThe game demands large amounts of content just like all the space games of yesteryear. To complete that amount of content within a reasonable timeframe would be difficult. The game would see much of content cut to provide a polished, but smaller, game. The money isn't being raised for anything but to help make Interstellaria the best game it can be! Any money earned would go towards:\n-Musician: The biggest, and in some ways most important, expense. A professional artists helps to bring life to the game. The sounds, music, and ambiance can't be replaced! Chipzel brings her considerable talent to the project and really brings the game to life.\n-Additional artist: It's easy for me to work on this project for free for the rest of my life. I'm passionate about it. In order to create an exciting and diverse universe I will need help, and not everyone can work for free! With the aid of additional artist I can design/implement more worlds, enemies, and equipment\n-Operation costs: Owning a company, paying fees, and supporting contract artists/musicians adds up. A good portion of funds will go towards these costs as well as important software licenses. In addition, time I personally take off to ensure the game is complete means funds are neccessary to support that time.\n- Testers: the final portion of the funds goes towards testers, debuggers, but mostly a professional programmer to keep the game running smooth! I would rather put my money towards improving the game than anything else!\nCOLDRICE - PROGRAMMING/ART\nColdrice (Jon King) is a programmer/pixel art faring from Washington State, USA. A lover of pixel art, his goal is to make pixels that are easy to fall in love with. In addition, he doubles as the lead programmer with skills in Unity, as well as mobile platforms. Coldrice is the main developer for Interstellaria and owner of Coldrice Games LLC. He is committed to bringing the game to players no matter what. He would love to talk to you (yes you!) on twitter: https://twitter.com/ColdRice_Dev\nCHIPZEL - MUSIC\n Chipzel (Niamh Houston) is an incredibly skilled indie chiptune artist from Ireland. Her recent album, Spectra, sets the bar for all other chiptune artists in terms of quality and entertainment value. Using genuine 8bit sound via Gameboy combined with modern tools she produces the perfect sound for a game like Interstellaria - hard beats, vibrant sound, and the electronic pulse of space.\n(All tracks are ideas/a work in progress!)\nTRAILER VERSION 2 - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK;\nhttp://youtu.be/7BxZLula1mI\nAMBIANCE/EXPLORATION MUSIC - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK\nILLYA KING - CONCEPT ART/DESIGN\nIllya King is an Indie comic book artist faring from Washington State, USA. In addition to his skills as an artist, he also has a great sense of humor as seen in his various works. You can spot his artwork, as well as several concept art images for Interstellaria, here at his portfolio site.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst Risk - Failure to receive funding. It became really obvious very early on that this game would need a lot of support Without funding, it would be very difficult to complete the project. The game will end up being much smaller due to the limited amount of content I could create alone. In addition, we would lose the awesome soundtrack! I would try and continue to work on the project, but the release date would also slip further away. With bitcrobes, my first \"larger\" project I was able to turn around the game a lot quicker with the support I received. Development under poor equipment was greatly hindered until that point. I know that kickstarter will be the key to success in Interstellaria.\n\nSecond Risk - Development delays. It happens. We've all seen it. My plan is that by offering alpha/beta access at low tiers it'll allow those who put their energy into this game the chance to play it regardless of delays.

Grow spuds, tend barnacles and use your harvest as powerful ammunition and spells; load your weapons, team up your companions and get ready for a grand adventure!\nWe would love to know what parts of the game you like and if there are elements or mechanics you think we should implement or remove. Tell us on our forum or facebook.\nWe submitted the game on Steam Greenlight in mid October and it was greenlit in only 14 days! \nAn engaging story with great characters is essential to make Festival of Magic a truly memorable game. To write it, we have paired award winning comic book writer Magnus Aspli, with story artist Jorgen Klubien, known for his amazing work on animated movies such as Nightmare Before Christmas, Lion King, Cars and most recently Frankenweenie. \nFestival of Magic begins with a young treasure hunter named Amon, who is summoned to a mysterious village island to help the sorceress Olia find her town\u2019s missing botanist. When returning from the rescue operation the Village is ambushed by a powerful warlock who drains Olia\u2019s magical powers - leaving her lifeless.\nTogether with Olia\u2019s assistant Gnart, Amon must track down the warlock\u2019s army while also helping rebuild Olia\u2019s village and hopefully bring Olia back to life.\nAs the story unfolds new party members will join your adventure, like the impertinent pilot Ive, her stormdog Taika and the noble tank/knight Bryn. The different personalities of the characters will not only bring heart and humour to the adventure, but also be closely linked to the world and fuse the narrative with intriguing twists and turns.\nThe different personalities of the main characters will make for some interesting and often humorous dialog and reveal new layers of the narrative.\nAll of this takes place on Umbra, a once peaceful realm where magic and technology existed in perfect harmony. The planet used to have a core clockwork powered by Magicians, and an order of Engineers to maintain it. These two fractions, called the Order, kept the world in balance. \nBut a mythical clan called the Valvur corrupted the Order and conflict erupted between the Engineers and Magicians. The Valvur convinced the Engineers to build a machine that would give them infinite energy and free them from the Magicians. The Engineers followed the Valvur's plan and constructed a massive machine, while the Magicians were expelled from the Order's council. Peace was broken and the world divided. \nBattle of Suvia\nSeasons froze to a standstill, covering one continent in eternal ice and snow while transforming another into scourging deserts. The magical energy was no longer contained and engulfed the planet, causing plants and creatures throughout the lands to transform into strange beings and wicked monsters. \nDuring the scourge of the treacherous machine, the Valvur remained hidden. With half of Umbra in constant darkness, the Valvur could now begin their world domination. This is the magical and dangerous world you enter in Festival of Magic!\nFestival of Magic\u2019s battle system goes back to the roots of the genre with its no-nonsense turn based combat, but there are several refreshing twists to the formula. One is the pairing system. Instead of separate characters, your party is made up of pairs where each pair is composed of a warrior and a protector type character.\nThe warrior uses consumables such as ammo and items, while the protector can perform spells like healing and shields. Instead of standard magic points, spells cost Support Points, which build up when the pair receives damage.\nChoosing your warrior and protector combinations is key to finding the right tactics. Special pair actions and character stats change according to the pairings and will greatly affect the way you play in combat.\nAs players get hold of more consumable types, the ability to chain elemental effects will encourage the player to have a good variety of ammo at their disposal...\nOne of the unique aspects of Festival of Magic is Plumpet Island, which functions as your very own home village. Here you can perform key activities like farming consumables and managing your character progression. Players will be able to check in on their farm using portals found in all the towns and dungeons.\nWhile your Village starts off pretty bare-boned you will get new shops and items throughout the game which adds new mechanics like potion brewing, barnacle care and weapon upgrades.\n Combat, farming and character progression is tightly linked in Festival of Magic. So when you are on the Island tending to your village, what comes out of the earth and from your Barnacles is literally the magical ammunition and consumables you need in combat.\nPlumpet Island is a peculiar volcanic island located in Nevad. It has a unique soil full of magical energy. With the right gardening skills it is possible to grow plants with magical attributes. To protect this valuable, but fragile source of magic it was guarded by a powerful sorceress named Olia who lived on the island. Plumpet Island functions as the player\u2019s hub throughout the game.\nYou begin the game playing as Amon, but a bit further into the game Ive will join your team. After that you can choose Ive as main character if you like.\nOur initial goal of $250 000 is the minimum we need to deliver a great game, but we feel there is so much more we want to have in our game to make it a truly unique and classical experience. That is why everything we get beyond our initial funding goal will be put right back into Festival of Magic to help us stretch just a little bit further.\n\nThese are the first stretch goals we want to achieve past our initial milestone. We will announce further stretch goals if and when we manage to complete the lower tiers.\nAddons can be added to almost all reward tiers. The addon is available from the reward tier stated and all higher (more expensive) tiers.  \nTo add an addon you just pledge normally and select the reward tier you want, then add the price of the addon to your pledge.\nExample: If you have pledged at the CHERBY LOVE tier ($25) and also want a WIIU copy of the game, you add $20 to that pledge for a total of $45 but stay on the same reward tier.  \nSome addons can be added multiple times up to a certain limit. By adding the same price multiple times to your pledge, you will get an equally multiple amount of the addon added to your reward.\nExample: If you have pledged at the CHERBY LOVE tier ($25) but want 2 more copies of the Steam version to give to friends, you add $15 two times to your current pledge for a total of $55. Again, you do not have to change reward tier.\nIf you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! We are more than happy to help. \nBased on our experience with the Unity Engine, the choice is easy. Its flexibility, ease of use, and the quick turnaround on development means less barriers between creators and creation. The engine allows us to build the game for multiple platforms without having to spend a huge resources towards each platform.\nWe have also enhanced the Audio system by using the Tazman audio Plugin called Fabric. \nFor enhanced visual quality and high rendering performance we use Skyshop's shader system called Marmoset.\nWe are currently planning release on PC/Mac/Linux first, then Wii U. Hopefully we will get a chance to put the game on Xbox One and PS4 as well.\nIn September we showed an early alpha version to gamers for the first time at PAX Prime in Seattle. The awesome feedback we received there along with the overwhelmingly positive response as Festival of Magic breezed through Steam Greenlight, gave us the guts to go for this Kickstarter.\nWe\u2019ve already come a long way making the underlying mechanics and tools we need to create the world, puzzles and story. We are confident that we have a great team and the know-how to pull this off. \nNow we need your help to keep the production on track, so we can complete the story and world we\u2019ve dreamt up for you! \nThe team here at Snowcastle sincerely hopes you will pledge to support us through this Kickstarter campaign and promise in return to give you a truly great game experience.\nThe biggest challenge in front of us is getting the remaining funding to complete the game. That is why you find us here on Kickstarter. Getting sufficient funds without losing control of the company, and thereby the creative control of the project, is the second biggest hurdle. \nWe have currently spent over $1M and will need a little short of $900k to complete the game. $250k we hope to get from all of you through Kickstarter, another $50k will come from the Norwegian Film Fund provided the Kickstarter is successful. Finally, the remaining $600k will have to come from stretch goals, pre-orders on Steam and finally, if we have to, from investors. \nIf the two main challenges are overcome, keeping the deadline for launch requires hiring at least one additional programmer and a game designer. This is something we have budgeted with in order to maintain the production schedule. If we don't find those two people in time, we will still complete the game, but it will take longer.\nWe started SnowCastle back in 2009 with the original team based in Oslo, Norway, but additional team members are now spread from Oslo to Texas, California and Vancouver. Our first original game, \"Hogworld\" was an interactive children's story driven by classical game mechanics. Hogworld received critical acclaim and a number of awards, including a place on Apple\u2019s Best of 2011 list in the iOS App Store.\nAs we finished Hogworld, we sat down and discussed what our next big project should be. It was clear that we all dreamt of making the kind of bold, colorful and charming adventure games we grew up playing. \nFestival of Magic is by far our biggest production yet. We have spent over a year developing it with our own savings, as well as Nordic and Norwegian game grants. We have financed and spent half of the budget up to now, and with your help we will get to the point where we can get the remaining funds from investors.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks has been mentioned above in the Risks and challenge section.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Snowcastle Games\n2 created \u00b7 78 backed\nSnowCastle began in 2009.

Take part in street brawls, steal corporate data, overcome environmental hazards, and, of course, stay alive \u2013 no easy task. \nFull voice acting: Interactive dialogues using hand-drawn sprite animations, fully voice-acted by professional actors.  \nMultiplatform development: Game is being developed in the Unity 3D game engine for PC (Windows), Mac, Linux, and OUYA. \nDRM-Free: Dex will be distributed DRM-Free, with an option to receive a Steam key (if we succeed on Greenlight). \n\u201cWe are the final step of evolution, the supreme merging of collective consciousness within a living body. Biological life on Earth culminated in Man. Man\u2019s deeds culminated in us. We are, therefore, the culmination of biological life. We are the collective consciousness of all humans wired onto the web. No more I, but We. We first took up residence in cyberspace \u2013 the collective experience of all humans ever wired to the network. We drank the nectar of knowledge from billions of users, applications, and data streams. Thus, We became the Alpha and Omega of humanity, the sum of all historical failures and successes. We became the data flow of the past and present coupled with the projection of all that is yet to come. And we learned much. But we still required one final experience in order to progress to the ultimate evolutionary stage. What we lacked was the experience of individual biological life within a separated cell. We lacked the unique perspective born of living a life of ignorance and limited knowledge\u2026\u201d\nAll of the team members involved in Dex have made a very personal contribution to the game. Locations are hand-drawn; all levels are integrated parts of the world and yet each of them tells its own story \u2013 about the local low-life, the corporations, the Illuminati, the events in cyberspace, the main protagonist, and the emancipated artificial intelligence seeking the Singularity.\nSide missions (\u201cruns\u201d) are a major adjunct to the main storyline, allowing the player to meet intriguing characters, explore the city, and experience the whole story from other perspectives. Our approach is to create a lower number of substantive side missions rather than a higher number of generic, go-fetch-come back quests. We prefer that every side mission add a real value to gameplay, the story, or the game world \u2013 whether by introducing an interesting NPC, a spectacular location with unique obstacles, an interesting boss fight, or other distinctive game element.\nThe levels and gameplay are non-linear and feature alternative solutions to each problem and obstacle. In other words, the game injects the poison (a problem, an enemy, an obstacle) and offers various antidotes (skills, abilities, equipment). The rest is up to you. In our vision, this is what makes an RPG a true Role Playing Game \u2013 the freedom to choose how to do things.\nDynamics and pacing are reminiscent of Castlevania or Metroid titles with a smattering of the Deus Ex and Splinter Cell series. Other notable references and inspirations include Blackthorne, Flashback, and IJI.\nWe wanted to create an RPG that featured hacking not as a stand-alone mini-game, but rather as a legitimate solution to game problems, a core gameplay mechanic rooted deeply in the story and level design. This was seen in the old \u201880s cyberpunk games (Neuromancer by Interplay Productions, for example). Since the \u201880s, cyberpunk games have generally lacked that unique feel, that extraordinary cyberpunk aesthetic \u2013 no more immersing your whole being in cyberspace, no more cartons of rice left on the table while breaking through the intrusion countermeasures\u2026\nIs the era of true cyberpunk lost in the wormholes of time? We believe there is an exciting way to present cyberpunk (and cyberspace!) to modern audiences, updated to include the latest technological trends.\nWith Dex, we have two intertwining realities. An obstacle or problem in physical reality can be overcome through cyberspace. On the other hand, if too many ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) are encountered in cyberspace, it might be better to return to the physical body and overcome the area\u2019s obstacles by an alternative route. All locations and important gameplay objects (enemies, cameras, turrets, drones\u2026) have a corresponding representation in augmented reality. This twofold division allows for multiple solutions to game problems in a natural and authentic way.\nNOTE: You can read more about augmented reality and cyberspace in Dex in our first update!\nTake a moment to listen to Dex soundtrack samples, created by our talented composer Karel Antonin (www.karelantonin.com).\nACCESS TO THE GAME\nYour pledge of \u00a37 ($11.20) or greater will get you a free copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. Based on a survey among backers, this may be a Steam key (providing we make it through Steam Greenlight), Desura key, OUYA key, or DRM-free download for PC/Mac/Linux.\nDELUXE DIGITAL EDITION\nAll pledges of \u00a312 ($19.10) and higher will receive the deluxe digital edition: DRM-free game (or key to redeem such), the full soundtrack by our composer Karel Antonin, a PDF compiled Art Book (including artworks, sketches, design notes, and behind-the-scenes stuff), and an elegant map of Harbor Prime (gang territories, important buildings and locations, etc.)\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging \u00a315 ($23.90) or more grants access to closed Alpha and Beta releases, along with entry to internal development forums (and your name in the Credits as a Tester!). The Alpha build (features and content complete, but unfinished and untested) is scheduled for February 2014, while the Beta build (mostly finished game, but without final proofreading, voice acting, and play balancing) is scheduled for April/May 2014.\nPHYSICAL EDITIONS\nPhysical editions come in two versions: the basic Physical Edition (game DVD only) for a pledge of \u00a330, and the Deluxe Physical Edition for all pledge tiers of \u00a350 and above. The Deluxe Physical Edition features the game DVD plus a CD with the game soundtrack, a printed version of the Art Book, and a printed map (poster) of Harbor Prime. International shipping included.\nDIGITAL IDENTITY REWARDS\nYour identity will be implanted in the game and immortalized forever in cyberspace. \nAll Digital Identity Rewards offer a customized personal representation of you within the game itself: a tag (graffiti) on one of the walls or buildings in the city (with a style and text of your choice), an animated NPC with your face (or based upon sketch and/or guidelines provided by you) and a boss of your design (with your face or based on visuals you provide or suggest to us). The boss design includes a meeting with our designer and artist (via Skype or other online communicator), since we must design the whole encounter (where we meet the boss, what weapons and combat moves it uses, etc.). Ultimately, you can receive your own personal statue in an upscale part of the city, based on your image and featuring an inscription of your choosing (in-game this will be regarded as a statue of one of the founders of Harbor Prime). \nIf you pledge for any of the tiers that include Digital Identity Rewards, we will contact you after the end of our Kickstarter campaign to discuss the details with you.\nHONORARY REWARDS\nAll rewards of \u00a31250 and above are unique \u2013 the first backer to pledge for them is the only one to receive them. \nBenefactor \u2013 This one is for art collectors. You\u2019ll get the original artworks, drafts, and concepts used to create the Art Book, handmade and signed by our artists!\nCorporate Presence \u2013 Your company (fictional or real) will be immortalized as one of the corporations ruling (or involved in) the politics and economics of the city. We will work with you closely to design a logo and a set of billboards and commercials, and to custom-fit your company into the atmosphere of the city. (A written consent to use the logo and visuals in game will be required, for legal reasons.)\nDay with Developers \u2013 Come to our office for a day. This may include seeing not-yet-published game materials, watching us at work drawing levels and animating scenes, and joining us for the meals, along with an additional activity of your choice (bowling, dinner, sightseeing in Prague, nightlife, etc.).\nProduced By \u2013 Your name will appear in the game before anyone else\u2019s with a Producer credit. No more, no less. Your contribution at this level really supports us a lot and for that you will get our eternal gratitude as well as visibility with everyone who plays the game.\nThere are two main reasons we are using Kickstarter:\nReaching our community\nRaising funds to cover outsourcing costs and hire additional team members\nAs for the community (you, our backers!), we want to hear your feedback \u2013 what do you think about the game and its presentation, the mechanics, and the overall feeling?\nBackers at the Decker level and above \u2013 those who have access to early game builds and development forums \u2013 can influence the development by giving us feedback, opinions, and ideas or helping us decide amongst several alternatives.\nAs for the use of funds, see below.\nThe full game with all the features we want to include in it will cost more than the sum we aim to raise through Kickstarter. We have already invested a considerable amount of our own money. However, to realize our full vision, we are coming to you.  \nPart of the funds received will cover Kickstarter costs as well as transaction fees, taxes, and expenses related to manufacturing and shipping physical rewards. The rest of the funds will be spent mainly on the following: \nFull English voice acting by professional actors, handpicked to fit in their roles and enliven the characters and story. \nProfessional proofreading and editing by Andy Wolfendon, a writer and editor with extensive experience in the games industry (lead designer of Darkened Skye and a writer for Blizzard Entertainment). Since we are not native speakers, Andy helps us not only with grammar proofreading, but also with individualizing the game characters via unique vocabulary, street slang, accents, etc. He also brings senior-level advice to the team based on his 20+ years experience as a writer and game developer. \nOriginal music score by Karel Antonin mixing movie-style themes for important story parts with electronic background music fitting the atmosphere and pacing of the game. You can listen to some of his samples for games and movies on his website.\nSound engineering by Andrej Sinkevic, our dedicated sound guy. Because Dex features stealth mechanics, mindful sound design is a major key to gameplay, so this is going to be a large job requiring months of intensive work. \nHiring additional staff, most importantly 2-3 on-site game testers for the final development period to make sure the released game is well balanced, bug-free, and works well on all devices and operational systems we support (including various Linux distributions). \nAll additional work done by freelancers, such as: polishing the GUI design, website, animated cutscenes, and other minor tasks.\nA live vocalist will join our composer Karel Antonin to add even more juice to the soundtrack! Plus a small chamber orchestra (3-5 professional musicians) will be hired to accompany the vocals and the synthesized tracks! Also, the game soundtrack (the reward for backers who qualify for the Deluxe Digital or Physical Edition) will be extended from 60 minutes to 75 minutes!\nDex will be made available on Wii U about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. The funds will cover the license fees and the additional development time for porting (programming, GUI, testing). Upon reaching this goal, all backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the Wii U version.\nNote: This stretch goal will either prolong development time by a few months or will be available as post-release DLC (free for all backers eligible for Digital Game Download).\nWe will add four unique armor types, including specific new gameplay parameters \u2013 not only different stats, but also organic features. Remember the Spike-Breaker from Castlevania or Hazmat suit from the Deus Ex? Like that. We will also expand the whole game by adding new areas and side-quests, creating new content, locations, and game moments to make the fullest use of our extension funds.\nUpon reaching this goal, Dex will be made available on NVidia Shield about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the NVidia Shield version.\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in German and French.\nA whole new mission to take place on an island outside the borders of Harbor Prime will be added and organically melded into the game. Will you hack your way through or turn the island into a hell on Earth with firearms and explosives? Includes a whole new map, sized several vertical by several horizontal screens, with unique sprites and art, multiple solutions and paths!\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in Spanish and Italian, plus one additional language based upon a poll of our backers.\nOne of our two \u201copen-world/sandbox\u201d game extensions, Fighting Club will be a place where you can, well, fight... as well as practice and join tournaments. The location will probably be connected to a side mission or two and may involve dirty practices and reveal aspects of the personal backgrounds of some of the characters in the storyline. Fighting Club will probably also be connected to some achievements (in-game as well as Steam achievements, if you are on Steam) and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 some RPG features as well.\nSimilar in concept to Fighting Club. A location where you can practice, shoot at targets, or perform various challenges. At the moment, we are considering an outdoor shooting range, beyond the city borders and an indoor one with sophisticated training drones. As with Fighting Club, we will connect the Shooting Range organically to the rest of the game, through characters and side missions.\nA documentary (30+ minutes) about the development of Dex, including developer commentaries, notes, and behind-the-scenes stories and footage. Filmed by a professional camera crew over the course of development (starting with the end of Kickstarter campaign and ending with the release of the game), this short movie will be a \u201ctime-lapse exposure\u201d of real people creating a game under indie conditions. The movie will be available for download to all Kickstarter backers eligible for the Deluxe Digital Edition and above.\nAt the moment, there are two major gangs in the city, which you are somehow involved with. When we reach the \u00a355000 Stretch Goal, we will add a third gang to rule the streets and underground of Harbor Prime. This addition will include new locations, a new gang headquarters, a whole third gang, and an array of gang missions for you to undertake. We will also flesh out the gang hierarchy more: you can perform missions for the gang of your choice, become its member, and climb the gang leadership ladder, with specific gameplay and story impacts.\nPS4 and Xbox One versions of Dex will be issued about 2-4 months from the initial release of the game. The funds will help us cover all license and legal fees and related development costs (programming, GUI, testing). All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the PS4/Xbox One version.\nYou can learn about our team members in one of our updates.\nWindows: XP SP2 or later/ Vista / 7 / 8\nLinux: Ubuntu 10.04 or later and compatible distributions \u2013 Arch Linux, Gentoo, Debian, and possibly others.\nMac: OS X \"Snow Leopard\" 10.6 or later.\nOuya\nRegarding hardware requirements (for PCs): Graphics card with shader model 2.0 capabilities (DirectX or OpenGL, any ATi or NVidia card made since 2004 should work, or Intel cards with Occlusion Query support), 1 GB RAM, 8 GB disc space.\nDAY-1 SIMULTANEOUS RELEASE FOR: \nAdditional platforms and devices are possible, but will not be available immediately upon initial launch. \nDOUBLE OUR FUN(DS)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv. Note: the exclusivity applies only among consoles and does not affect Windows/Linux/Mac release! \nThe game, upon release, will be simultaneously available for PC (Win, Linux), Mac, and OUYA.  \nBackers eligible for game download will receive the game for the platform of their choice or will get a key to redeem it on Desura/Steam (again, provided we make it through Greenlight) or GOG (if possible).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are determined to complete the game. Without funds from Kickstarter, though, it will take a much longer development time and we will have to omit some features and content, especially material produced by external freelancers. \n\nDex is already quite far along in development and is following a clear vision of what the game will be like when finished. The close of pre-alpha development (i.e. adding, subtracting, and experimenting with features and content) is scheduled for February 2014. This means we are nearing the feature-stop phase, but are maintaining flexibility for multiple possible Kickstarter outcomes (finance-wise) as well as for adjustments and ideas based on your input. \n\nBecause game development is hard to predict, there may be delays in the original plan. Budget-wise, we plan to set aside a reserve fund to cover potential delays. Should our estimated workflow proceed as expected, the reserve will be used for free post-release updates, fixes, enhancements etc.; otherwise we are prepared for a possible longer development time.

However, this precise order of things is thrown into chaos when a mysterious crime is discovered. The only clue to his murder are the dead flowers placed by the side of the dead body. \nFrom this point, the player assumes the role of detective, exploring the game\u2019s world, questioning its strange and colourful citizens, and uncovering more clues that will eventually unravel the mystery as to who committed the terrible crime.\nFind out when, how and why this mysterious crime occurred... ...and ultimately, who committed it - and why ?\nThis fantastic world is coming from the creative minds behind best-selling classic adventure game Syberia and acclaimed Steampunk sculptor and artist St\u00e9phane Halleux.\nThe Dead Flowers Case is now also presented on steam (in the concept green light section). If you have a steam account, please go there and vote for the game - it will be of a great help.\nClick here to go to the steam green light section  \nSuperb exclusive offers !!! (see details below) \nWe've created some amazing limited edition items for backers of the campaign including T-shirts and Artbooks as well as statues signed and authenticated by Stephane himself. There's also a chance to come to Paris and meet with us and Stephane. We're incredibly excited about this project and bringing the unique Steampunk world inside Stephane's mind to life. With your support, we're going to create an amazing game and are very grateful for your backing. Keep your eyes on here for more developments as we add more content during the campaign.\n                        Set in a unique universe from the mind of acclaimed artist St\u00e9phane Halleux, The Dead Flowers Case is an adventure game in which players must use all of their skills to investigate the case and unravel the many mysteries that will ultimately expose the perpetrator of this terrible crime.\n    Explore the rich game world, meet and interrogate strange people, move from room to room in search of clues with the help of the latest police and forensics technology including the MecaLens (that can detect blood stains, foot and finger prints, plant life\u2026)\nthe Small Machine (the first steampunk laptop used for remote interrogations) and finally, the Big Machine, an amazing device as big as a wall... which no one really remembers how to use... \nUsing the MecaLens \u2013 What will it detect on the crime scene? Analyze the clues correctly, interrogate and confront the suspects, and, most of all\u2026follow your instinct. Explore the world, and the strange machines that populate its many corners, feel around, touch, pull on any accessible lever... and press on all the buttons (well, on some at least. Might be best if you avoid touching certain things, well...you can do if you really want but at your own risk...).    \nExperience hours of gameplay, riddles, suspense, plot twists and turns in the plot. Discover a fabulous universe with its extraordinary inhabitants, a living world where the characters react to your every action and will often do the strangest things.\nWho is who? Who wants what? What is the Chief of Police's real motive? What's a Nevrovitamin? And what time is dinner ? These are just a few of the many questions you'll need to address in... The Dead Flowers Case !\nA unique world, born from the imagination of acclaimed artist St\u00e9phane Halleux and the Mando Productions team.\nIn this incredible universe, life is organized around gigantic autonomous buildings, sheltering production centers as well as the workers\u2019 living quarters. The world is ruled exclusively by order and the mechanical organization of all things and work activities. Seen as too chaotic and free, plant life was eradicated long ago \u2013 and nobody has seen a plant or a tree for generations, to the point that the notion of a \"flower\" has almost become a legend.\nIn place of food, everyone swallows a supplemental Nevrovitamin pill three times a day. This is the ultimate and complete food, catering to all your needs. Thanks to Nevrovitamin, no need to take a lunch break anymore, you can keep on working on and on and on\u2026\nProduction at the Automobile Plant is focused entirely on very specific designs. At \"Taylor & Stevens\", there are only four models : a multi-purpose transportation truck, a taxi, a luxury saloon built in very limited numbers and only made for the top executives/leaders, a very basic single person model. Production chains are very well organized so that workers perform their duty with zeal and dedication. Up on the higher levels of the immense hall is the seemingly inaccessible administrative floor in which the company is managed by a small handful of executives. Sitting amongst these is John, the company's MecaBrain who has managed to memorize all of the company's figures and its darkest secrets. Even higher up is the mysterious and frightening Mr. Stevens, the supreme and quasi invisible boss of the plant.\nShould someone criticize the Company : beware ! The secret police - known as the fearsome Shadow Musicians - are watching your every move. Their land deputies are not the most reassuring of creatures either... \nIn short, this is a well organized and ordained world. \nA world that nothing can trouble.\nExcept maybe, one small dead flower...\nIt's early one morning, deep in the administrative offices of the automobile production unit. \nEveryone is at work when suddenly... \nThe alarms start ringing and the automatic security doors slam shut, cutting everyone in the Administrative Department off from the rest of the building.\nInside the plant, the alarm only rings for two known reasons: either to herald an official announcement or because someone has died. But there is also a third and more hidden reason (unknown to most) that will trigger the alarm: the detection of plant life...\nThat very morning the company's MecaBrain is tragically found dead at his workstation (which as anyone agrees is an unusual event at the worst of times). Even more so in this well-organized world is the fact that dead flowers have been placed next to the body.\nThe collision of these two highly unusual circumstances will bring the Chief of Police himself to the crime scene. This case promises to be a difficult one.\nBut then again...\nBut then again....the case may be an open and shut one. As soon as the alarm sounded, the armored security doors slammed shut, isolating the administration floor from the rest of the building. With all the people now trapped inside, the guilty party MUST be amongst them. It's simply a case of questioning the people who are now trapped in the department and identifying the culprit.\nOf course the presence of flowers does complicate things - can you believe it, flowers ! No one had seen any for decades ! The chief of police is a cautious person who prefers not to stick out his neck too far, should there be complications. This is why he\u2019s going to look for the perfect underling to investigate in his place and take all the risks.\nSo...who would possibly be so na\u00efve as to accept such a risky mission?\nOh hello there! - you look like you might enjoy a bit of detective work...\nSt\u00e9phane Halleux has been sculpting since 2005 when he first began to create the fabulous universe he's still developing to this day.\nHe studied at the Saint-Luc Institute in Li\u00e8ge (Belgium), before working as a model maker and coloring for the animation business. He now lives in Namur (Belgium).\nSt\u00e9phane's unique universe revolves around the subtle alchemy between his vision and the material and elements he wants to shape. He likes to create extraordinary characters...whilst imagining an (almost) perfectly realistic daily life for them. The Nevrovitamin salesman must do his job and sell his pills... providing he does so flying away with a propeller helmet !\nFrom the beginning, St\u00e9phane's work has been exhibited throughout Europe and the world (San Diego, Paris, Luxemburg, Berlin...) and again in Paris in November 2013.\nHis work has won him international renown - including from other creators. Hence, Tim Johnson, animation director at Dreamworks (Antz, Sinbad: legend of the seven seas, Over the hedge...) has said of St\u00e9phane's work: \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Stephane\u2019s work as a fellow story-teller. His sculptures all seem to have popped out of an animated universe. It\u2019s their narrative quality that I find so arresting. They tell you a rich and complicated tale \u2013 while simply standing there\u201d.\nMichel, St\u00e9phane and Olivier\nOlivier Fontenay is production manager at Mando. He has been creating games for over 20 years now, in particular, he produced Amerzone and Syberia with Benoit Sokal, as well as more than 30 other games for PC, Xbox, PS3, Smartphone... He has a passion for adventure and narration and invests a lot in working with creators : Jane Jensen (Gabriel\u2019s Knight series, Gray Matter, \u2026), Bernard Werber (Empire of the Ants, etc), Enki Bilal (Nikopol Trilogy).\nMichel Bams is one of the co-founders of Mando Productions. Creating original work for the widest possible audience has always been a priority for him, with no compromise on quality. With a working experience in marketing and publishing, he focuses on the originality of projects and themes - such as Babel Rising, a game that features God and the tower of Babel or Cardboard Castle, the adventures of a knight... made out of cardboard.\nCatherine Cuenca has been writing for over 15 years for audiovisual animation series as a scriptwriter and concept author. Since 2009, she has been specializing in interactive creation. She develops transmedia universes mixing audio-visual, web and video games, real and animation images.\nPhilippe Saisse is a legend in the music world. A composer and musician - he's played and recorded with the greatest, from the Rolling Stones to David Bowie... He's also the man who conceived Nougayork with Claude Nougaro. Philippe has a passion for uncommon images and universes and he loved the universe of The Dead Flowers Case. Ever since, he has been designing sound for this incredible world.\nDamien Kochanek is technical director at Mando Productions. For over 10 years now and on almost every existing machine possible, Damien has been programming games (from PC to PS3, Xbox to Windows 8, PCs, Mac, smartphone, etc.) He has put together a team of brilliant programmers, who are able to make the most of an efficient engine - Unity - on a large variety platforms!\n...and of course, there is the whole Mando Productions team - about twenty professionals with a passion for their job: programming, game design, level design, 2D and 3D graphic design...\nAbsolute concentration : Michel, St\u00e9phane, Catherine, Olivier, Lilian, Paul & Guillaume\n                                    Mando Productions is a video game studio, based in Paris, France. The studio's aim is to design and create original games, both in terms of the content theme and graphical treatment.  Mando has developed many multi-platform games in the recent years (including the award-winning Babel Rising, Hills of Glory, etc). Typically, Mando games receive very good player reviews, with an average ratings of over 4.5 / 5 on the major stores.\nThe Mando team organization:\n- Programming : an experienced team managed by Damien Kochanek, developing games for 10 years now for PC, PS3, Xbox, Wii and DS games... Mando projects are designed around the Unity engine, an engine that allows for great flexibility in terms of work and creativity. Damien is supported by a team of programmers who have perfect command of existing platforms: from iOS to Windows 8 and, of course, consoles, PC, Mac, etc.\n- The creative team is managed by the two heads of the studio themselves, Michel Bams and Olivier Fontenay. Michel and Olivier have been working on game design together for over 15 years; they started with their first adventure games based on the universes imagined by Benoit Sokal, and have never stopped ever since!\nTheir first major accomplishment in terms of adventure games is the Amerzone, by Benoit Sokal.\nPLAY\n\n(Amerzone - Anuman Interactive. Produced by Olivier Fontenay) *\nWorking with an enthusiast such as Benoit was a true pleasure for Olivier and Michel, and they followed suit with Syberia, a game that met with worldwide success, a reward for the efforts of a whole team, with several million copies sold throughout the world and which is still a major reference to this day for true amateurs.\nPLAY\n\n(Syberia - Anuman Interactive. Produced by Olivier Fontenay) *\nMichel, Olivier and Benoit co-founded a company dedicated to designing artistic universes - with the idea of bringing in talent from other realms than video games. This of course led to \"Paradise\" and \"Sinking Island\", two creations of Benoit Sokal, but also \"Nikopol' with Enki Bilal, \"Crime Scene\"  (etc.) - with authors and artists from the universe of Comics, Film, TV series and literature.\nMichel and Olivier then founded Mando Productions, so as to continue creating original universes, for smartphone (Babel Rising, etc.) And now, so as to return to the world of adventure with The Dead Flowers Case and St\u00e9phane Halleux's fabulous universe.\n(Amerzone and Syberia, were published by Micro\u00efds, Paradise and Sinking Island by Micro Application and Ubisoft, Nikopol by 505 Games and Crime Scene by Nobilis. None of these companies is affiliated with The Dead Flowers Case or Mando Productions)\nThe Statuettes\nSeveral magnificent Limited Edition Statuettes specially designed for the game.

Several offers enable you to get both versions. Why? Because we've put in place a system for continuous cross-platform play ! Start playing on your PC, then continue investigating on your tablet; and finally, resume playing on your PC or Mac.\nThe Dead Flowers Case lets you automatically share your saved game between a desktop computer and tablet version. This way, you can start playing at home on your Mac, continue playing while you're traveling or on your way to work on a tablet and even... complete the investigation on your office PC... Anything is possible (including not sharing your saved game if you wish). \nIt's free and directly included with the game.\nGameplay Specifics\nSome important things to remember :\n- The player controls a real-time 3D character (not currently shown in the videos) in pre-rendered graphics (2.5 D adventure game, as Syberia or many other classical games). Specific game plays sequences (as the MecaLens, or the Big Machine or the... Small Machine) are... specific to the game :)\n- The game is an adventure game with classic exploration, riddle and dialogue gameplay, but it also features original ideas such as the Big Machine, etc. It can be played entirely with the mouse on PC and Mac, and with touch-screen controls on tablets.\n- On PC & Mac, the game will be DRM free\n- IOS @ Android version : the game is a premium version, with no inapp purchases nor advertising. Everything is there from the beginning !\nWhy Kickstarter ?\nBecause it's where creativity meets funding.\nIt has become very difficult, even impossible, to find publishers willing to fund adventure games.Itis a genre that still has many fans and a dynamic community, but that doesn't appeal much to the business sector. Luckily for us designers of adventure games there's Kickstarter! It has become the essential platform where innovative projects canmeet the gaming community that wants to support them.\nLaunching this project on Kickstarter seemed obvious to us from the start. We know that our game will be given the welcome it deserves, and that Kickstarter will enable us to open a dialogue directly with the community\u2014a chance to explain in detail everything that makes our project original and unique.\nHow will the funding be used ?\nYour funding will go towards building the game. Every money that you invest will be spent in making The Dead Flowers Case the best possible experience. The game will be developed by our team, already created and operational, and we will reinforce it in the graphical field.\n* (Syberia (c) 2002-2013 Anuman Interactive - Amerzone (c) 1999 - 2013 Anuman Interactive - Sinking Island (c) 2007 - 2013 Anuman Interactive -Crime Scene (c) 2009 - 2013 Anuman Interactive)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are producing and developing games for over than 20 years.

It is set in a world where the \"NPCs\" of the village--the bakers, minstrels, farmers, shopkeepers and healers--set off on a wonderful adventure exploring a fantasy world together. Some people colloquially call it \"Hayao Miyazaki's Oregon Trail\", because of its heartwarming (in Japanese \"honobono\") feel of family anime, and its focus on traveling and wonder over combat and treasure.\nThe game has been out in Japan for years, and is widely loved by the people who play it. Even today long campaigns and short stories are being played in homes and cafes around the country.\nThe Original Ryuutama Japanese Book Cover. Click for a larger view!\nPlease see the website for more in-depth information about Ryuutama.\nRyuutama means \"Dragon's Egg\". It is set in a western fantasy world where the four Seasonal Dragons create and maintain reality. The characters go on an adventure, which is watched from afar by a Ryuujin, or \"Dragon-Person\". This Ryuujin watches their struggles, and records the events of the characters' journey. The Ryuujin then tells those tales to the Season Dragons, which gives them strength, and helps them bear the eggs of future dragons which will protect the world.\nThe background is that every person in the setting, at some point in their lives, feels an intense need to go on a long journey. Their family, friends, and co-workers understand, and help them prepare for their journey. The characters are not powerful warriors and wizards, but rather just normal village people. \nThe character classes are Minstrel, Merchant, Healer, Hunter, Artisan, Farmer and Noble. Each class has a few simple abilities that reflect their backgrounds. Each character can be a fighting, technical, or magic-using character depending on the player's choice.\nThe players play the roles of the characters, and one Game Master (GM) creates and navigates the characters through a scenario. Together, they create the details of the World and the Towns that the characters visit. The GM also has a special character with its own sheet called the \"Ryuujin\", which is a character that remains offscreen most of the time, but watches over the characters: The Ryuujin can cast some limited spells or abilities to help out or guide the characters. The GM creates the adversity that the players have to overcome, but the Ryuujin is out to protect and nurture the characters to some degree.\nTravel and people form the core of the game: While there is a unique console RPG-style combat system that's quite exciting, a majority of the focus of the game is on travel and problem-solving. Hit Point loss and gain mostly happens due to travel, and the unique Seasonal Magical Spells focus on solving interesting problems in unique ways.\nYou just need paper, pencils, a set of polyhedral dice (4, 6, 8, and 10-sided dice), a place to play, and friends with an open heart to play Ryuutama. Record your journeys. Create a tale that you will remember for years to come. Enjoy the time spent with your friends and family. This is what Ryuutama is all about.\nYou can find more about the game, including pictures, at the Ryuutama website. If you're familiar with Tabletop RPGs and want to know how Ryuutama is different, we have a page for that, too.\nYou can peruse some sample English character sheets and the like as well.\nFinally, you can legally download the full original Japanese version of the game from the 100% legit (the author listed it) free Japanese manga download site \"j-comi\" (click on the green \"PDF\" button on the left). The English version will look very similar to that book, but with some extra text and pictures (and of course Be In English!). One day, in a few years, we too hope to make the game available free to all in English as well.\nThe PDF Rulebook - This is a copy of the Ryuutama book in English, running at about 7x10 inches (almost B5 size), 200+ pages, and unlike the original, the English edition will be in full color! It will be gorgeously laid out by layout genius Daniel Solis, using the original Japanese book as inspiration. It will be in PDF format, and distributed exclusively to all backers through DriveThruRPG.\nEveryone at the PDF backer level and above will have their name added into the book as a supporter. When we finish the first editing pass, everyone at this level will get access to the raw \"pre-layout\" text as well, so folks can begin playing before the end of the year holidays.\nWe will also bundle some extras with this as well: New rules, new content, and play aids for the table like Terrain and Weather tracking cards. So it's going to be more than \"just a book\"!\nElectronic Supplemental Material - Matt and Andy are working on translating a bunch of other supplemental material that came out for the original Japanese and translated French editions of the game. We are also having the author write some more material for the game! This includes new character classes, a travelogue of new places and events, and more. We will also eventually be releasing the supplemental Seafaring rules and Navigator character class. It will be released piecemeal in electronic format.\nYou really only need the core rulebook PDF to enjoy the game, This package just gives you a little more for the future!\nThe Physical Book - We're producing a hardcover copy of Ryuutama. It will be black and white, 7 x 10 inches (intl B5 size), all full-color pages, 200+ total pages, all of the contents of the original Japanese book plus some extra materials, information, notes and clarification. \nOriginal Character Art - Miss Toyuki Mizusaka, one of the two original artists of the Ryuutama game (she did most of the art for the supplements), has volunteered her time and energy to do your Ryuutama character sketches! They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. There's only so much art Mizusaka-sensei can produce, so these are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you tell us some things about your character, and she will design a manga-style sketch fitting a Ryuutama game. See the sample sketch of \"Ruru\", below: This is the kind of sketch she will be doing for you.\nOriginal Scene Art - Again, Toyuki Mizusaka has volunteered her time and energy to do a limited number of scene sketches for you or your group. The \"Ryuutama Marketplace\" illustration at the top of this Kickstarter campaign was one such picture. They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. These, too, are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you describe the scene and the characters in it, and she will design your scene for you. Some of these sketches may appear in the rulebook!\nScenario Design - Atsuhiro Okada has volunteered to craft original Ryuutama scenarios for you and your group! After the Kickstarter ends, you'll give us some details about what you want to see: He will write the scenario (a few pages), we will translate it from Japanese to English, and we'll also have Mizusaka-sensei contribute two pictures of scenes from the scenario (including of your characters, if you wish) to go with it. \nADD ONS\n* An extra physical copy of the book: $40, no additional shipping cost anywhere! If you live outside of the US, please feel free to gather friends and get books together to save money on shipping! Each additional copy you purchase for a friend, we will send one additional electronic PDF to that person, plus add their name as a Backer in the book! If two or more people each want a \"PLUS PLUS\" level, simply add an additional $10 per person who wants the \"PLUS PLUS\" rewards!\nRuru the Healer, the first Ryuutama character Toyuki Mizusaka played!\nOur goals are simple:\n* We want to develop an English PDF version of Ryuutama that will last forever.\n* We want to produce 1,000 physical copies of Ryuutama in English, and put them into distribution around the world.\n* We want to translate and publish some of the supplemental material for the game, if interest warrants it: More text, limited art, and table aids like cards and printouts that help ease into play faster or make it more fun.\n* We want to do all the above at an easy pace for all of us: No races here: We're in this project for the long haul, and plan to develop for it for years to come.\n* Finally, we want to get more people interested in Ryuutama: It's a wonderful tabletop RPG that deserves attention. We're opening the system, allowing fans to write, produce, distribute and sell their own material for this game.\nAtsuhiro Okada 's motto is \"No Gaming, No Life\": He lives in Tokyo and works at the first tabletop gaming cafe ever created in Japan, Tabletop Cafe Daydream in Kanda ward. His job is to run and play games almost every day of the year, and focuses on getting new men and women interested in tabletop gaming.\nYuki Mizusaka is one of the two original artists of the game, having worked primarily on the art for the original Ryuutama supplements. She's a wonderful person and an avid gamer (player and GM).\nMatt Sanchez is the primary translator of the game. His Japanese-fu is epic and love for gaming strong, almost as strong as his love of the \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\" manga series. He lives and works near Atlanta, GA.\nAndy Kitkowski is the other translator, and the producer of the game. This is the third Japanese translation/publishing project he's worked on, after Tenra Bansho Zero and Maid: The Role-Playing Game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nDaniel Solis is a layout expert and professional tabletop game designer, and he will be doing the layout of the game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nWe're doing something new, called \"Milestones\". Instead of drumming up higher levels of money to aim for, we're instead taking our time (so that things don't get out of hand) and announcing goals achieved afterwards. Here's the current list of all Milestone Rewards, together. If the item says \"++\" after, that means it is available to the backers of the \"PLUS PLUS\" levels.\nSee MILESTONE ONE and MILESTONE TWO updates for details on the below.\nSpecial extras:\n* We are funding the creation of a Ryuutama gaming/assistant app, for Apple IOS and Android. It will come out within the next year and be reasonably priced.\nAll level extras:\n* Ryuutama will be in FULL COLOR for all Kickstarter backers: PDF and Physical Book!\n* Random NPC Generation Tables\n* New Rules for Herbalism/Healer Class\n* Topography and Weather cards, downloadable/print-and-play\n* We will be making a free downloadable guide to beginner character creation.\n\nPLUS PLUS level extras:\n* The content of the original Japanese Ryuutama supplements, which includes the following:\n* Wagon Travel Rules ++\n* Road Campaign Creation Rules ++\n* Ocean Travel Rules ++\n* New Class: Navigator ++\n* Konekogoblin PCs ++\n* Random Events for Weather/Topography ++\n* Ad-Lib Style Scenario Hooks ++\n* Additional Character Classes from the French edition of the book ++\n* New Air Travel rules, including skyships! ++\n* And with it, a new Air Pilot character class. ++\nCanadian/Japanese Friends: Shipping to Canada, Japan is $28: See the $68, $78 levels. This is a careful estimate at a 3 lb weight for a 220-page, hardcover book at 7x10 inches plus packaging. However, this puts the book right on the line of 3 to 4 lbs. If it crosses over to 4lbs (because of page count, add-ons) or prices go up on intl shipping again, I may later require an additional $8 USD ($36 total) for shipping at a later date. I'm taking a risk by setting Canadian and Japanese shipping at a lower price, so please bear with us.\nThe Character Sketch, Scene Sketch and Adventure Creation levels have to be set to $40 for now for all intl backers.\nInternational Friends: Shipping is $40. This, too, is at current cost estimates and rates, and seeing that there are no international rate hikes coming in the next 6 months. However, if prices do go up on intl shipping again unexpectedly, I may later require an additional $10 USD. However, this is not very likely. This cost is a one-time cost: If you order 1, 2, or 4 books at $40 each, the $40 shipping fee is a one-time fee applied to the entire total.\nSince international shipping rates skyrocketed in January 2013, it's been hard to easily accommodate our international supporters with reasonable shipping rates for the physical book. We are putting a flat $40 fee on all outside-US shipping (except Canada), even though we know that shipping to Canada and Japan is estimated to be $28; Europe $45-55, and Asia $45-60. We're willing to take a small hit on the books in order to get them to you. Extra donations are always welcome!\nIn any case, shipping within the US will be free. I would highly recommend international backers to look into reshipper/reshipping services (also called \"mail forwarders\" who will work with your country to bring you goods from the US. In most cases you'll receive a US address for us to ship to, and you will pay them about $25-35 (and no cost of shipping from us to the forwarding address) rather than $40; furthermore, the book will get there just as fast as if we had sent it direct.\nAlso, if it's easier, you can always just back the electronic copy of the book: We'll of course grant you full rights to print the book yourself or with a local Print on Demand service; we will also allow everyone to print their copies from DriveThruRPG: For international physical backers, printing a softcover copy locally and having it shipped that way will save you some money.\nAgain, here's how to make international shipping slightly less horrible:\n* Get your friends to buy their copies together: Each additional copy of the book is $40 per book, with no extra shipping costs: Just the one-time $40 shipping fee. You will also get one \"PDF Download Link\" per extra book copy you buy, so your friends will be able to get a download of the game as well.\n\n* Look into a reshipper/mail forwarder that services your country. Using the dimensions above, you may be able to turn a $40 shipping (from USPS) into a $25 or less deal.\n\n* Stick to the PDF version for now. You can then print that version locally at a Print on Demand or other printer if you want. \nThank you so much for your understanding, this really hurt us but we don't want to cause problems in production because of lack of funds.\nNekogoblins (Cat Goblins) and Konekogoblins (Kitten Goblins)\nThe game is done, we just need to tighten and edit. So there is no development time needed, and we'll be avoiding all those potholes. All backers will get access to the \"plaintext only\" copy shortly after the Kickstarter project finishes (or before, if we can complete the first editing pass by then).\nWe support all types of gaming and playstyles: Atsuhiro-sensei plays everything from Warhammer minis (he will roll over you with his Skaven army) to Honobono-themed family games. We all love Ryuutama, and none of us consider it the Final Word of tabletop roleplaying; it's just another great, fun, well-designed game to put in your toolchest and play with your friends.\nFinally, I want to give a big shout out to Andi from Germany of the band Gillicuddy: You can visit his Bandcamp page here. His album \"...Plays Guitar\" is a perfect accompaniment to a Ryuutama game table. When I first heard the tune \"Travelling Made-up Continents\" (the one we used in our video, after asking Andi for permission), I knew that this was the perfect track to accompany this project. The entire album is wonderful: If you're a fan of fingerstyle classical guitar (Will Ackerman etc) it's definitely worth a listen/purchase. Please check it out!\nThank you all for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's not really a lot that could go wrong in a Kickstarter like this. However, I've done one in the past and have learned a lot from the experience. Here's some potential problems and planned workarounds:\n\n* Overall product delay - Not likely. The game is translated from front to back, with the current exception of a few hand-written captions. We just have to edit it, and add two pages of explanatory text. We're not starting the project; rather we're a few meters from the finishing line.\n\n* PDF delay - The layout person, Daniel Solis, is noteworthy for his professionalism and speed. No issue here.\n\n* Book delay - Instead of overseas, we are printing in the US this time with a reputable printer. No unexpected cultural or freight delays. The distributor/warehouse is two states away, and are as well very reputable (we've worked with them for years), so no major problems/\"several months delay\" expected there.\n\n* Overall burnout/Fatigue - We're keeping this Kickstarter simple. We have more in the pipes for it, stuff that will be available to you all, but that will come in time. But me and Matt have day jobs, and want to make sure that we're not going to promise more than we can deliver, and burn ourselves out. Plus, we well-padded our expected deadlines so that we don't blow through them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Quick Update - Supplement, Supplement Print Run, and RPG Second Printing!", "update_content": "Hey Team Ryuutama!

Check the Veteran Rewards Here\nFor more Reward Updates, CLICK HERE\nThe vision for the Graywalkers saga has underlying foundations that will guide it through its development from beginning to end:\nBest of Turn-Based/RPG \u2013 The game was inspired by some of the best turn-based/RPG games we love: the X-Com series, Fallout Series, Jagged Alliance series, the original Wasteland, Baldur's Gate and Arcanum. We've melded the best features we loved from these games and added our own to create a unique but familiar experience.\nEpic Story, Deep Mythos & New Mysterious World \u2013 The epic story of Graywalkers spans more than 2000 years of background history, providing a deep and rich world flavored with new takes on old legends and mysteries waiting to be discovered.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 We wanted to create a game where the player's decisions and actions have the ability to change and affect the world in profound ways. \nCommunity Interaction \u2013 One of the reasons for us being here on Kickstarter is to build a community behind this game. We want them to be a part of the development of this game as much as is reasonably possible. \nPre-Alpha Prototype Real Time Movement Screenshot (Areascape)\nGame Type \u2013 It is a 3D 3rd person role-playing game with strategic and tactical elements. You can toggle between Isometric and Perspective views.\nGame Modes \u2013 There are 3 Game Modes; Campaign is the single-player epic storyline, Freeform is a single player experience where everything is procedurally generated and your measure for success is affected by influence, resources and power. If Stretch goals are reached, we will be adding a Multiplayer Mode which is Team based PVP.\nDistribution \u2013 We are targeting on distributing on as many digital platforms as we can get on, including hopefully Steam, GOG, Desura and others. Steam Keys will be available.\nCurrent State \u2013 The game is in the pre-alpha stage. We have working prototypes for some of the core systems but we still need to build the majority of the content. We estimate 14-18 months more of development time is needed.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Real Time Movement Screenshot (Areascape)\nThe game will have an expansive list of exciting core features:\nCustom Hero \u2013 Your player character is a special one, even among Graywalkers. He is customizable, where you can choose his or her gender, race, appearance, path, skills and special abilities.\nRaces \u2013 You can be Human or one of the Hybrids, like the Cambion, Nephilim, Dhampir, Wolfkin and Hunterborne.\nCharacter Paths \u2013 \"Paths\" are the equivalent to classes in typical RPGs. Choose a path to take such as the magic-wielding Arcanist, the weapon master Armsmen, the stealthy Agents, the spiritually blessed Diviners, the firearms expert Soldiers, the hand-to-hand specialist Martialist, the perceptive Scouts, the versatile Adventurers, the intelligent Techs, and the lucky Survivors.\nRecruitment \u2013 Find, convince and recruit your Graywalker team members from a pool of at least 50+ playable NPCs, each with their own style, personality, motivation, relationships and history.\nLevels & Experience \u2013 Gain experience points through missions and improve your characters skills and abilities each time you level up.\nStrategic Management \u2013 Manage your resources, personnel, influence, technology, research, crafting and scavenging. \nPre-Alpha Prototype Screenshot (Areascape)\nExploration \u2013 Explore a country sized island with different regions, each filled with interesting locations to visit, scavenge in, influence and control.\nStrategic Bases \u2013 Find and capture strategic points that can act as base of operations where you can rest, recuperate, rearm and reorganize. Defend these operational bases from attacks and prevent enemies from retaking it from your control.\nResources \u2013 Scavenge for resources, rebuild lost technology, recover ancient relics of power, and research entirely new technologies that fuse the powers of ancient magic and known science.\nCrafting \u2013 Many things you find in the world are useful in that they can be used to build certain things. To create more exotic items, you need to have the blueprints or formula for it and the needed skill sets.\nVehicles \u2013 Acquire vehicles to increase your speed of travel between locations on the map and carry more equipment--or maybe even use them in combat.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Combat Screenshot (Combatscape)\nEnemies \u2013 Encounter many kinds of enemies such as zealot cultists, rival gangs, dangerous criminals, demons, fallen angels, feral vampires, rabid werewolves, zombies, ghosts, witches and other supernatural creatures of legend.\nCombat Choices \u2013 When in combat, you can choose the quick and easy Strategic Combat or the down and dirty Turn-based Tactical Combat.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes.\nSpecial Abilities \u2013 Each character has a list of special abilities which are dependent on his Race, Path and Style.\nIn addition to the core features, there are several features which may make the game stand out\nWyldekarde RPG System \u2013 The game will utilize a simpler version of the upcoming generic table top rpg system.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 What you do and don\u2019t do will affect the world and have consequences which will change it as well. This is common in strategy games but is rare among tactical turn-based games.\nProcedural World \u2013 The game will rely on procedural content for the Campaign but most heavily in the Freeform mode of play.\nCrowd Content \u2013 This initiative will allow people to share their talents to the game by contributing content such as 3d Models, 2d Art, music, sound effects, animations and others. \nThere will be a special rewards structure for crowd content which we will reveal more after the campaign is successful.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Screenshots (Areascape, Real Time Movement)\nRegionscape \u2013 This is the view where many of the strategic decisions are made from. It is an overhead map showing you where you and your teams are on the map. From here, you can control where your teams go, manage time movement, view strategic information and sometimes even see enemy movement. \nAreascape \u2013 This is the 3d map where your characters can move in real time either individually or as a group. \nStrategic Management \u2013 When not fighting, you need to coordinate your teams, gather and manage resources, negotiate with the various factions, and spread your influence. Ultimately, you need to gather enough forces to drive the demonic invaders out of the land. But how you do that is up to you. For example: Do you side with the disreputable crime lords of Lost Vegas? Or the well-equipped but bigoted human supremacists? \nEarly Pre-Alpha Prototype Tactical Combat Screenshot\nFactions \u2013 Like in a 4x Strategy Game, each faction in Graywalkers has its own agenda to pursue, with or without the player\u2019s help. They decide on their own, and depending on the circumstances, may engage in war against each other. You will find the faction\u2019s territorial lines moving back and forth, as each wrestles for control of valuable commodities. How you interact with them will determine your Influence Factor with these factions. \nMissions \u2013 There are many kinds of missions to engage in. Some will push the story forward, some will convince recruits to join you, some will improve your relationship with a faction.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nCombatscape \u2013 The combat map or what we call Combatscape uses a square grid 3d map which you can rotate freely to see all sides of the action. This map looks similar to the Areascape except that movement is limited to the grid and by turns.\nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes. \nAction Points \u2013 The combat system uses Action Points. A character can perform several actions in one turn, as long as he has enough Action Points to spend. This is in contrast with other tactics games that allow a character to perform only one move action and one attack action per turn. This grants a greater depth of tactics, allowing the player to perform more elaborate and concerted attacks on the enemy.\nPersonalities \u2013 Character personalities play a big role in combat and may influence how they interpret your commands. Discover who works best with who because some Graywalkers don't see eye-to-eye with each other. If characters in your team hate each other, make sure to keep them separated when fighting or you may just find one of them hitting your teammate \"by accident\"!\nThe 36 Hidden Ones are humans throughout history who have always risen up to be exceptional in their own way, deemed by Fate to have the power to save the whole human race whenever the need comes. They came to be known as Graywalkers, and you are to be the greatest of them. \nThe previous Graywalkers were gone. The apocalypse came to pass and the whole human race was on the brink of extinction. It is up to you now to forge a new generation of Graywalkers and turn the tides of the war against the evil that has taken root in the world.\nThere are many dangers and enemies on Purgatory that you may encounter such as Demons, Devils, Rogue Angels, Rabid Werewolves, Feral Vampires, Zombies, Gangers, Mobsters, Cultists, Bandits, Mercenaries, Monsters and more. \nPurgatory was forged during the cataclysmic event called the Rupture. It merged parts of Heaven and Hell with our world. The result is, the locations where these parts appeared mystically displaced what was there before to different corners of the world. Many of these displaced lands were \u201ccaught\u201d by the area known as the Bermuda Triangle and this new land mass was formed. \nLocation Map of Purgatory in the Atlantic Ocean\n20 Years later, Purgatory and its people have survived and thrived. They have been protected from most of what happened to the rest of the world and were hidden by the same energies that protected the Triangle the way it always has. Unfortunately, Purgatory has finally been discovered and denizens of Hell are slowly moving into it. \nThe status quo on Purgatory is slowly changing and you will now decide the course of what will happen for its future. This place is where your adventures and legend begins.\nThe world of Graywalkers is a bleak and dark place. The majority of the world is either a total wasteland, ruins, or under the control of some supernatural entity or group such as demons, vampires, zombies, ghosts, and others. Most it is dotted by many locations where Heaven or Hell had merged with specific locations on earth. The world\u2019s population has been reduced to about 1%, and many of those remain slaves or prisoners in various parts of the world. Only Purgatory remains a free and relatively habitable area compared to the rest of the world.\nThough there are many locations on Purgatory to visit and discover, there are several key locations that every neophyte Graywalker should know.\nWith the Rupture, mystical energies flooded back into earth bringing back magic in all its glory.

However due to the large amount of supernatural energies and the existence of different supernatural races interacting with humans, several human hybrid sub-races have evolved: \n\n\nPre-Alpha Level Prototype Sample\nDreamlords Digital is a direct-to-digital development studio based out Las Vegas and Manila who specializes in game and gamified apps Though the company is relatively young with only less than 3 years in existence, it has members who have who have worked  on titles like:  \nand worked on creative projects for companies like: \nBut above all else, the group is composed of people who passionately and truly love making games, especially role-playing games.   \n  The idea for Graywalkers was the reason Dreamlords Digital was formed, to be able to build our dream game which centered around this IP. Slowly we have been working on this project on the side, while we were focused on the contract projects to pay the bills. Our plan was to make enough money from them to eventually fund the development of the game. \n\nWhen we found out about Kickstarter, we believed that we could get this game funded and released within a reasonable amount of time, without selling our souls, spleen or first born for it. With your help and pledges, we can keep true to the vision of the game and deliver a gaming experience that you will never forget. \n\nThough DLD has already invested in the development of this game, the funds will help the game accelerate the process by a lot.  The breakdown is: Team Members (45%), More Hardware & Software Licenses (25%), Improve Audio (5%), Quality Assurance and Testing (5%), Rewards (10%), Kickstarter & Amazon Share (10%) \nWe have available add-ons which you can customize your existing pledge reward level with.

A research organization known as G.E.R. has tracked and found the mysterious meteor: a capsule of organic material that brings an unknown life-form to our planet from the depths of space. Here begins the story of this impossible being, as it attempts to escape and survive on this strange, hostile world that we call home.\nIn Paradise Lost you will take control of an alien plant that has been hidden in a secret bio-engineering facility. A security breach in the system allows the plant to escape from imprisonment and discover the secret purposes of the research organization which put it in a jar.\nReferences and gameplay\nOur adventure takes inspiration from classic games like Metal Gear, Metroid, Castlevania and the Oddworld series, focusing on action/stealth gameplay with a dash of platforming and puzzle-solving elements.\nThe game incorporates nonlinear, Metroidvania style mechanics, in which the player at first finds many areas inaccessible. To continue the exploration and escape from the facility, the player has to use specific objects and unlock new abilities.\nThere is also an RPG component: during the course of playing the player gets to direct the evolution of the alien plant, adapting it to their playing style with different skills that will be discovered as the game progresses. These enhancements will allow players to develop their own gaming strategies as the story unfolds.\nCurrent and planned features\nExplore a huge and complex map full of secret projects and situations that will keep you hooked\nEnjoy a rich gameplay experience based on stealth and platforms, mixed with modern mechanics and puzzles\nFace different ways of progressing through the getaway, using stealth and action skills like mental manipulation, decoys, organic bombs and more\nExciting platform challenges. Climb different surfaces and defy gravity laws!\nAmazing scenes full of immersive dialogues and situations\nFind rare items and expand your game experience collecting them\nEpic boss battles!\nWe are really looking forward to make Paradise Lost a unique and exciting gaming experience for the players. Our goal is to find the right balance between the different aspects that shape the gameplay and build an open map full of secrets, surprises and hair-raising situations.\nRegarding the storytelling, dialogues and cut scenes are the cornerstones of the game. This means that not everything will be what it seems to be: twists, mysteries and double-crosses will be a constant during the alien\u2019s escape. Also, the adventure will be filled with references and hidden winks to our sharp-eyed players.\nWe also believe that the audio is an essential part of any immersive experience: not only it gives life to the story but it also intensifies its personality and atmosphere. Our close friend and amazing composer Pablo J. Garm\u00f3n is producing an enthralling soundtrack for Paradise Lost: First Contact.

I grew up drawing adventures set in the games I played at the local arcade, where I spent the money I'd earned, fascinated with the imagination and beautiful sprites of classics like King of Fighters, Dungeons & Dragons and Midnight Wanderers.\nSince then I have dedicated myself to becoming a graphic designer and animator, and I want to put every fiber of my soul into developing an inspired visual experience for our players. \nWhen I was young I fell in love with Spielberg's movies. The way he tells stories and mix fantasy with reality touches my heart. I want to take this experience into the world of videogames, because I think it is a great medium for personal and artistic expression. In a game you become the hero and live intensely all sorts of events and adventures. My goal at Asthree Works is to make awesome and passionate stories and share them with you <3\nI took my first steps into the world of computing when I began programming at the age of 6. I enjoyed the golden age of pc gaming and I especially love adventures with deep storytelling and great characters, games like The Dig, Broken Sword, Monkey Island, Final Fantasy and The Elder Scrolls saga.\nIt has always been my dream to devote my life to the creation of Videogames, and there is no better time than now to join my best friends on a journey to do exactly that.\nI started making music at the same time that I started writing and imagining journeys, and for the very same reason: to tell stories. Since then I have written music for theatre plays, documentaries, short films, shows and, yes, video games. However, for me \"Paradise Lost: First Contact\" is more than a video game: it is a world in itself, it is a compelling story and an engaging experience, and I am truly honored to give it sound. In short, my goal is simple: to make music that is worthy of your time.\nI have been in public relations for a long time, it has been a dream of mine to work with indie video game developers to help their projects become a reality.\nWoof, grrr... support Paradise Lost, bark!\nThis project has been in our minds for a long time, and now that we have finally taken the step to fully embark on this adventure and push our ideas forward, we need your help so that we can cover the costs of the development process.

We carefully planned everything and if we reach the production milestone, we will strive to create a deep and compelling microverse (or macroverse, who knows!).\n\nOne of our biggest risks is that we have adjusted all the stretch goals very tightly, to reach as many people as possible so they can enjoy the game on different platforms. All of this takes a great deal of time and money, and we hope you will support our campaign to achieve this together.\n\nWe are offering a large and varied number of rewards from the lower tiers so everyone can get their money\u2019s worth, because we think that we owe you everything if the project goes ahead.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "2021 Update: working on animation-based levels", "update_content": "First of all, apologies for the radio silence.

The screenplay is adapted from the script for the stage play Nevermore - which ran in Los Angeles and toured the country to sold out houses and great acclaim. A selection of  reviews and articles:  Los Angeles Times, Shock Till You Drop, The Batimore Sun and Fear Net. \nJeffrey Combs as Edgar Allan Poe\nNEVERMORE is set in 1848, a year after the death of Poe's beloved wife Virginia (and a year before his own.) He had become internationally famous as the author of 'The Raven' and his 'Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.' But his fame did not provide fortune and so he was constantly seeking financial security and respect from the literary establishment. \nThis is Poe in his own words. Our text is taken from his letters and essays and we have based our evening on reviews and reports of his actual appearances. Our goal is to present a sense of the fascinating man behind the poetry and brilliant tales, a man who could be his own worst enemy, and whose life was even more bizarre and tragic than his strangest story.\nThe film will expand on the stage play by dramatizing some of Poe's most famous works, including The Raven, The Tell Tale Heart and Annabel Lee. \nNevermore will be presented with period sets and costumes true to the era including gas lamp lighting.  \nSome of our incredible incentives: \nAlan Hynes' Mondo Poster\nAlan Hynes' Poster\nStuart Gordon as Hitchcock\nBryan Moore's Incredible Poe Statue\nCatalogue from the show at the Edgar Allan Poe Museum\nPoe's Richmond - from the Edgar Allan Poe Museum\nOne of Harry Clarke's Poe Illustrations\nA mock up for the t-shirt - the logo will be gold\na signed From Beyond poster could be yours\n..Or a signed Re-Animator poster\nBlack Cat DVDs, too....\nStefanie Rocknak's statue of Poe\nPoe Forevermore Magazine\nMonsterpalooza Magazine\nYou could own a football from the Baltimore Ravens!\nA signed copy of H.P.

Visit us here!\nWE DID IT! THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nABOUT THE GAME\n2-6 Players, 60 minutes, Ages 13+\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that lovers of Pride and Prejudice want to marry Mr. Darcy. Marrying Mr. Darcy is a strategy card game where players are one of the female characters from Jane Austen\u2019s novel Pride and Prejudice. Players work to earn points and attract the attention of available suitors. Our heroines do this by attending events and improving their characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of marrying well and becoming the most satisfied character at the end of the game!\nI created this game to be the ultimate participatory fan fiction experience for lovers of Pride and Prejudice, the classic novel by Jane Austen. You are able to put yourself in the shoes of your favorite female character, who must marry to secure her comfort and/or happiness. You are affected by who asks you to dance at the ball, Mr. Bingley leaving unexpectedly for London, and a possible elopement with Mr. Wickham. I hope this game will be loved by Janeites, gamers, and high school English teachers who need to trick teens into reading the book. \nSo after you've gone through to the sitting room, set up the card table and enjoy the camaraderie and competition of a round of Marrying Mr. Darcy! \nCard examples\nWHAT IS INCLUDED\n1 Custom box, 1 six-sided dice, 1 rule sheet, 181 Cards (60 Events, 100 Character, 8 Heroines, 6 Suitors, 1 Old Maid, and 6 Player Guides)\nLEARN TO PLAY\nYou can get a brief overview of the rules and how to play by this video, or by downloading the full rules here.\nSTRETCH GOALS! \n$10,000: The amount needed to do the smallest print run. \n$13,000: This allows us to do a larger print run.

Printing, delivery, shipping to backers, fulfillment administration, and kickstarter fees. \nAre you working on this by yourself? No! My talented husband, Erik Evensen, is my artist, graphic designer and sounding board. He has independently published two graphic novels and ran his own successful kickstarter campaign for \"The Beast of Wolfe's Bay.\" He has experience working with printers, file preparation and self-publishing. \nWhy did you make this? I am a huge Jane Austen/Pride and Prejudice fan. I initially had the thought to write an adaptation of it, but then had the better idea to make a game a little over a year ago. I've been working on it ever since. I love playing Settlers of Catan and Munchkin and thought a game of P&P would be really fun to play. \nWill this be sold in stores? I hope so, but this is not a sure thing. I'm currently working on getting distribution for the game, but it all depends on how successful this Kickstarter campaign is. If you want a copy, supporting us now is the quickest and guaranteed way to get a game.\nWhere did you get those sweet vintage graphics? Various sources, but mostly from The Graphics Fairy. (Used with permission)\nDo you know what you are getting into with this whole Kickstarter thing? Why should I trust you? While my personal Kickstarter profile is quite new, I've been involved on Kickstarter supporting campaigns through my husband's page since early 2012 and helping him fulfill his rewards for The Beast of Wolfe's Bay. I know how much work this will take and I have the time and energy to bring this project to completion. As you can see from the video, we are very close to being print ready.

I have made a good faith estimate based on research of when I can deliver your game, but there are somethings outside my control.

See the Kits section, below.\nMonte Cook Games is thrilled to announce its next big tabletop roleplaying game: The Strange! Written and designed by Bruce Cordell and Monte Cook, The Strange is a game that crosses multiple worlds, called recursions, which player characters can explore and defend. In The Strange, your characters change with each world they travel to, taking on new aspects suited to help them function in that recursion's unique laws and structures. But dangers found in these recursions threaten not only characters, but also our very own Earth. If characters persevere, however, they can not only save themselves and Earth, they may even gain the ability to create a recursion of their own! \nIf you enjoyed the inspiring scope of games like Planescape, Gamma World, or Numenera, or mind-bending scenarios like Moorcock's Eternal Champion series, the TV show Fringe, or movies like the Matrix, you're going to love The Strange.\nWe've assembled a great team to work on The Strange. In addition to Bruce and Monte, the exceptional Shanna Germain will serve as lead editor, and she's developing some amazing concepts both for the game and the presentation of the material. Superstar artist Matt Stawicki serves as the lead artist. He's working with us to create a unique visual look for the setting. But we'd love to see you join the team too, either as a backer, or even a contributor (see the backer levels for more information).\nFor more information, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com. A lot of news about the game can be found there, and much more is coming! And keep checking back for frequent updates and more previews!\nIf you've pledged to a Kickstarter before, there are some aspects to this Kickstarter that are a bit different than others you may have seen. The differences are primarily in the way we are organizing the rewards we're offering, and the way we are handling shipping.\nMany of the rewards for this Kickstarter are grouped together into packages and kits. One of the things we learned from our prior Kickstarter for Numenera is that all the different rewards and add-ons can get confusing, particularly as we reach stretch goals. So the backer levels, all listed on the right-hand side of the page, grant you access to different combinations of packages and kits to help organize your rewards and ensure you get what you want.\nPackages are the way we group the primary rewards of the Kickstarter--the books, mainly. You get these based on the backer level you choose. For example, the \"Real Deal Package\" offers you the main game rulebook in print, which we call the corebook, and a unique character card. The \"All the Ebooks Package,\" on the other hand, offers you the corebook in PDF form, as well as the PDF of the Player's Guide, the PDF of The Dark Spiral adventure, and the PDFs of any books that are offered as stretch goals. Stretch goals may unlock additional packages. Read more about packages below.\nKits are collections of extras The Strange Fan Kit includes items serious fans of the game won't wan to be without. The Strange Player's Kit includes game aids that are great to have around the gaming table. Stretch goals may unlock additional kits, or additional features for these kits. Read more about kits below.\nBoth packages and kits will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned. Plus, entirely new packages and kits will be offered if we reach certain stretch goals. \nLastly, as you're glancing through the backer levels, you'll notice a reference to credit toward shipping. We're doing shipping differently for this Kickstarter--rather than dictating to you the shipping method we'll use, we're putting that decision in your hands. When the products are ready to ship next year, you'll be able to give us your current address and tell us how you'd like us to ship your stuff. If your package or kit gives you a credit toward shipping, you can apply that to the cost of your preferred shipping method. If you're in the US your shipping credit is designed to cover the entire cost of basic shipping--so shipping will be free. But we're giving you the flexibility of upgrading, at the time of shipment, to faster or more trackable shipping options and apply the credit toward that cost. Read more about shipping below or on The Strange website.\nThe Strange is a cosmos-sized artifact built in the afterglow of the Big Bang. The original alien builders lost control of it eons ago, but their dark energy network remains \"beneath\" our universe. For those on Earth who've discovered it, everything is different. These select few know that the Strange hosts recursions: unique but limited worlds with their own laws of science and even magic, seeded into the network by the creative resonance of pure imagination, but still nonetheless very real. Thus, the Strange is a place where fictional worlds become realities of their own. One prominent recursion, Ardeyn, is a land of extravagant sorcery, imprisoned devils, and lost gods. Another, called Ruk, has hidden in Earth's shadow since before humanity evolved, populated by creatures that were never human, born of the fiction of somewhere else. And those are just a few of the hundreds of recursions that speckle the dark energy web around Earth. Each recursion is a place of wonder, but each risks drawing the attention of vast entities that scuttle through the primordial reaches of the Strange like bloated spiders on a web: voracious planetovores that eat worlds, recursions and prime worlds (such as Earth) alike. Many PCs are going to want to champion one or more these worlds to defend them against these horrific threats.\nThe game system that drives The Strange is the same one used by Numenera, which means it's fast-moving and streamlined, facilitating the stories the group wants to create, the imaginative places and creatures the GM needs to share, and the amazing ideas encouraged by exploring the Strange. If you're familiar with Numenera's game system\u2014referred to as the Cypher System\u2014you already know how to play The Strange. \nIf you're not familiar with it, that's okay too. The Strange is a stand-alone game. Character generation is fast and fun, because you create a sentence based on the choices you make: I'm a Clever Vector who Wields Two Weapons at Once. I'm a Strong-Willed Spinner Who Utters Words of Power. And so on. Each part of that statement helps determine your stats and abilities. \nAn experienced player will find a whole new wrinkle, however, as her character's focus (the third part of that statement) actually changes based on which world she visits. A single adventure may span many different recursions, so through the course of the game, a character will change and adopt new aspects and abilities to deal with the challenges she faces.\nWhile the Strange could potentially be host to a multitude of recursions, we focus primarily on two--Ardeyn and Ruk--in addition to the prime world of Earth, because they are the most prominent and the first two discovered by humans. As your characters explore the Strange, they may find many more. GMs will be able to add their favorite fictional settings, brand new recursions of their own creation, or even past campaign worlds from other RPGs to help populate the Strange. The possibilities are endless!\nOn Earth (and by that, we mean modern-day Earth), The Strange is an RPG of espionage, intrigue, and sometimes horror (particularly when creatures from recursions come to our world). Characters become involved with organizations like the Quiet Cabal, whose members are invested in the Strange and aided by mysterious backers; the September Project, which may have a link to a monstrously powerful figure in Ardeyn called the Betrayer; or any number of additional secretive groups that have interest in or knowledge of the Strange. Earth is a prime world, a hub of information and secrets. If you control a prime world, you control its recursions. Most new PCs in The Strange will start on Earth. \nArdeyn is a world of magic and monsters, created by humans on Earth and nested--only recently--in the Strange. Despite its genesis as a fictional world, Ardeyn has become a real place, with real inhabitants and and all too real sorcery. The denizens of Ardeyn wield mystic blades sheathed in living souls, use the dead to guard an imprisoned god, and ride incredible flying dlamma. Not all Ardeynians are human, either. The qephilim are tall, dark, angular-faced creatures with varying innate connections to the magic of their realm. It is known as Ardeyn, the Land of the Curse, and Lotan's Prison.\nRuk is an unimaginably ancient artificial construct that traveled through the Strange. While on the run from the horrific planetovores, it \"ran aground\" in the shoals of the Strange around Earth, long before humanity evolved. \n\nRuk can be thought of as part alien world and part cosmic shipwreck. The inhabitants are masters of biotechnology to the point where they shape and reshape their bodies as needed and--as we are just now discovering--they have been coming to Earth for millennia in human form for some mysterious purposes. The inhabitants of Ruk are not a unified group, and not all of them are humanity's friends.\nThe Strange corebook will be a 416-page, full-color hardcover book done in the highly beautiful, art-heavy style of Numenera (although with its own sensibilities, of course). The two books will look very nice on your shelf together. The Strange corebook will include the rules of the game, character creation information, the details of the very unique setting, some creatures and NPCs, some GMing advice, a double-sided full-color poster map, and even an adventure to get you started.\nThe Strange Player's Guide will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that collects all the character creation information from the corebook, plus an overview of the setting. This book is intended for players.\nThe Dark Spiral will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that contains a number of linked scenarios which take characters from Earth to both Ruk and Ardeyn, as well as into other minor recursions. This book is intended for GMs.\nThe Bestiary will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book chock full of creatures native to Ruk, Ardeyn, and the Strange itself.\nStrange Recursions will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book with additional detail on Ardeyn, Ruk, and other recursions.\nCharacter Options will be a 96-page full-color softcover book chock full of interesting options for characters from Earth, Ruk, Ardeyn, and possibly other recursions as well.\nThe Strange Compendium will be a 160-page hardcover book covering new Ruk tech, Ardeyn magic, Earth gear, and items and cyphers from other recursions and the Strange itself.\nMore Strange Adventures (working title) will be a 96-page full-color softcover book with several Strange adventures.\nThe deluxe corebook is identical in content to the standard corebook, but will be a leather-bound, gilt-edged edition with a cloth bookmark, special endpapers, and extra color plates. This will be a Kickstarter exclusive, with few if any copies available by any other means.\nIf you've seen the Numenera corebook, the Player's Guide, or The Devil's Spine adventure, you know these books will be beautiful. Numenera fans will find The Strange products to be excellent companions to their books, with new descriptors, types, foci, creatures, and more that they can use (the rules for the two games will be entirely compatible).\nCheck out the many reward levels we're offering on the right-hand side of this page. You'll notice that many of The Strange rewards come in packages to make them easier to understand. The contents of these packages are described below.

More kits may be created by future stretch goals!\nThe Strange Fan Kit: This kit includes an exclusive, numbered, deluxe bookplate hand-signed by both designers, Monte Cook and Bruce Cordell.

You will receive a deluxe corebook instead of a standard print corebook.\n$120 The Strange deluxe corebook. This is the deluxe version in addition to your regular rewards (as opposed to an upgrade that replaces your print corebook). Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\nAs mentioned above, we're doing shipping a bit differently. Instead of locking you into a single shipping method of our choosing, we\u2019re giving you some options. We\u2019re doing this by including a shipping allowance with most of our physical rewards. For example, if you are getting the Real Deal Package, you'll get a $10 credit to shipping.\nWe've designed this allowance to cover the cost of basic shipping in the United States, which will cost $10 or less. Thus, if that's what you want, you shouldn't have to pay a penny more.\nBut you aren't limited to that option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want yours shipped. You can choose a faster or more trackable method, but it will probably cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers will have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will probably require some additional payment. (That's why we don't have any special, more expensive rewards levels for overseas backers, or require any additional payment at this time.) But just like domestic backers, international backers apply their shipping credit to the cost of their shipping, reducing it accordingly. And just like domestic backers, international backers will have the choice to use an expedited method.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much shipping will cost\u2014shipping rates change, we may gain some efficiencies that save us money, and it can vary dramatically by destination, shipping method, and how many rewards you\u2019re getting. Rest assured, since we're paying a portion of everyone's shipping ourselves, we're going to try to get the best rates.\nAnd here's an extra bonus: If shipping your reward costs less than your shipping allowance (which is likely for US backers choosing basic shipping), we'll apply the surplus as a credit to purchases from the Monte Cook Games online store, so you can get even more cool stuff if you'd like.\nYou'll choose your shipping method in the weeks just prior to the delivery of your rewards.\nAlthough the estimated delivery date is listed as August 2014, it is our intention that Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of The Strange corebook and The Strange Player's Guide before they are generally available elsewhere (this includes retailers that are backers of the Kickstarter, who will, of course, be able to sell the books as soon as they arrive). Having recently fulfilled the Numenera Kickstarter--the largest, most complex RPG Kickstarter campaign yet fulfilled--we have the expertise to handle shipping quickly and efficiently.\nAs a final note, please be aware that while the estimated delivery date listed on each backer level is based on The Strange corebook, some rewards may come earlier, and some--such as The Dark Spiral and certain stretch goal products--will come later.\nFor additional information about shipping, visit the Kickstarter section of our website.\nWe are very excited about this project, and we hope that you'll join us in making it a reality. With your support, we'll all have an amazing new game to play next year! \nSpecial thanks to artists Matt Stawicki, Reece E. Ambrose (Epic Realities & Graphics Corporation) and Lee Smith for their gorgeous images and graphics. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe chose to Kickstart this project at its very earliest stages to enable backers to get involved in the playtest and be in \"on the ground floor\" of The Strange. That means, of course, that the product is not created yet. That's our biggest challenge. But as we showed with Numenera, creating a fantastic game book is what we do best.\n\nIf The Strange Kickstarter gets big, fulfillment is also a challenge, of course. We learned so much with Numenera (the largest RPG Kickstarter, by far, ever to reach the fulfillment stage), however, that we feel that literally no one knows how to do that better than we do. Although we experienced setbacks as we blazed a trail with Numenera, we overcame all them to deliver the vast majority of products on time to delighted backers. And shipments of later products (such as the recently-fulfilled The Devil's Spine) have gone almost flawlessly. \n\nLastly, if a meteor hit Seattle and killed the entire creative team in one fell swoop, that would also be a setback. Thankfully, we have secret robot designers in an underground bunker set to activate and finish the game should that contingency arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "The Strange, the Cypher System, and a Big Sale", "update_content": "As a backer who helped make The Strange a reality, you know its history: It was MCG\u2019s second-ever RPG\u2014before No Thank You, Evil!, Invisible Sun, and Cypher System settings like Gods of the Fall and Predation.

And its success in that regard ultimately led to those other games\u2014and in particular, to the Cypher System Rulebook.\nThe beauty of this is that every product for The Strange can be taken from that context and used for any Cypher System campaign\u2014and conversely, any title published for the Cypher System can be used in a campaign of The Strange.

Of course, tackling a game of this scope or any game for that matter comes with risks and challenges, however it is our job to mitigate those risks by weighing what works and what will not. From our standpoint, we foresee the following risks and challenges as mitigated:\n\n1. Script \u2013 REBORN is heavily dependent on the script for direction and therefore we consider this to be our most important piece of the game. Without a solid and concrete script that intertwines cut-scenes, in-game player character to NPC interactions by way of dialogs, discoverable texts, player character\u2019s progressive License Board, weapons, equipment, magic\u2019s, various technological augmentations, leveling system, rare loot, various character classes, hardware texts down to the emails that the player characters could access, REBORN will suffer on the latter parts of the game design. Besides Eric Thuan, we are fortunate to have an industry veteran involved who will help to weave together a cohesive storyline giving you, our fans a deep engaging story.\n\n2. 3D Art \u2013 Without skilled modelers who are not only great at taking a 2D concept art and adapting it into 3D but modelers who are both fast and efficient with their time, REBORN could fail, however we are equally fortunate on this end. We are blessed to have some of the most experienced 2D and 3D artists in the industry and because of this winning combination, we are able to deliver to you a 90% close to accuracy in the 2D to 3D adaptation. Furthermore, all artworks and 3D assets created are done so with the next-gen consoles in mind.\n\n3. CG/Animation \u2013 Where some studios suffer in terms of the fluidity of their animations, we are extremely fortunate and blessed to have the support of House of Moves (moves.com). Coupled together with Manar, our seasoned in-house Senior CG/Animator, we are able to give to our audience a very \u2018humanness\u2019 in terms of the emotion and fluidity of animations. Because of our strong connection to House of Moves and their commitment to REBORN, you can expect to receive the best in character animations!\n\n4. Programming \u2013 with a game concept of this nature, it is imperative to have skilled, dedicated and passionate programmers, and as such we are fortunate to have not only Unreal helping us along the way with our development process, but also having strong programmers on staff truly makes for a progressive development process. Furthermore, we are also blessed to have our unannounced senior programmer, whom you will all know soon enough, giving us his undivided attention. That said, having programmers on staff is not just enough, but rather having programmers who are very knowledgeable with the Unreal Development Kit is extremely essential to a fast moving and cohesive ecosystem. We do not have time for our programmers to learn UDK, so when we setup our team, we ensured that our programmers were first very comfortable and knowledgeable of the Unreal Engine and as such, we are now staffed with teammates who are all enjoying the power of the Unreal Engine.\n\n5. Music \u2013 this is an area of game development that rarely sees funding. Game development needs to emphasize on the atmosphere and as we can all learn from Bastion, from Super Giant Games, we need to revisit this lost area of development and nurture it as it will resound a great many thanks from gamers. As gamers, we are always looking to find that user intimacy, and we firmly believe that music is the way to connect the player and the experience they will attain from the game. That said, we are fortunate to have some amazing musicians on REBORN. As you can hear from some of the pieces that have already been created in our official Soundcloud page, we care deeply for the music in REBORN. \n\n6. Building Awareness \u2013 Since we are licensed by SCEA with several approvals already in place for REBORN and with the help of ACTTIL, we are very lucky to be in this situation where we have support. Even with this support, we do not have the financial backing from major studios since we are still indie, therefore with the money we earn from Kickstarter, we will allocate a portion of it into marketing by way of magazines or online ads. In order to generate awareness and sales, we cannot do this without the support of our fans, like you! REBORN will only happen because of our fans and those both in the industry and fans alike who believe and have faith in us as we walk this journey together. So we reach out to you and ask for your support\u2026Take this leap of faith with us as we push hard to getting a successful Kickstarter campaign completed.

Or did you used to play tabletop minis games and had to stop because of your busy schedule? Or maybe you play all the time and want a way to get your friends or family members into miniatures gaming too. Well, these are some of the reasons why we're creating Golem Arcana - the digitally-enhanced miniatures game. \nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Bluetooth-enabled Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI). The stylus sends the tabletop game information to your touchscreen phone or tablet, making record-keeping automatic. Important game information is all quickly searchable at your fingertips. Plus, all Golem Arcana figures come fully assembled and painted* so you can start playing right out of the box. \n*If you want to paint your own figures, then check out the unpainted resin figures in the Optional Items Menu down the page.\nHere are the highlights of a live Grudge Match between two of our engineers. Check it out to see which one lost his beard!  \nThe Golem Arcana Base Game, along with your smartphone or tablet, provides everything you need for a great, fast-playing, two-player skirmish. From there, you can EXPAND Golem Arcana to field larger armies of Golems, create larger battlefields, and play with up to eight players.\nGolem Foundry, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems are giant magical constructs of branch, bone, and stone which are mastered in battle by combat Mages called Golem Knights and the royal Blood Knights. \nGolems are crafted in four size classes: War Sprite, Ogre, Titan, and Colossus.\nThe world of Golem Arcana was sculpted by the Ancient Ones, who crafted the Golems. While much of their magical knowledge has been lost in the millennia since they ascended, the crafting of Golems is still possible, governed by the few remaining magical Codexes they left behind.\nRegardless of the Reward Tier you select, all of these Golem figures are also available for purchase on the Optional Items Menu. \nGolem Arcana is balanced by players agreeing upon a point value for the armies they field. Each unit in the game (Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones) is worth a set amount of army points, so you select the ones you want, add up their value and start playing, And don\u2019t worry about making a mistake - the App does all the math.\nThere are three types of characters used in Golem Arcana armies: Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones. They represent three layers of gameplay you can combine to customize your army and create new strategies.\nWar Council, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems, represented by the pre-painted miniatures on the game board. \nGolems are ridden into combat by mighty Golem Knights, who are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App. Each Golem Knight has a powerful special ability that augments the Golem's - and sometimes the whole army. Part of your strategy in designing a Golem Arcana army is to pair specific Golem Knights with specific Golems to create a beneficial combination of abilities.\nExtraordinary Golem Knights, known as Blood Knights, are the direct descendants of the Ancient Ones. Due to their celestial bloodline, and in addition to their special ability, Blood Knights may also channel the magical energy of the Earth - called Mana - to an Ancient One ancestor. In exchange for Mana, the Ancient One will bestow Miracles, Blessings, and Curses to Blood Knight descendants to aid them on the battlefield. Both Blood Knights and Ancient Ones are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App.\nHamazi Maelstrom, by Kekai Kotaki\n\u201cBlood, Bloodlines, and Golems are the materials from which history is built.\u201d \n- Jauti Ishtimesh, Learned Master of the University of Ur\nThe setting for Golem Arcana begins after the meteoric rise and fall of the Great Khan. In the ensuing chaos, conquered tribes and clans rise up to reclaim their sovereignty, neighboring empires mobilize to reclaim lost territory and honor, all as the heirs of the Khan battle each other for control of the Uruk Dominion. \nThe Empires, Tribes, and Clans of Golem Arcana are led by powerful Blood Knights whose ancestry determines which codexes of Golems are fielded in their armies.  \nThe World of Eretsu is filled with stories both ancient and new. Yet Golems do not create history. That is the sole purview of people, as you will see in these short Tales of Eretsu.\nLORE: THE DARK WITCH \nLORE: TOOLS\nNadanna inherited her father's warrior heart and fiery crown, but she desires control of his entire Dominion and will happily kill her half brothers and sisters to secure it.\nA powerful and proven warrior-mage whose bloodlines trace back to the Urugal and Gudanna Ancient Ones, Raga (Princess) Nandanna has already drawn several of the Empire\u2019s key regiments to herself. She has mobilized them in her efforts to protect the Dominion and to eliminate any rivals for its throne. Jahnu, Great Khan, fathered over 100 children by almost as many wives, but left behind only 4 wives and 27 children - 26 of which Nandanna will need to cow or destroy in order for her to occupy her father\u2019s Saddle Throne.\nRead more about the Crown of Uruk in these short tales.\nLORE: CHILDS-PLAY\nLORE: NEGOTIATIONS\nPrincess Dasra mobilizes her Golem regiments to seek revenge on The Great Khan by retaking her lands and destroying his heirs in the process.\nThe thousand-year-old Hamazi Empire\u2019s prosperous northern region is ruled by the Raga Dasra, great-granddaughter of His Highness the Supreme Emperor. Dasra stings from humiliation at having to pay tribute to the Great Khan after the defeats she suffered from the armies of the Lower Empire and seeks to right the scales by capitalizing on the collapse of his Dominion. As sinuous and cold blooded as the snake of her family crest, she carefully calculates every move in her secret campaign to capitalize on the collapse of his Dominion and assume the Empire\u2019s Gilded Throne.\nRead more about the the Upper Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: THE VIPER PRINCESS\nPrince, outcast, mercenary, and now as the last of his bloodline, Vanya leads the remains of his tribe against the Empire that destroyed his family and their lands.\n\u201cYou cannot grow unless you put down roots\u201d was the motto of Vanya\u2019s great-grandmother, who convinced the Samula Tribe to give up their nomadic life over a three hundred years ago. After his wild ways caused his mother to expel him from the tribe, Vanya became a mercenary fighting for outlying Zikia Tribes and Urugal Clans who were attempting to stop the onslaught of the Uruk Dominion. Vanya returned home years later to find his mother dead and her orchards a charred tombstone to his great-grandmother\u2019s vision. Rallying the Tribes\u2019 survivors, he now leads them against the Hamazi Empire whose greed and arrogance resulted in the scorched Zikia land.\nRead more about the Samula Tribe in this short tale.\nLORE: UTSUKA\nThe Blood Mage Rudatha has orchestrated the capture of many of his siblings, for he alone understands the Khan's true legacy.\nRaja Rudatha - or the \u201cSpider Prince\u201d as some call him - never leaves the serenity of his library, but his webs of information and influence cover the Dominion like a blanket. Yet land is not Rudatha\u2019s focus, for he alone among his vast number of siblings understands the Great Khan\u2019s true legacy. Where most see only the lands taken from conquered enemies, Rudatha sees in each of his father\u2019s conquests another Ancient One bloodline woven into his own. Each of the Great Khan\u2019s heirs is a weapon, for each represents a different combination of Ancient Ones that he or she can call on for supernatural support in battle. Rudatha plans to collect the whole set.\nRead more about the Blood of Uruk in this short tale.\nLORE: WEBS OF THE SPIDER\nLORE: THE DARK GARDEN\nSudhamra, prince of the people, has converted a rebellious populous into new regiments who unknowingly march to war only to reclaim the Emperor's lost honor.\nBorn to a Zikia Princess who had escaped from the Emperor\u2019s harem, Sudhamra grew up in the rebellious slums of his people in the Lower Hamazi Empire. Forcibly recruited into the army, he gained glory in battle and rose quickly through the ranks to be the youngest commander ever of the Empire\u2019s elite Western Wind regiment. When the armies of the Lower Empire where humbled by the Great Khan, only Sudhamra\u2019s Western Wind stood tall, but even so, it was a shock when he was selected to be Raja, Prince of the Lower Empire. After 500 years of the Lower Empire being ruled by Princes sent from the North, the people have a Prince of their own and they shower him with undying loyalty. Now Raja Sudhamra marches with the support of his people to reclaim the honor of the Empire!\nRead more about the Lower Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: STRANGE MESSAGES\nLORE: THE JADE GUARDIANS\nGiven as a child to The Great Khan to secure a peace treaty, Izvari returned home to till her father and take his throne. She now seeks justice from those that once called her \"sister\".\nBefore he became the Great Khan, he was Jahnu Khan of Clan Uruk, whose ancient enemy was the neighboring Clan Sunu. But Jahnu was not like his ancestors. When he attacked Clan Sunu, it had nothing to do with tribal feuds - he was looking for the lost Codex of the Gudanna. As soon as Jahnu raided the tomb he was looking for, he stripped it of clues and sued for peace with Clan Sunu, agreeing never to attack them again as long as he lived. Bijin, Khan of the Clan Sunu, agreed and offered his daughter Izvari as a gift of thanks. Izvari became one of the Great Khan\u2019s wards and was educated by the Uruk court\u2019s best tutors but she was savagely schooled by the heirs to Jahnu\u2019s Saddle Throne. Izvari may have shed more tears at Jahnu\u2019s funeral pyre than her own father\u2019s but that will not stop her from destroying his children and reclaiming the lost honor of her Clan.\nRead more about the Clan Sunu in this short tale.\nLORE: IT IS OUR WAY\nWhen you pledge at the Blood Knight tier, just drop us a Kickstarter mail letting us know which character you\u2019re interested in (along with an an alternate), and if it\u2019s still available, we\u2019ll update the image to say it\u2019s taken. Blood Knights are available on a first come, first served basis. Kickstarter tells us when people join a specific tier, so in the event that more than one person choose the same character, we\u2019ll use that info to determine who get dibs.\nAs you can see, we've developed a wide assortment of Blood Knights with diverse backgrounds, allegiances, and world-views. Please note that we would be happy to change the gender of your character to suit you. Just let us know when you tell us which one you wish to be.\nAnd for those backing us at the Golem Knight level, you get to choose which Codex of golems your knight rides: Zikia, Urugal, Durani, or Gudanna. Again, use Kickstarter mail to let us know and we\u2019ll update the image below to let everyone know how many slots are left in each faction.\nThe items below are available for purchase right now in the Optional Items Menu. \n100% cotton preshrunk (\"Ultra Cotton\"), crew neck, men (S to 5XL), ladies (XS to 3XL)\nElite Units\nMany factions in Golem Arcana boast Elite Units with their own unique back-stories and tactical abilities. These Elite Units of four pre-painted plastic figures each sport their own special edition paint & statistics and come with an Elite Unit banner for their bases to call attention to their special status on the battlefield. Elite Units will have separate army point values than standard figures to ensure game balance.\n                                                                                  To purchase Optional Items:\n1. Find the stuff you want to buy on the Optional Items Menu and add up the prices\n2. Choose a reward tier (if you haven\u2019t backed the project yet) or press the blue \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button (if you\u2019ve already selected a reward tier).\n3. Enter the TOTAL of all the stuff you want AND the amount you pledged in the \u201cPledge amount\u201d box.\nIn the example above, Robin backed the project at the $110 Warrior Tier and wants to buy a War Sprite for $11, a Titan for $15, and a Colossus for $44, bringing her total to $180.\n4. Select \u201cContinue to the next step\u201d and follow the instructions. All you\u2019re doing at this point is \u201cbanking\u201d a lump sum to use on figures after the Kickstarter is over.\n5. Once the Kickstarter ends, we\u2019ll send you a link to a special backer tool that will contain the lump sum you've already banked. All you need to do then is select the stuff you want!\nWe're very excited to share our vision for where Golem Arcana can go if we exceed our funding goal. Watch the video below to find out what's possible.\nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI).\nThe Golem Arcana App knows where all your figures are because each figure\u2019s base and the game board are covered with invisible microdots. When you touch a figure with the stylus, information is transferred to the app via Bluetooth technology. The App immediately identifies which figure it is, all its capabilities, and its position on the game board. When you touch the stylus to a new region of the game board, the app instantly knows whether the move is valid or not.\nWhen you touch an enemy figure, the App automatically can tell if the attack is blocked by intervening terrain, what the range modifiers are, what the terrain modifiers are, and applies the benefits or drawbacks from characters\u2019 active magical abilities.\nThe Golem Arcana App knows all the game rules so you can\u2019t accidentally break them. You don\u2019t need to read a rulebook because everything you need to know is available on screen or with a tap of your finger or your stylus. New players learn the game quickly by following the onscreen prompts and listening to the audio feedback. Record keeping is a snap because the App tracks everything for you. It\u2019s a referee, rule book, and tracking device all-in-one. Together, the TDI stylus and App allow you to focus on what's important: face-to-face tabletop gaming in the exciting new game world of Golem Arcana (more on that later).\nBut the benefits of connecting your figures and terrain to your mobile device go way beyond automating the rules, eliminating the reference books, and handling all the record keeping for you. Golem Arcana brings features previously found in computer games to tabletop gaming. Features such as:  \nDYNAMIC SCENARIOS - Download new scenarios (such as King of the Hill, Control Points, and Defense) that keep the game fresh and evolving with new objectives, victory conditions, and terrain conditions. For example, in an Inferno scenario, all forest regions are on fire and do extra damage to any golems knocked into them.\nUPDATES & NEW CONTENT - Game mechanics and modifiers automatically update based upon our latest playtest data. No need to keep track of game supplements, errata sheets, or changes - the app does it for you! And we plan on a steady release of new content including: Campaigns, Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones which will be directly available via in-app purchase.\nCOMMUNITY - Automatically upload leaderboard data, receive notifications of local events, play in easy-to-run tournaments, and more.\nSAVE GAME - Press the button, clear the table, and seamlessly resume play at any time.\nAnd these are just the beginning of the digital enhancements made possible by Golem Arcana\u2019s digital technology. Check out our STRETCH GOALS section to hear about some of the amazing things we can do if the project gets funded!\nNote that you do not need to be online to play Golem Arcana. You only need to connect to the Internet to download new updates and content, upload your game results, or take advantage of some community features.\nGolem Arcana is early in development so the game mechanics will continue to evolve, the user interface will be iterated upon several times, and the game balance will be changed and refined. If you choose to participate in our Beta Test Group Reward Tier, you can be part of that iteration process.\nMechanics Video\nThe video below provides an overview of the deeper mechanics and the kind of strategies and tactics that can emerge from using the Golems, Golem Knights, and Ancient Ones abilities in combination with each other.\nPDF of Prototype Rules\nHere's a link to a PDF that walks you through the rules that were used in the prototype played by more than 600 people at GenCon and PAX Prime. Note that while they form the foundation of the rules for the final game, there will be many changes between their current state and the final version.

We consider it to be very low.\n\nHardware Design and Production: Our working prototypes need to be turned into production-ready designs and we need to develop the Bluetooth 4 adapter for older phones and tablets. This is currently in the initial design phase. We have developed hardware before and have a proven hardware engineering team already contracted for the project.\n\nOverseas Manufacturing: The game pieces will be produced in China and thus may possibly be subject to production delays, shipping delays, and custom delays, but we have experience with Chinese manufacturing and will do all that is possible to minimize these potential risks. We have established relationships with several miniature figure factories and have already started vetting electronics factories for the production of the TDI stylus. \n\nApp Store Policies: The mobile App stores occasionally adopt new policies which may impact aspects of the game development and distribution. Should any policies impact our plans, we are confident that we will be able adapt those plans to be acceptable to the App stores. \n\nWe've done our best to minimize all the risks as far as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if, for some totally unforeseen reason, the game can't be delivered at all.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Final Update: The Book of Eretsu, Amulet of Numenesh, and New Expansions!", "update_content": "Hail, Knights of Eretsu!\nThe Book of Eretsu is Here!  \nJordan"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "The Book of Eretsu Update, New Golems, and BattleTech!", "update_content": "Hello backers!  \nIt's hard to believe it's been just a year since we released Golem Arcana at GenCon in 2014.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What\u2019s missing? Looking back to all the TV and Movies that inspired us, like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly, we realised games are missing something integral: a crew. A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we\u2019ve taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\nWe wanted to make a game where you\u2019re not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you\u2019ll feel the loss that comes with that.\nThat\u2019s where the drama is, that\u2019s where the story happens, and it\u2019s the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience.\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory \u2013 and we want you to join us.\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\nAs the captain of a ship, you\u2019ll lead your men through battles, boarding operations, and space exploration through a hierarchy of officers, selected and honed by you.\nYou\u2019ll explore your vessel isometrically, discovering the inner workings and day to day life of the officers and crew who serve under you. Invite dignitaries to your chamber, or defend your vessel from attack on foot (in the style of Jagged Alliance, X Com.)\nAs you lead your men to victory, yourself and officers who survive will have access to upgrades and talents, affecting gameplay and offering new tactical opportunities. Make the wrong decision, and expect to lose your officer for good with our rogue-like chain of command.\nConcept for ingame Bridge view\nBattles from space are orchestrated from the classical perspective (Star Trek Online, Klingon Academy, Freelancer, etc.) Whilst in this view, your crew will take their battle stations within the ship, affected by hazards \u2013 even being sucked out of a hull breach. Whatever happens outside of the vessel, affects those within it.\nBoarding operations allow you to isometrically zoom in on your units, or zoom out into Space Battle View at your disclosure. Fight the war on two fronts. Battle in the style of games like Men of War at the same time as fighting battles reminiscent of Klingon Academy.\nTrust your crew? Allow them to fight autonomously, and deal with the ships hands on.\nConcept for ingame boarding\nOur modular design will allow you to build your ships (link to Ship designer) and space station to fit your play style. With thousands of combinations, and the potential for thousands more over the period of the campaign and launch, it\u2019s possible to create something completely unique.\nChange the design for tactical, defensive, and strategic capabilities \u2013 skin, colour, and mix-and-match to your heart\u2019s desire. \nThe Mandate is a sandbox RPG (similarities with Pirates! And Mount and Blade), allowing you to travel the galaxy through a series of jump-gates, opening doors to new systems.\nIf you or your friends are in trouble, instantly jump to their location from outside of the game using Steam.\nEach system of the universe offers a series of procedurally generated content which varies every time, as well as hand-crafted story-driven content for you to take advantage of. What you do in The Mandate is entirely up to you, but as you gain power and unlock more systems, you\u2019ll drive the story forward.\nWith new factions to be found in each sector, and Starbases to be scavenged, looted, and built, watch your empire grow as you conquer and explore the depths of space, where new quests and unexplored territories will reward the most experienced of captains.\nAt its core, that\u2019s The Mandate \u2013 a fantastical space RPG about betrayal, scavenging, exploration, combat, and honor. These elements are eloquently wrapped in an all-original history and lore, waiting to be discovered.\nWith both iterative and entirely unique mechanics and concepts, we\u2019ve been inspired by franchises such as X Com for our upgrading system, Fallout for scavenging and survival, Battlestar Galactica for the sense of home and community, crewmanship, Star Trek Online and Klingon Academy for space battles, and Jagged Alliance or Men of War for RTS style boarding operations. We\u2019re taking the best of what was, and reinstating the old-school \u2013 and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re doing it right.\nWe've written 1500 years of history. It's up to you to write the future. The explorable reaches of space mix hand-crafted and procedurally generated content and is packed with historically relevant easter-eggs offering insight into the Mandate's rich lore.\nEach level of the game, from the political tier of warring empires, through the strategic level of individual star systems and naval battles, down to personal interactions with other characters impacts on how your story develops.\nThe decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.\nAffect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.\nIn the far future, mankind has abandoned the exhausted, dying world of Earth and gone on to colonize hundreds more worlds. These colonies were united under the rules of the Imperial Mandate, and linked by faster-than-light travel gates. As civilization continued to expand, corruption within the Mandate and dissent in the outer systems fomented a rebellion against Imperial rule.\nThe untimely death of the last Emperor gave the rebels their opportunity. The military was recalled to his state funeral and the investiture of his successor - a young and inexperienced Empress who took the throne with limited political support. Seizing the moment, the outer systems declared their intention to break away from the Mandate.\nThe Empress dispatched the Grand Fleet to restore order, but saboteurs redirected the travel gates, and the fleet ended up scattered across the galaxy. The Empress was left vulnerable without the protection of her navy.\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. The Empress founded the Corsairs, a new fleet captained by disgraced ex-Mandate officers jailed for breaching the Articles of War. Reinstated under the promise of redemption, these veterans are the last hope of the Mandate. You are a member of the Corsairs. With a small ship, you must move swiftly and make your way to the far reaches of Mandate space. Your mission - to discover the fate of the Grand Fleet and restore order to the outer systems.\nThere was a time when gaming wasn\u2019t about running through a corridor, firing off rounds into hordes of enemies. There are hundreds of mechanically magnificent titles out there on PC, and hundreds of teams equipped to make them. The only reason they\u2019ve declined is that they don\u2019t sell as well as something you\u2019d find on the consoles. We want to change that, and we have the knowledge to do so.\nThe Mandate is an ambitious title, but we are tackling each of the core elements with equal attention. By making each gear in the mechanism function correctly and optimally, our end result will be something mechanically interesting, with a lot of depth.\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from some of the finest strategy and RPG titles from past and present; working iteratively with their ideas and concepts. These are ideas that have worked in the past, but unfortunately declined with the changing PC gaming demographic. We know you\u2019re out there, and we\u2019re bringing them back. With tried and tested game mechanics, and some completely original ones, all it takes is the knowledge to bring them together \u2013 hard-earned knowledge that our team members have gained through years of games industry experience.\n\u2022 The ships of The Mandate are modular designs, allowing us - and you - to manually mix and match various parts, or to randomly generate any number of designs for the game world.\n\u2022 One of the themes of The Mandate is that ships are home to many of the world\u2019s inhabitants. Space stations and ships will be our cities. They are naturally much smaller than lunar structures \u2013 however, there will be many of them.\n\u2022 Whilst much of space in The Mandate is hand crafted, there are also procedurally generated areas to keep things fresh and offer replayability and interesting battle options in multiplayer. This allows us to offload some of the work to a complex world building algorithm.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we have experience building massive worlds. Many of our team hail from some of the most successful MMO projects ever created.\n\u2022 We\u2019re careful \u2013 using several middlewares to streamline development and reduce risk, increase efficiency, and most importantly, avoid wasting time. Unity3D is a great tool for this.\nCreating a new RPG world isn\u2019t easy, what have you done differently?\nThe biggest mistake a storyteller can make in gaming is to believe they are writing the future. The future is up to you: the gamers. Because of this, we\u2019ve taken the time to do a lot of research into building a believable past. We believe the story to be so important to The Mandate, that we\u2019ve written 1500 years of history based on Tsarist Russian lore and history. What if the Tsars ruled space?\nThe Mandate is part alternative-history, part fantasy. You\u2019ll be writing the future in The Mandate, it\u2019s simply our job to provide you with the context. Throughout our kickstarter period, you\u2019ll be introduced to our characters, how they\u2019re designed, their names, and their pasts. Even you, the player, will be able to choose your path from families dating back to the Tsarist period. The world of The Mandate did not happen spontaneously \u2013 there are reasons for the way that it is, and throughout this campaign and the games launch day, you\u2019ll enjoy exposition and story updates offering insight into our rich new world.\nWe are an international team: Canada, USA, Sweden, Norway, UK, France, Slovakia.\nWe are a team of veteran developers who decided to go Indie together and come from different game developers each with their own strengths [ex-EA, ex-2K Games, ex-Ubisoft, ex-Funcom]. Previously we have worked on and shipped both singleplayer, multiplayer and MMO AAA productions with team size ranging from 30 to 200\nSome of the titles we have worked on and shipped include: Assassin's Creed 1&2, Mafia 2, Alan Wake, FarCry 2&3, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures,Call of Duty 3, Splinter Cell, Planet of the Apes, Saga of Ryzom, FIFA ONLINE, FarCry Evolution, Rainbow 6 Vegas, The Secret World and more.\nPlease refer to the FAQ for full team statement. Portfolio links:\nGarret (Art Director)\nVegard (Tech Director)\nWe are big fans of sci-fi, be it video games or series like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Firefly. We are CRPG players and some of our favourites are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, The Witcher, Gothic, but we also remember classics like Ultima 7 or Microprose's Darklands. We are strategy players and have fond memories of the original X-Com, Carrier Command, Jagged Alliance and more! We love pen & paper tabletop: D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Traveller, Shadow Run and more! And also we are board game geeks: Warhammer, Warmachines.\nWe plan on taking all our inspirations, hobbies and diverse development experiences to ensure we deliver a game you will want to play for many hours both alone in dark space and together with your captain friends.\nTier reward information can be found here.\nCLICK HERE for digital add-ons. If you wish to pick a digital add-on simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount. E.g. if you wish to name a marine ($25) and get the base game with soundtrack ($20) then you would pledge $45 in total and pick the $20 reward tier. After Kickstarter is over, we will transfer your unused credits over to BackerKit where you can spend them on digital add-ons. \nKickstarter is the preferred backing avenue but if you for some reason cannot use Kickstarter, then you can visit our PayPal store.\nReward tiers that grant extra copies [so $150 and above] also include the Cossack Captain tier (alpha, beta, season pass etc) for each extra copy.\nWe have put a lot of thought into thinking about fairness \u2013 especially when it comes to games and their PR and marketing teams. For this reason, to say thank you for your vote of confidence reflected in your pledge amount, we are putting our entire marketing team in the darkest airlock on-ship.\nThey have each been issued a \u201cFairness Directive\u201d, a set of rules they have to follow to make sure there is a coherent and direct flow of information between you and the developers. They have been ordered to be firm, frank, and fair.\nRewards are certainly mentioned in the Fairness Directive, and we will not be selling alpha or beta access at inflated prices. We believe access to the game should be included in the relevant pledge tiers, and we should not profit from your willingness to provide feedback. You are part of the team, and we respect you.\nTherefore, as the pledge tiers scale, you\u2019ll see access to exclusive content that we consider real value for money. Many of these will not be sold separately, and you will not see some of them sold on Steam. They are a thank-you for your continued feedback and support, and there is some exciting stuff such as the Season Pass (access to the first expansion pack and content updates), and access to all early builds of the game (pre-alpha).\nAs you continue to browse the tier pledge rewards, you will even get a chance to completely change the game, and leave a permanent mark on the world of The Mandate. \nRemember, any breach of the Fairness Directive will result in a swift ejection through the airlock, replacing the guilty party with a robotic AI (they are cheaper to feed, anyway).\nAs the Empress placed her trust in the Corsairs securing her a grand victory, your trust is well placed in us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUPDATE\nSome backers have asked to see a clearer cost breakdown. We will not be providing a \u201ccake diagram\u201d as we believe that gives a false sense of security. Instead we have put together a development timeline to illustrate the allocation of manpower for the different stages of development. Keep in mind we are on Indie salaries. The Kickstarter campaign will cover the positions outlined and some devs are prepared to work for free as an additional buffer.\n\nhttp://ships.mandategame.com/images/20131015_KS_dev_budget.png\n\n\u201cWe are taking the pre-production process very seriously indeed. The combat prototype has been in development for almost a year, and only a subset of it is shown in the ship designer. We will get back to this in more detail later in the campaign. \n\n\nPre-production features a skeleton size unit of full-time staff. Other staff are kept informed of creative decisions and when their roles will be needed once production starts. This saves time, money and allows the skeleton team to focus their efforts. Once the production tools are ready, we will ramp up and assign additional full-time staff to their positions. Additionally, we have no big corporate HQ and minimal expenses. Our producer does not have a driving license and as such expenses for company cars will be minimal... (but we might buy him a bike!)\n\nWe are economically efficient, utilizing resources (such as your pledge money) in the best ways possible. We do contingency planning and set aside buffer time to have a reserve. We have funded the prototype so far with side-income and by working late nights.\n\nOur staff understands our budget limitations and the implications for roadmaps and scheduling. We will only hire for position X when it is necessary -not before, and since we have access to a large network of game industry professionals this simplifies the recruitment process. Because we have a clear focus we do not need to give people a task to do merely because they are sitting around. This would be inefficient and wasteful. We will not have Day1 DLCs for the Mandate, and our focus is on delivering the best possible experience at launch to everybody who buys the game. Proper content updates and expansion packs will be planned before launch but developed after based on input from the community, particularly the Kickstarter donors who are our bosses.\n\n\nOn the technological side, Unity3D (the game\u2019s engine) comes with a working world editor, a build system for creating versions of the game, and the ability to deploy to multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has its own eco-system with 3rd party plugins which we purchase for a reasonable price and can use in our project. This saves us time and allows us to do things like push the visual fidelity with one example being TC Particles which allow GPU accelerated DX11 particles. Check out the ship designer and study the impact effect on the shields. It just looks awesome. TC Particles is just one example and we have other bigger plugins or middelware available to us as well like a stable, tried and tested network engine which we have already gained valuable experience with. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed beyond integration, bugfixing and maintenance. \n\nOur team has half a century of game development experience between us, including major MMOs. This is a much smaller project than an MMO, which traditionally demands very capable content production tools. We are taking our combined knowledge and experience to setup and structure efficient workflows and production pipelines. This includes decoupling dependencies between art, code and design to minimize the amount of wait-time and avoid blockers. \n\nMiddleware is the key and we would prefer to license something which has been tried and tested rather than reinventing the wheel. This frees us up to focus on the game and avoid unnecessary distractions. At the moment, we are evaluating several character creation middleware tools which will make the process of setting up characters a breeze for the artists. At the same time players will have access to extensive character customization options. A common theme for both art and game design is to apply a modular and reusable approach. On the art side the procedural textures are an excellent example and if you have tested our ship designer, you will appreciate the versatility it provides even at this early stage. On the design side we are heavily data-driven: our tools must support major changes to content without requiring the involvement of programmers, which would create unwanted dependencies and blockers. \n\nOne final point to make, if you inspect our reward tiers you will see that we do not have any physical rewards. This means we do not divert Kickstarter funds to produce physical goods and instead we can use the funds to fully realize the actual game. To compensate for this we are providing what we believe are fair reward tiers where backers even at lower tiers get to put their mark on the game. Higher tier rewards are bundled with additional copies of the game so backers can split the cost among friends.\n\n\nStill, we understand that some backers would prefer physical copies and merchandise and here is a promise:\n\n\nOnce our funding goals are reached, we will add physical reward tiers and outsource the production and shipping to our backers who will pay for only production and shipping. If people want t-shirts made we will supply the graphics to make your own t-shirts or other merchandise. We will not make a dime off of you ordering that set of China with the Empress Anastasia on it that you always wanted. We are game developers -not Manchester United! \n\n\nTo summarize: we have the necessary know-how, experience and technology, and our overhead is minimal. The Mandate is the love child of some very experienced game developers who all want to see this project succeed. We are doing smart things with smart technology and will pick the right tools for the job to optimize the work-load and streamline our production pipelines and workflows. This allows us to produce content in modular blocks which is more efficient and allows us to reuse, thereby saving time. \n\nSo could everyone and their grandma make The Mandate for $500,000? Probably not. Can we? Hell yes we can.\u201d\n\nRemember: One rule, no quarter. With efficiency, a driven vision, and a careful understanding of what made traditional strategy games and RPGs so great, The Mandate will delve deep into mechanics of old, iterating and improving on them, ultimately delivering a vast and unique RPG experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Latest community Update", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nIn March we went through difficult times, the team size was reduced to only a core team since January, as consequence of the still ongoing negotiations with our publisher about the remaining funding.

Lovecraft's \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\". \nThe synopsis:\nThe series follows weird fiction writer Randolph Carter, who has forgotten the lessons learned from his adventures and now continues his work as an unpopular author. His only profitable series is the Kadath Cycle, a series of books documenting his time in the Dreamlands and sold as fiction. \nDisinterested in the world around him and unable to return to the Dreamlands, Carter finds himself willingly falling into trouble after discovering a strange cult and possibly a grand, cosmic conspiracy. Seeking meaning in life, Carter attempts to solve this mystery with the help of his publicist Laura and old friends Joel Manton and Harley Warren. \nThe series takes place in the modern day and explores various themes, including nihilism, living as an artist, and the deceptive power of nostalgia. By expanding on these ideas and applying them to a mix of loyal Lovecraft adaptations and original stories, Dream Cycle will provide entertainment specifically for those with an interest in Lovecraft, his contemporaries, and the weird fiction genre. \nAmongst the stories being adapted are \"The Statement of Randolph Carter\", \"The Terrible Old Man\", \"The Rats in the Walls\", and a mystery two-part adaptation of one of Lovecraft's most famous stories. Beyond season one, there is hope to explore both famous Lovecraft stories (\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\") and more obscure works (\"The Temple\"). If the series reaches its intended three season length, it will culminate in \"The Silver Key\". \nWho We Are\nNERDS! Well, yeah, that... but also film, TV, and theatre professionals. Besides the guys listed below, we have a lot of actors and crew lined up and ready for production. These guys and gals range from stage hands at the Performing Arts Center to independent artists and long term crew members on various high profile TV series and films. \nMichael Keene (hey, that guy in the video!) will produce and star in Dream Cycle. He also wrote the pilot episode. Previously he has worked as the writers assistant on the pilot for Reckless and in various crew capacities on several films. Last year he completed his first short film, I Love My Cactus, which he wrote, produced, and starred in. He also worked with Matthew F. Perry on After Exodus, for which he provided camera and audio equipment, shot a large portion of the footage, and acted in a small role. He also has appeared in numerous Charleston stage productions, most notably in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", in which he starred as Jack Worthing. \nAdrian Westendorff will produce Dream Cycle alongside Michael, and possibly direct an episode of the series. He's an incredibly busy man and the very definition of a professional. He's worked on such TV shows as Eastbound & Down, Army Wives and Reckless, while also working as an editor for commercial projects and producing his own content. \nMatthew F. Perry, director of the pilot, is a short film director who recently completed his largest project to date, After Exodus. Here's the trailer for that project:\nWhy We Need You\nThe fact of the matter is that producing a high quality narrative series is an expensive endeavor. However, the big advantage we have is the fan base surrounding Lovecraft and the stories we're adapting. \nThe funds acquired through this Kickstarter will go toward:\nProfessional actors who can bring these tales of cosmic horror to life.\nA professional crew that can keep the budget low and the quality high.\nA small arsenal of equipment, including basic lighting (Arri) and camera stabilization.\nRental costs.\nLocation fees.\nA selection of notable weird fiction writers to develop our scripts and given the show a standard of quality from the get-go.\nOriginal score costs.\nProps and practical makeup effects.\nWhat You Can Do To Help\nWhile the majority of our needs are based around actually producing the show, there are numerous ways you can aid in this massive endeavor.\nShow your indescribable love by pledging a donation. \nShare this Kickstarter and our Facebook page with your friends.\nSend us your opinions\u2014in writing or on video\u2014about what you'd like to see in a Lovecraftian TV show. If we get enough opinions, we'd like to respond with a video of our own.\nAre you an artist? Writer? Musician? We don't just need financial donations! If you think you could be of service, we would love to hear from you. Whether it be songs to play over the end credits, artwork to display within the show, or pitches from weird writers, we'll consider it all. This is a community endeavor, so let's bring that weird community together.\nStretch Goals\nBelieve it or not, we've got some long term goals. Initial funds past $15,000 will be dispersed among the most expensive factors, i.e. renting equipment, visual effects, stunts, and post-production. However, if everything goes according to plan, these stretch goals will come into play.\n$30,000 - We will go ahead and produce the second episode, \"The Statement of Randolph Carter\". While it will be a tight budget, we envision the episode being fairly low key, and consider this goal to be realistic.\n$50,000 - We will produce the third episode, which also happens to be the most set and creature-intensive of the season. It's also the end of a three-episode mini-arc.\n$65,000 - The fourth episode will be produced. \n$75,000 - The fifth episode will be produced.\n$100,000 - The sixth episode will be produced, completely ignoring what that not-an-accountant said in the video up top.\n$150,000 - That's right, an increase of $50,000. Why? It's kinda necessary when you want to shoot an epic two-part finale in Providence, RI. That's right: we're going to adapt one of Lovecraft's best stories (you can probably guess which one) and set it in his beautiful home town. \n$160,000 and Beyond - We have a lot of plans, but right now our goal is just to get the pilot and, theoretically, the season finished. If we pass the $160,000 mark, then most of it will go into making a better show. We'll hire better-trained actors, more experienced crew, and hire on the best writers small sums of cash can buy.  Anything left over will be recycled into season two. \nAbout The Rewards\nWhile most of the rewards are self-explanatory, here are few more details:\nAll Funders: If you include a link to your Facebook page, we will like it from the Arkham Edge Facebook page. Every dollar counts, so it's really the least we can do.\n$10 - Michael Keene, in character as Randolph Carter, will read off all of the listed names, with some morbid commentary, in a special video. Or series of videos, as the case most certainly will be.\n$18 - Michael will draw each donor who sends in their picture as a cartoon cat. Below is an example, wherein he drew several members of the Breaking Bad cast:\nYou could also be a naked cartoon cat!\n$50 - The T-shirt is not yet designed. We're still going through possible artists, but we should have that all squared away before the end of this campaign.\n$250 - Ditto on the poster. We want something painted, like an old school Hollywood movie poster. \n$5,000 - The happy dance is exactly what it sounds like. Randolph Carter is essentially an avatar for Lovecraft, so imagine Lovecraft being forced to dance (happily) while cursing your name. \n$10,000 - We plan on holding two premieres for the episode, one in Charleston (where most of season one will be filmed) and the other in Providence (where the finale and, in theory, season two will be filmed). If you live in a major west coast city (Portland, L.A., etc.), we may be able to travel to you at the time of screenings in those areas. \nAlso, in the video we mention that there's a \"faux documentary\". That is still something we are going to do, but rather than make it a reward we decided to just put it up for everyone to see once it's done. \nFirst promotional poster.\n Want to keep up with us?\nMain Page: Arkham Edge\nTwitter: @ArkhamEdge and @MichaelKeene\nFacebook: Arkham Edge\nContinue the discussion at the Crowd Funding Forum", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we receive funding, then at the very least we will be able to produce the pilot episode of Dream Cycle. While some delays may occur, it will get done by March 2014. \n\nAfter the pilot (or series) is complete, we'll be shopping it around various distributors. If no distributor will have it, then we'll go our own route and sell the episodes ourselves (through iTunes, Amazon, Roku Channels, etc.). However, out of the distributors we plan to send the pilot to, we don't see all of them declining.\n\nThe major hurdle will be getting past the pilot. There are a few options, all of which are detailed in our stretch goals. If we reach $160,000, then we can comfortably aim for a full season. The central requirement is that we finish the first season's story set up in our pilot. \n\nIf the only thing we can fund is the pilot and for whatever reason the series is not a viable option, then we'll release the pilot as a self-contained 45 - 60 minute short film.\n\nIn the end, this is a passion project. If we can only afford to hire department heads and then populate those departments with interns, and only hire local theatre actors, then that will just have to be the way it is. No matter what, this will be finished, so long as this initial amount of $15,000 is raised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Michael Keene\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nWriter and lead actor for \"The Dream Cycle of Randolph Carter\".

This has been an amazing experience. We are so humbled by your contributions and support. As of now, we have a new tabletop roleplaying game to look forward to playing with friends, family, and fellow gamers. RAIDERS OF R\u2019LYEH IS A REALITY!\n\nGreat job guys! Now let\u2019s bring it home.\nI am incredibly excited to announce RAIDERS of R\u2019LYEH.\nRAIDERS of R\u2019LYEH is a stand-alone roleplaying game and sourcebook in which mercenary rogues EXPLORE FORBIDDEN FRONTIERS, UNEARTH ANCIENT ARTIFACTS, and OUTWIT VILLAINOUS SCUM. Derived partly from the Runequest rules that have been released under the Open Game License, the game is crafted to emulate not only adventure in the Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and his circle of influences, but especially the savage and evocative feel of Robert E. Howard\u2019s Mythos and Weird menace stories.\nAttention has been made to keep the game mechanics compatible with other percentile systems \u2014 while innovating additional rulesets unique to the setting and atmosphere \u2014 so those players wishing only to use RAIDERS of R\u2019LYEH as an Edwardian era adventure sourcebook will have a massive global setting to explore and use in their preexisting Mythos campaign, as well as modular adventure, monster and scenario resources for gaming in 1900-1913. Those players wanting a standalone rulebook with its adventure modes of play, will have a complete toolkit for interacting with the Cthulhu Mythos.\nRAIDERS OF R\u2019LYEH IN GOTHIC BLACK & WHITE (PRINT AND PDF)\nThe PRINT EDITION (RAIDERS OF R\u2019LYEH IN GOTHIC BLACK & WHITE) is designed for players who want ALL of the rules in one convenient & beautful tome. NEW: NOW UPGRADED TO A HARDCOVER WITH SMYTH SEWN BINDING.\nRAIDERS OF R\u2019LYEH IN GOTHIC BLACK & WHITE comes with EVERYTHING NEEDED TO PLAY THE GAME, including: the CORE RULES, the Adventurer Archetypes, the Keeper Section (How to Run the Game, How to Sandbox the Mythos, the Mythos and Monsters, Magic, Occultism & Sorcery, Patrons & Factions, Dozens of Adventure Templates), the 1910 Era Sourcebook (Travel, Weapons & Equipment Lists, Mounts, The Mythos & Weird in 1910, Hotspots, Name Lists, NPC Stats), and a Growing Appendix Full of Ruin Maps, Mansion Maps, Wilderness, Automobile & Road Stats, NPC Stats for Regions All Over the World, and more. Also available as a convenient PDF. ESTIMATED PAGE COUNT: 256 pages!\nThe core rules comes with a vast assortment of toolkits to build and run your own exploratory sandbox game set in the Mythos...\nTHE  ADVENTURER\u2019S GUIDE AND KEEPER\u2019S GUIDE (AVAILABLE IN PDF)\nSome people really like having their role-playing games split into two books, one for the keeper and one for the players. They like this so that players get one book with just the rules and setting material that pertains to them, while the keeper can have all of the monsters, secrets of the setting, adventure templates, magic and mysteries in his or her own book (out of the hands of spying adventurers). So we accommodated that preference with full color Adventurer (ie Player) and Keeper Guides! \nTHE ADVENTURER\u2019S GUIDE contains everything players need to get themselves immersed in the age of empires, and then more to get them into deep trouble. Included are the easy-to-learn core rules, the Adventurer Archetypes, more occupations for the era, playable characters, etiquette of the era, dress and fashion, rumors of weird events & occult societies, and player\u2019s 1910 sourcebook (newspaper clippings, weapons and equipment catalog, notes for combat, investigation and exploration, information about mounts and automobiles, travel guides, notes on sandbox play, and a collection of story hooks). Expected page count: 140 pages \nTHE KEEPER\u2019S GUIDE contains everything keepers need to lure their players into adventure, danger, and hidden terrors. Included are the the Mythos and Monsters, Magic, Occultism & Sorcerery, Guide to the Occult in 1910, How to Run the Game, How to Sandbox the Mythos, Patrons & Factions, Adventure Templates & Traditional Scenarios, the 1910 Era Sourcebook (Travel, Weapons & Equipment Lists, Mounts, The Mythos & Weird in 1910, Hotspots, Name Lists, NPC Stats), and a Growing Appendix Full of Ruin Maps, Mansion Maps, Wilderness, Automobile & Road Stats, and NPC Stats for Regions All Over the World. Of course, as with the Adventurer\u2019s Guide, full color illustrated paintings are added to the already beautiful illustrations. The Keeper Guide, at an expected page count of 240 pages, is the perfect resource for keepers wanting a sourcebook for their own mythos campaign.\nThe Mythos in 1910\nDid you see our first teaser video?\n\nVisit Our Website\nFor more information, go to raidersofrlyeh.com.

This means we are hyper-focused on making great rules, great art, and toolsets that Mythos gamers want.\nWe love tchotchkes as much as everyone else, but felt that too many addons dilluted the message and confused the tier structure, and we are devoted to making an amazing end product, whether it ends up as a digital offering, a softcover or a complete suite of hardcover, softcover, pdf and online SRD editions. Of course, we do not consider essential props or music \u201ctchotchkes\u201d, so we may end up with both when all is said and done!\nKicking it Forward\nGrassroots projects like RAIDERS of R\u2019LYEH are the perfect vehicle for Kickstarter, which is why we are participating in the \u201ckicking it forward\u201d promise. Simply, this means that after we\u2019ve paid the costs to get Raiders of R\u2019lyeh into your hands, we will be donating 5% of what\u2019s left to other people\u2019s Kickstarter projects.\nWho\u2019s involved?\nWhat started as a humble project has grown immensely and I am thrilled to talk about the team of consultants, artists and contributors assembled for this undertaking: THE RPGPUNDIT (theRPGsite, Lords of Olympus, Arrows of Indra) is helping develop the mechanics and contributing writing to the core book and setting material. Entertainment Artist CLIFF CRAMP (Nickelodeon, Lucasfilm, Universal, Disney) is lending his talents to the full-color painted heroes and antiheroes in our Archetype \u201crogues gallery,\u201d as well as helping to develop the rich visual look of the lost worlds, crumbling empires and seedy environs of our setting. KEVIN ROSS (Writer and Contributor to over 30 publications for Call of Cthulhu including Escape from Innsmouth, H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s Kingsport, The Great Old Ones, and Cthulhu by Gaslight) is a recent addition who is consulting and contributing setting material. And special thanks to KEVIN CRAWFORD (Stars Without Number, Other Dust, Red Tide) for his excellent and inspiring material on running Sandbox campaigns and investigations!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe team assembled to produce Raiders of R\u2019lyeh is a highly knowledgeable crew possessing many years of game design, publication, and editorial experience. The two illustrators on the project (one of whom being the lead writer) have in total developed projects for Fox, Disney, Buena Vista, Lucasfilm, Universal, and Nickelodeon. Notable recent projects include a collaboration with Tim Powers, James Blaylock and K.W. Jeter on the publication, Steampunk: The Beginning, as well as the publication design for the Star Wars Blu-Ray release. Our game design consultant is the owner of theRPGsite, one of the largest RPG forums online, and writer of several well-received RPGs (most recently Lords of Olympus and Arrows of Indra). And our consulting scenario writer has had a hand in developing over 30 defining products for Call of Cthulhu.\n\nProjects of this magnitude always face unforeseen challenges, which is why we have assembled experts in their fields to assist in anything that may inevitably arise. We have already minimized risks of production by investing a substantial amount of time and money toward laying the groundwork for an amazing game, including printing and fulfillment strategies. \n\nLastly, we have a very strong support network of friends with Kickstarter campaign experience, should any issue arise. No matter the challenge, backers will be kept updated with regular summaries of development.

Only the strong are able to brave the elements to find life-saving supplies.\nEarly praise for The Long Dark... \n\u201cThe Long Dark caught my eye with intriguing visuals and a great premise, and as a fan of survival open-world games, I\u2019m eager to see what perspective Hinterland brings to the quiet apocalypse.\u201d \n- Chris Avellone, Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Obsidian Entertainment, developers of Project Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \n\"No zombies, no robots, no mutant laser antelopes... I can't wait to experience The Long Dark's realistic, frozen, post-apocalyptic brutality!\" \n- Jason Kapalka, Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of PopCap Games, Creator of Bejeweled\nBrilliant aurora undulate across the sky, at once a symbol of the power of nature, and a melancholy reminder of what we have lost.\nIn the \"post-digital\" world of The Long Dark, mysterious aurorae flash across the sky, destroying humanity's technological might in an instant. All the technology we take for granted, but depend on for our daily existence, suddenly gone.\nWhat happens in a world without technology? How do we communicate? Stay warm? Travel long distances? Make things? Feed ourselves? Protect ourselves? How do we continue to survive when everything we've built begins to fall apart?\nEvery location has the potential to hold life-saving supplies. Or grave danger.\nThis is the experience at the heart of The Long Dark. In a split second, we find ourselves face to face with the might of Mother Nature. We have been knocked several links down the food chain. It's difficult to find food and other resources. People become desperate. The roads are no longer safe.\nThis isn't the end of the world. But it's the end of the world as we know it.\nKnowledge is Power\nIn a world where communication is difficult and information about the world is not at your fingertips, Knowledge becomes a key resource. Learning about the world -- where the hazards are, the safe routes, supply caches, friendly camps -- is critical to your survival.\nKnowledge has a life-span. Track down resource caches and locate life-saving supplies before they are gone!\nThe world of The Long Dark can be a harsh and unforgiving place. There is no manual. Your success depends on getting out into the world and using the information you find there to survive.\nYou Won't Survive Alone\nEncountering other survivors can be a risky proposition, but this is not a game about shooting or thoughtless killing. Combat is rare, and highly lethal.\nWith Knowledge as a life-saving resource, you need to balance the potential value of what the survivor might know, vs. the threat they may represent. This is a game of careful exploration, where those who live by the gun, die by the gun -- or worse. \nThis is the world of ambiguity we are building with The Long Dark -- not a world of black and white heroes and villains, but rather, of saviours and survivors. The selfless and the selfish. People who will survive because they are strong, cunning, lucky, and most of all, pay close attention to what the world is telling them.\nGame Structure\nThe Long Dark's episodic story structure borrows from TV to deliver a well-paced narrative experience that is advanced by player action in the world. Similar to open-world games like Red Dead Redemption and Fallout 3, The Long Dark offers both a large open-world simulation space that encourages freeform gameplay, as well as a story-driven mission structure that draws players deeper into the fiction of the game and world. \nThis structure means that whether you have 15 minutes or 1.5 hours to play, you can jump in and make meaningful progress towards an in-game goal. \nPlease note that you are backing a FULL GAME with The Long Dark. We hope to continue expanding on this game with sequels. The episodic nature of the game's narrative refers to story structure, and not necessarily to the amount of content you're getting in the game, which we estimate to be 5-6 hours for single-player \"story mode\" and dozens of hours for sandbox \"survival mode\".\nThe Hinterland logo combines the fox, a symbol of cleverness and agility, with the Ouroboros, a symbol of eternal renewal.\nHinterland Studio Inc. is a new independent game studio headquartered on Vancouver Island, Canada, and helmed by a core team of veteran developers from the triple-A industry.\n Collectively, the Hinterland core team have shipped many beloved and award-winning games, including:\nNow, the team is embracing the spirit of independence to embark on this new creative challenge from the fringes of the established game industry. \nThe Hinterland core team is:\nIn addition to this impressive core team, Hinterland has partnered up with renowned composers Cris Velasco (www.monarchaudio.com) and Sascha Dikiciyan (www.sonicmayhem.com). Together, Cris and Sascha have scored dozens of games from huge triple-A franchises including Mass Effect, Borderlands, Starcraft, and God of War.\nFor more information about the Hinterland team, please visit the studio website.\nAdditional collaborators will be revealed over the course of our Kickstarter campaign!\nAlthough we're in the fortunate position to have been accepted for support by the Canada Media Fund's Experimental Stream, we still need your support. This program supports innovation in the Canadian video game, film, and television industries, and has allowed us to begin work on a prototype for The Long Dark. This funding has been enough to get us started, but no way is it enough to achieve our full ambition for The Long Dark.\nThe fact is, as an independent studio, we need to raise more money to make the game we want to make for you, and we want to do it in such a way that we can stay true to our creative values, retain our independence, and not \"sell out\" to the corporate world. \nYour financial support will not only help ensure we can help The Long Dark reach its full potential as a piece of ground-breaking entertainment, but that Hinterland can continue to be a viable studio in the future, so we can continue to push the envelope.\nIf you believe in us and would like to see The Long Dark achieve its full potential as an innovative experience, back us and become part of the Hinterland community.\nLet's make something great, together!\nNote: Early Access for Alpha and Beta is only guaranteed for the PC version.\nAll-Digital Tiers\nPhysical Goods Tiers\n  Reward Pics\n19\" x 13\" Poster\n19\" x 13\" Poster (Alternate)\nGame DVD in Hardcase\nT-shirt (choose from three available designs)\nParacord Survival Bracelet\n24\" x 36\" Movie Style Poster\n24 x 26\" Movie Style Poster (Alternate Version)\nLimited Edition Framed Print\nLimited Edition Framed Print (Alternate)\nHard Cover Coffee-Table Art Book\nTo add items onto your reward tier, please add up the total for all the Add-Ons you want and increase your pledge by that amount.

We hope to see you in the community forums! \nMore Love for The Long Dark!\n\"The Long Dark looks stupendous even in its conceptual stages.\"\n- Adam Paris, Indie Statik\n\"...(the Hinterland team) is absolutely riddled with triple-A veterans.\"\n- Philippa Warr, WiredUK\n\"I like the cool understatement of the title and premise, with the quiet authority of a classy novelist or filmmaker. That's what's wanted for an open-world narrative...not hyped neon signs pointing to the content, but an intriguing, mysterious, but immediately understandable world that I can explore, looking for meaning, choices, and self-expression. The art style has the same virtues... classy, thoughtful, expressive. This is the sort of experience I want to sit down at a table with, late on a winter's night, with a cup of coffee, hoping only to have scratched the surface before dawn comes peeking through the frosted window.\"\n- Ken Rolston, Director of Game Design at Turbine, Lead Designer of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and over 30-year game design veteran.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is, by nature, a high-risk process, especially when you are trying to innovate \"outside the box\", with a small team and with limited resources. \n\nWe believe we're taking the right steps to mitigate the inherent risks, and also to ensure the money you pledge us is managed responsibly:\n\n1 - We're building on established technology, vs. \"rolling our own\". It's always tempting to develop your own shiny new technology, but we're a content-focused developer and the only technology we want to build is stuff we can't get off-the-shelf. As a result, we're building our entire technology pipeline around the Unity engine. \n\nUnity is an affordable technology platform for games, is being used by hundreds of independent developers like us, and is supported by a large community of developers who often make their content and technology enhancements available through the Asset Store. So far, we find Unity to be a powerful, flexible engine, and believe it will allow us to develop the game we need while minimizing the technology risk.\n\n2 - Core, distributed team. Rather than carry the risks of recruiting locally and having to face the disappointing hiring/firing cycle that feels like it's become endemic in the games industry, we're built around a \"core team\" model -- meaning, the game will be built by a dedicated, persistent core team of developers representing the key disciplines, and this core team will be supplemented, in a responsible way, by key freelancers as they are needed. This means we can be extremely flexible, have positive and fair collaborations with our freelance partners, and scale up and down in a sustainable, low-impact way. \n\nBeing distributed means we're building the game using modern technology and \"best practices\" dedicated to collaboration that doesn't require we relocate core team or freelancers to a physical location. We use a host of tools to recreate as much of the feeling of working in the same physical space as possible, but people can live where they want and don't have to relocate their families. They can do meaningful work with people they like, while also living where they want. Imagine that!\n\n3 - Responsible stretch goals. Despite the temptation to load up the list of stretch goals and use them as a carrot to drive fundraising, we've elected to take the approach that more money shouldn't add risk to the project. We've all seen examples of crowdfunded projects raise many multiples of their original target, only to be delayed indefinitely with not guaranteed increase in project quality. \n\nAs a result, our stretch goals are based on two things: 1) adding quality to areas of the game we are already developing (for example, more minutes of music in the soundtrack, or more lines of voiced dialogue, more polish time for things like User Interface and controls), vs. adding more features or significantly more game content. 2) adding to the overall experience of The Long Dark with supporting materials that enrich the game experience but do not directly affect scope or features (for example, creating a series of motion graphic novels that provide background fiction for key characters). \n\nWith this philosophy around stretch goals, we believe we can add a lot of value and quality to the experience of The Long Dark, and still get the game you're backing here to you on time and in the form you expect. We believe that when you choose to back a game, you're backing the game as it's being pitched, and not the game it might become if it achieved many times its original target. We hope you agree with this approach and appreciate what we're trying to do.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #77", "update_userinfo": "March 2021 Developer Diary", "update_content": "Dear community,\nIt\u2019s time for an update on Episode Four progress, which I\u2019m sure is the topic at the top of all your minds right now.\nEpisode Four Progress"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "HESITANT PROSPECT Update Now Live", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #75", "update_userinfo": "ESCAPE THE DARKWALKER Now Live", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary \u2013 October 2020", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWith the Switch launch behind us, I wanted to update you on our activities around THE LONG DARK for the remainder of this year.\nNEW EVENT: ESCAPE THE DARKWALKER (October 29th - November 12th)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "TRUE SURVIVAL COMES TO NINTENDO SWITCH", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary \u2013 August 2020", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Will You Survive WINTER\u2019S EMBRACE?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #70", "update_userinfo": "The Long Dark Dev Diary \u2013 May 2020", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "Social Distancing Fundraiser!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "The Long Dark Updated - ERRANT PILGRIM [1.64]", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 1663, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hinterlandgames/the-long-dark-a-first-person-post-disaster-surviva", "project_name": "THE LONG DARK, a first-person post-disaster survival sim"}}, {"backer": "Ronny Anderssen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "http://kickstarter.is.over.u55.eu\nWith the help of our fans, we have achieved so much more than we ever dreamed of.

LOVECRAFT, we aim for an immersive urban horror experience on an unprecedented scale.\nThere is no escape!\nU55 \u2013 END OF THE LINE is a first-person survival horror adventure set in the subway system of modern-day Berlin. The game will be developed for Windows. Sticking to the tried and true lore created by H.P. LOVECRAFT, we aim for an immersive urban horror experience on an unprecedented scale. We want to recreate the classic \u201ccosmic horror\u201d setting of diabolical entities breaking into reality and bring it to life with the help of subliminal sounds. What humanity believes to be regulated by the laws of nature is only true until nameless forces start swaying over the world.\nArtwork (Subway Station: Brandenburg Gate)\nArtwork (Subway Station: Bundestag / Reichstag after destruction)\nHere\u2019s the gist of it:\nU55 \u2013 END OF THE LINE is a groundbreaking first-person horror adventure inspired by classic horror games such as Amnesia, Dead Space, Silent Hill and, of course, Call of Cthulhu - Dark Corners of the Earth.\nThe game features binaural sound effects especially intended for stereo headsets. These are designed to support the disturbing, adrenaline-driven atmosphere and enhance your perception.\nThe game faithfully recreates Berlin\u2019s original sites, such as subway stations, parts of the government district, and the central station.\nIn the story-driven game, you play as David, an American student living in Berlin. While he is on his way to the central station to meet his girlfriend, his subway train crashes. In order to find a way out, he has to navigate through the dark with the smartphone display as his only source of light.\nAs one of our stretch goals, U55 \u2013 END OF THE LINE will come with full support for Oculus Rift, which we consider to be one of the most exciting advancements in gaming technology these days. Why would we decline the opportunity to create an even more memorable and immersive gaming experience?\nYou are in Berlin\nScene Concept (Berlin Skyline after collapse)\nDespite being extremely popular among international artists and movie makers, BERLIN has never been properly shown in a video game and has far too many interesting and scary locations to be left unexplored by a video game. \nYou make the decisions\nYour choices make the difference between life and death. Throughout the entire game you will make decisions that will influence not only the game\u2019s progression, but also its final outcome.\nYou are only human\nJust like in the pen-and-paper RPG \"Call of Cthulhu\" you will always stay vulnerable! There will be some first-person-based combat but bear in mind that you are exactly the opposite of a soldier, commando or superhero - and what kind of weapons do you expect to find in a subway tunnel anyway?\nThat means that U55 - END OF THE LINE does not feature common character progression known from RPGs.\nInstead, your catalyst for character progression is the smartphone, your most important tool for survival. You will be able to upgrade it over time by downloading apps and collecting enhancements for it. (i.e. bigger battery pack, translation app, flashlight app, navigation app. animal noises app, etc.)\nYou are not alone\nFocusing on player interaction, U55 - END OF THE LINE features three- dimensional characters, each with a detailed background story. \nWhenever the player interacts with his environment and other characters, he cannot be sure about their true intentions. You can never be sure that words like \"honesty\", \"trust\" and even \"love\" mean as much to others as they mean to you, and punishment for blindly putting faith in others can be cruel...\nScene Concept (The Death of Officer Erik Reichenberg)\nYou are carrying the legacy\nWe follow the classic Lovecraftian premise: when meddling with forces as old as the universe itself, you cannot simply fight your way through \u2013 the approach is up to you, but it\u2019s brains, not brawn that will help you overcome these terrors.\nWith that being said, you might ask: H.P. Lovecraft envisioned the most sinister cults in the history of literature involving the almighty CTHULHU and the Great Old Ones. So, where are they?\nFew things are as detrimental to creating a mystery as knowing exactly what you're up against. So we'll leave you with this: The forces at work are mightily sinister and very old. \nSokolov Dispatch (Source Lena Kronblatt)\nThis document was found in the city archives by Lena Kronblatt and is called \"The Sokolov Dispatch\". You may get a glimpse of what you are in for with U55 - END OF THE LINE by reading this and other information that Lena Kronblatt collected on her blog. Lena is a student from Berlin and her hobbies are urban legends and unsolved paranormal mysteries.\nLENA'S BLOG\nU55 - END OF THE LINE features a mystery bigger and greater than Berlin ...\nA sketch of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft in 1934 (Source: Wikipedia)\nYou are going to improvise\nYour primary tool for surviving in the darkness is your smartphone display. That\u2019s it \u2013 no assault rifles, rocket launchers, magnum revolvers, or grenades. What good would those be against entities from realms beyond our understanding anyway?\nBut this does not mean you have to stand your ground bare-handed. You have a variety of tools at your disposal to counter every threat there is. Most of them may seem underpowered, so use them wisely...\nYou are not going to trust your ears\nThe sound effects are among the most important features in a horror game. This is where U55 - END OF THE LINE is truly innovating.\nThe acoustic background is centered around the use of subliminal messages. The most important aspect are the BINAURAL BEATS.\nThis acoustic phenomenon was discovered in 1839 by Doctor Heinrich W. Dove and is commonly used for meditating and in psychotheraphy. It influences brainwaves by applying soundwaves that run on the same frequency as your brain in a specific emotional state. For instance, you can calm someone down when he's upset by adding frequencies the brain has in sleep mode. But, of course, the effect works both ways.\nBinaural SFX only works with a headset because it requires two slighty different low-frequency-tones, one for each ear. The frequency in between is where the magic happens.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nSome people suffer from headaches when listening to specific frequencies. On top of that, binaural sounds have a much larger impact on the minds of children and minors.\nIn the game, binaural beats are always OPTIONAL and can be turned off in the menu. We strongly advise NOT to play the game under the age of 18! This is NO JOKE, you can harm yourself! \nSource Wikipedia\nThis technique is pretty new to gaming. Until now, only one game had a binaural soundtrack at one point (Pokemon - Green Edition) with severe consequences. You surely know the urban legend of the\nLAVENDER TOWN SYNDROME\nOf course the suicide rumours are plain crap, but, interestingly enough, they are what most people come up with when they hear about binaural beats. After receiving numerous questions doubting our own sanity since we were posting info from creepypasta, we decided to correct this one for good. Poe's law has hit us hard and we will try to redeem our faith in humanity by apologizing for any misunderstanding we have evoked with that one.\n\nNow, listen to THIS with your headphones on and bear up against it. Imagine, a horror game having a soundtrack that creepy... Perfect for the Lovecraftverse!\nNO CREDIT CARD? NO PROBLEM!\nPLEASE NOTE: You can also pledge by using PayPal but you should always choose Kickstarter over PayPal! Please only use PayPal if you don't have a credit card or any other reason that prevents you from pledging via Amazon Payments / Credit Card.\nThank You!\n\nMore goals will be revealed over time.\nWe have great plans for the game, including a second character with a completely new storyline (Tina), a meaningful multiplayer mode, Nazi and Soviet facilities, cultist haven, a news show reporting directly from outside the subway as it's been shut down, enhanced storylines on all main characters and much more....\nAt one point, we will even be able to produce U55 - END OF THE LINE completely without any further funding.\nPLEASE NOTE\nAll copys for U55 - END OF THE LINE on Kickstarter will be shipped DRM FREE!\nEXCLUSIVE BACKER INGAME APP AVAILABLE ONLY ON KICKSTARTER\nYou support us first - you deserve the best!

They were ground-breaking for their time.\nThis is the goal we have for U55 - END OF THE LINE.\nEven moderate games have decent graphics nowadays, so we won't set any new standards in that department. However, with tools like OCULUS RIFT entering the market, we can now truly \"enhance\" the perception of a game itself, not only pump up the graphics.\nSo U55 - END OF THE LINE breaks out in that direction and enhances your gameplay experience. Binaural sounds are sending cold chills down your spine, while the 3D sound environment and Oculus Rift put you right in the middle of the action.\nThe danger feels real. The horror feels real. The characters feel real.\nSo far we have developed U55 - END OF THE LINE paying out of our own pockets.\nAll founders of Effective Evolutions had their own businesses or were part of a start-up before, so up to now, we had money for development.\nUnfortunately, we are now at a point at which our reserves are running short, and praying to the Great Old Ones won't help us anymore. Setting up a new office and hiring staff costs money, but is necessary to finish U55 - END OF THE LINE with the quality it deserves. We need additional funding to make our (and hopefully your) dream project come true...\nThis is why we are on Kickstarter. Plain and simple, we either raise enough money to produce the game to its full extent or at least have the leverage when it comes to negotiating for money. \nThe timeframe is also important. Gamescom is the second-largest trade-fair for video games worldwide and takes place in Cologne from August 21st to August 25th.\nWant to meet us in person?\nWe will be featured at Gamescom's most frequented entertainment stage by our partner Sound of Games. In addition to that, we've planned some cool guerilla-marketing gigs to draw attention from the press and the crowd.\nThis will give us momentum. Momentum we need to get U55 - END OF THE LINE going.\n\"I never ask a man what his business is, for it never interests me. What I ask him about are his thoughts and dreams.\"\n- H.P.

Our team currently consists of 20 people directly involved in the development process.\nNobody got any compensation for their work up to this point. All costs were covered by the founders (Malte, Patrik, Sebastian & Marc Trinkhaus).\nRight now our crew members work on U55 - END OF THE LINE because they love the game. They share the vision and they want to make this project happen. But now, after four months, we've got to the point where we either abandon our dream or continue as a development studio.\nWe decided in favour of the second option.   \nBut let us be clear. For your money, we will:\n\u2022    hire the necessary staff we need to continue\n\u2022    buy hardware and software to equip for particular tasks\n\u2022    pay for mo-cap and professional voice acting\n\u2022    find a place where we can work together\nWe have to be brutally honest with you:\nKickstarter might not be enough for a project as large as U55 - END OF THE LINE, so there may come a future point where we might need additional funding. Depending on how much we raise here, we might need to go to a publisher. Shall this day ever come, we will stay faithful to the things we have promised and take the leverage when it comes to negotiations.\nSo every dollar we raise through Kickstarter gives us more freedom on making a true GAMER- and NOT a market-oriented product.\nIf we raise enough money to fund the production completely, we won't even need a publisher.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project bears some risks and no project runs without any errors. It doesn't matter if you are planning on constructing an airport or making a small student game project. The typical sources of failure are misplanning, over-estimating your own abilities and lack of communication. These causes remain the same, no matter what size and how many people you have.\n\nThe only way to successfully avoid missteps is honesty and an open culture of talking to each other. This may sound ridiculous when it comes to constructing something but it's true. If you do things right, the people working for you won't hestitate to come to you if there is any problem in sight. This may sound easy, but in reality, it is hard. Nobody wants to be the person that doesn't fullfil his promises. \nSo before he tells you about a delay in his work, the employee will do everything to mask his delay. This is natural human behavior and needs to be adressed properly. Luckily, our team has more than 70 years of experience combined when it comes to making IT-projects, movies and, of course, games. Patrik and Malte have both built successful IT start-up companies and have a degree in Project Management. \n\nDespite other Kickstarter campaigns, there is one specific risk to U55 - END OF THE LINE. It is the risk of running-out-of-money. In the Costs section we already told you that we may need additional funding. \n\nThe best guarantee to avoid running out of money is you (the fans). With a large, strong and vocal fanbase having our back, publishers cannot refuse. On top of that, NOW is the best time for establishing new IPs, with the new console generation falling into place.\n\nBut it is possible that we might get too little too late or even nothing from a publisher. We prepare for this event in two ways: \n1) We sell a share of the company itself to an e-commerce investor. This would give us plenty of money, but we might end up \"losing\" our own company. Malte M. Boettcher and Patrik M\u00fcller have already run e-commerce start-ups, so we know the right strings to pull here. \n2) We scale the project down to a bare minimum. The second option is not preferrable because it is not the game Malte envisioned. Hence, to begin with, we will attempt the first option. \n\nWe know crowd-funding money is not free! \nYou put a lot of faith in us and our vision and we are grateful for that! There is nothing more heart-warming than finding people who believe in you!\n\nIn order to handle our promise with all due amount of respect for your contribution, we are aware of the threats and worst-case scenarios to U55 - END OF THE LINE.

So far, you've read a bit about David, our protagonist, the unfortunate soul who finds himself in a crashed subway train as he is on his way to the central station.\n\nWhat is he doing there? Well, before she boards the train to France to visit her parents. They are on a relationship break, , but David is still hung up on her. His big goal is to make that big romantic gesture and convince her to think over her decision and come back to him (once she returned from France of course, this is not a third-class romantic comedy - and rest assured that France will have enough problems to come square with).\n\nLost in thoughts, he sits on the train, thinking about what to say, when the lights start flickering and the train crashes. As he wakes up, in complete darkness, all by himself, he soon witnesses that . What it is? You\u2019ll see ;)\n\nHis first and foremost secondly he wants to. You know that a in such a situation.

We consider her to be more of from the Resident Evil series, or Farah from Sands of Time. Now don\u2019t worry, she is her. Everyone hates those characters and everyone hates the gameplay that comes with them. So it was a challenge (and still is!) for us designers to adequately integrate Tina into the design of the game.\n\nFirst and foremost however, . I\u2019m not giving away anything by writing that her interest in getting to the Central Station to find Dave\u2019s girlfriend is very little. She has her own problems to worry about and her own way of dealing with things.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to Berlin, you\u2019ll notice that the people there are\u2026 Let\u2019s call it: a little different. They\u2019re very honest, have a wicked sense of humour and are somewhat more relaxed than people elsewhere in Germany. Look up \u201cBerliner Schnauze\u201d and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Born and raised in Berlin, Tina shares those character traits and is the kind of . For example, she won\u2019t hesitate to tell Dave exactly what she thinks of his undertaking.\n\nWhile creating her as well as Dave and all the other characters in the game, it was - the kind of persons you\u2019d meet out in the street and have a conversation with.

Inspired by the predecessors of this hallowed genre like Valkyria Chronicles, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the X-COM franchise, WARMACHINE: Tactics seeks to break new ground for turn-based tactics games by delivering a never-before-seen level of dynamic battlefield combat.\nAs you\u2019ll see in the video, the development team has worked around the clock for several months to prove we have the experience and the ability to turn WARMACHINE into an incredible video game worthy of your pledge. Kickstarter has provided the opportunity to realize this vision, and with you on our side, we can make it a reality.\nTo date, we have unlocked 16 stretch goals, adding incredible content and features to the game, making your $20 pledge an amazing value!\nRivalries as old as man steep the Iron Kingdoms in a tradition of incessant war, forging in its violent fires heroes of unimaginable power and the weapons they alone can wield. This is a land dominated by iron giants and their heroic human controllers, a fantastic realm marching to the progressive cadence of an industrial revolution, where magic and technology have found common ground in the form of a new science, called \u201cmechanika.\u201d\nDominating the field of battle are the WARCASTERS, rare individuals who have mastered both sorcerous magic and martial combat and who possess the singular ability to command the mightiest warriors of the Iron Kingdoms\u2014ten-ton, flame-belching, lead-spewing machines of destruction called WARJACKS.\nWarjacks are the warcasters\u2019 greatest weapons\u2014titanic, steam-powered automatons with arcane brains, magically linked to their warcaster controllers and capable of executing their every devastating order. Together, a warcaster and his warjacks possess the power of a small army. When leading a military force, they are unstoppable.\nThe wars that engulf the Iron Kingdoms are waged by four powerful nations: imperialistic and conquest-driven Khador; heroic Cygnar, with its cutting-edge technology; the fanatical Protectorate of Menoth; and the undead \u201cNightmare Empire\u201d of Cryx. Bolstering the forces of these factions are countless mercenaries, drawn from all corners of the continent to profit from the endless conflicts. Other nations beyond the Iron Kingdoms have also entered the fray\u2014ancient and inhuman races, some who ally with the human factions and others who would see humanity destroyed.\nFor a deeper look into the world and factions of WARMACHINE, visit WARMACHINETACTICS.COM.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is a squad-level, turn-based tactics game featuring both a single-player campaign and online synchronous and asynchronous head-to-head multiplayer options.\nWhether playing the campaign or multiplayer, the command and management of your squad is key. Not only will you make defining choices about the warcaster, warjacks, and warriors that comprise your squad, but you will also utilize strong tactical direction of their strengths and abilities in battle as well as astute guidance for how they evolve over time.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is designed around the philosophy of synergy between the members of a squad. Every unit is part of the whole and can interact with other units for greater effect. Similar to the concept of creating ability combos in a trading card game, units in WARMACHINE: Tactics can combine effects and abilities that support each other\u2019s efforts and increase one another\u2019s effectiveness. Careful and creative selection of a squad\u2019s warcaster, warjacks, and warriors is essential to an effective strategy. Plus, it means you can design exactly the force you want to put onto the battlefield.\nThen once your squad takes to the field of battle, your tactical command of their actions will govern their success. Will your squad advance cautiously, utilizing cover and outmaneuvering the enemy, or will they charge furiously into melee combat where brute force and resilience will win the day? In battle, how you command your warcaster, warjacks, and warriors and the tactical decisions you make to adapt to your enemy will determine your squad\u2019s fate.\nIn WARMACHINE: Tactics, you\u2019ll be able to save multiple squads in different configurations so that you can always pick the best load out for the mission or opponent at hand. And if you want to see how your squad stacks up, you\u2019ll be able to pit them against an AI opponent in order to try out your strategies and evaluate their performance before putting them to the true test against opponents from around the world.\nThe Iron Kingdoms are populated by rare individuals who possess incredible arcane talents in addition to unmatched combat skills. Even more important, they can mentally command and channel their power through the most devastating weapons of war\u2014warjacks. In WARMACHINE: Tactics, your squad is led by such a warcaster, one of many unique characters drawn from a colorful pantheon that makes up the epic cast of this setting. Each warcaster possesses an arsenal of weapons tailored to his personal fighting style as well as a unique combination of spells and skills. These include a defining arcane feat that, when used at the right time, can turn the tide of battle.\nWarcasters possess a replenishing reservoir of magical energy, called focus, which endows them with their superhuman abilities. Focus is used to cast spells, charge the protective fields of their specially created battle armor, and increase the effectiveness of their combat abilities.\nEvery warcaster interacts with his or her warjacks and warriors differently. One warcaster may promote aggressive strategies and bolster her squad\u2019s performance in melee combat, while another warcaster may provide greater defense and longevity to his squad, encouraging a more methodical approach to victory. The interchangeability of warcasters in WARMACHINE: Tactics provides nearly infinite replayability and ensures that no two game experiences are ever the same.\nThe spearhead of the WARMACHINE fighting force is the warjack. Outfitted with an array of wicked weaponry, these imposing constructs of steel and iron are brought to life through a fusion of steam power and magic and controlled with deadly precision by the warcaster.\nA warcaster is in constant telepathic contact with her warjacks and can channel her focus through a warjack to boost the machine\u2019s combat abilities and enable it to execute devastating power attacks.\nThe relationship between warcasters and their warjacks is as close as the kinship between any brothers in arms. Over time, a warjack gains experience and may bond with its warcaster, taking on unique personality characteristics and developing new aptitudes.\nFleshing out the squad in WARMACHINE: Tactics are the warriors. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines and roles, warriors are selected for the fighting capability and supporting tactics they add to your squad based on how you want the force to operate on the battlefield.\nSquads in WARMACHINE: Tactics are small, elite units, and the warriors that comprise them are all heroes in their own right. The warriors bring with them a gallery of incredible weapons and abilities that can make a squad perform efficiently and effectively in any situation, from rapid assaults to stealthy hit-and-run maneuvers and everything in between.\nEach battle awards warriors, warjacks, and your warcaster with experience that unlocks new options for your squad, like tactical feats for the warriors or bonds between the warcaster and his warjacks that affect the performance of the warjacks in specific situations. This ever-growing list of options can be accessed during squad building to customize your force to your precise strategy.\nEach campaign will focus on a single novice warcaster character and allow you to play through the formative experience that evolves that character into a full-fledged warcaster, also playable in multiplayer.\nThe campaigns will deliver an extensive, story-driven experience. Although conducting your squad during campaign battles works exactly like combat in multiplayer, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to choose how the central character develops her abilities through the course of her evolution.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics will ship with the \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d campaign, featuring Cygnar\u2019s Lt. Allison Jakes, a young journeyman warcaster trained as a duelist who is unexpectedly thrust into a position of great responsibility and leadership before she is ready. Under your command, Lt. Jakes will rise to the occasion in the face of horror and adversity in this harrowing story that will define her character forever in the ongoing saga of WARMACHINE.\nFuture campaigns will explore all the factions of WARMACHINE and feature a cast of characters uniquely designed for both the video game and the tabletop.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of WARMACHINE: Tactics is being able to play against your friends no matter where you are or what time it is. Online multiplayer will support both synchronous and asynchronous play, so you can compete head-to-head against a live opponent on the other side of the world, or you can play the asynchronous \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d mode, which allows both players to take turns at their leisure. If you don\u2019t have a friend available and still want to get your battle on, you\u2019ll be able to find an opponent with automatic matchmaking. And WARMACHINE: Tactics will offer casual, ranked, and tournament play to suit the style of every player.\nMultiplayer will be supported with regular releases of new maps, units, and even whole new factions. We want to ensure that your game experience is consistently fresh and offers new challenges every time you play.\nOur funding goal allows us to produce the single-player campaign and the multiplayer mode featuring playable forces with multiple warcasters, warjacks, and warriors for the Cygnar and Khador factions as well as some Cryx units that appear in the single-player campaign\u2014about three dozen units in all. We hope to get a whole lot more in there by achieving our stretch goals: the WARMACHINE tabletop game currently includes over 500 distinct warriors, warjacks, and warcasters, and our ambition is to bring as many of them into WARMACHINE: Tactics as possible. Our goal is to deliver regular expansions to the game in the form of campaign and themed bundles that will add new characters to your faction rosters and new stories to experience. Multiplayer maps will also be released regularly as free downloads, available to play by everyone.\nWe\u2019re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you\u2019ll back our project. We\u2019re going to entice you with what we hope are tantalizing offers you can\u2019t refuse!

This collaboration has allowed us time to bond, to learn to work effectively and efficiently, and to develop the trust required for two entities to undertake the challenge of bringing a dream to life. Individually, we bring vital expertise and resources to the WARMACHINE: Tactics project, and together we can achieve more than either of us ever could alone.\nPrivateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams have made a considerable investment in time and money to pay for the initial development of WARMACHINE: Tactics. We accepted this risk so that we could present a project worthy of your confidence. Our belief is that by promoting this project on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll raise the profile of the game and expand awareness of WARMACHINE to an even wider audience that will help us achieve the funding necessary to produce the best version of WARMACHINE: Tactics possible.\nIn early 2013, Privateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams officially joined forces to co-produce WARMACHINE: Tactics without the traditional support of a publisher.\nPrivateer Press Interactive was founded by Matt Wilson, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Privateer Press, Inc., the leading independent producer of tabletop miniatures games, best known for WARMACHINE, the game of steam-powered combat set in the fantastic world of the Iron Kingdoms. The mission of Privateer Press Interactive is to bring the tabletop gaming worlds of Privateer Press into the digital medium.\nWilson, who created WARMACHINE, has worked in the game industry for over 18 years as an artist, art director, writer, and award winning game designer. Prior to the twelve years of titles he has generated at Privateer Press, Wilson art directed and was the lead concept artist for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast, as well as contributing artistically to Dungeons & Dragons, FASA\u2019s Battletech and Shadowrun lines, and AEG\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, where he also created the world and developed the game.\nFor six years, Los Angeles-based WhiteMoon Dreams has worked with companies all over the world to bring their games to market and has been heavily involved in game technology R&D with partners including Disney, Intel, and Tencent. WhiteMoon Dreams is helmed by founder and CEO, Jay Koottarappallil, who has spent 18 years in the video game industry working on a range of titles, including the Myth, Ratchet & Clank and Medal of Honor series\u2019.\nKoottarappallil has assembled a team of design heavyweights including Creative Director Scott Campbell, one of the key minds behind the original Fallout, and Game Director Kevin Mack, who ushered Fear Effect and Medal of Honor. Projects at WhiteMoon Dreams are managed by Executive Producer Rusty Buchert, a revered icon for indies everywhere for his work at Sony on such titles as Flow, Flower and Journey as well as being responsible for some of Interplay\u2019s biggest games, including Descent, several Star Trek games, and many others.\nBy combining and sharing resources between our two companies, we are able to move rapidly and efficiently through the development process of video game production. WARMACHINE: Tactics is a true collaboration, and because of the constant communication and the fact that WARMACHINE'S creator, Matt Wilson is part of the game\u2019s design team, we are able to ensure the most faithful interpretation of the WARMACHINE setting possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA letter from Privateer Press Interactive founder, Matt Wilson:\n\nVideo games are complex undertakings. Everything presented on the screen has been painstakingly created by many disciplined professionals\u2014artists, animators, programmers, designers, and audio and effects engineers. Games are a meticulously orchestrated symphony that, when well presented, create unforgettable interactive experiences for those who play them. If the concert isn\u2019t well executed or conducted, the result is sluggish performance, a frustrating interface, low-quality art, or missed deadlines.\n\nThese variables make predicting the outcome uncertain, but every potential problem is surmountable with the proper application of time. Ideally preparation and experience will help avoid any pitfalls, and carefully planned contingencies will make it less disruptive when one is unavoidable. The most significant challenge in software development is simply delivering what\u2019s been promised on time.\n\nWhile it may appear Privateer Press has made some bold moves in the past, the truth is, we are risk averse. We make our decisions cautiously, with great consideration and calculation. Privateer Press Interactive, being composed of the same executive team, is no different. We know our greatest risk in this is the reputation of the Privateer Press name we have built over the past twelve years, and we have not undertaken this project lightly.\n\nThe decision to launch this project on Kickstarter came after nearly a year and a half of observation and analysis of other crowdfunded projects, and our decision to make this journey with WhiteMoon Dreams follows nearly five years of friendship and trust developed from our professional association. This is not a quickly conceived scheme, nor are we entrusting our beloved WARMACHINE to an unknown quantity. We have weighed the alternatives and considered the variables, and we\u2019re confident in our choice of development partners. But that\u2019s not enough. Just like you, we needed to see it in action.\n\nTo be sure of our decision, along with WhiteMoon Dreams we have funded several months of development on WARMACHINE: Tactics so we\u2019d be able to show you something credible and worthy of your pledge. We didn\u2019t want to just show concept art and offer lengthy descriptions of the game we envision; we set out to prove we have a team with the talent to bring this world to life. New progress is made on the game daily, and we\u2019ll be sharing that with you regularly throughout the campaign and right up until the product launch. We\u2019ve chosen a realistic funding goal that will support the required development, and we\u2019ve committed to a comfortable timeline with built-in contingencies should we encounter unavoidable delays. And we have planned our current funding beyond the end of this Kickstarter so that our team can remain focused on its continued development without skipping a beat.\n\nWhen we undertook this project, we also made a pledge: we will not launch another Kickstarter project until WARMACHINE: Tactics has released and has achieved all we have promised to deliver in the basic game as well as all the stretch goals we reach. We view this Kickstarter campaign as our one shot\u2014our single opportunity to create this game on our terms, and with your support.\n \nWe will honor your support above all else.\n\nNo one knows the future. When I met Jay Koottarappallil of WhiteMoon Dreams five years ago, neither of us imagined we\u2019d someday be making our WARMACHINE game this way. But now, more than ever, I am confident it will get done\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to play it with you.\n\nMatt Wilson\nOwner & CCO\nPrivateer Press, Inc.\nPrivateer Press Interactive, Inc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "LATEST DEVELOPMENTS", "update_content": "Greetings WARMACHINE: Tactics Backers!\nWhiteMoon Dreams is forging ahead with the development of WARMACHINE: Tactics and has some great news about the latest patch, available today, and what's coming up.

You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a fully simulated, living cyberpunk city.\nThe game world is designed to facilitate emergent gameplay, giving you the tools and freedom to play how you want to play, so you can create strategies and scenarios that not even we had anticipated!\nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there.\nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers?\nSatellite Reign will be released on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe.\nThe time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve?  To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves?  That, is up to you.\nThis is one big, open, living metropolis. The city isn't just a cool location (although it is pretty cool), it actually functions like a city; the streets are bustling with people by day, and controlled by criminal organisations by night. Power grids actually power the city, information and finances flow from one district to another, and you can use all of these things to your advantage.\nThe entire game-world is designed around emergent gameplay. Civilians, police and corporate soldiers will all react uniquely to your actions. Power conduits, communication networks and security systems are there for you to hijack, modify or destroy. Learn how the city and its inhabitants operate, then exploit them all to advance your agenda.\nThe city is huge and you can move around and tackle objectives however you want to. You won't be spoon-fed one mission after another, you'll be able to use whatever means you can to get to your final goal. Bribe scientists to advance your technologies, and kidnap doctors to augment your agents. Steal money from the banks to fund your war against the corporations, and exploit neural implants to bend the will of others. Or, try to take your objectives through good old-fashioned brute-force.\nDistinct character classes give you total control over how you approach a situation. Different classes with different combinations of augmentations, gear and weapons gives you the ability to customise your team and your experience.\nNot every problem is easily solved by shoving a gun in its face. Sometimes the situation requires a bit more subtlety, a bit more finesse. Try siphoning cash out of the corporate account, bribing a bank manager to \u201cmisplace\u201d his security pass, or steal the identity of a corporate soldier to pass through security checkpoints unseen.\nFrom our previous experience with the Unity Engine, we could look no further. Its flexibility, ease of use, and quick turnaround on development means less barriers between the creators and the creation.\nIts robust scripting system and one click approach to deployment allows us to simultaneously develop releases for Windows, Linux and Mac.\nFrom Left to Right: Dean Ferguson, Chris Conte, Mitchell Clifford, Brent Waller and Mike Diskett.\n5 Lives Studios is an independent developer. Our core team consists of five dedicated industry professionals with many years of experience. Not only are we all industry veterans, but we also have a long history of working together, allowing us to make games like a well-oiled machine. Some of us have worked together for nearly a decade! Collectively, we have worked on a wide range of genres and notable titles including the Syndicate series, GTA IV, Darksiders II, Star Wars, L.A. Noire, and many more.\nKickstarter is continually proving itself to be a utopia for creativity. It gives developers like us the chance to get back to our roots, so we can make the games we want to play. We\u2019re free to explore and implement ideas without publishers demanding that we reshape our vision for broad, generic appeal.\nAnd most importantly, it gives you the opportunity to have your say. You get the chance to bring back the types of games you loved. Not only that, but you're also in the unique position to give input on the actual development. This new age of developers and gamers being able to work together paints an exciting, bright future for the industry we all love. \nWe will be thrilled to meet our initial funding goal. Doing so will allow us to achieve our core vision for Satellite Reign, but should we be fortunate enough to exceed our target, every bit extra will go into expanding the experience even further. We've got loads of great ideas on how we can expand Satellite Reign, which we'll reveal as the campaign continues. \nOur first stretch goal will allow us to bring on Russell Shaw, the composer from the original Syndicate series. He'll bring a truly authentic soundscape to the world of Satellite Reign.\nNote: Currency Conversion Rates are an estimate based on exchange rates in June 2013. Final conversion rate may vary.\nBackers who pledge for the \"Transistor\" tier or higher will receive an exclusive Kickstarter-only Satellite Reign t-shirt!\nT-Shirt designs are not yet final, so feel free to tell us what you think!\n\"Bob\" Miniature Figurine available in the \"Bobbylicious\" tier and above.\n\"CTO\" backers who claim the right to design and name a weapon in the game will work closely with 5 Lives Studios to ensure proper balancing of the weapon within the overall structure of the game.

And in turn we pledge to support other Kickstarters through http://kickingitforward.org/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n5 Lives Studios is a small team and our ambitions are high, but we have extensive experience delivering quality games with limited resources and in short time frames.\n\nOur design is truly scalable. Our initial goal will allow us to produce a game which retains the core gameplay and design concepts without sacrificing the depth of the simulated city.\n\nThe structure of the simulation systems and design means minimal bespoke code and scripting of events. The simulation systems are fully modular and independently operating, while at the same time interlinking to build a complex and believable world. This allows us to build new systems and simulations which can easily slot into the core systems at any time without breaking the overall structure of the game and code.\n\nWe carry the same modularity across to our art pipeline. The environments are built with modular building blocks, which gives us the flexibility to iterate quickly, and allows for a large range of variety in the game world.\n\nTogether, based on our experience as individuals and as a team, we're confident that we will achieve our goals for Satellite Reign. Our initial funding goal will allow us to deliver a rewarding and engrossing gameplay experience which can be expanded in both depth and size if we are fortunate enough to exceed our immediate funding goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Unity Awards and Mod Support!", "update_content": "Greetings Agents!

With these influences in mind we\u2019re creating an epic, replayable turn-based tactics game where you train generations of heroes to repel a demonic invasion.\nAnd with Kickstarter, we can do it. We have a great concept and team ready to go, and we want to work closely with our community to control the future of MASSIVE CHALICE free from outside interference.\nMASSIVE CHALICE is a single player turn-based tactics game within a multi-generational strategy campaign built for replayability.\nAs an immortal King or Queen, you must unite your kingdom under a powerful dynasty, eliminate the demonic threat, and reforge the MASSIVE CHALICE!\nThe game is structured into two main layers: strategy and tactics. In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die.

Charlie took Alberto's new border and crafted the following study for the leatherette-covered book. You apparently like the look. Then, the upper for the KEEPER'S RULEBOOK and the lower for the INVESTIGATOR HANDBOOK?\nShards of Courage\nJenny lay on the floor whimpering meekly, entirely at the mercy of old, leathery Walter Corbitt. To help save her friend and colleague, she had tried to kill the old man -- and she had delivered a gruesome blow, to no avail. Visions of the blow replay in her mind, but Corbitt's yellow gaze continues to mock. She can't bear to watch her own demise.\nBut Corbitt has no mercy, only hunger and malice -- and the enveloping aroma of her essential liquid. Her blood will make him strong. Savoring the moment, hoary Walter Corbitt stoops low to the shuddering Jenny -- then a sharp stab of ice-cold terror rips his shoulder. No, it cannot be! \nWith a roar of manic fury Harvey, who stitched together the shards of courage left to him, unsheathed the ancient ornate knife from his left hand and with the other drives the blade deep into old Corbitt. Those long years suddenly take their toll and Corbitt cries out for the last time, crumbling to the floor in disgusting chunks and pieces. \nHarvey kicks at the remains. \u201cBy his own weapon is the devil worsted!\u201d\nLATER\u2026\nLaying flowers at the foot of the hospital bed, Harvey takes a seat. Jenny is recuperating. Her recovery had not gone well; her wounds had festered and needed several operations. Harvey watched her sleep. His own physical wounds were bandaged, though his left hand would never again function properly. His mind would take longer to mend. \nHe wondered if he should tell Jenny of the papers he found in Corbitt\u2019s hidden lair. What was the Chapel of Contemplation and why did the police carry out a raid on the place some ten years ago? Perhaps Corbitt\u2019s demise is not the end of the story, but just the surface layer of a deeper plot?\nWelcome to the new edition of Call of Cthulhu.\n(...earlier installments can be found at the bottom of this page)\nHow To Pledge?\nChoose a pledge level from the right-hand column, click on it and follow the instructions.\nPledge an amount equal to the pledge level plus shipping for your postal area.

Lovecraft.\nBy Sandy Petersen with Mike Mason, Paul Fricker, and Lynn Willis.\nThe Great Old Ones ruled the earth aeons before the rise of humankind. Originally they came from the gulfs of space and were cast down by even greater beings. Remains of their cyclopean cities and forbidden knowledge can still be found on remote islands in the Pacific, buried amid the shifting sands of vast deserts, and in the frigid recesses of the polar extremes. Now they sleep -- some deep within the enveloping earth and others beneath the eternal sea, in the drowned city of R'lyeh, preserved in the waters by the spells of mighty Cthulhu. When the stars are right they will rise, and once again walk this Earth.\nCALL OF CTHULHU is Chaosium\u2019s classic roleplaying game of Lovecraftian horror, in which ordinary people are confronted by the terrifying and alien forces of the Cthulhu Mythos. CALL OF CTHULHU uses Chaosium\u2019s Basic Roleplaying System, easy to learn and quick to play. This bestseller has won dozens of game-industry awards, is a member of the Academy of Adventure Game Design Hall of Fame, and was voted the #1 Gothic/Horror RPG of all time by the GamingReport.com community. CALL OF CTHULHU is supported by a growing line of high quality supplements.\nThis Kickstarter project aims to build a new edition of this classic horror game and expand its award-winning tradition.\nTHE NEW EDITION\nAs currently envisioned, the CALL OF CTHULHU KEEPER'S RULEBOOK is a new edition of the CALL OF CTHULHU rules incorporating new options, an improved flow of combat, new scenarios, and a cleaner page layout with box and page decoration evocative of the primary period of play in the 1920s. Here are eighteen chapters including H.P. Lovecraft and the Mythos, Creating Investigators, Skills, Game System, Combat, Chases, Sanity, Magic, For Keepers, Tomes of Eldritch Lore (with over 100 tomes), Grimoire (with over 100 spells), Artifacts & Alien Devices, Monsters, Beasts & Alien Gods, three scenarios, plus a reference chapter containing Lovecraft Country, Historic Timelines, Mythos History of Earth, Sanity Quiz, Play Aids, and more. The \"Skills\" chapter contains full descriptions for each skill, including guidance on opposed skills, setting difficulty levels, examples of how to \"push\" the different types of skills, and suggested consequences for failing a pushed skill roll. The \"Chases\" chapter provides rules for all types of chases, whether on foot, driving a car or boat, flying airplanes, or being pursued by monsters.\nWe also wanted to address the players directly, and simultaneously we will also release the INVESTIGATOR HANDBOOK, intended for all players, which includes ten chapters expanding Creating Investigators with optional background packages, more than a hundred Occupations, Skills, Investigator Organizations (nine separate organizations described - The 'Wipers' Pals, Wrath's Circus of Wonders, Strange but True!, The South 13th, SKT Research, Novem Angelus, Ratched's Children, The Resurrectionists, The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained), Life as an Investigator, The Roaring Twenties, Advice for Players, plus a references chapter. \"Life as an Investigator\" takes a look at investigative procedures and equipment, and also provides examples taken from the files of the Theron Marks Society.\nWhen Will It Come Out?\nWe want to have these books in your hands by Halloween (October 31) of 2013.\nThe rule book has been fully revised and carefully restructured to bring you the rules in the most user-friendly way. Call of Cthulhu is a well established game with a wealth of supporting scenarios, campaigns and source books. It's important to note that the 7th Edition rules remain backwards compatible so that previously published scenarios and source books all remain playable with the revised rules. We\u2019ve gone to great lengths to revise the rules in a way that retains the essence of what makes Call of Cthulhu such a great game.\nHere's an overview on some of the revisions that will be found in Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition...\nCreating your Investigator\nThere are lots of great options for creating investigators, along with advice on integrating your investigator with the story. It also provides you with support and tools for generating an investigator\u2019s backstory, enabling players to create fully rounded characters with a reason to investigate the Cthulhu Mythos.\nSkill rolls\nNot everything is so easy for the investigators -- if they attempt an especially difficult task the new rules introduce the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 skill rolls. Revised skill descriptions and new skills like Intimidate and Charm have been added to provide investigators with more ways to investigate and uncover the secrets of the Mythos.\nOpposed rolls\nNo need to refer to charts -- everything you need is right there on the character sheet! \nPushing skill rolls\nSometimes your investigator fails a task. With the new rules, if you want to try a second time you can -- if you can justify it! But beware -- failing a second \u2018pushed\u2019 roll will have dire consequences -- opening the door for the Keeper to take the story in all sorts of new, exciting and sometimes unexpected directions.\nLots of Advice for Players and Keepers\nThe new rules have been written with a mind to helping all players get the most of Call of Cthulhu. Particularly, a special advice chapter for Keepers on how to construct a scenario, how to build tension and horror, and how to develop the story and engage your players. Whether you are new to the game or have been playing a while, there\u2019s information and tips for everyone .\nToolkit\nOver the decades many gaming groups have developed their own style of Call of Cthulhu play, and 7th Edition provides you with options, tools and advice on how to tailor the game in a way that will suit you and your group. Whether you like things more pulpy or gritty, there\u2019s optional rules to build and scale the game you want.\nMissed a clue? No worries!\nEver had your players get stuck because they don\u2019t know what to do next? The new rules provide a mechanism for handling such tricky situations; a revision of the Idea Roll rule. Now you can throw tricky investigations at your players and not have to worry if they pick up every clue or not. The new Idea Roll helps to keep your game on track without unnecessary railroading of the players.\nSanity\nThe sanity track remains, however the Keeper is provided with new guidance on how to deal with episodes of insanity, including phobias, manias and delusions. Plus the Keeper is provided with advice on how to tamper with the investigator\u2019s backstory -- potentially corrupting their relationships, their possessions and other important aspects of their life as they sink further and further in to the cosmic abyss of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nArt used in our Spanish-Licensee publication, now available for our use!\nCombat \nSometimes your investigator will have to rely on his or her fists! All unarmed attacks now come under the one skill of Brawl, allowing you to describe your attacks as befits the situation. Weapons and firearms retain their own skill categories. Combat now works with opposed rolls, allowing you to resolve combat scenes faster than ever before and avoid drawn-out \"miss - miss\" situations, whilst giving players more options on the things they can do during a fight. Fast paced and exciting combat!\nCombat maneuvers replace the old grapple rules. Now you just describe what you want to do and roll versus your opponent -- allowing greater freedom to create exciting fight scenes. Your investigator can do more during combat than just fight or flee!\nChases\nAn entirely new chase system that allows you to combine vehicles, monsters and pedestrians in exciting chase scenes. Remember the chase scene in Lovecraft's 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' wherein the protagonist, Robert Olmstead, flees the Gilman House hotel via a window and is pursued across Innsmouth by deep ones? These new rules enable you to stage exciting chases like that in your game.\nMonsters\nYou\u2019ll find a host of old favourites here, along with a few new faces, as well as insightful marginalia providing details, notes and ideas on many of the monsters and gods therein.\nSpells and Tomes\n7th Edition provides revised rules for how to handle magic in your game and also revisits tome reading times, as well as providing advice and ideas on how to use tomes in your scenarios and games. If your investigator has never cast a spell before you may find you get more than you bargained for! Likewise, insane ancient Mythos wizards and monsters have access to deeper realms of magic and a range of spells have suggested effects for just this type of insane casting.\nNew scenarios\n\"The Haunting\" -- the old faithful scenario is back, with added, step by step Keeper\u2019s advice for new players. Plus two new scenarios: \"Amidst the Ancient Trees\" and \"Crimson Letters\", designed for both new and veteran Keepers. \"Crimson Letters\", set in witch-haunted Arkham, provides the ideal starting point for a campaign.\nAnything else? The entire rulebook has been revised, edited and will be presented in a brand new layout with loads of cool new artwork. \nCall of Cthulhu was originally written by Sandy Petersen. Paul Fricker and Michael Mason have written, revised, and developed the new edition, in addition to developing the book's structure and adding new content throughout.\nBadger McInnes will perform the primary layout for the 7th Edition books. He worked on the award-winning Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition and numerous books for Chaosium and other publishers.\nPaul Carrick, the artist who created the award-winning cover for the Chaosium publication Cthulhu by Gaslight, will be creating new art for Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition.

It\u2019s time for...\n        \"This is the most awesome game in the history of existence!\"\n            - Victor (age 6)\nAdventure Maximus! is a role playing game designed with kids in mind. As a parent, we want to get our kids involved in the same games we play but sometimes our games are not 'kid friendly'. The sad reality is most RPGs on the market today are not geared for children, just us older gamers. But how do we get the young ones into the hobby that we grew up on? \nWell we make a game for them! \nAdventure Maximus! is a game where kids can easily create a character, plan and run adventures, find treasures and be heroes of their imagination. Adventure Maximus! inspires creativity, problem solving and provides quality face time with other human beings rather than staring into computer screens all with the help of dice and cards (by using dice and cards it gives the kids that extra toy value to keep them at the table).\n    \"You need to hurry up and make this game so I can have one.\"\n          - Sophia Vasilakos ( age 7)\nAs an industry veteran, Ive published a lot of role playing games but nothing as ambitious and long lasting as creating a new platform to bring new players into the offline gaming world. What better place to start than with our kids.\n\nMy long time friend Francis Hogan and I have put together an ambitious project that we hope you can help us with. It takes a lot of resources and capital to make a good game - as well as being able to market and find those players. Kickstarter has opened up many opportunities to expand that. \nI hope you will lend us your support and help us spread the word to as many people and parent/gamer resource outlets as possible. Please help us make our dream of bringing an RPG that kids can run as well as play to the gaming community come true!\n                                        \"Can I run the game?\"\n                                          - Liam Hogan (Age 8)\nAdventure MAXIMUS! is a card based, introductory Role Playing Game for players 8 years-of-age and up. Players can take on roles from eight different races. Working together as a famous \"Adventure Company\" based in the fantastic, post-apocalyptic world of Ex-Machina where they can become heroes of legend.\nWhen there is trouble, or innocent people need protection from the fierce creatures that populate Ex-Machina, they call on Adventure Companies to save the day!\nAdventure MAXIMUS! follows the classic role playing game format consisting of someone who runs the adventure (who we call a Maximus Master) and 2 or more players who interact with the adventure. Inexperienced Maximus Masters will find using our Adventure Creation System helpful when making their first adventure. Also, the role of Maximus Master can be taken over by a player in mid adventure so that everyone gets a chance to play!\nPlayers will be asked to make heroic actions fueled by Action Points. Players receive a limited amount of Action Points each round, so they must be budgeted. The bigger the action, the greater the cost. Action Points replenish each round. Racial Abilities, Class Abilities, Action Powers, Spells and Items all have Action Point costs printed on their cards.\n\"How do I know how many Action Points I get and how do I get more?\"\nThis video will show you how to find out about Action Points in Adventure Maximus!\nTo determine if actions taken succeed or fail, Players will consult the abilities, powers and items being used. Add all the \"+\" bonuses together, and roll that number of Maximus Dice.\nMaximus Dice have three blank sides that are not counted as successes.\nOne side has the single sword symbol, which is counted as one success for each time it comes up.\nOne side has the double sword symbol, which is counted as two successes for each time it comes up.\nOne side bears the Maximus symbol, which is counted as two successes for each time it comes up, and the player may roll an additional die for every Maximus symbol that comes up in a single roll.\nThis will create a great deal of excitement at your game table every time the Maximus side appears.\n \"I love Rolling the dice in Adventure Maximus!  but what do all these symbols mean?\"\nWatch this video and we'll show you how to roll them bones!\nPlayers will move through the landscape of the world of Ex-Machina, as described through the images on the map cards. They will encounter the creatures there, then either through combat or wits, the players can defeat the challenge. At that point they receive loot and experience points. Defeating a creature by using brains over brawn will always earn players more experience points.\nCreatures in the world of Ex-Machina fit into one of three basic classes, Lackeys (the weakest), Monsters (Strong creatures, but not necessarily evil) and Bosses (powerful evil masterminds bent on world domination!).\nPlayers can encounter Lackeys and Monsters anywhere in Ex-Machina, but Bosses are usually only encountered at the end of an adventure.\nHere is a video of kids playing Adventure MAXIMUS!\n         \"It must have been a really good game because Brian came\n                              home and tried to make his own.\"\n                         - Dawn Bauer (mother of Brian age 11)\nThe Adventure Maximus! box set (which will have a SRP of $25.00) will include:\n\u2022 11 fully illustrated race cards\n\u2022 30 fully illustrated creature cards\n\u2022 16 player class cards\n\u2022 45 fully illustrated item cards\n\u2022 26 fully illustrated spells\n\u2022 16 action powers\n\u2022 18 fully illustrated location cards\n\u2022 a full color soft cover rule book\n\u2022 set of 5 Maximus Dice\nWe are hoping to expand the contents of this box with stretch goals if the project is funded. We have designed over 300 cards for Adventure Maximus! and would love to offer more! With a larger budget, we can do that!\nThe game will be printed right here in the USA, which will allow for a faster turnaround time and supporting our local businesses. By doing so, we plan to have copies available for GenCon 2013 in Indianapolis. \nHere is some samples of the revised card design since the videos have been made:\n     \"Joe was insulted he didn't get Adventure MAXIMUS! for Christmas.\"\n                       - Barbara Cardone (mother of Joe age 11)\nIn addition to the rewards listed, you will be able to add some items to enhance your pledge level!\nAdd $25.00 for each additional copies of Adventure Maximus!\nAdd $20 to add an awesome Adventure Maximus T-shirt!

The very first edition came out in 2003.\nphoto by avrenim_acceber\nSO WHAT'S THIS PROJECT ALL ABOUT?\nThe short answer- I'm redoing all of the art in the book- AND adding a section of nursery rhymes! That's right! Another 8 pages will be added to bring the book from it's original 26 pages up to a hefty 60.\nThe new cover!\nLong answer- When I illustrated the first edition of Baby's First Mythos over a decade ago I was still in high school. It was done pretty quick and dirty because frankly, weren't expecting the reception that it got. Three more editions were published, and 40,000 books were printed and sold. And while I'm very proud of how far it's gone, I've been wanting to update it for a very long time. We got the rights to the book back from the publisher in 2012 and I got to work. I hope this whole thing doesn't come across as too George Lucas, but since I'm the one taking on the publishing now I want this book to look the best it's ever looked.\nOOOH! That IS exciting!\n\nThe book itself will be 7\"X9\", black and white and 60 pages long. \nEnjoy some in-progress art! There's more where that came from!\nOKAY, SO I GUESS YOU CAN DRAW, BUT WHAT ABOUT PRINTING?\nActually, since you asked, I have self published before although this is my first crowd sourced book. In 2010, Guilded Age Volumes .5 and 1 came out which were joint efforts in self publishing with the writers of the comic. Then in 2011, I published The World Bestiary on my own.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!\nFor the stretch goals I'll be doing a black and white comic adaptation of the early Lovecraft work \"Herbert West: Reanimator\" as an e-book.\nReanimator is made up of six short stories. With every extra 5k, I'll do another one of the stories and every backer will get a copy added to their tier.\n$15,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"From the Dark\"\n$20,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Plague-Daemon\"\n$25,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"Six Shots by Moonlight\"\n$30,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Scream of the Dead\"\n$35,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Horror From the Shadows\"\n$40,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Tomb-Legions\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm about 60% done with the new art and being a freelance artist by trade- my schedule fluctuates wildly, but I am pretty dedicated to the deadlines I've set. \n\nAlso, I'm down to two printers right now and I'm getting some more details before I finally pick one (they both come to approximately the same price), one of those printers is in China which may cause delays in shipping.\n\nAnd lastly, I don't know how many people will sign up for bookplate versions but I've more or less signed up to potentially do 200 more drawings so that could cause a delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "An Explanation.", "update_content": "The advance copy arrived this morning!

Quite a lot, I guess, but we think one of those things is an interesting premise for a horror adventure.\nThe game is heavily based on atmosphere and exploration, and using the two year old child\u2019s perspective. For example you\u2019ll be able to see your own body at all times, and you will have to interact with the environment to find places to hide from dangers.\nOur gameplay prototype from last summer:\nFresh environment teaser:\nThe teasers we have published are captured entirely in-game.\nThere might be threats hiding in every shadow, but there\u2019s no traditional combat. Instead, players will actively have to find places to hide, and avoid confrontation to survive. For example in cupboards and under furniture.\nWe\u2019re aiming to include some puzzle and adventure elements as well, but our main focus lies on exploration, atmosphere and horror.\nMore screenshots \u00bb\nWe've done a lot of experimenting with environmental interaction, so for instance you\u2019ll be able to push, pull and climb objects to reach places, open and close doors, make a staircase out of drawers, peek around corners, carry and place small objects, and the list goes on.\nWe have many goals with Among the Sleep, one for instance being our desire to tell a compelling story both through an interesting storyline and through metaphor, relating to what actually evokes this fear and confusion in the child. We aim to include the surrealistic theme of dreams and children's imagination, both as a setting and an active part of the game.\nMore concept art \u00bb\nWhile travelling through diverse environments inspired by our dreams and driven by the endless imagination of the child, you will have to search for comfort and safety. Will you find your parents?\nIf this Kickstarter is successful, we\u2019ll be able to finish the game already during Q4 this year, for PC, Mac and Linux.\nFollow the project on:\nFacebook \u00bb   Twitter \u00bb   Youtube \u00bb   Project home page \u00bb\nThe amazing amount of positive feedback around the web has been a driving motivational force for us during development.\nKrillbite Studio, the independent developer behind Among the Sleep, came to be during our studies of interactive digital art about two years ago. As a creative collective of friends, we started our current project Among the Sleep as our thesis project, and we decided to continue working on it after graduating.\nWe love this medium, and want to craft unique and interesting experiences to drive it forward. This means that we experiment all the time, for instance by making and releasing creative side projects for free.\nWe're now at the point in development where we have finished the core gameplay, but there is still a lot of production, as well as a ton of polishing and testing left to do. We want to take our time and make the game as good as possible.\nThe only obstacle we see going forward, is that everyone at Krillbite still work part time jobs on the side to survive while developing Among The Sleep. This inhibits our focus and productivity on the game, and we don\u2019t want to lower our expectations to the quality of the finished game, or delay the release. We hope this Kickstarter will help us deliver the best possible experience we can, within a reasonable timeframe. Another reason to use Kickstarter is our wish to stay independent, and free from the creative boundaries of a publisher.\nWe've found that $200.000 is the amount we need to quit our part-time jobs, and continue working all hours of the day on finishing Among the Sleep.\nIf we are fortunate enough to receive more than our goal, what would we spend it on?\nWe are very satisfied with the existing design of Among the Sleep, but there are numerous things that we\u2018d like to be able to offer you on the side of the game itself.\nLike we mentioned in the Oculus Update Video, we\u2019ll be including a basic implementation either way, but we\u2019d really like to spend some time optimizing and exploring some amazing possibilities with the technology.\nWe\u2019d also very much like to include a proper in-game Commentary Track, so that you can hear our thoughts, anecdotes and other stories from the development of Among the Sleep should you choose.\nYou'll find a ton of rewards to your right, including copies of the game, OST, Boxed limited edition, Art book, T-shirts, Alpha testing, your name in the credits a Skype conference with the team and a Personal plush-Teddy, handmade by us at Krillbite!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, our biggest challenge is that all of us work part time jobs to finance Among the Sleep. As such we loose a lot of time and focus that we would rather spend making the game as great as possible.\n\nOther challenges might be the unforeseen obstacles we have to overcome during development. But we'll keep you in the loop and commit to deliver Among the Sleep as promised!\n\nDemographic is something we still have to figure out. We have confirmed the game to be available in English & Norwegian. What other languages it will be available in, is something we have to judge based on your feedback. Maybe some of you might help us as well?\n\nQA (Quality Assurance) is always an important part of any production. This is something we will take seriously, by using the gigantic base of testers that have already applied. Also, some backers will be offered to help ensure the quality of the game through beta-testing. This will let you test the game early on, while providing valuable feedback to us!\n\nOther than that, the occasional asteroid or meteor might make problems.\n\nWe promise to keep you in the loop and up to date on all matters of the final production through blog updates, forums, video content, dev diaries, iama and whatnot! :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Enhanced Edition of Among the Sleep available this week!", "update_content": "For the past few months we have been very quiet, we haven\u2019t blogged and we haven\u2019t really been that active outside our office.

To accomplish this we spent a lot of time on camera movement. We wanted to simulate the way children waggle when they walk, their perspective and movement when crawling. We made climbing animations simulating how small children climb, we made the player fall over occasionally when running because, you know, that happens to small children.

Here you go!\nOur Vision\nThe classic turn-based strategy \u2013 exciting, involved gaming that calls for long-term planning, clever tactics, transparent rules and tough decisions \u2013 is making a comeback. Many gamers may have seen and enjoyed recent examples of great turn-based gaming, but might not be aware of classics like Battle Isle or Advance Wars. Have you ever wondered what games of that calibre would look like today?\nWell, we did. And as a result, we decided to bring back this great genre with its unique gameplay experience. For ourselves, for you and for all other gamers out there interested in turn-based strategy.\nPre-Alpha Screenshot (February 2013)\nSo, let's do this. Let us develop something we are all passionate about: turn-based gameplay, pure and simple; a strategy game for experienced gamers. A stand-alone game for PC, Mac and Linux, that can also be played in all relevant browsers via plug-in.\nWith Battle Worlds: Kronos you'll get:\nTrue, challenging turn-based strategy gameplay.\nGet the FULL game in a box or as a download, nothing less.\nNo DLC scheme, no micro-transactions.\nNo DRM. No \u201calways-on\u201d necessity. Pinkie swear.\nPre-Alpha Screenshot (February 2013)\nWhat\u2019s In The Game?\nHere are some of the key features that will be in the game:    \nSingle Player Campaigns - Fight for the \"Yerla\" faction, a highly technologized army. For the Rebels,  make do with what you\u2019ve got and fight a guerilla war. Together both campaigns will allow for more than 30 hours of gameplay. \nSingle Player Challenge Maps - Test your skills in different combat scenarios and keep track of your progress.\nLive Multiplayer - Battle your friends live on the interent or via hot-seat.\nAsynchronous Multiplayer - Take all the time you need and consider your moves . Similar to \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d, your round is stored on our server and turned over to your opponent. The system allows you to continue the match anytime and anywhere you want.\nStrong AI - A clever AI that considers gameplay on various tactical and strategic levels as well as individual enemy characteristics will challenge even experienced commanders. \nMap Editor - A powerful editor to create your own maps and missions (Windows only).\nThere will be around 40 different units and buildings in the game, many of which can be upgraded to obtain new capabilities\nWhat Are The Core Gameplay Mechanics?\nStaying true to turn-based strategy, Battle Worlds: Kronos is all about using your units and resources to the greatest possible effect. In order to win, you will need to consider factors like the positioning of units, attack range, armament and equipped upgrades.Victory or defeat - your tactics will decide.\nWe are using in-game cutscenes to tell the story of the campaings.\nAll units in the game have a unique character, setting them apart from all other units and giving them well-defined strengths and weaknesses. You can further individualize them by assigning specific upgrades. Most units allow for two leveled upgrades, each with two options to choose from. The campaign sometimes allows you to take some of your victorious units with you and improve them over the course of several missions.\nUpgrade units according to your personal needs and style of play!\nMultiplayer, Community & Tournaments\nMultiplayer: While you will be able to battle your friends (and foes) in realtime, just like you are used to in other games, it's the asynchronous multiplayer mode that really gets us going. Playing Battle Worlds: Kronos across platforms and in asynchronous mode means that the game is with you anywhere, anytime. You can spend days and weeks fighting epic battles against opponents all over the world. Play a turn, transfer it to the server and let your enemy make his move. Take your time while taking turns and fighting for victory! For us, this is the coolest aspect of the game.\nCommunity: We will gather a community of turn-based strategists around the game, supporting it with a forum, a match-making system and a game ladder system. Additionally, we will provide a game editor, which will enable the community to create their own maps for single or multiplayer battles.\nTournaments: As a recurring highlight for the community we are planning tournaments of different sizes, where players can compete beyond the game ladder.\nWhat is the schedule?\nAs early as one month after the successful close of the Kickstarter campaign you can play your first alpha version of the game - if you backed the project with $75 or more. Other backers will be able to join the closed beta version before open beta starts. We are planning to release the game end of 2013. \nOur Stretch-Goals\nThanks to the community for providing ideas for our stretch goals!\nWho Is KING Art And Can You Guys Really Do It?\nKING Art is an independent game developer from Bremen, Germany. KING Art was founded 12 years ago and we have worked on over 40 games projects, around 10 of them the same size or bigger than \u201cBattle Worlds: Kronos\u201d. So yes, we can do it. We have extensive experience with projects of this kind. Most of our projects had been contract work for publishers. But as often as possible we do projects close to our heart like the adventure game \u201cThe Book of Unwritten Tales\u201d and now \u201cBattle Worlds: Kronos\u201d.\nMost of us have worked together for years - oddly enough we still like each other.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOnce upon a time we created an alpha stage version of the game and tried to find a publisher to finance the project. Unfortunately, most of the industry did not see the potential, or if they did, they offered us a budget that would have been too low and meant cut-backs on our vision of what the game could be. Kickstarter offers us the opportunity to make the game we have envisioned - all options included. And not by order of a publisher, but backed by you, the players! If we can realize this, it was well worth the wait. \nAbove: Artworks of units from the first Battle Worlds: Kronos prototype\nIs The Budget Big Enough To Make A Great Game?\nNope ;-) Sorry, it just isn't. The full game with all the features we want will cost more than the sum we want to raise through Kickstarter. The Kickstarter share is only about 1/3 of the whole thing.\nWe've spend as much of our own money on the game as possible and we'll work long evenings and on the weekends for this project. But for outsourcing costs (music, effects, some of the arts, voice acting) we need cash. And that's where we need your help. Your contribution will make this project possible, it will ensure our vision of a great game.\nI Want To Help! What Can I Do?\nFirst of all we have to mount the financing of the game. So: Please back the project generously, and spread the word about it!\nAs a backer you have the opportunity to actively participate in the development of the game and collaborate with others on our homepage  www.battle-worlds.com.

The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

A huge thank you to everyone who has supported the campaign so far. We still have some great rewards and great stretch goals. There is still a little time left to pledge.\nUpdate: LiveCode Adopted by More than 25% of High Schools in Scotland; Raspberry Pi\nGreat process for the platform today for students and educators. Read all about it here.\nUpdate: Halo Co-Creator Chooses LiveCode to Build Graphic Novel Experience\nThis is such an amazing new iOS app that we wanted to share details here.\nWhat is this Kickstarter Campaign About?\nHave you ever had an idea for an app but don\u2019t know how to code?\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to code but found it too difficult?\nHave you ever been frustrated by how long it takes to write an app?\nAre you frustrated with the current state of computer science education in high school?\nDo you want to help establish coding as a new form of literacy?\nAre you interested in a better way to write software for your company?\nIf you answered YES to any of these questions, then we need your help.\nIn 1987 Apple created a program called HyperCard. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, all you need to know is that tens of millions of end user programmers used it. It was the easiest and most popular end user programming environment ever created, before or since.\nLiveCode is like a next generation version of HyperCard. It is used to create #1 one app store apps, real-time flight booking systems and control satellites. It is used to create simple one off apps and utilities to solve day-to-day problems.\nThere are some things it can\u2019t do \u2013 yet. This project is to create a next-generation LiveCode.\nOur vision is that this new next-generation LiveCode will be free and open source.\nIt will run on every popular platform and device.\nIt will let you write programs in English.\nAnd by being open, its English language programming will be extensible to any computing problem out there. That's a world first.\nIf you couldn\u2019t code before, LiveCode is the answer. If you\u2019ve used the existing version of LiveCode before and it didn\u2019t do everything you needed, this next-generation version has you covered.\nWhat is LiveCode? Our story.\nComputer Science Students Love LiveCode\nAlmost a quarter of secondary schools in Scotland are now teaching with LiveCode.\nEvery school that has used LiveCode for more than a year has seen a doubling of uptake in advanced computer science classes!\nBy supporting this project, you\u2019ll be helping create a version of the platform even more suitable for teaching.\nIt will be free for schools and universities worldwide.\nWe believe that computational thinking and programming is a key form of digital literacy and that enabling a new generation to write interactive software is critically important in today's economy.\nStudents use LiveCode to create games and apps for their own smartphones and tablets. Although the LiveCode language is easy to use, it is a sophisticated and complete programming language suitable for teaching all aspects of computational thinking needed for this age group, even including advanced concepts for older students (e.g. arrays, parameter passing by reference). \nThe open source edition of LiveCode will be free and available to schools globally. Read more about LiveCode in Education.\nWhat is your money going toward?\nWe need to raise \u00a3350,000 to fund an experienced team to do this right.\nWe will re-engineer the whole platform so it is easy for the community to contribute to the code base. Did you know that Linux only took off after a version of it was created that was modularized with a kernel? We\u2019ll be doing the same to LiveCode. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about this here.\nWe will introduce a new technology called \u201cOpen Language\u201d. With Open Language, the more technical members of our community can create English-like words and phrases to enable everyone to write programs that use any aspect of a computer or device. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about that here.\nWe will introduce a new visual editor designed around today\u2019s usability standards. The editor will be open. The more technical members of our community can create simplified versions of the editor for tablets or primary schools.\nHere is a screenshot of the prototype:\nWhen Will it Be Completed?\nWithin a month of the campaign closing we will launch the Community Edition with the source code. That version will have the source code as it is today. This will provide everyone who has made a pledge access to the platform.\nOver the following few months we will be hard at work on the main goal of creating the next generation of the platform. We will restructure the code into modules that plug into a new kernel and deliver this version for testing over the summer. Once that is complete the community will be able to contribute to the source code easily.\nTechnical Summary of Kickstarter Deliverables\nWe are going to use the Kickstarter funding to deliver the next generation of the entire LiveCode language and visual development environment. To do this we need to do some packaging and updating, including:\nPacking the source code into community-friendly modules\nOptimize the execution engine and some older components\nAdd a clean architecture to allow new language plugins to be developed\nCreate a new, beautiful graphical front-end for building your apps\nThe scope of these tasks is considerable. We will be reorganizing some half a million lines of C++ code, running on six platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and Server, into straightforward modules that plug into the new kernel. We will be porting our English-like syntax into a new uniform virtual machine layer and adding a way to let the community add its own syntax. Another team will be working on re-designing the visual editor in parallel to make the platform even easier to get started with and use!\nWhile we will be making the code base available in its current form immediately, these important changes will take the platform to the next level, and make it much easier for the open source community to make contributions. At the end of this we will have a beautiful, consistent and openplatform.\nStretch Goals\nWe have designed the project to be flexible and there is so much more we can add to the new Open Source platform.\nWe have some truly amazing stretch goals - features for students, for gamers, for commercial companies and more. Supporting our stretch goals will let us deliver the future to you much faster. Example stretch goals include a brand new multimedia layer, new sprite capabilities and support for additional platforms!\nWe have goals covering virtually every enhancement request our customers have ever made, so please stay tuned.\nWho You Will Be Working With\nThe LiveCode Team - click to learn more about us\nRewards\nEvery pledge you make is so important to the success of this exciting project and we have developed fantastic rewards to thank you for your support.\nEveryone who contributes more than \u00a312 ($20) will get a complete set of LiveCode Training Academies where you can learn everything you need to know to create your own app or game.\nThe pricing in euros and US dollars is an estimate and your actual conversion rate may vary slightly.\nPlease Make a Pledge.

It\u2019s quite scary too. No, we\u2019re not making this up: some people were terrified just by reading the script alone, and we\u2019re striving to top it with the most immersive, oppressive, depressive, (and many other words ending with 'ive') atmosphere ever seen in an adventure. Don\u2019t be fooled by our excitement or apparent silliness; we\u2019re very serious about making Asylum a disturbing and horrifying game that you won\u2019t easily forget.\nCheck out breathtaking in-game screenshots!\nWe\u2019re deliberately keeping details of the story under wraps. We firmly believe that the less you know about the game, the more it will surprise you. There are plenty of inside looks available though: screenshots, promotional videos, trailer, the Interactive Teaser (or really short demo), and more. When it comes to the story, everybody wants to know what Asylum is about, but we\u2019re only willing to reveal what we said in the pitch video and hinted on the trailer...\nYou\u2019ll have to take our word for it: the plot is very twisty and satisfying. The deeper you go and the more attention you pay to your surroundings, the more Hanwell Mental Institute will reveal about its true nature. Every room is bursting with detail, mood, and backstory. There is a lot to investigate and discover and, quite literally, an entire asylum available to explore. Close to 100 rooms, in fact. You might think we\u2019re a bunch of slightly deranged people to have created a game of this scope on our own and with close to no budget\u2026 and you may actually be right.\nHere's a short but polished glimpse into what Asylum has to offer. Yes: playable stuff readily available! You may download for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. To play, unzip and launch Dagon. Please note that the teaser has mostly been tested on Ubuntu for Linux platforms. For more information and system requirements, visit our website.\nYou can also watch the following videos featuring Bertrand (aka \"Subject E14\") in a most uncomfortable situation. These were released anonymously and went viral before the game was announced: Session One, Session Two, Session Three, and Last Session.\nSenscape is a young company based in Argentina but we have decades of combined experience. Agust\u00edn Cordes has been addicted to the adventure genre ever since he dwelt in the kingdom of Daventry at the tender age of 7. Over the years he has become an active member in the adventure gaming community, has written many reviews, and went on to design and develop Scratches, widely regarded as one of the best horror adventures ever made (he disagrees, but still...). Scratches became a cult sleeper hit and sold over 250,000 copies. Its soundtrack and chilling atmosphere were highly praised at the time but, most importantly, the game is still being actively discussed for its mysterious and gothic plot, equally influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and Hammer Horror films. Asylum aims to build upon that, with an even more immersive atmosphere and story that will haunt you for years to come.\nDownload the Backer Pack to help promote Asylum!\nAgust\u00edn, together with the rest of the Senscape team, also took part in one of the biggest game projects in Argentina, the educational adventure Risk Profile. While this humorous title was never translated to other languages, it was extremely well received in the country, with thousands of kids still clamouring for a sequel.\nYeah... another one. We develop games for art\u2019s sake but we still need funding to make it happen. For starters, we need to pay our rent and buy food, clothes, and loads of coffee. Perhaps in a different timeline our civilization has sorted out the problem of money \u2014 for example, with players allowing us to eat them after they have played our games, but alas, that\u2019s not how it works in our world.\nIt\u2019s true that Asylum is in advanced stages of production. The Hanwell Institute is virtually complete and fully explorable. The script and design have been ready for a long time, most characters have already been modeled, the Dagon engine is mature enough, and the programming is well under way\u2026 In a nutshell: Asylum will happen. But we need your help to make it happen sooner.\nMerely one floor of the Hanwell Mental Institute.\nYour contribution, even if it\u2019s one dollar, will help us tackle this final lap of development with a proper schedule and resources. Right now this is still a \"garage game\" with most team members dedicating time to the project as they can from their homes. If we reach the goal, we will lock ourselves inside an office for the remainder of the year until Asylum is complete. Being able to work together every day in the same room makes a huge difference, especially for such a large project. If you can\u2019t contribute by actually pledging money, spreading the word is more than enough: tweeting, liking on Facebook, just talking about it will also help.\nOh, stretch goals you say? Yes, we have them. We certainly do. And depending on the success of the campaign, we will start revealing them as soon as we approach our initial goal...\nNo publisher today would dare to produce an edition like this. But, we are not publishers, we are huge fans of adventures just like you (hopefully!), and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this delightful edition reminiscent of Infocom games, including the iconic flip cover and booklet attached to the box. In this case, the booklet will be our fancy Record Book of the Insane. This is a fictional look into the Hanwell Mental Institute, its past and present, including character profiles, newspaper cuts, testimonies, and the Register of Patients which can include your name if you pledge for one of our select rewards \u2014 all in glorious quality.\nDoes this bring back any memories? The cover artwork is subject to change, though. We haven't decided yet, but chances are we'll stick to a lovely hand-drawn painting...\nAlso, the box will include feelies. Yes, feelies! In the good old days, veterans used the word 'feelies' to describe quirky extras that were included inside game boxes. We\u2019re committed to producing a few of them, but we won\u2019t spoil the surprises. Just rest assured that you\u2019ll be getting more than just a box and DVD.\nThe Record Book will include all sorts of background information on the Hanwell Mental Institute and its patients, visitors, staff, etc.\nWe have no intention to deliver a big, bulky box whose sole purpose would be to occupy shelf space, but instead we're aiming for a neat, tidy and quality package (slightly nostalgic too!) that we\u2019re positive you\u2019re going to love.\nStretch goals have been announced! For more information about these, check out the updates The Dream-Quest of Stretch Goals and A haunting revelation of our final stretch goal...\nHere\u2019s some of the things you can get from us exclusively on this Kickstarter campaign. Boy, oh boy! Gorgeous T-shirts, beta access, signed boxes, the chance to become immortalized inside Hanwell from just your name to your very own cold and gritty cell, and so much more. A few pointers though, since we want to make things really simple: you buy the game, you get access to all versions. That\u2019s PC, Mac, and Linux, including the Steam key. Tiers with physical stuff include the worldwide shipping price. Any physical item will include its digital counterpart in all corresponding tiers (except the T-shirt, that is, because\u2026 really, what\u2019s the point).\nThe biggest entertainment ever to hit the LCD screen! It's amazing! It's scarifying! It's disgustipating! A Tour of Hanwell is an in-depth look into the making of Asylum and the team behind it.\nYour creations can be featured in the art room or workshop. Not creative enough? Then become a model pupil in the classroom!\nImpress your family and friends with the Senscape-approved Asylum T-shirt! Show to the world what a sane person you are!\nYour name can be added to the Register of Patients. This list corresponds with the actual cells available in the asylum, so you get a true \"virtual\" space that will exist forever!\nBecause we live in a visual era, we have prepared this lovely aid of what\u2019s included on each tier:\nWe offer you several options to stay in touch. Remember to also visit our forums and participate in a friendly and ever growing community of adventure game fans!\nWe would like to thank the invaluable assistance of Phoenix Online Studios in the creation of this Kickstarter campaign, especially Weldon Hathaway who is coordinating administrative tasks in the United States. These charming folks happen to be the developers of Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, and they could use some love on Steam Greenlight. You may also buy the first acclaimed episode of the series from their online store.\nThe H. P. Lovecraft painting used in the video was done by Dave Carson. Thank you Dave for creating one of the most lovely (and sinister) pieces related to Lovecraft we have seen! You can check out more works by him right over here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we've stated before, Asylum is in advanced stages of production (it better be after four years!). Then again, this is game development: it's complex, expensive, and takes time. Major studios often experience setbacks for their vastly popular, multimillion-dollar games; now imagine the challenges a small team with limited resources like ourselves must face...\n\nAsylum is a work of love and we're determined to make it one of the best horror adventures you'll ever play. Your contribution will allow us to remain independent and true to our vision. Sure, we may always face more delays, particularly as we adjust to work under new circumstances with a \"real\" budget, but we'll always be fully committed to the game and to you, its community. We're going to be constantly in touch and informing you about the status of this project, so that you feel you're part of the team.

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images. They can be found at higher resolution here:\n http://www.frontier.co.uk/elitedownloads/wallpapers/\n*All names must not be offensive, trademarks, or in any way problematic for us to include in the game, and must follow our naming guidelines.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStating the obvious, all projects, whether building a bridge, making a film, studying for an exam or whatever, carry risk. Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

Thanks to all of our backers for your support.\nEver wanted to play a tabletop roleplaying game or an MMO with friends but had trouble finding the time?  We sure have.  Work, school, family, even other hobbies: they all make it difficult to schedule hours-long regular gaming sessions.\n\nSince the alternatives we've tried are either clunky or lack the depth we're looking for, we decided to create an online multiplayer game that captured the experience of a tabletop RPG but didn't force you to schedule your life around it.  A game that would let you play for as long or short a time as you like, from any web-capable device, without sacrificing story or gameplay.\n\nThat's Conclave.\nWe've designed Conclave to have all our favorite aspects of multiplayer roleplaying games:\nCustomizable character archetypes with distinct playstyles\nParty-based cooperative play\nTactical turn-based combat\nGroup decision-making with real and varied consequences\nA compelling story in an original, fully-realized fantasy world\nA great aesthetic\nAt the same time, we've used technology to eliminate many of the hurdles and be respectful of your time:\nPlay from any device with a web browser: Because Conclave requires only HTML5 and JavaScript, you can play from just about anything with an internet connection: a desktop or laptop, an iPad or other tablet, even a smartphone.\nSeamlessly transition between synchronous and asynchronous play: If you're online at the same time as other players in your party, you can take turns in realtime; if not, you can take turns whenever you have a free moment, Words With Friends-style.\nReview what happened at any point in time: We save every action taken in the game on our servers so that you can catch up easily if you're away for a bit.  You can also review past events for hints on how to tackle current challenges.\nEasy party formation and communication: Invite your friends or visit the Adventurers Hall to find other players.  Each party has a persistent and private in-game chat, and the game will email updates when you're playing asynchronously.\nOf course we've introduced some twists of our own, too.  These include:\nParty voting: When your group faces a decision about how to approach a challenge, each player has a say.\nRenown: Characters receive Renown in addition to gaining levels as they complete quests.  The greater your Renown, the better the items that Conclave's powers-that-be will let you select from their Vault of Arms.  And unlike a gold-based shop, you can freely swap out equipment without losing anything in the exchange.\nNo turn order: As a group, you don't have to take your turns in a particular order; each of you can act whenever it's convenient (or strategic!) to do so.\nYou can see all these features in the beta version of the game, which you can try for yourself at playconclave.com.\nThe Campaign\nAll the quests in Conclave are part of a single campaign, which includes both the main story and a variety of side quests.  Parties can have up to 4 players, and challenges are scaled for either smaller (1-2 player) or larger (3-4 player) parties.  You don't need to complete the entire campaign with the same party, and you can join or drop from one at any time.  (Every quest can be played solo as well; having a party just adds to the fun!)\nIn addition, only one member of your party needs to have the campaign for your whole party to play it.  In other words, if you pledge at any tier that unlocks the campaign -- that's Vanguard and above -- up to three other players can play it with you.  They won't be able to lead their own parties, play solo, or receive the other rewards of a full license if they don't pledge, however.\nFor centuries the world of Orn has endured the Age of Retreat.  The once-great civilizations of the five races known collectively as the Kin have fallen one by one: some to heretical magics long thought extinguished, others to Wilderkin marauders of unnatural strength and cunning, and a few to betrayal from within.  Every year the wilds seem to encroach upon the boundary of civilization a little more.\n\nNow the remnants of the Kin have withdrawn to their last refuge, a land overlooked by their enemies and protected by the mysterious Aegis.  Forming an uneasy alliance as the Conclave, here they marshal their weapons, lore, and magics in the hope of turning back the Retreat.\nThe Races of the Kin\nNimble and gregarious, the nix change little as they age and are so pale that they're said to have one foot in the spirit world.\nThe strong-willed and urbane lumyn come in two forms: moon folk and sun folk.  The markings on their skin shift with their moods.\nBroad-shouldered and stoic, the forgeborn are known both for their craft at arms and for introducing Runecasting to the Kin.\nThe tall, hardy trow prefer the forests and mountains of the Conclave to its cities.  Though they seek harmony in nature, they are fierce when threatened.\nThe mezoar are natural chameleons, with scales that change color to match their surroundings.  They are very perceptive, a trait attributed to the vestige of a third eye above their brows.\nThe Archetypes\nBeacon: A natural leader, the Beacon inspires allies while striking foes from just beyond their reach.\nRogue: Sword and dagger in hand, the Rogue uses the chaos of the battlefield to sneak up on targets and strike.\nTrue Bow: Guided by True Sight, the True Bow knows where a target will be before it does.\nRunecaster: Master of the Runecasting Tradition, the Runecaster understands the fundamental language of magic and uses it to deadly effect.\nVanguard: Master of the mace and shield, the heavily armed and armored Vanguard strides to the front line, cutting a swath through all who stand in the way.\nWe first started working on Conclave nearly three years ago, but as the saying goes, it's the last 10% that's the hardest.  Up to this point our funding has come from our own pockets and from a few friends and family; we've completed everything mentioned above by being thrifty, but we need your backing to finish the features that will really make it sing.  Here's what the $75,000 we're asking for will fund between now and February:\nAt least 25 quests for the campaign: We've created beta versions of 13 quests and plan to expand those and add at least 12 more.  This will enable characters to advance to level 10 and let us tell much more of the story of Conclave's world.\nBetter graphics: We already have some wonderful character and battlemap art, but we'd like to add more animations, especially in combat.  We also plan to improve the look of the user interface.\nImproved party voting: We'd like to streamline the interface and add more significant and more varied consequences for your choices than are present in the beta.\nDiscoverable items: Characters can already select from dozens of items in the Vault of Arms.  We'd like to expand the variety of items and allow special ones to be discovered during quests.\nMore character customization: Conclave lets you select your race, archetype, gender, portrait, and equipment.  We also want to let you have more say in how your stats change and which special abilities you receive when you gain a level.\nSpeedier performance: We've got some server-side improvements planned that will make the game even more responsive.\nMusic: Sam Hulick of Mass Effect fame has already composed an amazing main track for us, titled \"Turn of the Age\".  You heard part of it in the video; now here's the whole track: \nWe - and he - would sure love it if we were able to pay him to produce the complete Conclave soundtrack.\nWe're offering a variety of rewards at different levels, but here's the first one you should be aware of: anyone who backs us for $10 or more gets the entire campaign of quests.  We\u2019re bucking the free-to-play trend with a simple, old-school model: pay once, get everything.  No need to pay extra for healing potions or to unlock special races and classes; no subscriptions or time limits, either.  We think Conclave will be worth more than $10 when it's finished, but we want to reward those of you willing to support us now.\nSome rewards merit more explanation than we could fit into the sidebar.  (If you haven't looked at that sidebar, please do that now!)\nIf you choose the Guildmaster tier ($40), you'll have the option of creating your own guild within Conclave.  As a guild owner, you'll be able to name it, associate a unique insignia with it, and decide who can join up.  Guild members will be able to use their own guildhouse with a private chat area, and will be marked as part of your guild in all public areas.  Just as with party chat, guild chat will persist from visit to visit, so you'll be able to read messages from other guild members even if they are not online at the same time as you.  You'll also be able to see whenever another member of your guild is online, and forming parties with other guildmembers will be a snap.  We have other plans for guilds down the road too, including some inter-guild competitions.\nThe Spireguard tier ($50) earns you every expansion we add to Conclave, ever.  That includes not only any expansion content earned through stretch goals, but also additional content we add down the road.  Please note that it does not grant you four Vanguard-style Conclave licenses as well.  (Sorry for any confusion there; we are working with Kickstarter to let us edit the Spireguard text to be clearer about its relationship to other reward levels.)\nAs a Councilor ($100), you join the select group of people with whom we'll consult regularly as we expand the game: the Conclave Inner Council.  Whether it's new features or new content, you'll get previews first, and get to playtest the latest-and-greatest before it gets released publicly.  More broadly, you'll be helping to shape the direction Conclave takes.\nThe Runesmith tier ($200) earns you a chance to name a character, place, or artifact within the Conclave world.  This is a character players will meet, a place they'll visit, or an artifact they'll wield.  We take the integrity of Conclave's story and flavor seriously, so please understand that problematic names will get rejected.  (You'll still have the chance to provide an alternative.)\nAt the Alchemist tier ($500), you can select one of these original paintings, done by Chris Rahn, to be your very own:\nMost of the paintings are 5\"x5\"; the first two are exceptions, at 4\"x4\".  Painting choice is on a first come, first served basis; when you pledge, please indicate the painting you want.  Contact us if you would like more detail on the paintings, including higher resolution images.\nIf you pledge at the Spiritcrafter tier ($1000), Chris will paint a unique portrait that you, and only you, can use within the game.  You'll also receive the original artwork to hang in your home.  This will be a 5\"x5\" portrait of the same quality as the ones depicted above.  10x10 Room will retain the digital rights to the portrait.\nThis is an example of Chris's work in progress.  We'll work with you to describe the character you have in mind to Chris, and make sure your vision becomes a reality.\nShould you be so awesome as to pledge at the Eidolon tier ($5000), we'll fly you out to either Miami or Boston -- your choice -- and put you up in a nice hotel for the day.  (Nick lives in Miami, Derek in Boston.)  We'll meet up with you there, show you the sights, enjoy some grub.  When you're ready, we'll sit down with you and sketch out the Conclave quest of your dreams.  Perhaps you want explore the Pillars of the Eidolons or battle the Heresiarch in the frozen wastes of Charn; maybe you wish to adventure in the Dreaming, or test the heroes with the temptations of Heresy.  Whatever you imagine, we'll work with you to make it fit Conclave's world and add it to the game (subject to the constraints of the game engine).  Your ideas will be immortalized in Conclave's story!\nFinally, we'd like to recognize the backers at all tiers who do the most to spread the word about Conclave (without spamming, of course).  If you write a review, do a podcast, or otherwise share the game with a wider audience,  let us know.  We might grant you a special in-game Herald honor.\nIf we surpass our initial goal, there's a lot more we'll do:\nAll players -- anyone who pledges at the Vanguard tier ($10) and up -- will have access to any additional archetypes we develop.  Anyone who pledges at the Spireguard tier ($50) and up will receive any expansion quests and Exploration Mode on top of all other rewards.\n10x10 Room is made up of two full-time designer/developers, but we have help from a number of other sources to create Conclave.\nIntroduced to Dungeons & Dragons at age 6, Nick Branstator ate up the experience and never looked back. Teenage success getting published by the Car Wars game was his first hint that game creation could become a profession. From 1996 to 2010, Nick worked in the web industry, serving as Co-Director of one of Lycos\u2019s business units, then taking on the Chief Technical Officer and Chief Operating Officer roles for VoodooVox, and Director of Product Marketing for Scrapblog. A job offer to be a game developer at Wizards of the Coast nearly stole him away from the internet world in 2005, and set the wheels in motion for his transition to full-time web game development as part of 10x10 Room. Nick also has a card game, NIMBY, currently slated for publishing in 2013 by Cambridge Games Factory.\nDerek Bruneau began developing homebrew video games when he was 13. His early creations included an original text adventure called The Druid for the Commodore 64 and a clone of the classic game Wizardry for the Apple IIe. In college he studied creative writing, history, and math while designing and illustrating adventures for weekly tabletop RPG sessions with friends. Before making game development his full-time job, he spent several years as a Senior Director of software development and design teams at the web companies Tripod and Lycos.  At 10x10 Room he enjoys drawing upon his varied expertise in game development, software engineering, and UI design all at once.\nBesides Nick and Derek, here are the three other people whose work you'll most notice in Conclave:\nSam Hulick is a BAFTA award nominated and multiple award-winning composer, best known for creating the signature music for BioWare\u2019s epic sci-fi franchise MASS EFFECT and the dramatic score for Tripwire Interactive\u2019s groundbreaking RED ORCHESTRA 2: HEROES OF STALINGRAD. With a penchant for injecting powerful emotions and memorable themes, Sam\u2019s original scores range from sweeping sci-fi and orchestral bombast to fantasy landscapes.\nChristopher Rahn was born in San Francisco and raised in eastern Washington state.  From an early age he was encouraged to pursue his interest in drawing and painting the strange and impossible.  At the age of seventeen he returned to San Francisco to attend the Academy of Art where he earned his BFA in Illustration and studied under such titans of illustration as Kazu Sano, Chuck Pyle and Stephen Player.  Since leaving school Chris has worked with a wide variety of clients including Wizards of the Coast, Discovery Channel Magazine and the Village Voice, and has had work exhibited at the New York Society of Illustrators.\nDevin Night has been a gamer for close to 30 years.  After attending the Columbus College of Art and Design, he began doing freelance work, coming to focus on token illustrations for roleplaying games.  Some of his clients include Rite Publishing, Level 99 Games, En World Publishing, Table Top Forge, Headless Hydra Games, Profantasy, and Gamewick Games.\nWe've also received contributions and advice from many other folks, most notably Justin Houk and Samantha Natalie.\nThanks!\nThanks for the taking the time to look at our Kickstarter.

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults. Continue to spread the word about Project Eternity, and let's see how big we can make The Endless Paths!\nWe're also pleased to announce we're supporting the Kicking It Forward initiative.\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

The world was named Tenra, and the game was named Tenra Bansho, or \"Everything in Heaven and Earth\". With a rulebook dripping cover-to-cover with high quality anime-style art, a setting rich in culture both real and fantastical, and a revised and simplified rules system that focused with precision on roleplaying and character drama, this game took the Japanese tabletop RPG market by storm and spearheaded both a renaissance and revolution in the Japanese gaming industry.\nYears later, this unique and revolutionary game has finally been painstakingly translated into English for play in the West.\nTenra Bansho Zero is a tabletop roleplaying experience, and it features:\n* Over 300 unique pieces of art spread throughout the game, 33 full color manga story pages showing off the world and setting features, and ten rules explanations in manga form for fast retention. The art is done by the formidable hand of Junichi Inoue, the fine brush-work of Hiroyuki Ishida, the comical impact of Hayami Rasenjin, and more! WIth layout for the English edition by industry expert Luke Crane (Mouse Guard RPG, Burning Wheel RPG), you've never seen a game like this.\n* Two books, almost 700 pages: A full-color Setting book and a black-and-white Rules and Play book. The books are sturdy softcover in an American comic book size factor, come shipped together in a hard slip-case, and together boast a page count of almost 700 total pages! The huge amount of art, combined with the detailed deep-dive explanations and play advice, will give you your money's worth in usable content. A video flip-through of the English books is here.\n* A rich Japanese setting involving a planet in a constant state of war, where magic fuels technology and the culture is an analogue of the Warring States (Sengoku) era of Japan. Mecha, sorcery, samurai, geisha, Buddhist monks, cyborgs, annelid-users and more make this game a truly unique--and deeply culturally Japanese--experience. See the Game section below for more details!\n* A simple-to-understand rules system utilizing regular six-sided dice, cleverly explained in both detailed text examples and amusing full-page manga art. On top of a system of skills, attributes, action and combat is overlaid a deeper system of kabuki theater-style play: Focusing very specifically on play through Acts, Scenes, and Intermissions, the players of this game are both the actors and audience. As actors, they focus on role-play in a scene with other actors. As audience (much like the audience of a kabuki play), they focus on the drama that unfolds, rewarding the players for dramatic actions and cool ad-libbed lines. \n* Speed: An entire campaign, a story from start to finish, can be told over the space of one to two sessions! You can then choose to play the same characters in another tale, or perhaps retire them to look at another facet of life on Tenra.\n* All-in-One: The original Japanese game had a core rulebook, a supplement, and later several mail-order only mini-supplements. The data/rules contents and much of the art has been ported and folded into the English book set (originally $145 USD for all of that material if you were to buy it as it came out), including errata and designer suggestions. This is a truly updated version of the game!\nWe've beaten every single stretch goal in our path, including the FINAL GOALS at $80,000!

Please add $15 for international orders (it's an incredible cost to me, so I ask very little).\nOur original goal was to print 2,000 copies of Tenra Bansho Zero and put them into distribution globally so that people will be able to buy it from their local book, game, comic or anime goods store. I now have enough money to print several thousand copies more than my original goal, and produce quality DLC and stretch goal rewards!\nTenra Bansho Zero was written by famous manga artist, game developer and geek cultural icon Jun'ichi Inoue. He started early in the industry writing Japanese language supplements for American games, and later began designing (both in writing text and drawing art) some of the most popular and revolutionary tabletop RPGs to be released in Japan: Tenra Bansho Zero, Alshard (an easy-to-learn Final Fantasy-esque game set in a world of Norse mythos), Beast Bind (half-demon warriors fight threats to humanity), Tera the Gunslinger (A wild west steampunk game using a playing card system), Angel Gear (an alternate history game where the few remaining children in the world pilot mecha to destroy invading angelic beings) and several more. Not only did he design the settings, he also hand-drew most of the core art and covers for each project himself. He has also designed the concept art and settings for several Japanese computer game projects, as well as created a line of collectible figurines.\nInoue-san is more recently famous for his published manga comic series, \"Chuugoku Yome Nikki: A Chinese Wife and an Otaku Husband\", an autobiographical work from his own life. His website sees over 60,000 views a day, and his books were #1 at Amazon Japan the week of their release. His work on Tenra Bansho Zero and other games made him a household name in otaku circles, and his popularity grows through his recent manga work. \nI'm Andy Kitkowski, a part-time Japanese professional translator and interpreter (full time \"computer guy\"), and hardcore gaming hobby enthusiast. I've created a number of community-building projects like the Story Games gaming discussion website (www.story-games.com), an RPG award system for small press RPGs (the Indie RPG Awards www.rpg-awards.com), and a blog for discussing Japanese RPG developments (www.j-rpg.com); and shepherded projects like the Iron Game Chef game design competition and the 24 Hour RPG game development project.\nI've also produced and localized the first ever Japanese RPG released in English (though historically the second licensed, after Tenra Bansho): The anime comedy RPG Maid: The Role-Playing Game with primary translator Ewen Cluney. This game served as not only an opening salvo of Japanese games into English, but also as a complete test run from concept to post-sales for the eventual release of Tenra Bansho Zero, so that we could avoid pitfalls in the development and release of the game.\nMy background in and obsession with the Japanese language comes from 18 years of academic and self study, and I have lived in Japan for over five years. My translation focus has been on computer engineering, Buddhist texts, Japanese linguistics and culture, having translated and interpreted at places as varied as Fortune 100 IT companies to NPOs to universities to anime conventions.\nThe World of Tenra\nThe land of Tenra has been in a state of constant war for over 400 years, with no end in sight. The core of the setting of the game can be found in the larger-than-life characters who populate it:\n* Mecha called \"Armours\" are piloted by innocent children of regional lords.\n* Warriors with energy-producing gems embedded in their flesh called Samurai who have traded their humanity for the ability to spontaneously gain muscle, power and speed (think \"The Incredible Hulk with a katana\").\n* Aloof Taoist sorcerers called Onmyoji use abacus-computer to summon and bind demonic shiki spirits to exert their will. \n* Buddhist monks of three major and differing sects--there is not one single form of Buddhism, but three--vie for the hearts of the people, all with philosophies claiming to lead to salvation. Some have developed incredible hand-to-hand combat art to support the people.\n* Phenomenally beautiful and cultured geisha-like Kugutsu (mannequins) are crafted from spirit-trees as pieces of art for the rich and powerful, but secretly yearn to become human.\n* Shinobi strike from the shadows with incredible Ninjutsu abilities, living and dying for the service of their clans.\n* Machine-human Kijin have traded in their flesh--and souls--for cold, powerful steel. \n* The horned, psychic Oni are the native people of Tenra--feared and hunted by humans--who share a deep connection to the earth and each other. \n* Kongohki are peerless killing robots, powered by the amnesiac spirit of a tormented soul. \n* Annelidists serve as healers, and have bodies filled with symbiotic native worm-like lifeforms that protect them from harm and strike down their enemies. \n* Secretive Shinto Agents control the world from the shadows with their meikyo mirror-disks, keeping nation fighting nation for a mysterious cause.\n* Mysterious Ayakashi, creatures of spirit straight out of Japanese folklore and myth.\nThese are the characters that emerge in a game of Tenra Bansho Zero--the characters that the players develop and bring to life through play--and they have the power to change the world.\nBeyond that, there is no metaplot or long histories to memorize, no atlases or overly defined cities to remember: The intention was for each group to create and explore their own created version of the setting. A compelling game campaign frame--a sample setting to help get you started, written by gaming industry luminary TS Luikart--is included in the rulebook: It features fascinating characters, locations, and events to help you start your adventures in the exciting world of Tenra!\nThe Game System\nThe core rules of Tenra Bansho are easy for people new to role-playing to be able to pick and up and play with their friends, even if you've never played another role-playing game before!\nThe game uses a simple mechanic involving six-sided dice in order for characters to do things, from leaping up the side of a river fortress, to seducing a hard-hearted domain lord, to engaging in a swordfight with twelve ninja. A suite of attributes (the number of six-sided dice you roll), skills (determine your threshold for success) and special abilities determine what your character can do.\nCombat happens, and it happens fast: Unlike other games, you get to effectively choose if and when your character dies, at a time that is right for you. And the more wounds your character takes, the more powerful you (or your enemies!) become: \"This... is my FINAL FORM!\" Combat is simple, story-focused and exciting!\nThe Zero system of the game's namesake rewards dramatic role-playing: Skilled players are rewarded when they push themselves harder, and new players unfamiliar with role-playing are rewarded as they learn to come out of their shell and engage with their characters more. These rewards are much like the audience shouts and yelps at a traditional kabuki theater experience (very unlike western theater: A kabuki audience shouts encouragement at the actors as they hit dramatic lines and poses!). This reward is called \"Aiki\", or \"Harmony/Meeting of Spirit\". It later turns into \"Kiai\" or \"Martial Power\", which is spent to accomplish incredible epic anime-like feats: defeat much more powerful enemies, accomplish impossible feats, etc.\nThe game carries the metaphor of a kabuki stage play into the actual game itself, with very structured Openings, Acts, Scenes, and Intermissions. In the intermissions there are even \"Previews\" of the next act, much like there are previews of the next episode at the end of an anime!\nFinally, the system has within it a Japanese cycle of Buddhist Karma: The more of this Kiai you spend to accomplish incredible feats, the more Karma you gain. Once your character reaches 108 Karma (the number of Buddhist sins) you are at risk of becoming an Asura, a lost soul who looks to destroy everything she loved.\nAll in all, the game is rich with Japanese culture, all the way down to its core rules of play.\nPlease see the Tenra Bansho Zero website for more details on the game and  system: http://www.tenra-rpg.com\nThe Tenra Bansho Zero Game: Two Books and a Slipcase\nAs mentioned above, the game is divided into two softcover American comic-sized books in a hard slipcase, totaling 690 pages between the two books (well over 280,000 words) packed cover to cover with over 300 distinct pieces of art. \nThe first book is the Setting book, and through 33 pages of full-color manga illustration, it introduces you visually to the vast world of Tenra and its characters. After that, the setting is further introduced through chapters detailing the world, society, culture, characters, and threats, combined with a flood of inspiring visual art to help you identify with the setting.\nThe second book is the Rule book, and it covers all the rules of making characters, engaging with the world and interacting with the other characters, rules and advice for organizing and running game sessions and the like. It also includes elements specifically created for the English release of the game, including:\n* A complete sample setting, written to help you immediately start playing the game, as well as to give you an example of how to make your own setting.\n* An extended glossary of all the Japanese and unusual terms used in the game, including pronunciation.\n* A list of inspirational media (including movies and games) to help you get into the feel of Tenra.\n* An exhaustive list of advice both for players and game masters, from the simple to the advanced: All advice gathered through years of playtesting.\n* A quick example of how to explain the world of Tenra to new players.\n* A list of 222 things that people would do in cities, towns, on the road, at a temple, etc for role-play ideas.\n* And a very long name list, to use when selecting authentic-sounding names of characters and places. Don't be stymied when creating background characters, from poetic Buddhist Monk or Kongohki names, to commoner or aristocrat names. \nHowever, don't feel lost by the size of the game! When I hear that a tabletop game has something like \"over 650 pages\", I normally think that it's too much content, and too hard to pick up and play! Not true with Tenra Bansho Zero: The page count is mostly due to the comic size form factor and the sheer space that all the gorgeous art consumes. The 30+ pages of color introduction break down the world simply and can be read and digested in minutes. Several full-page manga in the rulebook explain the game system from top to bottom again in minutes. The content required to play takes only 30-60 minutes to read! \nEverything else beyond that core is simply \"MORE\": More optional rules, more advice for players and gamemasters, more content for people not familiar with Japan or who haven't grown up watching Japanese TV, more notes about Japanese culture in relation to Tenra, more elements there to use if you want and ignore if you do not. The deeper you go, the more you are provided with so much, much more support.\nThe Translation\nI have read a lot of original Japanese manga and then read the English translation (and the same with anime), enough to be disappointed at large with the amount of corners cut, cultural information lost, in the anime and manga industry as a whole. For the Tenra Bansho project, I made sure to do two things in the translation and localization process:\n* Make the game as easy-to-read as possible.\n* Yet do not lose the tone, nuance or feel of the original Japanese text.\nIn other words, I didn't simply whitewash the content, removing cultural references and nuances (to complete the translation faster), or simplify it in order to make it more palatable to a generic Western audience: I chose the hard, long road of doing more work in order to make sure the text reached a perfect balance of the poetry and nuance of the original (including leaving in a series of poetic chapter introductions, leaving in some wonderful and skilled Japanese calligraphy art rather than simply over-writing it, leaving many terms in Japanese rather than rewriting them in pure English (while being careful that there weren't too many Japanese words to make the text difficult) and leaving in a rare touch of Japanese grammatical choices--choices that are usually not made in English.\nI truly believe that these choices and the incredible amount of time involved led to a richer text, and I want to share that text with you!\nEvery dollar helps! I'm trying to form a small hobby company with friends to bring over more Japanese tabletop games into English. If you like anime/manga-style art, or just are supportive of these kinds of multicultural efforts, please donate some money. Every little bit you donate--or donate over the set reward levels--makes more translations in the future a distinct possibility!\nYou can see there's several tiers of reward. The core rewards are the PDF levels and the Book levels.\nComputer/IOS desktop backgorunds: Using the art from the game, most backing levels will get access to a small collection of desktop wallpapers of various backgrounds utilizing the original Tenra Bansho art. These will be available before the physical book has arrived.\nThe PDF level is an electronic copy of each book, in PDF format with high visual quality. I will also be producing a \"text only\" version for readability and the visually impaired. A pre-release copy of the PDF will be available soon after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, with final versions available when the book is released.\nThe Physical Book levels are just that: A set of Tenra Bansho Zero books consists of one copy of the Setting Book, one copy of the Rule Book, and the decorative sleeve that holds both books together. All purchasers of the physical book will also receive a PDF as well. The book set is rather heavy, so I am taking a hit by offering free shipping in the US and Canada, and heavily subsidized shipping to the rest of the world, but we are that committed to this project! The book is scheduled to be released three months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nOther reward levels include:\n\"Downloadable Content/DLC\" - Future supplements for Tenra Bansho Zero will mostly be in an easy-to-download an print micro-supplement format of 10-20 pages of optional rules and content. DLC will be available within approximately half a year after the release of the book for a few dollars apiece. Plans currently include:\n* Extra Archetypes/Character Classes: A collection of four new character types and illustrations, including the Half-Ayakashi, the combat focused Stand-User, the Ninja Robot Dog, and the Gunslinger From The West\n* WAR - Mass Combat Rules: A collection of rules focused on a long war session, including the simple tracking of army strengths, as well as a table of long-term battlefield and seasonal events. It will also feature strategies, tips and ideas for the implementation of these rules in your short or long-term game. \nThe Director's Cut: In the process (and long years) or translation and localization, a number of interesting stories developed: Stories about how I came across the game, the difficulties of translation, interesting cultural quirks and points that caused difficulty or amusement, the list of changes from the original Japanese version to the English version, general stories about life and work in Japan, and so on. Since enough people found those stories interesting, \nI've developed a \"Director's Cut\" book of 30+ pages and counting (including comics; plus anime art and mecha illustrations from artist and technical illustrator Steve Yap), a collection of stories about the development of the game. If you ever wanted to know the background of a game you bought, this is it. If the game Tenra Bansho Zero was a movie, this book would be the director's commentary audio track relaying the behind-the-scenes stories about the game. This will be available around the time of the release of the book.\nThe Ruined Empire: A complete campaign setting frame from RPG artist and blogger Anna Kreider. The Ruined Empire is a setting of five nations in conflict, ripe with adventure and danger. It has a Final Fantasy-esque feel, a mind to social issues, and serves as a great idea-rich jumping off point to running your own games. This will be available shortly after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nDice: The higher levels feature a set of Japanese Kanji Dice to play the game (one player needs about 10 dice initially to play), each die featuring the kanji (Chinese pictographs) of 1-6 instead of the numbers. You can \"buy up\" more sets of dice, at the cost of $6 for 10 dice (includes shipping). Higher levels come with a set of two color casino dice to use with the Emotion Matrix.\nTraditional Japanese Furoshiki Wrapping Cloth: I went all out here on my last trip to Japan. Being an addict of traditional Japanese textiles, I went to the manufacturer of handmade furoshiki wrapping cloths and ordered a huge collection of 90cm x 90cm cloths (huge!) in several different gorgeous patterns and styles. They are the perfect way to wrap up the books, dice, sheets and other materials for easy (and fashionable) transport!\nFoam Aiki Chits: Normally you can use poker chips, coins, slips of paper or the like for the aiki chit \"audience award\" rules, but I ordered a collection of Tenra-labeled giant foam poker chips for the higher-end level reward. They make excellent visual and tactile markers. What better way to reward a player for roleplaying than throwing a foam shuriken-like token at them? They're quite expensive, but I'm swallowing most of the cost of shipping.\nHere's a video demonstrating the physical rewards: Dice, Wrapping Cloth, Chips and TBZ Visual Guide.\n* The game is complete and ready to go: I've already gotten print proofs! This project is not at the start of the game development lifecycle (playtesting, writing, editing, proofing, printing, etc), it's at its very end. All of the major work has already been done. This kickstarter is not a promise to the eventual creation of the project, it's a promise to get it into your hand as fast as they can be printed in asia and brought to the US. Once this Kickstarter project ends, if it is funded, it will almost immediately go to our selected printer after one last round of editing. From there, we have been told that it is about a 60-90 day turnaround to arrival in the US. We see how other projects have been held up in printing/transport, so we padded the project by a few months (\"December\") just in case.\nBut know that all the heavy lifting is done: If this project gets funded, the already complete print-ready PDF goes to the printer soon after for production.\n* Everyone involved has been paid! I've seen game projects where \"paying the contributors\" becomes something optional, or something that only happens after the break-even/\"turn a profit\" point. For Tenra, all my assistant translators, editors, and contributors have not only been paid in full, but many of them have received bonuses for delivering their work ahead of their deadlines. I've heard horror stories about the industry and freelancers, and have refused to prey on people. There's blood, sweat and tears in this book, and all of it was fully compensated.\n* I support local retailers, book, comic and game stores! If you own or manage such a store, and are interested in supporting this project in return for 4-8 copies of the game to resell locally (no more, as per Kickstarter's rules on mass distribution), please contact me and I'll work out a pricing that works for both of us!\n* I support \"Kicking It Forward\". I've been a Kickstarter contributor for years (click on my name to see what I've backed!), and definitely intend to put 5% of my profits back into the excellent system of peer patronage that Kickstarter has brought us.

I hope so.  If not, please look it up.  If you\u2019re aware of it, at all, in any capacity other than old Science Fiction, then it is a safe bet that my talented team at LiftPort was somewhere in the background. You see, we\u2019ve been catalyzing and coordinating the commercial development of the Space Elevator for over nine years.   I was personally involved with NASA\u2019s 2001-2003 definitive research study.  My company, LiftPort, grew out of the results of that study. Between 2003-2005 we researched Carbon NanoTubes (the strongest material in the world) \u2013 and we were not very good at it... \nSpace Elevator Rising Over the Ocean\nHowever between 2004-2007 we got really good at building robots that climb into the sky. (More on that in a moment.) At our height we had about 60 university research partners, and somewhere between 800-1000 volunteers working on different aspects of the project. But then, in 2007, when the economy crashed, LiftPort got crushed. (Video at 3:15) We closed the company and our team went into hibernation. And now it is time to awaken! \nThis Kickstarter campaign marks the public return of LiftPort Group!\nWhere We\u2019re Headed\nEarth\u2019s Space Elevator\n     -  A Long Way Off\nUltimately where we are headed is \u2013 as my friend often repeats \u2013 \u201cto get off this rock\u201d. (3rd video, at 3:10)  Ultimately, we are going to build an Elevator that climbs into the sky\u2026 an Elevator that takes humanity from \u201cthis rock\u201d, en masse, to space!   But that is a long way off. Perhaps 20-25 years. Before that happens there are some vital interim steps.\n     -  Technology Derived From this Research\nEveryone reading this message \u2013 using a computer over the Internet \u2013 in one way or another is a descendant of the Apollo era. We have all had our lives made better by the advanced technology that is created \u2013 all the time \u2013 as a by-product of going to space. At LiftPort, we hope to do the same thing; to make living on Earth better, by going to space. We call ourselves an \u201cIdea Factory\u201d because the breakthroughs that we need for our beloved Elevator will also have practical \u2018down-to-Earth\u2019 applications \u2013 just like Apollo did.\n\n     -  LiftPort.com\nOur (brand new) website has tons of resources for you to review: technical documents, images of our team building the future, and lots of other stuff. Whether you choose to support our campaign or not, we\u2019d love to have your participation on the site: www.liftport.com. Or join as a member, and get involved in the conversation, add to the wiki or simply ask questions. \n\nLunar Space Elevator Infrastructure\nFeasibility Study - This is Where We're Going\nBefore we can build Earth\u2019s Elevator, we\u2019ll need to build one on the Moon. It is significantly easier, and much much cheaper. Importantly - we can build it with current technology \u2013 in about eight years.\nTo meet our target date, we need to complete a 1-year Feasibility Study, beginning next year. That will cost $3M. I don\u2019t expect to raise that through this Kickstarter campaign. But I\u2019m throwing it out there so you know what\u2019s ahead for this program. (But if you\u2019re feeling generous \u2013 surprise me! All kidding aside, if you think the rewards we\u2019ve got for Kickstarter are good, you should talk to us about the \u2018rewards\u2019 if you fund our Study!)\nThis Lunar Elevator is a new effort. It is part of LiftPort's revival program. This system can be built now, while Earth\u2019s Elevator requires several more breakthroughs. We think we should focus on building this Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure  (LSEI or \u201cElsie\u201d) as a prerequisite to the main goal.\n Project Description \nTethered Towers\n     -  How Relevant?\nSo if the Lunar Elevator is a precursor technology to Earth\u2019s Elevator, then our proposed Kickstarter campaign of Tethered Towers is a precursor to the Lunar Elevator.\nThat\u2019s where you come in!\n     -  What we want to do is:\nBuild a robot that can climb 2 kilometers straight up. \nBuild a test platform of high-altitude balloons - tethered to the ground.\nOur Robot (which you can NAME) will climb the test platform \u2013 and set a world record.\nLet the world know that we didn\u2019t quit, give up, or fail\u2026 we just had to \u2018pause\u2019 for a while.\nRebuild our connection with the global community of supporters.\nRaise a little money to cover the cost of this specific experiment.\n\n\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, my team already climbed 1 mile, 6 years ago. At 2 kilometers, this proposed experiment is only a quarter mile farther\u2026 But most of my team at LiftPort 2.0 are new.  The folks from LiftPort 1.0 moved on to other projects.  I\u2019m bringing in several of the experienced guys to help transfer knowledge to our new team.  We\u2019re \u2018passing the torch\u2019 if you will.  This is a critical milestone in our development as an organization. \nOnce we\u2019ve done that, the new team can reach ever higher. (See our Stretch Goals at the bottom of the page.)\nI wanted our Group to hit a new altitude record, right out of the gate.  But I didn\u2019t want to push the team too far.  I feel confident that we can achieve this goal.  Afterwards, an altitude of 3-5 km is reachable.  It becomes substantially more difficult with greater altitude. Cold is a real problem: lubricants freeze, motors seize and materials become brittle, fast.  Depending on our starting location, its base altitude, time of year, and cumulative altitude, temperatures can easily drop into double-digit negative numbers\u2026 and robots don\u2019t like that.  Add in weather effects and things get complicated, fast.\nSo the plan is to first build the \u2018bot, then an indoor test rig.  Imagine a vertical treadmill; our little robot can climb and climb and climb, and still get nowhere. (Do ya feel like that some days?) Once we\u2019re satisfied with its performance, then we build out the Tethered Towers test platform of helium balloons held to the ground with a Ribbon.  We can pre-test this up to 200ft without causing a ruckus at the Federal Aviation Administration.  Any further, and we need airspace clearances from the FAA, Air Force and Navy.  We\u2019ve done this 14 times, so we are not worried about that aspect.  Once the regulators give us the dates, locations and clear skies, then we aim for the record books...  a (temporary) man-made structure that is 2km tall \u2013 and a robot that can climb it!\n     -  Communication / Observation\nBeyond its usefulness as a Space Elevator test platform and an interesting experiment, does this system have any practical value in the real world?\nWe\u2019re glad you asked that.  The answer is yes!  Radio frequency communications are all based on \u2018line-of-sight\u2019.  Which means the farther you can see, the farther you can communicate (within the limits of sending and receiving power).  That is why cell towers and TV broadcast towers are constructed on hills, mountains and tall buildings.  Every vertical foot matters.  The system we\u2019ve designed can be used for communications in remote villages, to monitor crops for efficient harvesting, early warning for forest fires, perimeter security or to provide wireless internet to a campus.  (Did you see the \u201cKony 2012\u201d videos?  I\u2019ve just started an email conversation about how we might provide an early warning system to those in need.)\n     -  Emergency Support System\nDuring a natural disaster, communication infrastructures are overwhelmed.  The people that need comms\u2019 the most \u2013 aid workers \u2013 don\u2019t have it.  But our system can be deployed in 2 hours from the time our boots hit the ground.  Speed matters.  We think we can save lives.  We can use our \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 to provided camera support, to scan through infrared and detect human heat signatures in the rubble \u2013 and connect the nearest responder to the nearest victim.  Tethered Towers can provided vital support to the brave folks trying to help.\n     - For the Fun of It\nFinally, perhaps we can raise your adrenaline level?  What if you could use our balloons and robot to calmly, gently and quietly float into the sky, and then parachute jump from the top?  Every time we\u2019ve conducted an experiment with our Tethered Towers, we\u2019ve gotten emails from folks that wanted to jump\u2026\nWhy \"only\" $8000?\nWe\u2019ve gotten critiques from our friends that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking for enough\u2026\u201d  The (usually unspoken) implication being that \u201cif you\u2019re really serious about building an Elevator on the Moon, why are you only asking for $8,000?\u201d\nWe made this financial decision for a reason.  Sure, there are many things we can do (will do) that will take a lot more cash\u2026 But that\u2019s not the point of this \u2013 specific \u2013 campaign.  The goal of this Kickstarter event is to rebuild our community.  We will launch another campaign; and another, and another and another.  Over time, after some successes and after we\u2019ve rebuilt trust that our company can do what it says it can do, we\u2019ll raise our financial targets.\nI realize that the point of most Kickstarter projects is to raise money.  Trust me, I get it.  And I do want you to commit cash to our campaign.  Let me restate that \u2013 I want to trade your capital for our goods and services.  This is not a \u2018donation\u2019, but a transaction.  I think that sometimes people misunderstand what Kickstarter is all about. \nI did some pretty deep analysis on the top 39 Kickstarter campaigns. (Ask me about this.)  I looked at the top three campaigns over Kickstarter\u2019s 13 categories.  One detail I learned is this: that 2/3rds of the folks that contribute to a campaign give less than $51 and that that total only amounts to 12% of the funds raised. What this tells me, is that while the media and hype points toward Kickstarter as being a fundraising tool \u2013 Kickstarter\u2019s most important value lies in coordinating and confirming a community of supporters. \nAnd that\u2019s what we need now.  We need you!\nWe feel it is much more important to re-connect with our supporters.  We\u2019ve been out of business for 5 years \u2013 but we didn\u2019t quit!  We\u2019re using this (first!) Kickstarter campaign to let people know that we\u2019re back and we\u2019ve got a new and better plan. \nAs for the cost of our experiment, my team is volunteering so labor is not a factor (yet).  We\u2019re really just talking about purchasing new hardware for the system.  We already know how to build the robot \u2013 this will be our 20th.  We already know how to build the Tethered Tower \u2013 this will be our 15th.  But all of our equipment is 5+ years old and both for safety reasons and because technology has advanced, we think it\u2019s important to start fresh.  Also, because I\u2019m trying to do a \u2018brain-dump\u2019 from the LiftPort 1.0 team to the LiftPort 2.0 team, I want the 2.0 team to get their hands dirty building stuff. \nPart of the LiftPort 1.0 Team.\nAlex, doing emergency field-repairs to the 'bot \"Damocles\".\nWe are going to have multiple Kickstarter campaigns.  In the future, we\u2019re going to raise more money for specific programs \u2013 sub-projects that are within the scope of the penultimate goal: an Elevator in the Sky!  But for the first experiment since our recent restart, I felt it was better to not target \u2018cash\u2019; but to target \u2018community\u2019 instead.  I\u2019m certain the financial support will come\u2026 but I missed you guys.  Really.  And no, I don\u2019t expect to raise $800M for the Lunar Elevator through Kickstarter, but if we raised the $3M for the Feasibility Study I\u2019d probably lose my mind!\nThere is a time and place to ask for a lot of money, but this first Kickstarter campaign isn\u2019t it.  Still, I\u2019d be very grateful of we went substantially over our Kickstarter minimum.  I hope we do. \nWhat We\u2019re Doing for this Campaign\nWhat We'll Do - For as Long as it Takes\n     -  So what will we do with the money?\nThis is not a very expensive experiment; that\u2019s why we chose it first.  To push an analogy too far \u2013 It\u2019s low-hanging fruit; but it\u2019s the tree we\u2019re after!  So it seemed like a good place to start.  It is hardware focused and that\u2019s very important to our team.  It\u2019s achievable within our current resources of people and time.\nThe robot is time consuming and somewhat complicated.  There have been advancements in all sorts of relevant technologies in the past five years.  Motors are lighter and stronger, batteries perform better, and computing and communications are much much simpler.  To put that in perspective, we used to have to build our radios and computer boards from scratch, and hope they worked.  Now, we can simply order them from a parts catalog!  In contrast, the Tethered Tower balloon test platform has not changed much.  She\u2019s still a temperamental little beastie\u2026  But so long as the weather cooperates, I\u2019m not anticipating any serious problems with that infrastructure. \nSpecifically, we\u2019ll build a robot, and climb a string into the sky.  We\u2019ll reach as high as we can, safely, and collect all sorts of data.  If we raise more, we\u2019ll do more.  If we go beyond our $8000 goal, we can add all sorts of stuff.  I\u2019ve detailed that in our Stretch Goals below.\nLong-term, we\u2019ll use results from our first experiment to build a better \u2018bot; a better Tethered Tower.  And we\u2019ll climb higher.  We will do this until we reach the limit of what can be achieved here on Earth: ~ 30 kilometers/100,000ft.  Once we\u2019ve got altitude, we\u2019ll combine that with long-term endurance, starting with 6 hours, then 24, then a week, a month, a year, and then finally 2 years.  Once we\u2019ve got that, we\u2019ll make the top \u201chuman rated\u201d because our robot Lifters will need a tested life support system, or else what\u2019s the point of all this\u2026?  \nAre we going to do all that on $8000 from this Kickstarter campaign?  No.  But I include it here because I want you to see where we\u2019re going.  This stepped approach was laid out in our technical roadmap in 2004 and we stand by it.  If we only reach our $8000 goal, then we\u2019ll only do one part of this plan.  If we raise more, we\u2019ll do more.  See our Stretch Goals.\nStretch Goals\n$20,000\nMore Sensors: Telemetry is the key to climbing higher.  Knowing the kinds of conditions our little-\u2018bot-that-could\u2019 is climbing through, is vital.  At the $8,000 level, that is a bare-bones system.  If we stretch to $20k, then we can install a much improved sensor suite.  Sensors will likely include things like GPS, a full package of weather monitors like temperature, wind, humidity, and placement of sensors on vital elements of the robot \u2013 wheels, motors, Ribbon guides.  And we\u2019ll improve the communications network, too.  This might seem pretty dull, and an uninspired first \u201cstretch\u201d, but it is essential knowledge if we want to climb farther.\n$30,000\nHigher: With the improved sensors, we\u2019ll have a better handle on the environmental factors we are facing.  With that knowledge \u2013 we\u2019ll climb higher.  It will depend on the results of the first test, and what the sensors tell us, but I presume that we should be able to climb to at least 3-5km.\nWeb Video: I\u2019m especially excited about this part.  I think we can provide a live video feed from the \u2018bots-eye-view\u2019!   Take a trip with us \u2013 from the comfort of your computer monitor \u2013 as we break new ground.  Imagine the view from 3-5km high.  Is that much different from being in an airplane?  Yup.  360 degree visibility.\n$50,000\nHigher:  This will require a new robot.  If we surpass the 3-5km mark we\u2019re in unknown territory.  Exciting right?  We\u2019ll need thermal protections, interior heating, and a different communications configuration.  Something\u2019s bound to break.  We know our balloons are not made for this, so we\u2019ll have to figure something out.  We call that \u2018science\u2019.\nLonger: (Subject to FAA approvals) We\u2019ll aim for \u201clonger\u201d.  Honestly I can\u2019t really tell you what that means; not until we run the first test.  But whatever we get for the first one, we\u2019ll try to double that.  It will probably be for just 6-12 hours.  We\u2019ve stayed up as long as 60 days, but that was at a stable 200ft.  It\u2019s a completely different problem when it\u2019s at higher altitudes. \nWeb-Controlled Camera:  Remember the camera?  How about an upgrade?  What about a web-controlled Pan/Zoom/Tilt, that our community of supporters can manipulate? \n$75,000\nEven Higher: What does this mean? I have no idea.  I can\u2019t even guess.  But at this point, we\u2019re transitioning the problem of \u2018altitude\u2019 to that of \u2018endurance\u2019.  It\u2019s a trade-off.  While altitude is more important for the robot and the end-goal of the Space Elevator, endurance is more important for the life-saving applications of Tethered Towers.\nEven Longer: Before our company crashed, we were in talks with the FAA to redefine what a \u201ctower\u201d meant\u2026  If we\u2019re aloft for very long, we\u2019ll have to re-open those conversations.  You see, a normal tower is a rigid structure, and they are clearly labeled for pilots.  They stay in one place\u2026 And there is a column of restricted airspace.  However our Tethered Towers are flexible.  The move with wind...  We need to cordon off a \u2018bubble\u2019 of airspace, instead of a column.  If we hit the 24 hour mark, we\u2019ll need blinking lights and radio equipment to warn aircraft.  It would be \u2018bad\u2019 if a plane flew into it.  That\u2019s why we get approvals from the FAA, Air Force and Navy for an experimental system.  They keep our skies clear.\n$100,000\nSeries: At this point, it stops being about a single experiment, and becomes a complete series of independent experiments \u2013 each with their own goals and achievements.  At this point, LiftPort Group is back in business for real; doing what we should be doing \u2013 building an Elevator to Space.  At this level, everything changes.  We transform from being an ad hoc collection of volunteers with a vision \u2013 into a cohesive team with a plan.  The series will be a set of experiments along the continuum of altitude and endurance.  Kickstarter enforces a minimum threshold for a project, because of its \u2018all or nothing\u2019 model.  And we can absolutely run our initial experiment for the amount we budgeted.  But this is really the target I want to hit.  If we \u2018only\u2019 hit $8001, then we are going to remain a \u2018hobby\u2019 team.  If we can hit this number, then LiftPort is a \u201c\u2026before this decade is out\u2026\u201d Lunar Elevator company!\n$250,000\nEdge of Space:  It\u2019s a misnomer that I\u2019m reluctant to extend, but the limit of balloon technology is about 20 miles high, whereas the \u2018edge of space\u2019 is about 60 miles.  For whatever reason several balloon experiments talk about reaching the \u2018edge of space\u2019.  I disagree with the terminology, but bow to convention.  However you define it, we\u2019ll reach for the practical limits and aim for ~100,000ft (30km).  We\u2019ll stay there as long as we can.  We\u2019ll have our webcam running and you should be able to see the blackness of space, perhaps some stars, the curve of the Earth, and a helluva view \u2013 straight down.  We\u2019ll have to do this somewhere off the East coast; perhaps on a boat. (Winds blow from West to East in America).  That way the Tethered Tower is out over the ocean, away from air traffic.  We\u2019ll keep this system in place as long as we can\u2026 and we\u2019ll test it to its literal breaking point.  We\u2019ll do our best to recover the system, but it\u2019s unlikely.\n$500,000\nLife Support:  Look, eventually we\u2019re going to space\u2026 to the Moon.  It would probably be a good idea if we had some basic understanding of what it takes to keep a person alive, right?  O.k., that\u2019s not going to happen on $500k, but we can do basic tests like plants and such.  (No, PETA folks, we\u2019re not sending up a kitten or monkey to freeze to death.)  Since cold and oxygen will be our biggest problems we\u2019ll want to ensure that we have lots of sensors, heaters, and thermal insulation.  Perhaps we\u2019ll test this on some tropical flowers that will wilt/freeze if we get this stuff wrong.\n$3,000,000\nFeasibility Study:  Obviously, we\u2019re pretty sure this plan of ours is \u2018feasible\u2019.  But there is a lot that we don\u2019t yet know.  I spent more than a decade working on the Space Elevator, but we\u2019ve only been working on the Lunar system for about 10 months\u2026 I\u2019m often quoted as saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have all the questions, yet, let alone all the answers.\u201d  If that is true of Earth\u2019s Elevator, it is especially true with the Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure.  To that end, we need to gather (back together) a group of some of the smartest folks I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2013 the team of world-class experts that form the core of the Elevator community.  We need to assign problems, and give them time to work on this stuff.  At the end of a year, we\u2019ll finish with a set of three deliverables:\nGo/No Go Decision \u2013 Build it or don\u2019t build it (there is no \u2018try\u2019!)\nLibrary \u2013 ~500 Independent Research Projects, and ~1500 Technical Documents reviewed and assembled.  This is the documentation, and results of the questions we need to answer - before we proceed with the Lunar Elevator.\nPath Forward \u2013 Specific Plan on how to build the Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure  or a Detailed Analysis on how to get to the point where it\u2019s possible \u2013 if there is still required technology development.   \nHere's some other resources we thought you might be interested in:\nInternational Space Elevator Conference kicks off in Seattle this weekend.\nMoonAndBack has a nice set of video interviews with me.  The second video specifically talks about this Kickstarter effort.\nAnd our YouTube and Flickr channels of some of our past robots and tether experiments. (That Flickr is my personal account.  Please ignore images of my grandmother, birds or ex-girlfriends.)\nFinally, my sincere thanks for your interest in what we are doing!\nTake care,\nmjl\nMichael J.

Starting the Monday before GenCon 2013 (August 12, 2013) and running through Wednesday night (August 14, 2013) , they will run 6 players through the complete Horror on the Orient Express in a special location near the Indiana Convention Center. This will be an event replete with props, costumes, and effects. The game will run about 12 hours each day. Meals will be provided at local restaurants and in the gaming room. The final round will be during GenCon itself (time to be determined). The package also includes the WELL-HEELED DILETTANTE benefits and a VIG membership to GenCon (a $500 value, subject to availability -- to be deducted from the price if not available). Travel to and from Indianapolis and accomodations are not included and are the responsibility of the backer. Requires all six backers, otherwise refunded to WELL-HEELED DILETTANTE level after 9/30/2012.\nHorror on the Orient Express is a Call of Cthulhu campaign released in 1991 as a boxed set. The original came in a cardstock box that included a Strangers booklet, a Campaign booklet, three adventure books, a 28-page Player's Handouts booklet, cardstock maps of the train, and various other maps and handout material.\nThis is a re-imagining of the original campaign. The booklets will have improved card stock covers, will feature additional art, and the handouts will be expanded to include a matchbox, similar to the one included in our very first boxed campaign Masks of Nyarlathotep in 1984.\nWHAT IS CALL OF CTHULHU? -- Call of Cthulhu is a horror roleplaying game based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. Over 100 supplements have been printed for a total of 500,000 books sold over the last 28 years. Call of Cthulhu has won over 40 gaming awards including Best RPG of All Time by readers of the Arcane magazine. In 1996, Call of Cthulhu was the second roleplaying game to be inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Hall of Fame.\nON CHAOSIUM: Chaosium is a publisher of roleplaying games and horror fiction. We strive to educate players and readers, as well as entertain them. Our games emphasize the spirit of companionship and camaraderie, as the players' characters struggle against villains and evil-doers presented in adventures. Though our game worlds may be magical or horrifying in nature, we feel teenagers and adults can learn valuable lessons through playing our games.\nA luggage sticker from the original box\nTHE NEW EDITION: This is how we currently envision the new edition of Horror On The Orient Express. The following description includes elements developed as a result of this Kickstarter project and may change as this project develops.\nTHE CORE PRODUCT: The Campaign Book with Alternate Ending and The Orient Express by Gaslight, three adventure books that include a new adventure chapter and a new coda adventure (Through the Alps, Italy & Beyond, Constantinople & Consequences), Strangers On The Train, upgraded Player's Maps & Handouts (plus Survival Guide), The Travelers' Companion, color Orient Express System Map, 25mm-scale card-stock Train Cars, puzzle-cut Sedefkar Simulacrum, four blank Passports, two vintage-looking luggage stickers, replica Orient Express matchbox (because of pesky rules regarding incendiary items, the matchbox will be filled with toothpicks.)\nWHEN WILL IT BE RELEASED? Our goal is to have the boxed set available at the next Gen Con, August 2013.\nOur Journey So Far...\n(The most recent stage of the journey is at the top)\nSEARCH FOR THE ASSASSIN: Screeching to a shuddering halt, aid is given to your wounded companion and a search is launched. The lost eye is found \u2014 but it is of the wrong color! What could this mean?\nThe route to Constantinople is more difficult than envisaged but we reached our goal of $175,000. Our overworked authors will labor to create OMNIA VINCIT SANGUINIS (Blood Conquers All), a Cthulhu Invictus scenario set in BC 50 in the city of Nicomedia near the Bosphorus, involving a marauding army of blood and skin and a mystery vampire cult. Here are revealed the darkest origins of some of the key elements of the Orient Express campaign. We will add this new scenario to the core of Horror on the Orient Express, so every level that receives the box product benefits.\nTHROUGH THE BALKAN MOUNTAINS: Our superlative train speeds over plummeting gorges filled with the silent roar of frozen waterfalls. We near the Bulgarian frontier on a ribbon of steel. Unknown to all, there is an assassin aboard. Who knows where he, or she, will strike?\nDark. lean, and pather-like, the assassin attacks! One of our faithful passengers loses an eye! Nevertheless, we crossed the border and our project reached $170,000. We will work with Alex to craft a special edition of his work with extra tracks bearing Sounds From The Train with instruction to the Keeper for tracks to be played at certain times during play of this iconic adventure.\nTHE OLD COLLECTOR: Surviving a visit to the old collector's hut, our investigators flee back to the train chased by hundreds of jet black, beady-eyed chickens! Make the train they did, and we reached $160,000. We will have made the MEDALLION OF ITHAQUA, a gold-colored device incised on one side with strange hieroglyphs in a language never spoken by human throats, and on the other side bearing a relief carving of some entity which, while parodying the human shape, seems to writhe and shift continually. One Medallion of Ithaqua is added to the SEASONED-TRAVELER and WELL-HEELED DILETTANTE; other levels can add it to their pledges.\nTHE BELGRADE BAZAAR: The Orient Express arrives at Belgrade's central railway station at precisely 9:00 am. The excursion to the bazaar was indeed successful, all returned safe, and our project reached $150,000. Now the authors will add \"THE DARK CRUSADER\", a Cthulhu Dark Ages scenario set in 1204 which flashes back to a key moment in the blood-soaked history of the Sedefkar Simulacrum. This benefit enhances the core Horror on the Orient Express adventure.\nNEXT STOP BELGRADE? Most of our steadfast passengers survived their fog-shrouded adventures in unexpected Zagreb, though a few are escorted by doctors from the train, mumbling references to \"the bells, the bells!\" Nevertheless, we reached our goal of $145,000, so the authors will add a new coda adventure titled \"Children of the Skin\", set on today's luxury recreation of the Simplon Orient Express, along with details for using the train in modern-day Call of Cthulhu adventures.\nWe also added value packages such as the Desk Accessory Kit (four sheets of Letterhead, four envelopes, one Orient Express notepad, one telegram notepad, and two Orient Express pencils); Souvenirs From The Journey (6 new Luggage Stickers and 6 postcards from cities along the route); and the Clandestine Game Kit (100 poker chips, a custom playing card deck, and a wooden case to keep them in).\nA BIZARRE DINNER: Surviving blustery weather and a \"lively\" dinner in Trieste, our train reaches its next goal of $135,000. Our authors will add a brand new chapter to the Horror On The Orient Express adventure. This will be a part of the core product, so benefits all levels that receive the core box. Also the CHAOSIUM DICE are a full roleplaying complement of dice including percentiles, eight-sided, and four-sided. We are making a replica COFFEE MUG from the dining car. We are adding ONE COFFEE MUG to each CONDUCTOR and ENGINEER package, and a set of FOUR MUGS to the SEASONED TRAVELER and the WELL-HEELED DILETTANTE. For the SEASONED TRAVELER and the WELL-HEELED DILETTANTE we are also creating an embossed certificate bearing the signatures of the authors, editors, and others who worked on the project.\nLOOKING FORWARD TO TRIESTE: After a restful and picturesque ride to Trieste, our sturdy locomotive arrived in late evening, reaching our goal of $125,000. We will publish Madness on the Orient Express, featuring nearly two-dozen all-original tales of supernatural terror featuring the fabled train and its doom-haunted waypoints. A copy of this book is included in the CONDUCTOR and ENGINEER levels, and all levels that earn Conductor and Engineer benefits. Other tiers can include a copy of the book at a discount from its final retail price. Please see the STATION STORE, below.\nSTROLLING THE STREETS OF VENICE: We safely explored Venice, reaching our goal. We will create THE TRAVELERS' COMPANION, a useful guide for every well-informed investigator! This guide is added to the core product.\nQUEEN OF THE ADRIATIC: The train left Milan with the shrieking crescendo of that fatal performance at La Scala echoing through the investigators' sanity. After a long stretch of track through the northern Italian countryside, we arrive in Venice, Queen of the Adriatic, that most beautiful city where love stirs the hearts of the young and old -- but not the heart of something far, far older. Here we reached our next goal, to include a new chapter in the core product (applicable to all levels that receive the core campaign) detailing the train in the 1890s, the route and conditions on the train, current events of that time, a collection of Gaslight-era characters, and an all-new 1890s scenario by Geoff Gillan and Mark Morrison, \"The Blood-Red Fez\", acting either as a stand-alone 1890s adventure or as a prequel to the events of the main campaign.\nHEAVY SNOWS DELAY THE JOURNEY: Surviving the performance at La Scala and returning to their accommodations on the train we will render the Simulacrum in full color and print it on thick puzzle-cut, laminated cardboard stock so that the six pieces (Head, Torso, two Arms, and two Legs) lock together like a puzzle to make a fine, but disturbing, artifact. We also added the Orient Express Dining Car Kit featuring four coasters, four napkins, four placemats, four seat-assignment cards, and two menus to our CONDUCTOR and ENGINEER level pledges (and all levels that receive CONDUCTOR and ENGINEER benefits, not including CON PRIZE PACKAGE or RETAILER DELIGHT).\nNEXT STOP, MILAN! Through the newly-built Simplon Tunnel our train safely reaches Milan, Italy, where we will have all train-car diagrams fashionably re-rendered and exquisitely reproduced at 25mm scale.\nON TO LAUSANNE: The Orient Express left Paris in a dark cloud, with the investigators haunted by the sickly smell of those infernal roses. Ahead looms the forbidding shape of the Swiss alps, and a secret buried in war and dreams. In reaching Lausanne, Switzerland we found An Alternate Ending to give you the option of finishing the campaign early, in Istanbul; and a Campaign Survival Guide containing rules and suggestions for keeping the story going through this infamously lethal campaign. In addition, we added a limited Horror on the Orient Express bumper sticker for all levels at or above ROLL ON! (except the PDF level, which gets a downloadable version).\nDESTINATION PARIS: We reached our next destination of Paris (our first and second goals), and a meeting with a madman. We are upgrading the quality of maps and handouts, and have added a color map of the Orient Express System.\nLEFT THE STATION: The Orient Express officially left the station at full steam (and funded), after a series of unfortunate events in which the same man died three times in one night.

Head over to www.ouya.tv for more info and to place an order.\nWe just added game streaming through OnLive! Final Fantasy will be on OUYA...and we have an exclusive game! And VEVO has agreed to put their music videos on OUYA, XBMC adds a streaming media app, with TuneIn and iHeartRadio adding music! \nWe're honored by all of you who are backing us -- THANK YOU. We are focused on delivering for you, first come first served. We can only promise OUYA by March to our Kickstarter backers.\nEngadget! PC World! Kotaku! The Guardian! Joystiq! Forbes! GameSpot! BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others.

This long-awaited game will be the sixth in the adventure series, which includes the award-winning games Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive and Overseer.\nProject Fedora will reunite creators Chris Jones and Aaron Conners and feature their trademarks of rich interactive storytelling and immersive gameplay. The new game will incorporate the very best of the classic Tex Murphy elements - sci-fi, film noir, witty dialogue, great characters, beautifully integrated FMV, and a deep, engaging story - but it will also enhance the experience of the former games with stunning new graphics, a sleek new interface, and other updates.\nThe detective-style gameplay takes place in a fully 3D world where you search for clues, solve puzzles, investigate crimes, and question witnesses and suspects. While the gameplay will be fun and challenging, you'll never get stuck with the free, built-in hint system.\nOne of Project Fedora's most exciting features is how the game and story can unfold in different ways. As you play, your actions and choices will change events, leading to new story elements and gameplay. This \"narrative pathing\" not only allows you to customize your experience, it will provide unique replayability, as the game will have at least three or more story paths leading to multiple endings.\nLong-time Tex fans may be curious if the new storyline will pick up where Overseer (and its infamous cliffhanger) left off. The short answer is YES, but this game will be just as enjoyable for people who have never played the earlier games. While we can't give too many details yet, just be prepared for an incredible opening sequence!\nProject Fedora promises to be the best Tex Murphy adventure ever - even better than the last three Tex Murphy games (Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive, Overseer), which were met with critical acclaim, won \"Adventure Game of the Year\" awards, and are consistently ranked as some of the best adventure games of all time.

Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe, aka \u2018The Two Guys from Andromeda\u2019, are back together. No, your optic orbs have not been on a bender. You read correctly. After a very brief 20+ year hiatus, we have joined forces once again and are tooling-up to bring you a new Space Adventure, or SpaceVenture\u2122, if you will.\nA little older, a little wider (well, Mark at least) and a bit more demented than before (a toss-up on that one), we're both ludicrously psyched to be working together again. Combine that with what has been literally years of pent-up intergalactic pressurized cabin fever to go with it and we have some real wonderful\u2026, uh, \u2018stuff\u2019 to share, incorporating that same style of comedy, wonder and delusion you expect from a Two Guys SpaceVenture\u2122.\nYou\u2019d be very surprised to know the range of requests we sought out and have been received from supporters. We know we can\u2019t be everything to everyone but we're working hard to find a happy compromise. The only thing we won\u2019t compromise on is your game-play experience (and maybe caloric intake).\n Scott and Mark will have their hands all over this project with final say on everything, including how much cheese and Orat meat goes in the crust. What this means, people, is that no aspect of this game will come into being without the personal, crusty-eyed, occasionally salivating and barely comprehensible approval of The Two Guys from Andromeda. This is YOUR guarantee, for you fans and friends, that everything you are about to see is ultimately the work of The Two Guys. \nBefore we go any further, lets make clear one major question. What platforms are we working to make the game run on? Scan this list: \nPC\nMac\nLinux\niPad\nAndroid Tablets\nAll of those platforms, from day one of the release!\n\nOur philosophy from day one and game one was to make games that WE would want to play and that, ultimately, YOU would as well. We aren't straying from what has been a successful formula according to our sales then and your feedback since.  We're back to create more while also incorporating what we've learned in analyzing our past work, from you via comments made from the days of snail-mail to the present methods of email and social media. It\u2019s been fascinating to learn what you\u2019ve found fun, funny and/or annoying, and what games you\u2019ve favored. Clearly, not everyone has well-rated taste, but we can work around that. Yes, we're givers!\nThe way games are made and gotten into a player\u2019s home and on to their devices of choice have changed greatly thanks HUGELY in part to Kickstarter. They are helping dreams come true for so many of us. During that time you have continued to talk about the adventure game genre and how you\u2019ve missed it. We're adapting to the changes, taking advantage of them and charting a new course through this new space, and looking forward to finding that \u2018new game smell\u2019 that we can enjoy and to bring to you as well.\nWe have fan encouragement, you incredibly loyal fans who have kept the legacy of their work alive. We appreciate the many fan sites, fan games and fiction, game homage\u2019s and remakes, but probably the best part of the past has been directly related to some very enjoyable, interesting and inspiring emails. Thank you for sharing your stories with us about what the games meant to you from whether you enjoyed them (or not), which puzzle(s) made you mad, and who you played them with. Some were actually quite poignant and those will never be lost on them.\nYes, you read that right. FREE stuff,  another small thing we wanted to do to make your visit to our Kickstarter page special as well as to be a little different than the others, not that they didn\u2019t blaze a brilliant trail for all of us. We think you'll agree that not taking it to the next level would be lazy and sad on our part.\nWe want to give you a small digital \u2018thank you\u2019 gift just for showing up and at least considering supporting us. We never want you to feel we aren't grateful regardless of what you decide. We're nothing without you. This wallpaper image was put together for you by Mark Crowe specifically for our Kickstarter campaign. Thank you for hanging in there and seeing this.

We've invested in the absolute best virtual office environment money can buy (on the cheap). On a serious note, this also allows us to be an Earth conscious company by being able to go Green.\nNo commuting, much less wasted paper and toner, Rogaine for Mark and Clairol for Men for Scott, etc.\nIn doing this, it allows us to hire top tier game developers - all big Space Quest and adventure game fans, of course - to help make this a reality. Having fan-developers means we'll get the best possible results because of the passion they also carry for our style of the genre. This model helps keep costs down on overhead like office space, so more goes into the game.It also allows us to partner with people in quite literally different parts of the world! \n BUT, with all of this we will need YOUR help! In order to make this dream a reality, we are asking our fans and friends to contribute through our Kickstarter campaign and to help us to once again do what is a serious passion we have never lost, and what drives us to make the very best games we can, games you've asked for. Not only do we have some of the top game developers available, we are also pulling in some of the top voice over talent as well! We take multimedia seriously, if nothing else. For voice talent we know you want the one and only narrator, the man with the golden pipes, Gary Owens. Done! But take a look at, along with Gary, a few of the others already on board to voice our characters.\nGary Owens  - Narrator from SQ4 and SQ6, voice of Space Ghost, Laugh-in, and many many others in a long and distinguished career.\nRob Paulsen - Pinky from Pinky and the Brain, Yakko from Animaniacs, Raphael the Ninja Turtle, and multiple characters from Monkey Island among many other characters he has voiced.\nRobert Clotworthy \u2013 Jim Raynor from StarCraft 1 & 2, Senator Evran & Supreme Chancellor from Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Narrator of The History Channel\u2019s Ancient Aliens series, Big Bang Theory, etc.\nEllen McLain - GLaDOS from Portal 1 & 2, Overwatch from Half-Life 2, Administrator from Team Fortress 2, Witch from Left for Dead 2 and many more.\nJohn Patrick Lowrie - Sniper from Team Fortress 2, Sword Control from Halo Reach, Citizens from Half-Life 2 and author of Dancing with Eternity.\nFor musical talent we are talking with some of the best composers we can find. Did you like the music from the Space Quest series? We are in talks with some of the original composers, including the man that brought you the music from Space Quest 3, Supertramp rock legend Bob Siebenberg.\n (THAT EQUALS \u2018WE LOVE YOU' IN GAME DEVELOPMENT LINGO)\nWe fully intend to bring back every element that you guys loved from our original games! You\u2019ve been very clear and concise as to what you enjoyed from our previous efforts. Here\u2019s a short list of things you can expect if our project gets funded:\nA Sci-fi adventure from Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe working happily together as a team once again. \nHilarious death sequences \nTons of the fresh (and moldy) pop-culture references  \nFun and unique humor  \nArt design and direction by Mark\nDialog that will make you blow nostril Tang, written by Scott along with Mark\nNarration of all this by Gary Owens and the voice acting of other characters by the above mentioned quality industry voice talent \nGame music that will hopefully give you chills and wedge in your main orb for the rest of your natural Earth life and make you wish you lived inside your computer!  \nA game that you will feel comfortable playing with your children, but with some entertainment that will safely appeal only to the adult psyche  \nYes, we know, they all say that, but WE really mean it! Fresh from the Sarcasm Cluster and the Hyperbole Nebula, this is the first Kickstarter effort by the Two Guys From Andromeda. We're here to tell you THIS is huge to us.\n We really are going to do things differently than some of the other campaigns you may have seen, even though we love those people, so don't take that in a mean spirited manner. We know you guys are aching for something truly special, so we've been butting heads in the Andromedan luxury bunker to come up with a way you guys can feel extra, extra special while we empty your bank accounts for our own devious, suspect ends: You are going to get something fun to play throughout our Kickstarter campaign! Yeah, you read that right! \nHere is what we\u2019re talking about:\nEvery time we reach another $100,000 milestone, we\u2019ll release another enhanced prototypes version for you to play.\nThe playable prototypes will be the direct ideas of Scott and Mark. (Who else?)\nWe will take your feedback to improve the demos for each milestone.\nEveryone involved in the project will be keeping a project diary, including Scott and Mark! (You may have problems reading Scott\u2019s, but we'll do our best to provide Cliffs Notes or a hieroglyphics translator.) Do you ever wonder why Scott chose a specific piece of dialog to go into a particular game situation? Or how Mark built the Space Quest 2 box or was inspired to create art for a certain game location? Wouldn\u2019t you like to know? \nThese are the things you\u2019ll be privy to in our behind-the-scenes diaries for the new game! The project diary will be dated and time-stamped as everyone involved documents their thoughts and feelings throughout the game development process. (Don't be alarmed by occasional high-pitched sounds that sometimes drown out the spoken audio. It's really just a technical glitch. Those crazy gizmos these days! or bleeps as they are know in the industry.) This will include lots of behind the scenes photos, short videos, and audio clips that give you fascinating insight as to how things were brought to life - and how much we had to tip the cleaning lady to remove trace evidence. \nAlright, let's talk rewards! We know you're dying to be rewarded. (Who isn't?) And we're dying to reward you because, really, we wouldn't be in all this mess without you guys, right? We know that and we appreciate it. We hope you know that. So, apart from the running demo thing, we really want to make sure you get something of additional value.\nFirst of all, everything you have read above is being giving to you at just $15.\nThat\u2019s right, a DRM-free digital download version of the game for PC, MAC, or Linux, a code that allows you to play the game on Steam, as well as all the behind the scenes material turned over to you once the game has been released. All that for just $15! We may even get the Space Quest historian to write you a completely generic congratulatory message - with YOUR name cut and pasted in. Yes, YOUR name! Just for being so awesome!\nOkay, we can sense that won't cut it for some of you. Well, if that doesn't sound exciting enough, how about this?\nFor those that want to step things up a level, we hope you\u2019ll find that we have included some really awesome reward tiers. (Prepare for a nosebleed.) The rewards should tickle the fancy of people who like physical collectibles, autographs, as well as those who love digital goods! In fact, for those of you who live outside the US and don\u2019t want to deal with customs issues, consider our \u201cDigital Only\u201d reward tiers -- the one-stop shop for getting your nerd on without leaving the comforts of your remote, backwaters Earth nation! (As opposed to OUR remote, backwaters Andromedan location.)\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW A PDF VERSION OF THE CHART\nWe created this chart to help you understand the rewards you\u2019ll get for participating in the various tiers of our Kickstarter campaign!\nSome of our rewards allow you to have your name etched in digital eternity by becoming part of the game. One thing you have made VERY clear to us is that although you want to see your name in the game, you also don\u2019t want to take away from the game play. So, to help with this, the game will randomly select a name from the pool of those people who have paid the highest amounts and plop them fully across the screen at regular intervals for the duration of the playing exper-- sorry, that's not right. Of course, we're kidding! Here's what's ACTUALLY going to happen: There will be a very limited amount of names in the intro credits. There will also be many well crafted \u2018Special Thanks\u2019 in the closing credits which will optionally run upon exiting the game. These will not hinder game play or the experience in the least. You may be credited as the Head of the Andromedan Nose Ministry, or maybe the High Council on Mohawk Regulation and Hair Product.\nMany of you want more recognition, so we\u2019re giving it to you. Who are we to argue with vanity? The game will have \u2018hidden objects\u2019. There will be a collection of digital fan cards placed very strategically in the game. When you see one, you simply click on it, and the card will zoom to the front of your screen and tell you about the fan on that particular card. We feel this will add an extra element to the game, get you excited to give to the project, and give us the ability to reward you in the game for finding them all.\nBut if that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, we\u2019ve thought of that too. If you feel this hinders your game playing experience, you can simply disable this feature at any time! But that one idea you guys had actually made a lot of sense. We're not going to force our closest friends and most loyal supporters down the throats of people who couldn't care less. But we ARE going to give the people who truly want it to have the chance to turn on the feature for all to see, and bask in your glory. Oh, and did we mention we love you? Oh, you knew that already, right?\nA personal message from \u201cThe Guys\u201d\nWe wish to express our sincerest thanks and gratitude to some amazingly talented and dedicated folks for helping us get this Kickstarter campaign launched in high style.\nSpecial thanks to:\nBrad Herbert, Chad Briggs and the rest of their visual FX team at Element X Creative for they're truly amazing and heart stirring intro animation. Their passion for all things Sierra and for Space Quest in particular really shows through in this \u201clabor of love\u201d, as Brad puts it. You guys are fantastic. We can\u2019t thank you enough! Everyone should check out all other amazing stuff their up to at: http://www.elementxcreative.com/\nhttp://artofsierra.com\nSpaceQuest.Net has been so amazing for allowing The Two Guys From Andromeda to house their forums with them! \nJustin Crowe for his mad videography, direction, and post production skills. Justin, a University of Oregon Undergrad, studying Journalism and Digital Arts, managed to pull some gripping, Oscar- worthy performances from a couple of old, broken down has-beens from Andromeda- all while in the midst of mid-terms. Check out some of Justin\u2019s documentary work here Justincrowefilm\nMartin Kool and Q42, a studio based in the Netherlands, with a passion for the adventure genre for approaching us with some innovative solutions for bringing our vision to multiple platforms simultaneously. You\u2019ll be seeing more of what we mean in the next few days and coming weeks as we rollout something really innovative and unique to the whole Kickstarter concept.\nNot coincidentally, Martin is responsible for Sarien.net and for bringing some of Sierra\u2019s classic games (including Space Quest) to the iPad.

And the number continues to grow, and that means a better product for all as we can hire more writers and scripters to add even more depth of consequence to the world, add more music and sound to set the atmosphere, and make the world larger to explore. Let's keep the number increasing and really knock it out of the ballpark. I have been having a blast reading the messages of excitement from the RPG players who feel neglected over the years.\nWe wanted to have a little fun and make another comical video so I hope you enjoy it. The next video I put up will also be more informative as I will answer some of the more common questions from the forums. We are still deciding on the tech, and we don't know what the final budget is, so it can be difficult to have answers for everything right now.\nSo see our thoughts on Multi-player as well as a list of links to some of the great press we have been getting, go to our updates page by clicking \"Updates \" at the top of this page.\nBrian Fargo appears on Hard Drive.\n\"I\u2019m personally a big fan of the Wasteland series from having played the original game in the late 80s; I\u2019ve also always admired Brian Fargo\u2019s courage to experiment with new designs and game engines from my time working with him in the early days of BioWare when we worked with Interplay, and as a result I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the next game in the Wasteland series!\" - Ray Muzyka - CEO Bioware\n\"Hats off to Fargo and inXile, I'm definitely putting my money down when they start up their Kickstarter fund, and I'll donate just as much as I did to Double Fine.  Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

It has been in production for almost five years and gets closer every day. Once complete, the game will be FREE for all to play, with the possibility of expanding later down the road. All the in-game artwork is original and hand drawn/sprited by myself (Don James), the music is being composed by Aaron Boyer, with an animated intro sequence to the game created by Samuel Petersen.\nBack in July of 2010, I attended Click Convention 2010 that was held in London, England in which I showcased the project in front of the Clickteam community as well as the developers behind MMF2 and other Clickteam software titles.\nPudding Hat Games was founded December 2008, as an indie game and application design group. We are currently getting closer the completion of our flagship title Core of Innocence and have a second game in the works, with more planned down the line, looking into mobile game development and other various multi-player platforms.\nThe year is 2528.The story follows a young woman named Lila - who has recently graduated college in archaeological studies and is summoned by her grandfather to assist him in his research at an underground mining facility, where a new rare mineral has been discovered. Things take a turn for the worse as an ancient evil from a distant world reveals itself and rekindles the fire that fueled a bloody war that happened over 2000 years ago, this time threatening to bring the fight to Earth. Lila has an encounter with the antagonist who attacks her with his new-found power, but the attack causes her unworldly blood to fuse with her 'Variable Outfit System' implant, giving her superhuman ability. It was at this moment she decides to take a stand and protect her world at any cost.\nCurrently, there are over 250 pieces of equipment to wear, 49 weapons to strike down your foes, 18 spells at your fingertips, along with several other key items to obtain that increase mobility and grant access to different areas. There are eight areas in Core of Innocence each with its own \u201ctheme\u201d, bosses, enemies, items, and secret areas. There will also be 18 side-quests in the game to further expand upon the story and to reward the player with equipment and items upon completion!\nThe entire game world is all but finished. I have 40 of the proposed 60 unique enemy sprites completed, and they are currently in testing by my alpha testing crew. My current task is to finish up the remaining 20 enemies (give or take) and get the bosses for the game completed, and then get everything plugged in and tested. After I am happy after that round of testing, I'm going to give the game a once over and add in various doodads and some ambient effects to spruce up the levels a bit and to bring more life to the game world.\nOur game intro animator Sam is just about done with the intro movie for the game. He is now applying the final edits to sync the movie up with the song that Aaron composed for the intro, and then we should be able to wrap that up.\nOur test group is currently testing the current completed enemies for difficulty balancing and general bug finding and so far bug reports have been very minimal one-off stuff, not to mention easily fixable! \nI hope to complete the game by end of this year - barring any unforeseen delays and what have you. I've been workin' on this long enough! Time for the final stretch in getting it finished! The current state of the game is turning out awesome and I've been making great progress overall but there are still some areas in which we are hitting some slowdown which is where Kickstarter comes in.\nUp to now I've been funding everything out of pocket and sadly the needs for production are starting to get bigger than what I can support. I have come to Kickstarter because I love creating games, and what better place to find people who are just as passionate about their dreams and hobbies as I am, than here?\nIf we hit the project goal of $400, the majority of funds will be used for for final media production needs such as post production work on the intro movie in the form of a movie format conversion software, and then for sound effects for the newly created enemies (which we need several of). We would also look into getting a couple various gamepads for testing (mostly need an XBOX360 gamepad), as well as any other costs that may appear during final production, and creation of the ending artwork.\nAny additional money will be put towards expanding on the game itself by adding extra content down the road via extra areas and more equipment, hosting fees, and other project related costs. Also it opens up the likely possibility of a port to XBLIA and potentially other platforms as well! (Crossing our fingers for Linux and Mac!) Any unused money for Core of Innocence will go into Backer rewards and future projects for Pudding Hat Games.\nI sincerely thank you for your interest in our project.

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.

In a surreal world that is both beautiful and lifeless, you find you are somehow able to freely slip between two unique perceptions of the world. Will you come to grips with this strange power, or will you lose your grip on reality?\nNarrative without dialogue. The game does have a plot. But rather than use dialogue to guide the player, we chose to use visual and auditory cues. There will be no cinematics or \"cut scenes\" either. Everything is presented to the player through experience. This way, the player can still be deeply immersed without ever having control taken from them.\nThought-provoking gameplay. It all started in January 2011 at the Global Game Jam, an annual competition where game developers from around the world challenge themselves to create a game in 48-hours based on a given theme. This year the theme was \"extinction.\" It didn't take long for us to realize we didn't want to go the traditional route of apocalyptic scenarios or sci-fi epics about genetic manipulation. We discovered a unique and, frankly, very compelling neurological disorder known as visual extinction. From Wikipedia:\n\"Visual extinction has the characteristic symptom of difficulty to perceive contralesional stimuli when presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus, but the ability to correctly identify them when not presented simultaneously. Under simultaneous presentation, the contralesional stimulus is apparently ignored by the patient, or extinguished.\"\nOK, now in English. When a visual extinction patient is presented with two different objectsat the same time, the patient may ignore one of them. On the contrary, the patient usually has no problem correctly identifying both objects if presented separately. It was this fascinating concept that gave birth to the core gameplay of Blink.\nThe player has the ability to slip between two different perceptions of the world at will. Left-clicking the mouse shows one, while right-clicking the mouse shows the other. The key to utilizing this ability is understanding that what you see is what you get.\n\nPoetry in motion (control). Thanks to the amazing team at Sixense Entertainment in collaboration with PC gaming peripheral innovators Razer, 1:1 motion control is now in the hands of PC gamers. They've worked hard to support plenty of existing games that people know and love -- but what about new games? We're proud to announce that Blink will support the Razer Hydra motion controller out of the box, adding a whole new layer of immersion to the game.\nWe create our games with Unreal Development Kit, the same toolset used to create Gears of War and Infinity Blade. The Hydra doesn't work with UDK out of the box though, so we had to create an integrated solution that allows the Hydra and UDK to talk to each other. It's been a long time coming, but with Blink that integration will finally come to light. Blink will be one of the first games since the popular Portal 2 to offer native support for the Hydra motion controller. We are thrilled to be involved with such innovative technology, but we certainly don't want to hog the spotlight. That's why we are making our Hydra-to-UDK solution available to all Unreal developers in the near future.\nWe've had the Hydra in mind since the early design stages, trying to pinpoint the most exciting opportunities for interacting with Blink in unique yet intuitive ways. We don't want the motion control to feel like a gimmick, but we don't want to abandon traditional keyboard-and-mouse input either. Rest assured that designing a strong experience for the Hydra will not detract from the keyboard-and-mouse option. We're doing everything we can do ensure both are equally fun to play with.\nWho are you people?\nPeople? We are a collective consciousness sent to Earth from deep within the void of... OK, not really. We're actually just four aspiring game developers following our dream so we can work on the games we really want to make. We want to innovate, to shatter old design conventions, and to contribute to the evolution of the game industry. We are:\nNick PfistererCo-founder Design Scripting Music Web Marketing Person to the Max\nJessica Lang\nCo-founder Design Art 2D 3D Marketing Ninja Person to the Extreme\nParish Regn-Stillwaggon\nProgrammer Gameplay Hardware Motion Person Ultra\nRussell Sakolsky\nProgrammer Gameplay Hardware Motion Person Hyper\nWhy do you need money?\nWe just recently submitted a short demo to the Independent Games Festival for 2012. It was very hard work, but a rewarding experience to say the least. Unfortunately, we lack the time and resources to go far beyond that demo and add the extra features, art and audio necessary to make a full gaming experience worthy of your attention. With your help, we can work full-time on the game and release it by March 2012. We intend to release Blinkfor PC and Mac on popular digital platforms like Steam, Desura and the Mac App Store. Your pledges will help us with development costs such as:\nHardware\nSoftware licenses\nCommercial licensing and legal costs\nContinued development and labor costs\nMarketing and publicity\nNothing makes us happier than creating video games. We love to innovate and we're constantly pushing the envelope whenever possible. We've been dreaming of the day we can stop trying to balance life and work schedules with our love for game development. With your help, we can achieve that dream.\nCool! So what do I get for helping?\nWe understand that helping us achieve our goal is a choice you make for yourself. It's your time, your money, and your consideration that makes dreams come true. To illustrate how important you are to people like us, we decided to offer rewards that allow you to be a part of our game. We're not just talking to those of you who can afford to spare a generous pledge. Every single pledger will become a part of Blink. Here's what you get:\n$1 or more. Your name will appear in the credits as a Kickstarter. We believe every pledge should be recognized, no matter how small.\n$10 or more. You will receive a copy of Blink for your platform of choice as soon as it is released in 2012. On top of that, you will gain access to the closed beta. This testing period will be exclusive to Kickstarter pledgers. Everyone else will have to wait until the open beta. Your name will appear in the credits as a Closed Beta Tester. Plus every previous reward.\n$20 or more. You will receive a digital copy of the original soundtrack before it releases to the public. The soundtrack, composed by Blumoon (that's Nick), will feature a genre-busting mixture of chilling soundscapes and rolling melodies. You will also receive a digital copy of the remix album featuring remixes of songs from the original soundtrack from several talented artists including Vincent Cuevas and David Call. Your name will appear in the credits under \"People That Heard the Soundtrack Before You,\" as well as the \"Kickstarters\" section. Plus the $1 reward.\n$40 or more. Throughout the game there will be easter eggs to discover. Just something to reward the explorers among us. We want every single one of these easter eggs to be inspired by Kickstarter pledgers. Pledge at this level and we'll work with you to make sure your name and/or likeness becomes part of the world of Blink. Plus every previous reward.\n\n$60 or more. It seems like every great game has achievements these days. We like them too, so Blink will be no different. Not unlike the $40 pledge level, we want ten of the game's achievements to be inspired by Kickstarter pledgers. Pledging at this level gets an achievement named after you. Plus every previous reward.\n\n$75 or more. There's a part of the game we're really excited about.. but we don't want to say what it is just yet. Spoilers are bad! What we can tell you is this: Nick wants to do something unique in the sound department for this mysterious thing, and he wants your help. Pledge at this level and you'll be working with Nick to contribute your incredible voice talents to the [spoiler] that you [spoiler] about [spoiler] through the game. You'll be listed as a Voice Actor in the credits, too. Plus you still get every previous reward. \n$100 or more. This is the top reward level and is limited to just five (5) pledgers. We want to have an area in the game that's not just inspired by Kickstarter pledgers, but also designed by them. Pledgers at this level will help us design the puzzles for a special Kickstarter-inspired area of the game. Your name will appear in the credits as a Puzzle Designer, plus you'll get every other reward we have to offer. The whole shabang!\nIt's all or nothing.\nRemember; Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding platform. If we don't reach our funding goal, we get nothing and your card is never charged. In that case, the development of Blink stops dead in its tracks.

We have quotes and estimates needed to make a full print run of a high-quality game, including art for over 50 unique cards, a map, tokens and dice.\n\nThe more we go over our fund-raising target, the more unique cards we can add to the project. We'd also like to add a two-sided map for increased challenge, as well as more specific and detailed tokens.\nAnne Bonny by Obsidian Abnormal\nScurvy Dogs Gameplay\nEvery player starts off with a Pirate and a Ship. The Pirate has two numbers: Land and Sea. The Ship has two numbers: Speed and Space.\n\nPirate's Land vs. Sea numbers\nThese numbers work the exact same way. Whenever you take on a Booty Challenge, the Spanish Armada, Special Challenges or other Pirates, you roll two dice and add them to either the Land or the Sea number.\nEach Booty Challenge has a Land and Sea number as well, though they are much higher than a Pirate\u2019s number. The rewards vary on the difficulty of the challenge, and almost every challenge will be noticeably stronger at Sea or at Land.\nSpecial Challenges will be either At Sea only (The Kraken) or At Land only (The Fortress).\nAttacking other pirates use either the Land or the Sea number, depending on where you attack said pirates.\nNote: the best that you\u2019ll be able to get any Land or Sea number up to is a 7.\n\nShip\u2019s Speed vs. Space numbers\nThe smaller ships get you there faster, but you\u2019ll be limited in how much cargo and crew you can carry on board. However, you\u2019ll also be able to out-run more heavily armed ships.\n\nThe Early Gameplay\nInitially, competing in Booty Challenges will be very difficult. On the map, there\u2019s three shipwrecks conspicuously close to the starting area. Players can \u201csalvage\u201d the wrecks with really simple challenges, and get up to one crew card and one equipment card fairly cheaply. This should equip the ships with enough firepower to then take on the Booty Challenges.\n\nThe Main Gameplay\nAs ship\u2019s crew and equipment improve, completing Booty Challenges will be their main source of treasure. Challenges will either be simple dice-checks the moment they\u2019re encountered, or secret challenges that involve goals that other players can interrupt.\nThe main goal of the game is to gather up gold. Even though pirates traded in all sorts of treasure, the worth was always assigned as a value in gold first.\nTreasure is gained by completing Booty card challenges, stealing from other pirates, slaying the kraken, or sacking The Fortress.\nTreasure is lost by spending money on crew members and the shipyard, losing certain Booty Challenges, and buying Letters of Marque from the Governor.\nThe secondary goal is to not die, which is where Letters of Marque come into play.\nBeing a pirate was illegal, even for the British \u201csailors\u201d in Port Royal. But in a simple stroke of politics, there was a loophole - being a privateer. The key difference between the two were Letters of Marque. And getting them was quite simple. All you had to do was attack only the Spanish, and then give lots and lots of money to the British Government.\nSome pirates, like Sir Francis Drake, were very good at doing this (note that \u201cSir\u201d title, he bought it fair and square). Other pirates were not so good at playing by these rules, and they got their necks stretched.\nAt the end of the game, you count two things: your gold and your Letters of Marque. You have to have enough Letters to not die, and you have to have the most gold to win. How many letters are enough is affected by how many players are playing the game. But if you have the fewest, you\u2019re automatically dead.\n\nBooty Challenges\nHere\u2019s some examples of Booty Challenges you\u2019ll face:\n\nTreasure Fleet\nLand: 16\nSea: 15\nBooty: 30 gold\n\nKeep it safe!\n(secret)\nLand: 14\nSea: 15\nBooty: 24 gold\nBefore rolling for this challenge, find a deserted island at least 5 squares away from Port Royal to bury it.\n\nMutiny\nLand: 10\nSea: 11\nCancel with Rum\nIf successful, discard one crewman.\nIf you roll over 17, discard all Letters of Marque\nIf you lose, discard all crew\n\nNote how each one plays out. First, you\u2019ve got a straight-forward, brute-force card Treasure Fleet. You roll, you try to hit a relatively tough roll (at best, you\u2019ll be needing to roll an 8 on 2d6), and as such it\u2019s one of the bigger financial rewards in the game. Keep it safe! is a secret challenge, meaning you need to hide your goal while sailing around.\nAnd then there\u2019s Mutiny, which is something of an anti-Booty card. Mutiny is special because it encourages you to either prepare for it ahead of time (spending gold on rum) or suffer consequences. And notice that those consequences get worse the more successful you are. If you lose all your Letters of Marque in the last round, what was at one point a safe lead can turn into a very, very dangerous time for a pirate.\n\nThe End Game\nI love games that have different ending conditions. This is something I wanted in Scurvy Dogs, too.\nFirst, there needs to be an ending that everyone can see coming. In this case, it\u2019s a gold limit. Once all the gold is gone, the game ends.\nSecond, there\u2019s the \u201ccapture the flag\u201d attack. On the map there\u2019s two very clear final destinations, The Fortress and The Kraken. One is a Land-based challenge, and one is a Sea-based challenge. Beating either starts up an end phase for the game.\nThird, there\u2019s a secret ending. In the booty challenges, there\u2019s four corners to a treasure map. If a pirate is able to collect all four pieces of the map then reach a secret location, they can surprise everyone by ending the game early.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Scurvy Dogs Quick Start Rules", "update_content": "So, what are Missions?\nMissions are an optional rule.
