[{"backer": "eric kesselman", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "        The video game, cards, and figures can each be enjoyed independently of the others, but when played together your experience will be extra-awesome!\n        Every element of the Lightseekers universe interacts with our game. That means physical trading cards, digital action figures, comics, posters, packaging, videos and more will unlock additional rewards and new content. Everything works together to make your gaming experience even more compelling. The more support we receive, the more we will create that will enhance the Lightseekers game and reward you, the player. \nA Large, Open World to Explore: Lightseekers takes place on the fantastical planet, Tantos. Unlike many other games, Tantos is not built from a series of small levels. We've taken great care to make Tantos a living, breathing, ever-changing world with thousands of hours of repeatable gameplay, that caters to the needs of even the most adventurous explorers.\n  As a Lightseeker, it's up to you to unravel the mysteries of the planet's past and stop the evil umbron.\nThat is just a small part of the larger picture. Everyone you meet and all the different areas you explore have stories to be told. We have gone to great lengths to give the planet a coherent backstory from the perspective of all its many races and more will be revealed as the game evolves.\n  And there' s much more about the game lower down on this page...\nManufactured by TOMY, world renowned for quality, our digital action figures deliver real time 2-way interaction between your hero and the game. They talk, vibrate, and use different colored lights to show levels, status, warn of impending danger and help guide gameplay - think of them as your ultimate wingman! Your hero\u2019s evolving in-game attributes, accomplishments, and lineage are stored in perpetuity so that your hero is truly one of a kind.\nAt launch, we'll have two playable races available, tyrax and mari. Each hero unlocks additional game content. With your support, we'll be able to expand the number of playable races available later in 2017. Having multiple figures is not essential; but it enables head-to-head minigames and multi-hero interactions. We've designed our platform so you can play up to 8 playable heroes on a single device at the same time.\nModel and deco sheets from our first prototypes\nThese figures are so smart, that we're still figuring out all they can do! For starters, they can talk to each other in the game as well as when they're disconnected from the game, scan for other figures to automatically access more game content, and offer a wide variety of offline gameplay. But that's just the beginning as more features will be added over time via periodic updates.\nThe FusionCore is a forward compatible, user-removable IoT module that bundles most of the expensive electronics into one self-contained unit. That means additional heroes will be a lot cheaper and future accessories that we haven't even designed yet will be powered by the same FusionCore (making them even more affordable). The FusionCore can also be updated wirelessly over-the-air, allowing us to provide you with regular upgrades and awesome new features and functionality over time.\nIn addition, the game automatically remembers the last hero you played, so you can play on-the-go without your action figure. Any progress you make is then updated when your FusionCore is reconnected.\nEach weapon or accessory unlocks new abilities and adventures. Simply arm your hero and your weapon will instantly appear in the game!\nWeapons and accessories are compatible with all figures\n  Add magical lightstones and defeat enemies in-game to level-up your weapon and wield even greater power.\nIn-game stats and abilities are stored within, making your weapon uniquely yours. A physical sword, for example, maintains XP and magic type, and even lights up according to your stats and enchantments. Two individual weapon packs will be available at launch (in addition to the ones included in the starter packs that are outlined below): the Electro Eel Storm Order weapon and the Cogwheel Cleaver Tech Order weapon. With your help, a full arsenal of weapons will follow.\nWish you could fly? Snap on a flight pack to magically control your in-game character by moving your action figure. Fly to new areas of Tantos where you can access rewards via shortcuts and guide your hero through action-packed minigames. Two flight packs will be available at launch: the Skyrider Storm Order flight pack and the Flynamo Tech Order flight pack. We aim to make a wide range of flight packs, each with different in-game abilities.\n  The Lightseekers trading card game is a standalone physical game that includes 385+ lovingly crafted printed cards, each scannable by the Lightseekers game to unlock in-game effects such as new spells, boosts or even pets that will fight alongside you! Each card is embedded with a one time in-game bonus. \n  Each player in the trading card game takes control of a hero who uses an arsenal of cards, featuring spells, creatures, items, and locations, to defeat their opponents.  \nThe heroes of the game use a specific branch or subset of the magical energy, which is referred to as an \u2018Order\u2019. There are six known Orders that equate to six different playstyles:\nEach Order contains three \u2018Elements\u2019 that generally break down the gameplay to a specific style; aggressive, defensive, or utility-based.  \nIn addition to using cards every turn to influence how your hero reacts or fights, saving cards to play devastating combo cards can be an instant game changer and turn the tide.\nThe game is quick and easy to learn, but also provides great depth for advanced players who wish to experiment with deck building and tactical play using unique mechanics.\n  A few of the colorful TCG characters\nThe card game is intended for 2 players, but supports as many players as you have friends! :) Games typically last 10-15 minutes, but can vary based on deck complexity, skill level, and number of players. \nLightseekers features a tactical real-time combat system that is as interactive as you want it to be, whether that is hardcore dungeon runs or casually leveling while watching your favorite show on the sofa!\nTo support this, the combat system is flexible and caters for a wide variety of personalization. This includes abilities, talents, and control methods, just to name a few!\nAbilities are powerful combat moves that characters use to defeat their foes. Basic abilities are unlocked by leveling up your hero and allocating talent points, while even more powerful abilities come from combos and equipped items.\nStrategic choices need to be made about which abilities you have active at any one time!\nMastering combos is like a minigame within the combat system itself. They are powerful abilities that need charging up before they can be unleashed.  \nAll abilities belong to an Element, and a combo will call out for different ones. If you use abilities that match the current Element of the combo, your combo multiplier will increase and you'll charge it faster! This means that \u2018which ability\u2019 you use and \u2018when\u2019 has even greater importance.\n  Each hero has three unique talent trees, which are divided into multiple tiers. Tiers come with their own choices and also unlock new abilities as you progress through them.\n  A hero has nine slots for equipable items. Items can have various stats and effects and come in a number of different rarities. This makes for millions of unique combinations! Some of these items can also be powered up with lightstones...\nThey come in different types and rarities. Each one has a set of stats from a pool of more than 50, along with other magical effects, that can be unlocked and upgraded in different combinations.\nFor maximum replayability and player tuning, the game supports a dynamic and flexible difficulty system. By default, the difficulty of the game automatically scales to the area, your level, and equipment, but you\u2019re in full control to tweak this up or down as you please. Raising the difficulty will increase the rewards earned and also improves the variety of items and opponents you will encounter.\nAdjust according to how much you like pain\n  Dungeons are designed to be relatively short, challenging combat encounters. There will be dozens of them and each one features multiple unique bosses with their own mechanics and rewards. Based on what equipment you bring, you\u2019ll be able to access different parts of a dungeon, for additional bosses or rewards.\nRobot punch!\n    Lightseekers isn\u2019t all about combat - there are plenty of other adventures and challenges to take part in! Here are a few just to get you started.\nWe want this to be an important aspect of the game, so you\u2019ll find some of the world\u2019s most powerful items will actually be crafted by your own hands!\nIn addition to quests and puzzles, there is an ever-expanding list of side activities and minigames for you to take part in. Some of these take full advantage of the physical action figures, while others are purely digital experiences!\nWe are currently working on the following:\n    Tantos is a massive world that contains many mysteries to discover and hidden achievements to unlock. In your adventures, keep a keen eye out for secret items, areas, and other unique things to collect.\nThe game hasn\u2019t stopped just because you\u2019ve turned it off; your heroes will be able to continue working even while you\u2019re gone. You\u2019ll be able to set them to perform a variety of different tasks, such as gathering resources, running dungeons, or even helping out your friends.  \nWe\u2019re taking this to the next level - if your hero crosses the path of another that is also on an idle mission, they will trade stories and items, and you\u2019ll find out exactly what\u2019s happened and who you\u2019ve met next time you start up the game.\nEvery Mastery level you get allows you to fine-tune your hero further, for infinite improvement. These Mastery levels are shared across all your max level heroes.  \nIt\u2019s not just your hero that improves, so do all of your pets. Each one can be leveled up individually, and improved with lightstones. They even share your Mastery levels!\n Your friends in Lightseekers are more than just names in a list.\nThe game will also feature player-run guilds. You can take on shared challenges, work to better the guild, and eventually we aim to let you kit out your very own guild base!\nLightseekers is more than just a game; it's a commitment. We'll update the game several times per month with new and exciting content, with the community being the driving force behind how the world evolves.\nWe're already a long way into development, with our sights set on a full launch in March 2017. Our plan is to introduce our first two characters as starter packs which include: \nYou'll be able to choose your Hero - mari (includes the Aquadart Crab weapon) or tyrax (comes with the Nitro Hammer weapon). \nFour additional accessories (two weapons and two flight packs) will be available as stand-alone items. In addition, we'll have six trading cards starter packs and booster packs to help expand your collection. In the future, we hope to provide a much broader range of collectible items.  \nSo why Kickstarter? Are you guys not fully funded? The game looks good, we\u2019ve seen the figures and the cards\u2026why do you guys need the money? All good questions and we thought we\u2019d tackle them head on because we\u2019re like that.     \nOk, let\u2019s unpack this in two stages. Why are we doing it? And then Why should you back us? Other than you just think we have a good idea and you like us!\nWhy are we doing Kickstarter? \nWe\u2019re an employee owned company and we\u2019ve gone all-in on Lightseekers. The team has invested significant sums of our own money into getting things this far, and some of us don\u2019t even draw salaries. This isn\u2019t a pre-alpha game, it\u2019s the real deal and all of our technology actually works! All of that stuff is already covered, so what we need to know now is, who\u2019s excited about it? Where do they live? What do they want that we\u2019re not doing yet? \nThis is even more important on a new, unknown world like Lightseekers and critical when you\u2019re dealing with a new type of product that does things differently and doesn\u2019t have a ready comparison. \nWhat we\u2019re hoping to raise is actually a fraction of the cost to achieve our full vision. Any additional support we receive beyond $200k will help out and naturally will be fully re-invested into the studio, allowing us to make more playable characters, more figures and accessories, more connected content, and more awesome gameplay! \nFinally, it\u2019s really important that we are able to gauge demand for potential retail partners by pre-selling some of our products as well as starting to build our community on Kickstarter in advance of the game launch. \nWhy should you back us? \nA safe bet. This isn\u2019t a project in it\u2019s infancy. We\u2019re very far along and about to begin production. As a result, if you pay for a reward package (and we\u2019re fully funded) you will get that package because we\u2019ve already solved the big technical challenges and we\u2019re ready to go. \nYou\u2019re getting a really, really good deal. Each package is different but all of them are a great value for the money and less expensive than post-launch pricing. \nUnique game content. If you back us, you get exclusive stuff and the more people back us, the more exclusive stuff you get. \nYou can guarantee yourself cards and digital action figures at launch. Our plan is to soft launch in the USA first in a limited number of retailers. Therefore, one of the only ways to secure digital action figures or cards at launch is through this Kickstarter campaign. \nHang on\u2026If I don\u2019t want the figures or the cards and the game is free, why should I back you? \nWe think you will want the figures or cards eventually because they are awesome, but let\u2019s explain our thinking here. \nOur packages include valuable Kickstarter exclusive in-game rewards. So back us if you want limited edition and exclusive stuff! \nWe\u2019re getting requests to bring the game to PC, Mac and consoles next. This is great, we want to do that too. We live to give our community what they want, but extra platforms will demand extra work, requiring more people and ultimately more cost. So backing us enables us to expand Lightseekers to more platforms. \nFinally, longer term we plan to make our technology platform available to other game developers and toy makers alike. So, if you would like to see next generation connected play come to your favorite toy or game, then please back this campaign. \nWe've pioneered a groundbreaking platform and we feel we're off to a great start, but we need your help to fund our campaign, make our vision a reality, and create the future of connected play, together. \nWe built this game for you - our fans - so tell us what's fun, and we'll make more of it!\n  To get an optional add-on, click \u201cManage my Pledge\u201d in the top right corner of the Kickstarter page and input the total value of everything you want. For example, if you\u2019re at Physical Pioneer Pack ($60) and want to add on a Card Starter Pack ($15), enter $75 as your total pledge. When the campaign has finished, we will send you a survey. You will be able to select the characters and packs that you want and let us know what you would like for your pledge.\n    PlayFusion is an employee-owned, indie game developer and publisher.\nWe like to think of ourselves as an eclectic group of visionaries, ninjas, scientists, wizards, code poets and gurus from the fields of games, TV & film, toy design, robotics, mechanical and electrical engineering, computer vision and artificial intelligence.  \nOur team has also been fortunate enough to work on several of the best-selling franchises in video game history - around 150 titles over the last 20 years. Our experience stretches from the Dizzy games of the early 90s through to the modern era including Tomb Raider, Street Fighter, RuneScape, Disney Universe and many, many others along the way. We know how to craft great gameplay, immersive quest chains and how to build games that endure, but nothing so far has come close to Lightseekers in terms of ambition, scale, and pioneering innovation. \nWe're really excited to finally share our vision with you and invite you to join us in creating the future of connected play.\nSupport Lightseekers on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to unlock extra rewards! \n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so we're figuring it out as we go.\n\nOur action figures and accessories will be manufactured by TOMY in China. Our cards will be printed in Belgium. There is always risk with items that are shipped internationally. We're working closely with our partners to stay on schedule, but delays are possible.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or other feedback - please let us know via email, social, or on this project page. We want to hear from you so we can make Lightseekers even better together.\n\nSometimes, after a campaign successfully funds, a few backers may need to cancel their pledge before the estimated delivery date.

You control an agency which sits at the center of it all, pulling the strings. Utilize your agents and outwit your rivals to string together the most devious Web of Spies!\nThank you, Agents! \nWEB OF SPIES has successfully funded!\nThanks so much to everyone who helped drive this project forward! Stay tuned for development updates!\nIn WEB OF SPIES you will:\nUse your cards to move your agents across the board\nAcquire new powerful cards to add to your deck\nUse clever effects to sabotage opponents\nEliminate their spies in combat\nThe WINNER is the most dominant agency when any player is eliminated.\nFrom Cole Medeiros, the Designer:\n\"What I enjoy most about the game is watching people come up with clever new ways to outsmart their opponents. The cards and rules may be simple, but how you use them is what creates those really exciting movie moments.\nI love the theme of a world filled with action and intrigue, of spies and secret agents trying to stay one step ahead of each other. I was inspired by spy fiction such as James Bond, Archer, The Bourne Identity and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. If you've ever wanted to open a black briefcase to find secret codes, microfilm and a silenced pistol, I made this game for you!\"\nGame Components (not final):\nSetup is quick and simple. Place the board, shuffle the cards, and give each player their starting stuff (10 set cards, 5 spies, a player mat). Roll to determine a starting region for the agencies and starting assets on the board, and you're ready to go!\nEach turn, you have 5 cards (drawn from your own personal deck) that you can use in multiple ways: \nspend any card to move a spy\nspend any card(s) towards acquiring an asset in a city you control\nuse Sabotage cards to manipulate your opponents\nuse Combat cards to fight another spy!\nThis is where the tactical fun of Web of Spies happens. With just 5 cards, you have a lot of choices to make. Where will you move? What assets will you acquire? Will you attack now, or wait until the moment is just right?\nConflicts are fast and exciting. Not only do you need to eliminate your opponents' agents to win the game, but you might need to do so to secure critical assets for yourself. In the example below, the asset in Manila is contested, which means it cannot be acquired until one agency dominates the city.\nSo either one player brings in backup, or they eliminate the enemy in that city. How would this conflict play out? Well, it might look something like this...\nTo attack, a player reveals an Attack card. The Defender must respond or lose their agent. To do so, they reveal a Defend card with at least one matching symbol. As long as either player can respond from their hand by matching at least one symbol, cards are played back and forth as the battle rages on, telling an epic action story in the process!\nIn this way, combat continues until a player can no longer play response cards (or chooses not to). Either the Attacker fails or the Defender is killed, leaving the asset free to be acquired.\nThere are about 70 different assets which can be added to your agency to develop its unique abilities and arsenal. In this way each player develops a unique set of resources which help define their play style. Balancing your efforts between acquiring useful assets and using them at the right time is the strategy of Web of Spies!\nFor a more detailed walk-through, watch the video below:\nThe rules for Web of Spies are designed to be easy to learn and elegant to use. The booklet itself is only 9 pages, including diagrams and pictures to help you learn even faster. The layout and artwork are not final, but the rules themselves have been heavily tested! Click below to download the PDF and read them yourself!\nAll backers also gain access to the Print and Play files the moment you pledge (please contact me!) I want you to feel good about your pledge and try the game out.\nJonathan H. Liu, GeekDad:\n\"...I did enjoy playing Web of Spies and I hope it reaches its funding. My daughters liked the spy theme and were able to get into character while playing\u2014my 10-year-old even managed to wipe out four spies at once with her Secret Weapon, picked up as a Secret Asset so we didn\u2019t even see it coming. The games I\u2019ve played have had some really fun moments like that, moments that make me excited to play it again.\"\nPlease Note: This is a PREVIEW of the game, so Dan doesn't give his thoughts about the game so much as talk about how it works. To see what people thought of the game play, please see the comments and reviews below.\n \"We just absolutely loved how this game played out. How simple it was to learn. We were playing without a rule book in no time... I absolutely encourage you to check out the kickstarter.\"\n\"This game looks amazing. Risk map with San Juan card currency and Castles of Burgundy goods placement all themed together with an international spy adventure. I cannot say enough good things.\"\nKickstarter Badger at 'The Meeple Mechanic' website selected WEB OF SPIES as one of their Best Kickstarters of the Week! Click here to read more!\nAlex Rosenwald, Board Game Quest:\n\"Any game that provides the opportunity to create a shared narrative and story to go along with game play is one that is successful in our eyes, and Web of Spies delivers in spades in this regard. For instance, I had Armed Thugs (in this case, I said they were the Triads) snatch up an enemy agent from Hong Kong to London (no doubt through a network established when the British were running Hong Kong) to be interrogated and \u201cdisappeared\u201d by MI-5. Being able to string together actions, attacks and defense in the form of a story makes the theme immersive and makes you feel as though you are watching the events in-game transpire in front of you.\"\nRead more here!\nDavid Minken, Connect More:\n\"It's a very light deck-building game that forces player interaction amongst each other. [...] I think its great! I love this symbol matching of battles that occur... It's a bit of a press your luck. A bit of a gauge what that other guy might have in his hand.\"\nIgnacy Trzewiczek of Portal Games:\n\"I played prototype of this game and although it doesn't fit Portal Games line we all had pretty good time - it is quick, simple game of war between spies. Choose your spy and go for a mission - pick your gear, choose location and visit one of the cities on the map. And be there before your opponent!\"\n Matt Griffin, Personal Friend and Designer for Chucklefish Ltd.:\n\"Cole is the best game designer I have ever met. I have played many (if not all) of his board game prototypes and they always impress with how innovative and fluid they are. Don't miss out on Web of Spies, which will surely be the first of many incredible new games published by Cole Medeiros.\"\nBen Seck, Tournament Magic Player and Game Designer:\n\"...a unique twist on the deck building genre, that changes each time you play, [based on] who you play with. Most deck building games eventually turn into different versions of Solitaire, but Web of Spies encourages you to figure out who are your friends... or enemies!\"\nPlaytesters:\n\"I enjoy the real-world scenarios, weapons, and interactions. Feels like I'm right there in South America with my silenced pistol, watching and waiting for the perfect opportunity to take down my enemy spies!\"\n- Kristyn Fredericks, Playtester\n\"...one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. There is something really unique about the simple yet action-packed gameplay and the finely-tuned balance of strategy and luck that comes together in this game. I cannot think of a better board game experience than secretly acquiring a bomb that you use to take down an opposing spy who is flying across continents to try and assassinate you with a silence pistol or rocket launcher. Web of Spies provides a consistently fun, balanced, and unique experience every time I play. Can't wait for the final product!\"\n- Bradley Ross, Playtester\n\"Always my first pick for game nights! It's so well balanced and never the same game twice!\"\n- Anna Marie Clifton\nINFORMANT allows you to stay updated and also gives you access to the Print and Play files (which are available at all levels.)

The reward tiers are based on what I can effectively provide, and the stretch goals (while adding some fun new content to the game) are meant to be cautious and contained. That's because I want to make sure to provide the best possible product to my backers, and the best way to do that is to keep things simple.\nThis is my first Kickstarter campaign. I'm really excited about it and I've done tons of research regarding stretch goals and extra bits. I've included the ones I believe I can effectively deliver on in a timely fashion. Often elaborate stretch goals can prove to be the downfall of a small project like mine, leading to delays, misprints and errors. Ultimately they can distract from what the project is all about.\nI want to bring you the best darn spy game I possibly can, but I'm just one person. I want to focus on delivering on the promise of a great boardgame with quality components and a quick delivery.\nI hope you're with me on this, and I appreciate your support!\nHere's a little video showing some of my wonderful playtesters! They gave me TONS of great feedback which is what has made the game so much fun. I owe them so much for their help, so I thought I'd include a little tribute to them:\n(Btw, I love how several of the games drove players to their feet!)\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\nKristyn, my lovely Wife\nKyle Van Meurs, Art and Graphic Design Input\nDanielle Cheifetz, Camera and Sound\nJono Schaferkotter, Video Editing and Motion Graphics\nMike Humphrey, Historian\nPLAYTESTERS:\nBrad R.  \u2022  Alex M. \u2022  Derek W. \u2022  Matt G. \u2022  Kendra G. \u2022  Anna Marie C. \u2022  Ben S. \u2022  Loren H. \u2022  Kelly O. \u2022  Alexandria B. \u2022  Pam M. \u2022  Bob M. \u2022  Karl N. \u2022  Steven D. \u2022  Jake Y. \u2022  Mike S. \u2022  Jesse B. \u2022  Jason S.\u2022  Anna L.\u2022  Jason G.\u2022  Dylan H.\u2022  Ryan W.\u2022  Eric H\u2022  Allie B.\u2022  Duncan H.\u2022  Michael W.\u2022  Caryn R.\u2022  Jason G.\u2022  Chris B.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is the game could take longer to get to you because of unforeseen shipping difficulties.
