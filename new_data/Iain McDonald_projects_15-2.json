These  ranges cover King Philip's War, the American War of Independence,   Napoleonic Wars, the War of 1812, Western and many others.\nIn May 2020, our first This Very Ground French and Indian War  Kickstarter was launched and was wildly successful, funding 103  miniatures and the new rulebook.\nWith the This Very Ground 2 - French and Indian War Kickstarter, we have had Paul expand the range.\nThe French & Indian Wars featured a lot of skirmishing and   guerilla warfare and our initial offer definitely reflects that. Paul  has sculpted miniatures that you can use to add to your existing models  from our first This Very Ground FIW kickstarter, flesh out an existing  collection, or to get one started.\nOur core packs, and the packs that we unlock via Stretch Goals, are shown here in the campaign section. There are many packs and resin items waiting to be unlocked. \nAdd-Ons\nJust increase your pledge if you would like any of these add-ons with your pledge. It all counts towards the funding and stretch goals.\nThis Very Ground: Victory or Death\n\nAdd Printed Copy for $20 or PDF copy for $15.  This Very Ground: Victory or Death was written by Keith Stine and has been published by Sinister  Laboratories. This new edition of an old favorite was funded during the  first TVG FIW kickstarter campaign and is available as a Softback or  PDF.\n\nTo take a look at images for all the available French and Indian War packs from the first TVG FIW Kickstarter, click here:\nBrigade Games French and Indian War Range\nTo take a look at images for all the available King Philip's War packs, click here:\nBrigade Games King Philips War range\nTo take a look at images for all the available AWI packs, click here:\nBrigade Games American War of Independence range\nTo take a look at images for all the available 1812 packs for the British and Canadians, click here:\nBrigade Games War of 1812 - British and Canadians range\nTo take a look at images for all the available 1812 packs for the U.S., click here:\nBrigade Games War of 1812 - United States range\nSize Comparison\nComparison of BrigadeGames.com miniatures to other 28mm ranges\n\nL to R: Perry, Brigade  Games, Fife and Drum, BG, King's Mountain, BG,  Old Glory 2nd Ed., BG,  Wargames Foundry, BG, Front Rank, BG, Eureka\n\nShipping Costs\nYour Pledge Total does not include Shipping costs.

We are known world-wide as a producer   of very high quality historical and fantasy miniatures. BrigadeGames  is a one-man band (with convention assistance from the BG crew) but we  are pleased to work with many talented people in the  industry, like  Paul Hicks and Keith Stine.\nThe miniatures are sculpted by Paul Hicks, who renowned as a master   of his craft. Paul is BrigadeGames' primary sculptor and has sculpted a   majority of Lon's ranges including: French and Indian War, American  War of Independence, Napoleonics, War of 1812, King  Philip's War,  Western, Pacific War, Pirates, Musketeers, Gladiators,  Atomic Cafe,  China at War, etc.\nMolding and casting is being done in the USA.\nWe have hosted 8 successfully funded Kickstarters - seven with miniatures (some with rulebooks as well), and one for a rulebook.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first 14 packs (68 miniatures) have already been sculpted, are in the USA, and are ready to go through the master and production molding and casting processes. Miniatures for the stretch goals are either sculpted or being sculpted. The masters are ready for molding the resin item. The risks are minimal for BrigadeGames, we have been in business for 21 years and have over 3,000 miniatures that we have had sculpted, molded and cast in the historical and fantasy miniatures market under our own brand. We are using a contract molder and caster that we already have an established relationship and currently molds and casts 75% of our ranges. We do not anticipate any major issues or delays.

He shares his projects on Instagram and YouTube. And now the time has come to do the next step. Together with his wife Marina, they decided to create Miniature Terrain Making Vol. 1.\nThe book contains a wide range of easy & effective techniques to get your terrain ideas on the gaming table. As well as chapters about advanced modeling techniques to make highly realistic terrain and scenery. Of course the book also includes inspirational pictures and exclusive terrain projects.\nBy joining this Kickstarter you receive more than 20 pages with printable templates that boost your crafting to the next level.\nTechniques & Materials\nModel making materials like foam, different types of foliage, or balsa wood. This section explains how you can use specific tools and materials effectively to create stunning looking terrain for your collection.\nThe following example shows different ways how you can make walls of XPS-Foam.\nTerrain Tutorials\nA SiFi battlefield, dramatic rock formations, a grimdark forest, ancient pyramids, or deadly swamps: Of course the book offers a great variety of projects, including detailed process descriptions.\nThis terrain for example is mostly made of cardboard. The tutorial illustrates techniques to make scenery using materials you already have at home. You can even use the packaging of the book and get started.\nTemplates\nTo simplify the building process you get 20 pages with templates of items like walls, windows, paving, or doors. You can print them and craft complex shapes that make your models look cutting-edge. The templates can be used in various ways and can be combined with different building techniques like layering cardboard or engraving foam. (More templates will get unlocked by reaching more stretch goals)\nGuest Articles\nOur first guest in the book is Michael from the well-known YouTube channel Tabletop Workshop (TWS). He is also the author of the famous book `Tabletop Terrain From XPS Foam \u2013 Buildings\u00b4. Michael will share some of his most improved techniques and tips exclusively for you.\nInspiring Terrain Pictures\nAnd of course, the book provides inspiring projects that have been crafted with patience and passion.\nThe goal is to keep this Kickstarter simple. The more backers participate, the more content you will receive. That means: More pages, more templates, and more extras!\nAll books will be delivered with tracking and priority.\nPlease note as well: Your pledge on Kickstarter covers your reward and shipping fee. The country-specific VAT and other taxes or import fees collected by the local authorities are not included!\nWe are planning to ship your copy of the book by December  2021. We will keep you updated!  Stay safe and healthy!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith her professional traits as an experienced graphic designer and artist Marina will create a unique book. \n\nPhilipp is fascinated about making terrain models for more than 25 years now.

As a new recruit your abilities and resources are limited so you'll need your wits about you to try and survive. Push your luck to press deeper into the unknown or play it safe and live to fight another day. The choice is yours!\nThe game includes a deck of rooms that you must explore. Some will contain harmless frog swarms, whereas others will hide dangerous frog monsters or even more notorious foes from Hellboy's past! The differently coloured dice represent your limited resources and you must choose carefully when selecting which ones to roll. If you run out of dice or wounds, it's the end of your turn.\n The thrilling Dice Game isn\u2019t the only way to back this Kickstarter because we\u2019re also funding FOUR brand-new expansions for Hellboy: The Board Game. Designed by original developers, Needy Cat Games, each of these expansions builds on the tension-packed, co-operative experience of Hellboy: The Board Game but turns the danger up to 11, thanks to the all-new optional Ragnarok mode.\n\nThat\u2019s right, saving the world just got a whole lot tougher as enemies become stronger and more difficult to defeat. Ragnarok mode can be used to offer an additional challenge to not only these new expansions, but the core game as well. It's perfect if you've breezed through the previous Case Files and want an even tougher experience!\nPlease note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\nYou\u2019ve played through the core game, Darkness Calls and The Wild Hunt. Now it\u2019s time to bring the saga to a close with The Storm and The Fury. Armed with a certain magical sword (no spoilers here, just in case), Hellboy must face his toughest foe yet: Nimue in her dragon form. This is the biggest miniature we\u2019ve made for Hellboy: The Board Game and it\u2019s not going to be easy to take her down.\n3D renders of miniatures.\nThe Storm and the Fury includes new miniatures, an epic Case File, new Deck of Doom cards, new Encounter Cards and a new playable version of Hellboy.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\n\n\nHELLBOY AND THE B.P.R.D.\nBut that\u2019s not all for Hellboy: The Board Game fans because with the storyline complete, it\u2019s time to move onto a whole new chapter inspired by the B.P.R.D. graphic novels. These three new expansions focus on a different element to make your games of Hellboy more unpredictable and action-packed than ever before.\nWith Hellboy gone, the B.P.R.D. faces a range of horrifying new minions as the world descends into chaos. The Hell on Earth expansion introduces new minions to add to your missions. From swarming Crickets, to demons and Ogdru-Hem mutants, you\u2019re going to wish you were only facing the Frog Monsters from the core game. This expansion includes 15 minion miniatures, the Nesting Site Case File and Encounter cards, plus all the minions can be mixed into existing missions using the previously released B.P.R.D. Archives expansion.\nIf only it were just the minions you needed to deal with... but they're the least of your concerns. In Pandemonium some all-new bosses are here to try and end the world. This expansion includes The Flood Case File, Enemy cards, Unexpected Threat Hammerhead card, Encounter cards and Boss Behaviour Cards.\nWith all that, you\u2019re going to need some new heroes and the B.P.R.D. is here to save the day. End of Days includes new playable agents \u2013 Ted Howards, Sledgehammer, Evolved Abe Sapien and Flaming Liz Sherman \u2013 plus the Eviction Notices Case File, character-specific Deck of Doom cards and Requisition Cards. Use these new agents to tackle the new expansions or return to your favourite missions from the original game and play them again with a fresh cast of heroes.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nCombined with the original Kickstarter or the core game, these new missions make Hellboy: The Board Game infinitely replayable. Please note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\n\n\n Tabletop Gaming magazine plays a prototype version of Hellboy: The Dice Game.\nJames from Needy Cat Games and B.P.R.D. consultant Edwin, talk about what you can expect from the new expansions! Rob from Mantic's audio does get better... we promise, plus all the important stuff comes from James and Edwin anyway.\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. There is a risk that shipping may increase if any new tariffs or taxes are imposed for certain countries. We are VAT registered in the UK and will pay VAT for orders in the UK and EU countries.\nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\n\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Syria, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.

With this project, the expansions are all written and approved by Dark Horse, the miniatures and game components are approved by Dark Horse. Meanwhile, the Dice Game is also approved by Dark Horse.\n\nWe predict that we will begin shipping in June 2022 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes. COVID is still causing some issues with manufacturing and this could also impact the final shipping date.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 17 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War, DreadBall Second Edition, Star Saga: The Eiras Contract, Warpath, TerrainCrate, Kings of War: Vanguard, Hellboy: The Board Game and TerrainCrate 2. We currently have two outstanding Kickstarters, League of Infamy (mostly shipped) and Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game (digital rewards have been delivered, physical rewards are due to be shipped this year). \n\nREFUNDS\nUpon request refunds may be given within 14 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Of course, we will use our discretion on a case by case basis. Completing the pledge manager is the ONLY way for us to confirm your shipping address and pledge details, as well as making sure we hit the production timelines.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that you will pay for any shipping and any import or other duties required in your country.

We also cannot ship to PO boxes and you must provide an alternative shipping in this circumstance.\n\nAlthough we are aiming to deliver the Hellboy: The Board Game expansions to Kickstarter backers before the game is available at retail, production and shipping delays can lead to delivery at the same time or following the retail release.

The city is bright, magical, and wonderful above; below, the only sources of stability, community, and aid are the Gangs. Unstable magic, outdated Cybertech, and garbage from the overcity become invaluable commodities underneath. The species dwelling there \u2013 dwarves, goblins, humans, orcs, yetin, and elves \u2013 fight among themselves and each other: alliances formed and broken as just another day\u2019s work.\nIn Gangs of the Undercity, these gangs are represented by models you choose and paint. Your play area becomes a neighborhood in the Undercity, equal parts futuristic, wondrous, and crumbling from neglect. Abandoned buildings, noodle shops, power plants, feral beasts, and jury-rigged computer interfaces exist to be exploited or overcome. Defeat rivals using your wits, your gang, and a little luck.\nWhether you take control of a pre-existing gang, shape it to your own style, or make your own gang from scratch, you\u2019ll soon be discovering the secrets of the Undercity, all while claiming and reclaiming turf.\nYour gang\u2019s reputation, influence, and future depend on you!\n\nThe Gangs of the Undercity Two-Player Starter Set includes two of the most influential gangs in the Undercity: \nthe rag-tag Flaming Skulls, an aggressive street gang of orcs, humans, dwarves and more;\nthe militaristic Valkyrs, an-all elf gang hitting the streets of Neo-Babylon\u2019s Undercity to rebuild their lost power base.\nThe Valkyrs, led by Adelante and her enforcer, Mormeghul, are exiles from their elven homeland. Having fought for their country, they were dismissed and shunned because of their brutality. The Valkyr Company fled with their Sorcier General to the Undercity of Neo-Babylon, where they bide their time. They don\u2019t care what or who they destroy, they have formed their own nobility, and when they are strong enough, they\u2019ll retake their birthright. \nThe Valkyrs gang includes:\nAdelante (elf sorcerer)\nMormeghul (elf cyber-enforcer)\nMordo (elf sniper)\nSparrow (elf ganger)\nAnsa (elf pistoleer)\nAcid (elf ganger)\n ***\nThe Flaming Skulls, led by Vengeance and the gutterwitch Char, are what people think of when they picture out-of-control gangs running amok in the Undercity. They don\u2019t stay in their own turf, they set fires, destroy property, and take anything that is easy. They stay on the offensive. Using fear and explosions to dominate and intimidate, the Flaming Skulls attract the misfits and losers that don\u2019t fit in elsewhere. If they have a plan, they don\u2019t show it, but woe to anyone who gets in their way.   \nThe Flaming Skulls gang includes:\nVengeance (orc yojin)\nChar (human witch)\nSpur (dwarf breacher)\nDomino (human cyber-junkie)\nSnapper (ogre gunner)\nSinge (goblin sneak thief)\n***\nAdditional Gangs\nThese Gang models are not in the 2 Player Starter Set, but have been unlocked and will be added to the Rulebook alongside the Valkyrs and Flaming Skulls.\n*Note: there may not be art or minis unlocked to represent the entire gang, but whether by stretch goal unlock, or development down the road, we will fill out these gangs just like the Valkyrs and Flaming Skulls*\nLawjacks\n The Lawjacks are the faceless police that protect the Overcity\u2019s economy, elites, and social status quo.  Their motto is providing \"peace through obedience,\" but whatever that might have once meant to folk in the Undercity, it now only serves as a warning. The Undercity was abandoned by the rule of law long ago. But that isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t any Lawjacks in the Undercity. Along with Lawjack Golems - magically constructed juggernauts \u2013 Lawjacks from above often descend to the depths despite no official sanction. The only group able to come and go from the Undercity as they please, some realized the profitability in illicit activity without fear of prosecution. So whatever they might be in the Overcity, to the Undercity, the Lawjacks are just another violent gang.\nThe Lawjacks Gang includes:\nLawjack Captain\nLawjack Enforcer\nLawjack Soldier\nLawjack Rookie\nArmored Golem\n***\nShadow Caste\n The Shadow Caste does not discriminate based on blood or birth, but recruits from all species and walks of life. Despite their home in the Undercity, they are not so desperate as the other denizens. They actually prefer the undercity for its lawless nature and freedom from authority\u2019s eye. Led by the mysterious Demon Kober, they\u2019ve been around at least as long as Neo-Babylon has, but if you believe their propaganda; they are a much older order. Each member carries an heirloom blade, passed down from former Caste members, which is but one tool in their arsenal as they carry out their duties of theft and, if the Demon calls for it, assassination.\nThe Shadow Caste includes:\nDemon Kober (male human)\nKartika (female elf)\nDeaavh (female orc)\nVadok (male goblin)\nPlaie (female dwarf)\nTuerer (human foot soldiers)\n***\nThe Bulls of Heaven\n The Bulls of Heaven are a gang composed mostly of yetin and their traditional allies. They lean more toward the gang-as-family model, lending itself to strong bonds between the members and their community, where they care for all types, even the smaller folk, equally.\nWhile not strongly hierarchical, each family has a leader, but the relationship is not coercive. Decisions outside of combat are often held collectively. Physical prowess is respected over gunslinging, thus the gang has a preference for heavy and blunt melee weapons. The Bulls seem to be the most spiritual of the gangs as well; even their name comes from the scriptures, where Gilgamesh killed the gods\u2019 sacred servant \u2013 the Bull of Heaven.\nDespite their fearsome appearance, they are one of the \"less violent\" gangs. Preferring to use threat of berserk yetin rampages over actual force, the Bulls never allow others to intimidate them or their people.\nThe Bulls of Heaven include:\nChirashree (yeti)\nChiye-Tanka (sasquatch)\nDorje (cybered yeti)\n40/40 (almaslar)\nNu (rogue golem)\nRaz (ogre)\nFragging Unicorns Games is Kickstarting this project to fund the launch costs of Gangs of the Undercity. Pre-production costs and development have already been covered, which will allow us to put our game into production immediately. We hope to make enough through the Kickstarter to recover these sunk costs, and to put down deposits on other amazing upcoming projects\nSince the game is nearly 100% complete, we look forward to shipping to our backers as soon as possible; barring any major problems we are planning to deliver before December, 2020. We also promise to fulfill any and all pledges before any Gangs of the Undercity products are on sale \u2013 backers will get their stuff before anyone else!\nThe Two-Player Starter Set gives you everything you\u2019ll need to get into Undercity gang wars with a friend as soon as possible.\nMODELS\n12 highly detailed gang miniatures, including 6 Valkyrs and 6 Flaming Skulls gangers.

Between Ansa's cool headed and battle ready pose and Char's pure rage and aggressive stance and expression it was a blast to put color to them and really see 'em come to life\" - Nonsense Painting\n\"This mini's dynamic and aggressive pose was so expressive and a blast to paint. Can't wait to get my hands on more !\" - Dev Paints\n\"These are really wonderful and enjoyable minis to paint. The sculpts are incredibly detailed and dynamic with a real sense of character. The casting quality is fantastic and I'm incredibly excited to paint more.\" - Agent Meeple\n\"Domino practically painted himself, with his ready for havoc attitude. He was a fantastic sculpt and honor to paint up.\" - Brushforhire\n\"I really enjoyed painting up Acid, the great detail made bringing him to life a joy; right down to his personalized knuckledusters. Fragging Unicorns have done an awesome job with these minis, they have a bunch of personality, are loads of fun to paint & are of a great quality. ^.^\" - Electric Eve\n\"I really enjoyed getting to work on Adelante! The miniature is high quality with a lot of nice detail and character. She was a joy to paint - especially with some fun cyberpunk colors!\" - Sullivan Mini Studio\nHere's what the players are saying about the game:\n\"as a fast-paced and brutal skirmish game GotU blends sci-fi tech with magic seamlessly, it's strength lies in the Grit mechanic which forces you to become a gambler on your tactics and strategy constantly offering choices. Do you double down and risk it all or accept a small loss for greater gains later? It is the lifeblood of your Gang be careful you don't bleed out in the Undercity\" - Gerry mcCabe, OnTableTop/Beasts of War\n\"I've had the opportunity to playtest this at multiple phases of development. It is SO much fun. Exactly what I want in a cyberpunk gang skirmish miniatures game!\"\n\"Awesome game with a great setting and a lot of love put into it. Super excited for the Kickstarter!\"\n\"Had a lot of fun playing in the public beta, excited to see this launch soon!\"\n\"Played as part of the playtest and this has easily been the most fun I've had with a miniatures wargame. I love how accessible it is while still having strategic play options.\"\n\"Easy to explain rules, quick and dynamic gameplay\"\n\"I really liked the variety of attacks in a given match, between spells and breaching. It makes the battles very dynamic.\"\nArtists\nOur layout artist is Anna Urbanek, and you can find her here: https://www.doubleproficiency.com/\nOur Gang Models have been lovingly sculpted by  Kieran Russell.

All of our manufacturing is US-based, so mismanagement and delays on production are minimal. New unlocked sculpts will take time to create and produce, so will take longer to ship than the base game.\n\nOur the risks and challenges are as follows:\n1) We don't make our goal, and are unable to produce the game.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, most likely due to Covid-related slow-downs. However, we have multiple suppliers for our components, at least one US-based company for each component, so mismanagement and delays on production are minimal. We won't sacrifice fulfillment or punctuality just to save a few bucks.\n3) We may change a component, box, specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model. In these cases, the change will be always towards a higher quality, not the other way around. It could be that we just find a way to improve something, or perhaps a particular model needs to be shifted slightly to match the character, etc. \n4) New unlocked sculpts will take time to create and produce, so will take longer to ship than the base game.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount.

However, for those who want more, you will be able to order a 3x plates pack!\nSo why improve the RGG 360\u00b0 miniature handle? Because the additional features make it the most user-friendly holder for miniature painting. \nWhat's new?\n Swappable cap: You can now paint multiple miniatures with just one holder (additional caps sold separately).\n Magnetic dock: Secure your WIP miniature thanks to the magnet inside the holder. \nLoaded with cool features!\n Ergonomic handle to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue.\n 360\u00b0 rotation to offer more control and help you achieve a better painting at every angle. Effortlessly!\n Stick them all! Round, square, small, large, exotic bases\u202610 to 50mm you can stick them all.\n Reviewers and thousands of painters truly love it and are already using it daily.\n Pledge and get one FREE copy of our miniature painting book written by Angel Giraldez.\nWhen painting miniatures, you cannot hold your miniatures with bare hands: You need a miniature handle. Today, there is no straightforward solution on the market: they are either too clumsy, not ergonomic, or overly expensive.\nThat's why last year we created RGG 360\u00b0, the first natural ergonomic handle for miniature painting.\nWith our unique design, you are able to hold your miniature for long and comfortable painting sessions. No more cramps, no more unnecessary movement, just you having fun painting.\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been designed by painters for painters and developed with the feedback of pro-painters.\nIt is already considered the best paint handle available.\nThe first naturally ergonomic handle\nA simple straight handle does not fit your hand comfortably. To achieve high quality when painting, you need to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue. RGG 360\u00b0 is slightly curved and designed to feel completely natural in your hand. That\u2019s why the sculpted handle has been designed to sit comfortably in the hand. No odd shapes.\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only natural ergonomic handle designed to create the best connection between you and your miniature, helping you adopt the best painting position and minimizing unnecessary movements.\nThe added benefits are greater stability, better precision, and minimized fatigue so that you can paint for hours.\nAdopt the best painting handle, for a pleasant, fun, and perfect painting session\nExhilarating 360\u00b0 rotation\n360\u00b0 rotation axis is not an afterthought, but rather it is inherent to the natural ergonomic design. The 360\u00b0 rotation is highly intuitive and easy to adjust, allowing you access to any part of your miniature quickly and reliably. The level of resistance is such that the RGG 360\u00b0 is smooth and easy to rotate when needed. \nRGG 360\u00b0 can rotate easily, yes, but once you stopped the rotation, it will just stay in place. You don\u2019t need to hold it with your thumb\nThanks to our custom made mounting putty, you can fix a large range of miniatures from your favorite games! The mounting putty is safe and reusable\u2014in fact, we have been using the same putty for months!\nRound, square, small, large, exotic bases\u2026miniature bases come in many shapes. When designing RGG 360\u00b0, we tried several different physical designs and all kinds of sticky materials, but they were either non-adaptive, clumsy, heavy, non-reusable... but they all had their disadvantages.\nSo, we have created a custom made mounting putty, as the perfect mounting solution for your miniatures: Reusable, adaptable, and safe. We have been using the putty for over a year now, and it has never dried out.\nWith 15 grams included with the handle, you have 3x the amount needed to stick your miniatures.\nOne RGG360\u00b0- Multiple miniatures\nSwappable cap: You can now paint multiple miniatures with just one holder. Switch easily between your miniatures. Just remove the top cap and place a new one on your RGG360\u00b0 painting handle. (additional caps sold separately)\n Perfect for batch painting! \nRGG 360\u00b0 caps are made of strong ABS plastic and can be used for a long time.\nImproved stability \nMagnetic dock: Secure your WIP miniature thanks to the magnet inside the holder.\nThe metal plate comes with a 3M adhesive on the backside. You can easily attach the metal plate to your desk or workbench. Once it is secured, your docking system is ready.\nEach RGG 360\u00b0Handle includes the following: \n1 RGG360\u00b0 Magnet / Blue Edition, 15 g of orange mounting putty and 1 metal plate. \n Redgrassgames team up with Angel Giraldez!\nPledge during the Kickstarter campaign to get one FREE copy of our miniature painting book written by a true master, Angel Giraldez. \nAngel Giraldez started as a studio painter where he introduced his popular and innovative painting method to the world.

The first K.S. was a very complex project, coordinating many di\ufb00erent suppliers worldwide. But it was a big success with more than 8,000 backers. We have learned from this experience how to create a technical product with a lot of backers from all around the world. Now, we have successfully delivered our second Kickstarter campaign, RGG 360\u00b0 (first version). The product is proven and well designed. For our third Kickstarter campaign, we do not expect any issues since the production is underway and successfully tested by influencers and pro-painters around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe\u2019ve resorted to stronger plastics, reusable putty, and a very durable axis made of metal.

Just like any of our products.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur main production facility is located in the E.U. for an optimal supply chain. The factory meets the ISO 14001 standard that sets out the requirements for an environmental management system. Following these guidelines helps the factory to improve environmental performance through a more e\ufb03cient use of resources and waste reduction.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe have worked to minimize the overall weight of packaging to reduce transportation impact.

It only made sense that when we wanted a French & Indian Wars range to go alongside our launch of This Very Ground: Victory or Death ruleset that we ask Paul to turn his talents to it.\nThe French & Indian Wars featured a lot of skirmishing and guerilla warfare and our initial offer definitely reflects that. Paul has sculpted six packs (each pack has 6 minis) that you can use to flesh out an existing collection, or to get one started. \nOur core packs, and the packs that we unlock via Stretch Goals, are shown below.\nPLAY\n\nWe had a quick chat with Paul Hicks about the things he has sculpted for us, the way he gathers reference material, and his favorite minis in this range. \n These packs, along with any others that are unlocked during the campaign, can be added to your pledge level by clicking on the \"Manage your pledge\" button, and then increasing your total pledge amount by the value of the packs you would like to add.\n\n\nThis Very Ground: Victory or Death - Wargaming rules by Keith Stine\n This Very Ground: Victory or Death was written by Keith Stine and will be published by Sinister Laboratories.

Both of these are trial prints so final version may differ, they will be used to fix minor errors like the off center images on the box sides or small corrections in the book.\nCLASH of spears is a fast paced, warband level, wargame to be played in 4\u2019 by 4\u2019 tables over 1 to 3 hours.It was designed to be fast and intuitive, while providing realistic feel, tactical depth and high impact decision making.\nGritty and personal, CLASH relies on command points and fatigue management to represent the chaos and desperation of small scale conflict.  Skills and traits are used to represent the different  specialties and fighting styles of the ancient world.\nCLASH moves away from the massed ranks approach of traditional ancients rule sets. It has been thought of specifically for small actions, allowing units to close and open ranks as needed, and according to their preferred fighting style.\nVery much a game designed by wargamers for wargamers CLASH is able to achieve tactical depth through the value of combination of arms and terrain management, rather than resorting to board game mechanics and game specific external aids.\nCLASH of spears is initially set in the Rise of Rome and the Punic wars. Its 12 army  lists have been extensively playtested by 80+ people in seven countries over the last 9 months, to guarantee balanced gaming whether in club or competitive environments. \nThe initial army lists are: Roman Republic, Carthaginians, Lowland Gallic Tribes (Veii), Highland Gallic Tribes (Ligurians),  Greek Colonies (Taranto/Syracuse), Iberians, Lusitanians, Celtiberians, Italian Hilltribes (Samnites), Italian Lowland Tribes (Campanians/Etruscans), Numidians, Macedonian expedition (Pyrrhus)\nBut with CLASH\u2019s release we will provide full visibility into the point system and guidelines for players to quickly adapt CLASH to any period or armies of their liking through online support.\nThe CLASH of spears Ruleset is a hard cover 160 pages, offset printed in full color  in the finest quality.\nWarband Boxed Sets\nCLASH of Spears is proud to have partnered with Victrix ltd to provide ready to play warbands with a variety of troops and possible warband combinations. Our warband boxed sets combine Victrix's in skirmish level warbands of 45+ miniatures and 4 to 6 different unit types!\nAll miniatures come unpainted, require light assembly and do not have bases or transfers included.\nCarthaginian Boxed Set\nFounded in 812 BC Carthage has been a major power in the Mediterranean for centuries. Carthage\u2019s army is a melting pot of different peoples and fighting styles. From Numidian skirmishers to Iberian guerrilla infantry, a Carthaginian leader has many different tools to surprise and outwit his opponent.  But its core of mercenary veterans ensures that a Carthaginian force can also push through by sheer strength, when necessary. So choose your forces wisely and uphold the glory of Carthage!\nRoman Republic Boxed Set\nIn the 4th century BC the Rome has gained its independence and is now expanding to challenge both Greece and Carthage for hegemony over the Mediterranean sea.\nRome's citizen army is anchored on its strong and versatile heavy infantry. Experienced Velites lead the way with javelin harassment while Hastati and Principes provide Rome with a strong offensive force that can break through any line. Finally the Triari, armed with thrusting spear and heavily armored, provide a veteran reserve that can always be relied on. Rome also uses italian allies that specialize in guerilla tactics and can provide a nasty surprise to unsuspecting opponents. So gather up your men Roman and uphold the Republic! \nGallic Warband Boxed Set\nBy the 4th century BC, the Celtic tribes that had originated in central Europe had greatly expanded having reached Spain, France and even crossed the Alps into Italy. As avid fighters Gauls formed part of most conflicts in the Mediterranean, either directly or a s eager mercenaries.\nA Gallic warband relies first and foremost on the courage and ferociousness of its warriors, especially its Noble cast that is willing to lead the warband into the fray. Few can withstand the Gallic charge but a Gallic chieftain must be careful as his men can also tire quickly and become vulnerable if their impetus is spent. A strong Noble cavalry though, can be the perfect relief force to ensure that the warband gets a respite when needed. So Chieftain, lead your men forward...for Plunder and Glory! \nCLASH of Spears T-shirt\nCLASH of Spears t-shirt is here! To add this reward (any Pledge II+) just add $13.70 (thirteen dollars and seveny cents) to your pledge and send me a message with your size (S, M, L, XL, XXL). \nThis will not add any cost to your shipping nor will it delay your shipping in any way.

Although new to game publishing we are experienced gamers/designers and accomplished businessmen who will ensure this project is successfully fulfilled.\nWe may be a small outfit but we have poured our hearts, souls and minds into this project, to make a truly engaging and well thought out rule-set. And through the early success of the game system and the zealous support of our growing community, we have been able to expand it to a full game with excellent miniatures and more. This great adoption also ensures that CLASH will continue to be supported and expanded for years to come.\nBy turning to KickStarter we are giving our community an opportunity to jointly support CLASH of Spears. And by us knowing the level of that support before the production run, we can offer more value for the money, to everyone in that community.

These armies will be produced in March and delivered in April. Also exclusively containing VICTRIX LTD miniatures of their existing line but combined in multiple troop types in one box.\nLots of people have asked us to include them as an option in the Kickstarter. So we will.\nWe wanted to make this KS a minimum risk one for you, where everything we have offered so far is done, fully defined, and ready for production. To be delivered shortly after the Kicstarter. These new boxed sets are still being finalized, so after thinking a lot about this we have decided to offer the option to pledge for these armies BUT with a big warning disclaimer:\nWARNING: different from other things in the KS, these three armies are still in design phase. Exact contents may change (while keeping to 40+ minis) and delivery is expected for April but might be May (could also be sooner). If you are fine with these terms, and still want to pledge for an extra set/s, you will be able to do it in the survey.\nShipping: You will have to pay any additional shipping at the moment of delivery which we will arrange separate from the KS. As always we will try to minimize that cost.\nSo if in spite of my warnings you still want to reserve your spot at the KS discount for one of these beauties\u2026here they are, as we know them today. Details may change but basically this will be the composition of the armies.\nIberian Boxed Set (can also be Celtiberians or Lusitanians) - 42 minis\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Scutarii\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Scutarii\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Veterans (armored)\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Veterans (armored)\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Cavalry\n\u00b7 6 x Iberian Caetrati\n\u00b7 6 x Balearic Slingers\nImage doe not represent exact contents of the boxed set\nGreek Colony Boxed Set (e.g. Taranto) - 44 minis\n\u00b7 8 x Untrained Hoplites (unarmored)\n\u00b7 8 x Citizen Hoplites\n\u00b7 8 x Veteran Hoplites\n\u00b7 6 x Cretan Archers\n\u00b7 8 x Peltasts\n\u00b7 6 Noble Tarantine Cavalry (light cav)\nImage doe not represent exact contents of the boxed set\nItalian Hill Tribes (e.g. Samnites) \u2013 42 minis\n\u00b7 6 x Italian Tribesmen (unarmored)\n\u00b7 6 x Italian Tribesmen (unarmored)\n\u00b7 6 x Italian Warriors (Partial Armor)\n\u00b7 6 x Italian Warriors (Partial Armor)\n\u00b7 6 x Italian Veterans (Full Armor)\n\u00b7 6 x Italian cavalry (will be a combination of Helenic bodies and Italian heads)\n\u00b7 6 x Tribal Slingers\nImage doe not represent exact contents of the boxed set\nHow do you pledge for one of these armies?\nSimple, choose a higher pledge to have the extra number of boxed sets you want. When survey comes you will be able to choose these as an option.\nSo here we go, for most of you our Kickstarter will still be all stuff that we have completed and ready to go. For hardcore CLASHERS that know us well, and are willing to pledge something that is still in the works, you get the chance too.\nExpected Delivery: Early birds and all pledges II have a delivery date of February. Other pledges will be delivered in the order that they were submitted (if pledge survey is completed within 1 week of closing), so many of the non-early bird pledges may still be delivered in the February date.\n Attention! If you are on a budget and shipping costs are critical to you, look at the early bird pledge level II. We are subsidizing shipping so that we will have FREE SHIPPING in USA and all of EUROPE. Canada will have 4$ shipping and rest of world $8. This means we have VERY limited margin on early bird pledge II...but we really want everyone to have access to the game!\nIn order to keep everything organized and efficient, we allow a maximum of 1 delivery location per backer. Due to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, if you wish us to ship to P.O boxes you will be charged for additional shipping if it needs to be shipped again.\nPledger will be responsible for customs, tariffs and taxes. We do ship both from the US and the UK to minimize any impact of this.\nFREE SHIPPING OPTION\nWe at fighting hedgehog will be attending both Salute and Adepticon early in 2020 and will be happy to bring the game to YOU there if you prefer. Also we will host a day of \"pick up your game\" in our hometown of Atlanta in February. This will eliminate the shipping cost for you and we will refund you any costs added in the KS for shipping. Options to receive your pledge reward in person and free of shipping:\nHomemeet: February 15th , Atlanta, GA, USA\nAdepticon: March 25th, Schaumburg, Il, USA\nSalute: April 18th , London ,UK", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCLASH of Spears is brought to you by Fighting Hedgehog, a young but driven game publishing company founded by brothers Alvaro and Francisco Erize.

Which allows us to give you the very short delivery dates we are committing to and reduces your risk as an investor.\n\nRisks exist of course. We have short deadlines and force majeure could delay our delivery. Especially if Brexit moves faster than expected. \n\nWe believe production risks are very low due to the book already being finished and Victrix's exemplary reputation in production of it's miniatures.\n\nDelivery has a higher risk and different factors could affect delivery dates. Brexit being the biggest unknown today. Still we have used our extensive supply chain experience to set up a redundant logistics network to minimize this risk.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "I - Citizen", "descp": "You get our eternal thanks and get to follow the project.

I am the artist and owner of the campaign. It's a notorious hazard for comic creators to find a reliable artist, as they are often unprofessional and scatterbrained! Many pages are already complete, but there are several more left to go, as well as all the formatting and lettering. \n\nSince I am the owner/illustrator there is no chance of an unforeseen catastrophe occurring on account of a flighty and tempermental artist, but there is lots of work for me! Luckily, I have worked as a professional illustrator and comic artist for 20+ years, and I have produced full comics which already have been up for sale on the news stand. I am comfortable with the workload, and know the process well.\n\nAs a freelancer, I understand the importance of establishing and maintaining trust with clients, and I can say with enthusiasm and pride that I have never missed a deadline. On a current online freelancing platform, I have a \"Top Rated' ranking, and maintain a confidence score above 95% always.\n\nAs far as the writing is concerned, all the scripts are complete and submitted to the Green Devil Properties offices. In terms of risks and challenges, you can be confident that should Strange Adventures be funded, the comic will be produced smoothly. \n\nI work as an illustrator full-time, and should this campaign be successful, I will switch my work load entirely onto finishing Strange Adventures.

Based upon period art from Hans Holbein's Dance of Death (\"Totentanz\"), Renaissance, wood block prints from the 1500\u2019s, we are creating skeleton Landsknechts that have that old world and Oldhammer feel. \nThe boys are back in town! Painted Generals of the Apocalypse set.\nPeter Breugels \"Triumph of Death\" is the key inspiration for this line of miniatures,\nWith the help of sculptor Drew Day Williams, who shared my passion to create a range of 28mm skeletons in the vein of Renaissance artists like Holbein, D\u00fcrer and Peter Breugel, we Kickstartered the original set of Triumph of Death (ToD) range of miniatures, but knew that we would not be able to do everything in one go. Death (and gamers) always demand more...\nYour armies can be legion!\nThanks to backers like you, the first Triumph of Death Kickstarter was a smashing success, but we could only produce so many troop types and command figures. Many previous backers requested other troop types to round out their armies and I heard the clarion call! This is where you come in - with your help we can expand the ToD line of miniatures into a fully realized selection of infantry, cavalry and artillery models. You can command legions of the damned (damned smart looking, that is).\nPainted crossbow unit with pavise\nExample of 45 and 60 degree pike poses\nWIP Cannon and Crew\n The Pledge Guide: Knowing your way around Death - pack options\nThere are 5 options for skeleton army units and 3 command packs. Each option is based on one of the following:\nInfantry = 10 miniatures per pack\n Cavalry = 5 horses and riders per pack\nArtillery = 1 cannon and 3 crew per pack\nCommand = 3 miniatures per pack\nFor all pledges other than the Collection of Death, you simply mix and match the units that you want.  By popular demand, I also added in the option to pick units and command from the first Triumph of Death Kickstarter (ToD - Classic), which can be used as your pack choices. \nStretch Goals\nYou love them - we love them! Triumph of Death II has some sweet Stretch Goals waiting to be summoned from the depths.  All Stretch Goals are designed to be freebies for all who back a pledge that states \"Eligible for Stretch Goals\". \n\n\nNew Unit Descriptions In-Depth \nSkeleton Infantry (for Pike or Spear)\nDesigned open-handed, this pack includes a mix of 60, 45 and 90 degree arc poses to create variety and allow for \u201cranking up\u201d as pike or spear units would.\n10 skeletons - open handed \nStyrene plastic rods for pikes or spears included!\nSkeleton Infantry with Crossbows and Pavises\n 1 pack of 10 skeletons firing crossbows (3 poses)\n 5 pavise shields for the front rank\nSkeleton Cavalry with Darts\nDesigned open-handed so you can also use them with spears or other hand weapons should you wish.\n5 skeletons \u2013 open-handed (2 poses)\nThrowing Darts\n5 skeleton horses (2 poses)\nSkeleton Cavalry with Bows\nLight cavalry ready to harry any unsuspecting army.  Well \u2026mostly unsuspecting, because they are fighting skeletons!\n5 skeletons - firing bows (2 poses)\n5 skeleton horses (2 poses)\nSkeleton Artillery - Cannon and Crew\nWell the cannon is not skeletal, but the crew are dead shots!\n1 cannon\n3 skeletal crew\n Concept Art \nHere's some of the concept art that went into the making of Triumph of Death II. In particular, the cannon and crew currently being sculpted. \nconcept for pestilence\nGreens\nAs we get some of the greens sculpted, we'll post them here. \nUnit Scale Stuff\nIt's always important, especially these days, to know how your miniatures measure up. When designing my ToD line, I knew that they would be going up against many of my human troops and mixed in with undead from other manufacturers, so we've made them to a scale that would fit in well with most companies. \nThe Team\nTriumph of Death miniatures are designed by yours truly (Thomas Foss) of Skull & Crown Stratagem, Inc. I've been designing miniatures and games for over three decades, and this project has been in my mind and heart for a long while.  Sculpting comes courtesy of the talented and a devilishly handsome Drew Day Williams (Satyr Art Studio) who has also done work for WizKids, Dwarven Forge, and Privateer Press - to name a few. Steve Phillips (Firing Line Miniatures) has been my chief caster and mold maker for almost two decades, and is taking on the title of \"Master Caster\" of these miniatures.  This time around I've also had the great pleasure and relief of having help in laying out the Kickstarter by the talented Kawe Weissi-Zadeh of Westfalia miniatures fame. It's like having a bespoke tailor!  All miniatures are designed, sculpted and cast In the USA. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter, with a seasoned crew of sculptors and casters- so I'm pretty well acquainted with the processes and where the hiccups can happen, and am constantly working to mitigate these factors before they come up. This will be the first time I use Backerkit, so the time to get the surveys out may take a bit longer depending on the learning curve. That's why I'm giving this Kickstarter a bit more time to get rewards out. \n\nMost of the models of this Kickstarter, including the initial Stretch Goals, have already been sculpted, with master mold castings vetted and approved for the first set. My caster, Firing Line miniatures makes master molds from RTV instead of vulcanized rubber which greatly mitigates any chances of the master models getting wrecked in the process. \n\nOther than things outside of my control (like a postal strike or horrible weather) we should be good to go! Remember that Kickstarter does not unlock funds until 3 weeks after the Kickstarter succeeds, so that adds to the time I can get models out to you.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: These miniatures are not toys and are not recommended for children under 14 years of age.

Each sheet has an original size of 15 cm x 20 cm (about 6\" x 8\") and two of them are already unlocked as free items.\nWelcome wargamers, model makers and diorama fans! This is probably the book you\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2013 written by the longstanding terrain makers Gerard Boom & Michael Martin. Gerard is well-known for the helpful tools he developed for the Proxxon Thermocut for many years now (see his website Shiftinglands.com). He also was the host of more than 60 XPS foam workshops throughout Europe so far \u2013 teaching newbies and pros how to build inspiring tabletop terrain. Michael is known for his weekly YouTube show \u2019Tabletop Workshop\u2019 (TWS) and his excellent crafting tutorials. He\u2019s also an experienced writer for magazines and the author of more than 15 official strategy guides for video games.\nThis creative dream team came together some time ago: One of their joint projects was the successful terrain workshop \u2019ruined city\u2019 (see this german video report). Their favorite material is XPS foam because it\u2019s light, very affordable and easy to handle. And with their doubled experience and enthusiasm they decided: It\u2019s definitely time for the next level of terrain building \u2013 now in book form!\nExpect techniques, tutorials and tons of tips: \u2019Tabletop terrain from XPS foam: Buildings\u2019 has the power to be your new and ultimate guide for creating tabletop buildings! The 200-page DIN A4 sized book will be available in English and German language \u2013 and will include a variety of exclusive templates as free add-ons which support your own creative terrain projects. \n1. Know-how: A focussed introduction with lots of general information on XPS foam. What exactly is XPS foam? Which brands and quality levels are available and how do they differ with regard to the exact outcome? Are there any security instructions? And where can you get the best XPS foam?\n2. Basics: How to cut and structure XPS foam? Which results can be obtained by etching and melting? Which kinds of glue work best with XPS foam? Are there any recommended primers? What about special painting techniques? And is sealing really required?\n3. Tools: The Proxxon Thermocut is probably THE main tool for terrain builders. And: There are many optional and very helpful tools available developed by Gerard Boom during the past years. This chapter will show you how to work with the Proxxon Thermocut (or any other hot wire cutter) and how to use Gerard\u2019s supporting tools. In addition, we\u2019ll explain many alternative techniques in the book. So you just need the Proxxon Thermocut or similar for following the tutorials of this book, whereas the utilization of all other tools is optional.\n4. Techniques: In this chapter you\u2019ll learn how to use the exclusive templates attached to this book (please read more about the templates further on). Complex cutting techniques will be explained as well as layer techniques for building spectacular walls. On top you\u2019ll profit from tons of tested tips and many exercises to improve your skills.\n5. Tutorials: The \u201abeating heart\u2019 of this book are 15 rich tutorials with clear step-by-step instructions to create stunning buildings: fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, historical, wild west, ancient/ruined and more. Every popular tabletop genre will be honored with at least one building. And: You\u2019ll find tips that work fast and easy to combine and modify each building for putting a maximum of variety and individuality on your own gaming board.\nFor a quick and easy creation of your buildings this book will include 20 free templates to begin with. These exclusive templates are made out of stable cardboard and can be used fully modularly: Whether timber frame walls, specific roof shingles or the position of doors and windows \u2013 these templates will support all your terrain projects massively!\nThis campaign will start with 20 helpful free templates \u2013 and there will be many more to come by unlocking stretch goals! Please keep in mind: All templates are free supplements to the book during this kickstarter campaign only \u2013 they will be sold separately as soon as the book hits retail in mid-2020.\nTemplate examples. Further templates will be designed and revealed after this campaign.\nThis campaign starts with a book of 200 pages including 20 free templates. By funding this project and unlocking several stretch goals lots of pages may be added to the book. Also the amount of templates may raise significantly. And there are other utilities in preparation for free stretch goals: useful MDF components and sunning glass sheets for windows for example (see below).\nIf this campaign should reach 1.000 backers we'll produce video diaries twice a month until the books are shipped. So you'll be updated with current informations, have interesting behind the scenes views and can take a look at fresh layouts. \nAnd if at least 1.500 backers should join this campaign YOUR NAME will be listed in our book! You can either decide if it's your full name or your kickstarter nickname (and of course you can refrain if you like). All this will be asked in the pledge manager a few weeks after this campaign. Please note: This is an offer to backers of this kickstarter campaign only!\nEven if this book presents all of Gerard\u2019s smart tools for the Proxxon Thermocut, every cutting technique will also be explained without using any of these tools. So you will get the whole crafting experience all along with just the book itself. Nevertheless Gerard\u2019s tools give more precision, speed and comfort to your crafting process. Therefore each tutorial will include a list of recommended tools you can already find in Gerard\u2019s Webshop Shiftinglands.com \u2013 you can directly order there or meet Gerard at conventions all over Europe or use the pledge manager a few weeks after this campaign\u2019s end. In the pledge manager you can add any of Gerard\u2019s tools and pay the additional amount using PayPal (same prices as on Shiftinglands.com). All tutorials with all tool lists will be posted in updates with regard to this campaign before the pledge manager will be closed. So you\u2019ll have all the information required to make your decision.\nJeremy from Black Magic Craft is working with some of our templates.\nVisit and Interview with Gerard at Black Magic Craft.\nGerman video report about the two-day terrain workshop \u2019ruined city\u2019. \nOur early Teaser\nThe shipping fee will be added automatically to your pledge depending on your country \u2013 see the following table below. Shipping is worldwide with DHL including tracking.\nYes, shipping is always the annoying part of any campaign. But to make it clear: The regular DHL fee for shipping from Germany to Australia for example is 47\u20ac (US$ 52), so we took every opportunity to reduce this fee to a minimum of 31\u20ac (US$ 34). But we know: it's still expensive \u2013 we're sorry about that but we can't change the fees.\nBut we can do another thing: free stretch goals! Besides more pages and more templates there are a lot of free MDF components and free colored 'glass sheets' for pimping your buildings \u2026 At the end all these free stretch goals should have a retail value of over 30\u20ac (US$ 33).\nSo if you think 'shipping is to much' maybe just keep an eye on our campaign and check it out before October 13th. Then you exacly see what you'll receive for your pledge and shipping costs. And maybe ask your friends, so you can share the shipping costs.\nRegarding the Brexit situation in UK: The shipping fee for UK backers may raise if the UK should leave the European Union, in which case we will send every UK backer an e-mail with our PayPal adress to ensure the payment of the additional fee. We\u2019re sorry for any inconveniences.\nPlease note as well: Your pledge on Kickstarter covers your reward and shipping fee. The country-specific VAT and other taxes or import fees collected by the local authorities are not included!

Henry Chalfant\u2019s photographs and films, including his groundbreaking 1983 documentary Style Wars, immortalized this transient art form when it was still in its adolescence, and helped launch graffiti art into the international phenomenon it is now.\nThis September, a new exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts will honor that legacy. Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 will feature hundreds of artworks from one of the most significant documentarians of subway art. Through the lens of Henry Chalfant, the public will be able to see the now largely disappeared works of legendary subway writers, including Dondi, Dez, Futura, Lady Pink, Lee Qui\u00f1ones, Skeme, and Zephyr, and Bronx legends including Blade, Crash, DAZE, Dust, Kel, Mare, Mitch 77, Noc 167, SEEN, and T-Kid.\nFor this exhibition, we\u2019re going to print hundreds of Henry\u2019s photographs, a video that includes 800 images by well-known and under-recognized writers, and a recreation of Henry\u2019s 1980s studio, paired with a soundtrack of subway sounds. With your help, this exhibition will take visitors back to the center of the 80s graffiti scene, where friends and rivals built an entire artform from the ground-up.\nWhy Now?\nThe Bronx, and New York City as a whole, looks very different today from the city Henry was documenting. The historic exhibition and its programming explores the crucible in which this rebellious art form was launched, in the midst of a tumultuous time in New York City history. His photographs give us a rare look into New York life in the 1970s and 80s, offering an expansive view of an era when artists brought their world, and their message, to the street. Henry's work celebrates their voice, and this exhibition gives them the platform they deserve today.\nWhy Does the Bronx Museum Need You?\nAdmission to the Bronx Museum is free. \nWith this Kickstarter, we\u2019re looking to close the gap on the exhibition\u2019s production budget. Since its founding in 1971, the Bronx Museum museum has played a vital role in the Bronx by helping to make art accessible to the entire community and connecting with local schools, artists, teens, and families through its robust education initiatives. Supporting this project means you stand with the Bronx Museum and its mission to make world renowned exhibitions and educational programs available to all. \nAbout Henry Chalfant\nStarting out as a sculptor in New York in the 1970s, Chalfant turned to photography and film to do an in-depth study of hip-hop culture and graffiti art. One of the foremost authorities on New York subway art, and other aspects of urban youth culture, his photographs record hundreds of ephemeral, original artworks that have long since vanished. With Martha Cooper, he co-authored the definitive account of New York graffiti art, Subway Art (Holt Rinehart Winston, N.Y. 1984) and with James Prigoff, co-authored a sequel on the art form's world-wide diffusion, Spray Can Art (Thames and Hudson Inc. London, 1987). Chalfant co-produced with Tony Silver the PBS documentary, Style Wars, the definitive documentary about graffiti and Hip Hop culture and directed Flyin' Cut Sleeves, a documentary on South Bronx gangs, in 1993. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter gives the Bronx Museum the opportunity to reach a much wider audience than traditional funding models. We believe that backers from all over New York and the world will see value in building an exhibition about a Bronx-born art form in the Bronx at a free museum, and Kickstarter allows them to give their support directly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is an ambitious show, and it may be challenging to include 800 images in our video due to spatial and time constraints.

Flowing through the body, it allows the daily tasks of a farmer to be completed swiftly, and the strikes of a warrior to be strong and just. The Sohei are said to be able to use their Taiyo to levitate above the trees. Meanwhile, we sages of the Great Temple can move an object through the fabric of the world, breaking the teachings of time and being.The Great Masters use their power to help the people, and seek enlightenment. \nBut I fear others will use it to oppress, and kill.\u201d\n- Sage Yamasakura of the Great Temple.\nA Skirmish miniatures game for 2 to 4 players, Taiy\u014d Dynasties takes place in an alternate history Feudal Japan where humans never existed and beastmen took their place. As a third great war looms over the nation of Hanani, Taiy\u014d, the magical life force that flows through all things, has been harnessed by the clans and warriors of the land. As tensions grow between the Wafuto Imperial Army and the oppressed Atsuda clans, warlords and vagrant ronin alike seek to unlock the mysterious powers of Taiy\u014d, and turn the tides of battle in their favour.\nTaiy\u014d Dynasties is the creation of Alex Atkinson, a tabletop game developer working out of Japan. Narratively, Taiy\u014d Dynasties takes its influences appropriately from Japanese history and Asian folklore. On the tabletop, Taiy\u014d Dynasties is a quick, easy and accessible miniatures game suitable for players of all ages and skill levels. We believe it's a perfect skirmish wargame to get started with, even if you've never picked up dice and miniatures before. \nPledge at the Samurai Pledge level for the game starter set.\nThis Kickstarter aims to launch the War of the Falling Petal starter set for Taiy\u014d Dynasties. This box includes everything you need to play a two person game; Taiy\u014d Dynasties is a skirmish-scale wargame, and uses very few models - keeping everything quick and easy, from the painting to the playing. \nCharacter abilities are presented on cards and included in the box. Decisive actions are decided through simple six-sided dice rolls. Coins are used to add resource management mechanics to the game, and lend the game a degree of tactical depth that can keep even the most competitive wargamers coming back for more. \nAn Atsuda Vanguard closes in on Imperial Army Soldiers - Painting & terrain by Skullboy Studios.\nPlayers can choose their warbands from the unique clans and factions of Hanani, and with their forces they will wage war for land, riches and honour. With the clash of katanas, the whistling of arrows and the incantations of ancient magic, ancestral enemies settle age-old grudges and new rivalries are born among new recruits in glorious moments. \nThe land of Hanani is torn apart by the War of the Falling Petal, and all must choose a side; Ally yourself with the  Wafuto Imperial Army and crush your enemy with superior steel, or take up arms with the Atusda Vanguard and defend the holy sites of your ancestors with guerrilla tactics. Take the vows of the Akira yakuza, and cut deals and establish yourself within the crime syndicates operating right under the shogunate's nose. Meanwhile, the Reputan Trade Federation is open to those of a mercenary leaning, who would seek riches and treasures on the high seas, indifferent to the ideologies driving the War.\nThe wisest of Atsuda, opposed to the most cunning of the Wafuto. Painting & terrain by Skullboy Studios.\n Taiy\u014d Dynasties is a thoroughly \"tried & tested\" skirmish wargame with an accompanying fictional world, both of which have been over five years in the making. Our small, independent team have poured a great deal of love, attention and energy into making sure the game is everything that a fully-fledged, actively supported skirmish miniatures wargame should be. Be sure to follow our updates to learn more - in them, we'll be covering even more of everything that's presented on this page, such as the lore, mechanics and development process of the Taiy\u014d world! \nREAD THE BETA RULES HERE\nEarly playtests of Taiy\u014d Dynasties in the Blossom Gardens - Painting & terrain by Alex of Ulfsark Games.\nThis campaign seeks to fund the production costs for at least 400 copies of the first starter box for Taiy\u014d Dynasties, The War of the Falling Petal, and establish a core following for what we believe can be a popular and well-supported skirmish miniatures wargame. \nThis Kickstarter will release the first two Warbands; The Imperial Army and The Atsuda Vanguard. Further Warbands, such as Gang Akira and Samejima's Crew, will be released as stretch goals. Check out the add-on section to see the current Warbands that are available, and be sure to check for any new warbands we might add as the campaign progresses!\nTaiy\u014d Dynasties' models are 28mm heroic scale miniatures, standing between 32-60 mm tall and cast in high quality resin. Some assembly and painting is required, but our range goes together very easily with just a little bit of superglue. With all the characters cast and prototypes in hand, all our base models are ready for mass production. \nThe 28mm miniatures included in the War of The Falling Petal Starter Set, all ready & assembled for war!\nThe models have been 3D designed by Alex Atkinson, Thomas Lishman and Jason Burns, and have been cast by Matt Hobday of Goya Games, who has been working round the clock over the last few months to ensure a hassle-free production is all ready to go. Our studio miniatures were painted by Tom of Skullboy Studios, who found them fun and easy to paint!\nWafuto (top) and Atsuda (lower) Models painted by Skullboy Studios.\n Our models are available in the War of the Falling Petal starter set and also available in separate warband box sets. Each box set contains dice, tokens, bases and character cards for the models.\n(Left) Resin model (Right) 3D printed master\nPrototype 3D printed masters\nIn Taiy\u014d Dynasties, players take control of small warbands and play out thrilling, character-driven skirmishes rich with strategy and story alike. A warband is made up of Heroes, Elite Units, Troops and other unique characters. With 5 to 12 models in each warband, the game is fast paced and all characters are an essential part of play. Only through leveraging tactical acumen with the unique abilities of your units will you take victory.\nOur ruleset is already written and well-into playtesting. In that aspect, we want you to be a part of its development. For the full Taiy\u014d Dynasties ruleset, follow this link for the BETA rules! \nJoin our facebook group to be a part of the discussion!  https://www.facebook.com/groups/TaiyoDynasties/ \nAs with many tabletop games, resource management is a crucial aspect of the game. Every model in your force produces coins for your resource pool during a game, and the amount generated is shown by the symbols on the model\u2019s card. As such, the way you compose your army is also important. You pay for each action in the game with these coins, keeping the flow of the game clear and concise. The coins will be made of metal and are part of our Dragon Scales coin line! \nEach character in the game has a set of special actions that define the way they fight. With clear and helpful character cards to keep track of your models, you will never be taken out the action. Ultimately, we want the Taiy\u014d Dynasties ruleset to be quick, easy and understandable, whilst offering a great deal of tactical depth. \nYou can get immersed in a narrative campaign just as easily as you can play a one-off battle to prove your tactical might. \nAll the character illustrations are by Nexzerker. To view all of our character cards, simply follow this link!\nPlaytest cards from an alpha version, alongside a sample of our Taiy\u014d coins.\nWatch the simple gameplay intro video below. It shows the basics to get started with Taiy\u014d Dynasties.

Once the Kickstarter version of the game is released, the first edition of the rules will be published and the final artwork will be added. Every pledge level comes with a free PDF copy of the final rules. This reduces postage costs and allows you to get updated versions of the rules for free as the game develops or as new miniatures are added.

Carriage and Shipping will be calculated when we are ready to ship.\nAll items will be sold to you at retail discount.\nThe War of the Falling Petal predominantly concerns the conflict between the Wafuto and Atsuda Clans, and they're the stars of this starter set. As the world of Taiy\u014d Dynasties grows however, we'll look to adding many more factions, miniatures and forces to the world, allowing you to play out countless stories and battles in our rich and vibrant setting! \nThe highly militarised canines that rule with an iron fist. Mostly consisting of wolves, dogs and bears, the Wafuto Clan definitely has the ferocity and raw power to take out any enemies that stand in their way. Perhaps gifted with too much brawn and not enough brain, the Wafuto often lack the peace of mind necessary to utilise Taiyo in the ways that other species have mastered.  They more than make up for this with sheer military expertise and ruthless, well-trained soldiers however, and The Wafuto Clan are perfect for the cut-throat gamers. \nLed by Wafuto Zaifun, the Wafuto Clan are the largest clan, and have more than earned the right to call their leader Shogun. In 1699, The Wafuto Clan rose to power after the 8 year war knows as The War of Dogs. Owning most of mainland Hanani, the Wafuto hold large swathes of territory, and have drawn a great of natural resources from the land - chiefly, iron and gunpowder. Unfortunately, the Wafuto have also stretched their armies far and wide in order to assert such dominance, and as such, have lost almost all power over the nation's many islands and their respective sea trade routes. \nRuling over the lands with an iron fist and crushing any signs of rebellion with haste, players looking to take control of Wafuto's roaming Imperial Army warbands will find themselves playing hard and steadfast in order to obtain victory. We've painted our Wafuto warbands in rich reds and golds, but the clan's splinter factions and vagrant warbands can, and often will, enamel their armour in a great variety of bold colours to proudly showcase their wealth and power.\n The War of the Falling Petal Starter Box contains the following: Wafuto Tarou x1, Panda Elite  x1, Ookami Samurai x1, Ookami Senshi x1 Teppou Inu x1. It also contains bases and character cards for all the miniatures. That's all you need to play a full game of Taiyo Dynasties!\nMade up of primates, apes and monkeys, the Atsuda Clan are a highly intelligent and peaceful people, but in no way defenceless. Often comprised of peasant militia and warrior monks, Atsuda Vanguards utilise their innate agility, stealth and prowess to wage guerrilla warfare against the oppressive Wafuto. \nAtsuda Vangaurds often rally around their transcendent Taiyo Sensei, who, utilising their mastery over Taiyo energy, conceal sound, cast powerful magics, and teleport troops great distances with little more than subtle movements of the hand. With such arts and an iron will, the Atsuda Clan are not to be underestimated. This faction is great for the thinking player who looks to utilise every trick at their disposal in order to achieve victory. \nLed by Atsuda Chatoto and driven by vengeance, the Atsuda Clan have begun to harness their otherwise peaceful Taiy\u014d energies in a more offensive manner than ever before. Unlike the Wafuto, the Atsuda maintain control over many of the Southern Islands, and although they have less resources and manpower than the Imperial Army, the clan has dedicated itself to rigorous training regimes. While the Wafuto hold power and sit cleaning their claws, the Atsuda have something to prove. They have been limited to their island exiles for too long, and now they look to turning their knowledge and power to the reclamation of their ancestral lands. \nPlayers taking control of Atsuda Vanguards will find their forces require some level of thought; the Atsuda cannot muscle-out the forces of other clans easily. With graceful agility, cunning guile and masterful maneuvering however, the Atsuda can triumph in almost any given situation. We've painted our Atsuda Vanguards in deep greens and browns to reflect the clan's dedication to camouflage and subterfuge, but as the Atsuda Clans seek monastic sanctuary in almost any environment, their haori jackets and light armour are often dyed and painted to match their given habitat.\n The War of the Falling Petal Starter Box contains the following: Miyamoto Sensei x1, Goru Warrior x1, Tamarin Sohei x1, Chimp Ashigaru x1, Chimp Shashu x1. It also contains bases and character cards for all the miniatures. That's all you need to play a full game of Taiyo Dynasties!\n\u00a360 - An additional copy of the War of the Falling Petal Starter Box\nIncludes: 10 Resin Models, 30 Metal Coins, 10 Model Cards, and 8 Plastic Dice.\n\u00a345 - Atsuda Vanguard - Warband Box\nIncludes: 7 Resin Models, Miyamoto Sensei x1, Goru Warrior x1, Tamarin Sohei x1, Chimp Ashigaru x2, Chimp Shashu x2, 18 Metal Coins, 5 Model Cards, and 4 Plastic Dice\n\u00a345 - Wafuto Imperial Army - Warband Box\nIncludes: 7 Resin Models , Wafuto Tarou x1, Panda Elite x1, Ookami Samurai x1, Ookami Senshi x2, Teppou Inu x2, 18 Metal Coins, 5 Model Cards, and 4 Plastic Dice\nTerrain and accessories will be available in the pledge manager; \nJapanese 28mm terrain starter set for Taiyo Dynasties by Sarrisa Precision\nSakura flower metal Dragon Scales dice by Ulfsark Games\nAcrylic tokens for tracking health and status effects\nExtra sets of the metal coins for Taiyo Dynasties\nWe will be releasing additional Warbands as stretch goals to help expand the world of Taiy\u014d Dynasties!\nConsider increasing you pledge to help us reach your favourite!\nWhen will I get such stretch goal models?\nThese stretch goal warbands are in alpha at the time of this Kickstarter launching. The 3D models will be created after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The rules will simultaneously be tested and brought to beta state in September. At this point the character stat cards will be released for open beta (i.e; you can play with them) while final production of the resin models continues. In November, the open beta will close and the final stat cards will be printed and shipped with the models to backers who ordered stretch goals. Stretch goal rewards will arrive between November and Early December. \nTo view all the Beta Character Cards, Click Here!\nIf you wish to have your stretch goals sent separately from your starter box, please send us a message.\nCheck out the \u00a355,000 stretch goal - OUR KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE - All starter boxes get double the number of troops - At this point we have funded  enough to produce 1000 sets and our unit production price can be reduced. Therefore, we can reward our Kickstarter backers with 4 extra models!\n                        We proudly present our Stretch Goals! \n Gang Akira are the melee-only powerhouse force. Capable of being fielded as a stand alone warband or as a vicious accompaniment to a Wafuto Clan warband, the Gang features four named characters: Akira the Boss; Bo the Sumo; Aiko the Geisha and Chi, alongside two Akira thugs. For a fast moving and aggressive play style, these hounds are the way to go.\nThe Gang Akira box set contains the following: Akira x1, Bo x1, Aiko x1, Chi x1, Akira Thugs x2.  It also contains bases and character cards for all the miniatures.\n Samejima\u2019s sea-faring crew have a lot of firepower at their disposal. Muscle-bound alligators toss anchors at enemy ships, and drag them within range for frog pistoleers to leap aboard and rain fire down upon the enemy deck. Meanwhile, turtle cannoneers blast holes in the hull of the enemy vessels, ensuring nobody gets away without a proper fight.\nThe crews of the southern seas have no political allegiances, and will pledge their firepower to anyone - as long as they're the highest bidder! Samejima's crew can be allied with any other force as Mercenaries, or fielded as a stand-alone warband.\nThe Samejima's Crew box set contains the following: Samejima x1, Croc Deckhands x2, Frog Pistoller x2, Turtle Canoneer x1. It also contains bases and character cards for all the miniatures.\nOUR KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE - All starter boxes get double the number of troops - At this point we have funded  enough to produce 1000 sets and our unit production price can be reduced. Therefore, we can reward our Kickstarter backers with 4 extra models!\n The Drummers of Raijin are an incredible example of the way the Atsuda monks have harnessed their ceremonial Taiy\u014d energies into offensive forces. With each strike of their ancient drums, the Raijin monks send electrical Taiyo energies coursing through the air, melting armour, stunning generals and electrocuting enemy forces. The Drummers of Raijin can be fielded alone, but make for a great addition to an Atsuda warband, providing heavy-hitting ranged support.\nThe Drummers of Raijin box set contains the following: The Kaminari Twins with Drum Golems x2, Goru Jikata x1 and Macaque Ouchi x2.   It also contains bases and character cards for all the miniatures. \nWe're super excited about the possibility of expanding the Taiy\u014d Universe and if we reach high levels of funding we can begin discussing which forces and models the community would like to see realised next. Leave us a comment with what you would like to see!\nAlex Atkinson - Creator & Project Manager - UK\nThe creator of the Taiy\u014d Dynasties game and the owner of Ulfsark Games. Alex is responsible for all of Ulfsark Games' previous kickstarters, including the hugely successful Dragon Scale Dice and Coins range. Alex has worked very hard to bring Taiy\u014d Dynasties to its current state, and has poured an immense amount of love, care and attention into ensuring Taiyo Dynasties is the best game it can possibly be. The game started as a small project that  Alex worked on with Nexz, an illustrator from Argentina. However, as the project has grown over the last 5 years, he's handpicked a team of talented individuals to bring Taiy\u014d Dynasties to life. \n Nicol\u00e1s Amarilla (Nexzerker) - Concept Artist and Illustrator - Argentina\nNic has been on the project from day one, and his creative talents have shaped the strong visual design of Taiyo Dynasties throughout. Nic is an incredibly creative person and has become an indispensable asset to the project, and he will continue to work with us throughout Taiyo Dynasties' future. You can view Nic's Portfolio here!  \nSam Sleney - Editor and Project Management - UK\nSam joined the project during the final lead up to the Kickstarter. He has a very successful track record on Kickstarter as the creative director and project manager on the SINS RPG, and as social media & marketing manager for Room17's Tenfold Dungeon range. Sam's role on Taiyo Dynasties covers a bit of everything, from kickstarter project management, rulebook editing and game design.\nMatt Hobday - Goya Games - Resin casting and production - UK\nMatt has an incredible career history, having worked at both Games Workshop and Mantic Miniatures. He has since set up his own casting company and will be producing all our models for the final production. We are looking forward to working with him - rest assured, our model production is in safe hands. \nTom Lishman - 3D modeller - UK\nTom was the main modeller for the Atsuda Vanguard warband. He has worked on many other projects, including many of Steamforged Games' miniature range. Tom has a great eye for detail and captures a great human-like emotion in the faces of characters. In addition to his work on the Atsuda Vanguard, Tom will also be working on our stretch goal models. You can view Tom's Portfolio here!\nJason Burns - 3D modeller - US\nJason was the main modeller for the Wafuto Imperial Army warband. Jason brought a great visual style to the warband with their heavy armor and aggressive stances.

There are going to be many challenges we must face and whilst we don't expect to run into any major issues, we owe it to you, the backer, to be transparent and honest about any potential challenges. \n\n-Packing and Logistics - Although having run many kickstarters and found the best method for packing and posting for ourselves, this project is potentially operating on a much larger scale than our previous kickstarters. We will therefore we will be working closely with Spiral Galaxy Games to fulfill this project.\n\n- Quality control - All the orders being processed will go through quality control checks to make sure that everyone's products are up to scratch. However if there is an issue with your models it will be on us, and we will replace or refund the model. This will be a challenge as thousands of models are going to be packed. Nonetheless, we believe it is something worth taking our time over.\n\n- Delays and Updates - A kickstarter of this size, particularly when met with success, could have delays and as such we're taking a very studious approach to planning. We will make sure to keep everyone in the loop at all stages. Pictures and some tracking details will be shared to keep everyone up to date. Furthermore, you will be instantly notified about delays. We hope to have none, and we have already got the prototype models in hand, ready made to remove many of the delays that pre-production bring. Our model range will instead go straight to production on the wrap-up of the Kickstarter. The same cannot be said for stretch goal rewards due to planning logistics. However, we hope to use the experience we have already gained from the pre-production of the current products to swiftly and efficiently put any stretch goal models into production ASAP upon the Kickstarter's conclusion.\n\n- Stretch Goals - One of the most time consuming parts of the development phase is the design and prototyping. Therefore stretch goals could take some time. This is especially the case if we reach larger stretch goals.\n\nThere are many risks to business as a whole and Kickstarters are not exempt from this.\n\n- Suppliers shutdown - If this occurs with Goya Games it would cause delays. However, Matt Hobday is a reliable businessman and caster with an industry reputation, and we have no reason to believe there is a risk of this. In addition, given the local nature of production we can obtain our molds in the event of disaster. Furthermore, with all our model designs being 3D designed, we can just print more masters using digital back ups. We've been in touch with alternative casters and back-up production teams should anything go terribly wrong. \n\n- Health and Natural Disasters - Alex, the main project manager, is in very good health both physically and mentally, and shows no signs of producing ailments that would stop him from working. Nottingham is our main base of operations and is not known for any large scale natural disasters. Therefore we can rule these out.\n\nThis concludes our brief review of the risks and challenges.

Much of this will be written from the perspective of Alex, the lead game designer, and covers some of the 5 years of Taiyo Dynasties\u2019 development.\nWhere did Taiyo Dynasties come from?\nPeople often ask where the unique and interesting theme comes from? The simple answer is. However, are any ideas actually original? As I worked on the game it came to my attention more and more what this game had been inspired by. The answer was games and movies from my childhood. For example, Sonic, Shogun Total War, Kung-fu Panda and Disney\u2019s Robin Hood. These childhood inspirations combined with my current interest in tabletop games, anime, video games and film helped to shape the way the game feels. The abilities and characters are inspired by videogames such as DOTA2 and World of Warcraft. The themes and visual style are inspired by games and TV programs such as, Shogun Total War 2, The Last Airbender and Bleach. Finally the gameplay was inspired by the countless board games, RPGs and miniature games I\u2019ve played over the years. All this inspiration was molded into what is now Taiyo Dynasties. I hope you can feel the personal touch and passion that has been put into every part of the game."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to the world of Taiyo Dynasties!", "update_content": "We are off to a great start!

One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total. A default pledge of \u20ac7 has been set, as this is almost the lowest value element of this campaign. Once you have made your selection and have totaled its\u2019 value, you can directly enter that total \u20ac amount as your pledge.\nFor example: All you want is the Suicide Squad add-on (26 \u20ac), Batman Inc add-on (26 \u20ac), White Rabbit (6.5\u20ac), Carmine Falcone (6.5 \u20ac), and Nobody (6.5 \u20ac) from the picking zone. A total of 71.5\u20ac\nSo, select the \u201cYour choice - Open pledge\u201d pledge level and enter that total amount of 71.5\u20ac, overwriting the minimum pledge amount and you are set.\nAdventure mode racked up 42 missions in season 1, is still supported with 9 NEW missions in season 2.

When he was five, Mel built playsets for his little green army men in the corner of the craft store his mother ran. He was often assisted by model railroaders who were regulars at the store and, by the time he saw his first White Dwarf magazine at age 15, Mel was primed for a life of building terrain.\nMel has traveled the world, as a medic in the army, a physiotherapist, and even a salesman. He has worked with people from all walks of life, and looked at things from many different perspectives. It is this approach that he brings to his successful YouTube channel (The Terrain Tutor, click the image below to check it out). For the last fiveyears, Mel has been able to make a living from sharinghis passion \u2013 teaching people everything he knows about building terrain for tabletopwargaming, for hobbyists, clubs, displays, and for dioramas \u2013 and it\u2019s that passion and knowledge that he is bringing to this book, TERRAIN ESSENTIALS.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to fund a printed version of the book \u2013 TERRAIN ESSENTIALS \u2013 a (now) 176-page book perfect to add to the collection of anyone with an interest in creating excellent tabletop terrain, regardless of purpose or the builder's ability.\nMedia\nIn addition to Mel's YouTube channel and regular livestreams, Mel and Dave have been talking to various media outlets about Terrain Essentials (and Dave's book - Armies & Legions & Hordes).\nTo see Mel on Beasts of War, click HERE.\nTo see Mel at Salute on Beasts of War, click HERE.\nTo see Mel and Dave on Guerrilla Miniature Games, click HERE.\nTo see Mel and Dave on Skirmish Supremacy, click HERE.\nTo see Mel at AdeptiCon with The Lady in the Dress, click HERE.\nTo see Dave at AdeptiCon with The Lady in the Dress, click HERE.\nTo hear Mel and Dave on Rememberancer's Retreat, click HERE.\nTo hear Dave on The Brush Wielders Union, click HERE.\nTo hear Dave on The Independent Characters, click HERE.\nTo hear Dave on 40K Radio, click HERE. \nTo hear Dave on the Cast Dice podcast, click HERE.\nRewards\nStretch Goals\nAdd-Ons\nThe Content of TERRAIN ESSENTIALS\nMel has spent many years researching all manner of tools, materials and techniques, as well as experimenting and documenting his process. He\u2019ll be putting it down on paper for the first time, and TERRAIN ESSENTIALS will include: \n\u2022 Theory \u2013 From inspiration and research to planning and set design, from colour theory and build types to workflow and longterm project management, this section will help you plan the best terrain for you before you even start building.\n\u2022 Materials & Tools \u2013 Covering all the most commonly used materials, from basic craft and DIY to specialist modeling materials \u2013 including how and where to use them in terrain making \u2013 along with an in-depth guide to the essential simple, professional, and custom tools specific to making terrain, this section is all about making sure you have the right tool and right material for the job!\n\u2022 Core Techniques \u2013 From cutting bases to sealing your finished terrain and a whole host of techniques in-between, this section will ensure you have a solid understanding of the core skills and techniques used across the spectrum of terrain building. Covering the essentials, from basics like cutting and gluing, to advanced washes, sealing techniques and combating warping, this section will not only give you the information and confidence to use these techniques but also troubleshoot them.\n\u2022 Base, Texture, and Paint \u2013 Good terrain starts with a good foundation and this section provides in-depth coverage of basing, laying down the ground, realistic texturing techniques, and a range of earth tone painting guides. From cheap and easy basing materials to perfect pigments, you will have the information you need to make sure all of your projects start with a solid, realistic foundation.\n\u2022 Grasses and Trees \u2013 This section is all about the greenery, from laying down beautiful and durable grasslands and pastures, to tufts, flowers, shrubs, bushes and hedgerows. As well as tackling the small stuff, this section will go into creating a range of trees; everything from armatures, to bark textures, painting and finally creating awesome looking foliage for your trees.\n\u2022 Hills and Rocks \u2013 As the most common feature on gaming tables, this section covers those rocks, slopes, hills, and cliffs. We look at everything from a number of different construction techniques to maximising playability without sacrificing realism, realistic painting guides, and more advanced techniques for modular and large feature hills and cliffs. \n\u2022 Buildings and Ruins \u2013 Buildings and ruins can be mini-projects in their own right, so this section breaks it all down and takes you step-by-step through building, painting and fine detailing for buildings from our history, or a dystopian, gothic, far-flung future. Covering multiple techniques for everything from the foundations to the roofs, this section will have you making the best buildings for your urban combat.\n\u2022 Water and Snow \u2013 Often seen as the more challenging aspects of terrain making, this section will demystify water and snow pieces, giving you a range of techniques, core colour theory, and guides to the most common pieces like ponds, modular rivers, and snowy terrain.\n\u2022 Terrain Kits \u2013 As MDF/HDF kits, cardboard kits (eg. Battle Systems terrain - battlesystems.co.uk), 3D-prints, and resin casts become more prevalent in tabletop gaming, this section not only equips you with the key knowledge to make putting your kit together problem free. But it\u2019s not only about building kits; we will also take you through customising and tying your kits to your existing terrain collection, giving you what you need to turn each kit into a unique terrain piece.\n\u2022 Mel\u2019s Top Tips \u2013 Throughout the previous sections, Mel will be giving his top tips, tricks and fixes, making sure you learn from his mistakes so your builds go as smoothly as possible.\nWe are planning to cover each of these chapters in as much detail as possible, to give you as much information as we can. We have a number of stretch goals planned that will help us provide more in-depth knowledge on each of the techniques used and sample builds shown in the book. \nWhy create a book?\nIt has been quite a while since there was a great \u201cIntroduction to Terrain Building\u201d type of book on the market, so after five years of helping the community build their terrain on Youtube, it seemed right for Mel to be the one to do it. On The Terrain Tutor YouTube channel, Mel presents a lot of great ideas, techniques, materials, and tools in a handy, episodic fashion, but we know that not everyone learns in the same way. The written word (particularly when accompanied by great photographs) can help many terrain builders connect with the material covered in Mel\u2019s videos. Helping others enjoy their hobby is one of the key drivers behind The Terrain Tutor, and Mel finds there\u2019s certainly a lot of job satisfaction when helping others be happy is your living.\nMel is partnering with Dave Taylor, of Dave Taylor Miniatures, to bring this book to life. Dave has been involved in tabletop miniatures wargaming for almost 30 years, has worked in \"the business\" for 25 years, and has known Mel for a decade. Dave recently delivered his own book aimed at helping wargamers complete more of their wargaming projects more often \u2013 Armies & Legions & Hordes \u2013 which he successfully funded here on Kickstarter last year. Dave is running this campaign, and will be coordinating the layout, editing, publishing, and distribution of TERRAIN ESSENTIALS. If you would like to see flip-throughs of Dave's book, you can check out Guerrilla Miniature Games HERE, and Tiny Plastic Spacemen HERE.\nOf course, this campaign is also a bit of an experiment. If things go very well, we may look into a series of more detailed books for a future campaigns. \nShipping\nNote: These details have been updated during the campaign.\nShipping costs will be collected in the pledge manager, after the campaign. For a single copy of the book, we expect them to be US - $12, UK/EU - $12, Canada - $20, AUS/NZ - $25, Rest Of World - $30. For each additional copy of the book please expect to add US - $10, UK/EU - $10, Canada - $15, AUS/NZ - $20, Rest Of World - $20.\nWe will be working with fulfillment hubs in the US, the UK, the EU, and Australia. This means that our backers in those regions (or in countries that have duty/VAT exemption on books from those regions) will be free from additional charges.\nDelivery\nTo ensure we cover all eventualities, including delays caused by potential shipping issues, we are scheduling the delivery of this book for February 2020.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nA well-run Kickstarter campaign gives us the best chance to make a great splash, cover all our costs, and serve up a very memorable product that you\u2019ll be using for years to come. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMel has been building terrain for decades now and has reams of information on what tools can be used to apply certain techniques to a wide array of materials. Although he has never written a book before, Mel certainly knows what he\u2019s talking about and is well underway with the writing and new terrain builds! \n\nDave has been writing about, photographing, and laying out magazine articles about wargaming miniatures for over 20 years and has (almost) never missed a deadline, so we are confident that he\u2019ll have no problems in completing the layout for TERRAIN ESSENTIALS. \n\nTERRAIN ESSENTIALS will be printed in Lithuania, and now that Dave has had his own project printed there (ARMIES & LEGIONS & HORDES) he is MUCH more aware of the potential for production and shipping delays, where they may occur, and how to create a more robust timeline to avoid those delays. \n\nBREXIT \u2013 We have no idea how Brexit (if it happens) will impact various changes/charges/timelines with moving products from the EU to the UK. Rest assured, however, that we are committed to the pricing you are seeing in this campaign, and will cover any additional fees that might be imposed on us by the time we are able to deliver your cool terrain book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Our Thanks", "descp": "At this pledge level, you will receive KS Updates, be able to \u0003increase your pledge level later in the campaign, and have \u0003access to the pledge manager once the campaign closes.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["251 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "TERRAIN ESSENTIALS as a PDF", "descp": "At this pledge level you will receive a PDF version of the book, \u0003perfect for checking out on your computer or tablet.\nYou will receive KS Updates, receive appropriate Stretch Goals, \u0003access to the various Add-ons available throughout the campaign, \u0003and have access to the pledge manager once the campaign closes.\nYour name will appear on the Backer Roll in the PDF version.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["1,108 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "TERRAIN ESSENTIALS Book", "descp": "You are helping to bring the physical version of the book to life! \u0003How cool is that?

My name is Gabe, and in 2016 I created the Board Game Design Lab with one main mission: to help designers create great games that people love.\nOut of that mission came a podcast with over 115 episodes, a website full of resources, and an amazing community of designers trying to help each other become the best they can be.\nIt's been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. If you think there's a game inside you (and I believe there is), I hope you'll come along on the journey to get it out of your head and onto a table.

If you are a returning adventurer, grab your battered fedora, your .45 and a few of your most trusted, hard-boiled companions and plunge back into the two-fisted action. If you are new to Pulp gaming or even the Pulps themselves, pull up a chair for a few seconds and let me introduce you to a world of adventure from the headwaters of all action-oriented movies, TV, books and comics of the past hundred years.\nThe Pulps were cheap magazines from the first half of the 20th century and were devoted to popular entertainment for the masses. They gave us larger-than-life heroes such as Tarzan, Doc Savage, The Shadow and many others. The Pulps also introduced an endless rogues' gallery of twisted villainy: Fu Manchu, Doctor Death, The Scorpion and enough mad scientists and criminal masterminds to sink several battleships. Within the pages of the Pulps you would encounter lost cities and civilizations, dinosaurs and vampires, rocket ships and death rays. Pulp heroes could be tough guy detectives, rugged archaeologists, plucky newsgirls, explorers, occultists, scholars and soldiers, just to name a fraction of the possible characters. \nPulp Alley is not only a tribute to the wonderful stories of days gone by , it is a passport to thrilling adventures for you and your friends. We know you will enjoy Pulp Alley. Now pick up that old map case, make sure your gat is loaded, snap the brim of your favorite fedora and on to the fortune and glory!\n Here is a look at our pledge levels and rewards for this kickstarter:\nPulp Alley Core Rules: Second Edition\nFor our Second Edition rulebook, we looked at what we could improve and make the game even more enjoyable to play. Many of these improvements came from our Pulp Alley players. In addition, we have clarified existing rules, added more examples, and made the rules more consistent. And to make it easier for players, we have included many rules that had previously been spread across multiple books. \nThis book replaces our Pulp Alley Rulebook and Pulp Leagues. Otherwise, this updated version of the Pulp Alley rules is intended to be compatible with our other existing cards and books.\nPULP ALLEY RULE #1 is HAVE FUN!\nPulp Alley: Scenarios\nThis book includes all twelve of our Scenarios of the Month from 2018 - previously published as 12 separate downloadable files. In addition, the scenario book includes the basic set-up and wrap-up rules. You will find the basic rules for Solo play, Horror, NPCs, and so on - for quick and easy reference. The pages relating to each scenario focus on the special rules and cards for that scenario. \nHigh quality printed cards are available for these scenarios on the Pulp Alley store -- store.pulpalley.com\nKnown Associates: League Pack\nThis league pack includes 15 double-sided cards - for a total of 30 different pre-made Associates to support your Pulp Alley leagues. \nPhantom Pack 4: Fortune Cards\nThis 15-card pack can be added to your Fortune Deck to include even more thrills, tactics, and unexpected twists to your Pulp Alley scenarios.\n To keep shipping costs low and help us ship rewards quickly, we are only offering a couple add-ons for this kickstarter. However, please see the note regarding our special Pulp Alley Coupon Code (below). \nThe two following optional add-ons are available to eligible pledge levels: \nEach stretch goal we reach will unlock a new Kickstarter exclusive Pulp Alley card (Fortune, Reward, or Solo). All unlocked stretch goals will be included with the Sidekick, Leader,and Phantom Agent pledge levels for FREE!\nThere are no shipping fees for the Follower and Ally level rewards. For all other pledge levels, your shipping fee is based on your address. Please be sure to include the appropriate amount with your pledge:\nShipping to the US = free\nShipping to the United Kingdom = $5\nShipping to Canada and EU = $10\nShipping to the Rest of the World = $15\nNote - Our friends at Sally 4th in the UK will be handling the shipping for UK and EU.

At this moment, I have decided to undertake this project with the aim of promoting my brand, and also, to satisfy the demand of my regular customers.   \nI have experience, both in the development of my products, and in the administration of the resources. For this reason, this Starter Pack is established as a reliable project since the beginning.\nAbout the project\n I have been working with my company for three years and it is well known in this scene, but for a long time I wanted to try this method of financing. After several attempts I have opted for a small project for a brand of miniatures. This consists of thirty-two millimeters miniatures, which are made of resin. I usually ask for the material to do the work monthly and, after years working on this, I know the possibilities that I have with these raw materials. My goal is to obtain financing for this project, which has a solid base.\n The Starter Pack consists of ten basic miniatures and, with each monetary goal we reach in this project, a gift will be added, until a pack of twenty miniatures is completed. You must keep in mind that it is a basic pack to play, but it can be completed with other miniatures.\n With each \"Stretch goals\" we will add a free miniature to the \"Starter Pack\"\n You can add some miniatures of the catalog with a big discount, but remember that these miniatures do not carry the staging pedestal, they contain the standard base of plastic.\nYou can place orders to MOMminiaturas from all over the world.

However, because we ship Kickstarter pledges out along with retail versions of the game, in some rare cases the game may end up in local stores, or at conventions, before it arrives to you.

Our only outstanding campaign is Nickelodeon Splat Attack, which is on track to deliver in February.\n\nIDW Games, a division of IDW Publishing, has been publishing games into retail via standard distribution channels for over 5 years.\n\nAll of our games are manufactured in China, and as such there are a few issues that could potentially slow the delivery of our campaign. The most common issues are production delays due to plastic quality, shipping delays due to vessel schedules and weather, and customs clearance when the goods come into America. There is always the potential that one of these things could cause a delay in the delivery of pledges of this campaign to backers. When these types of delays do affect campaigns, we're quick to update backers with the current situation.\n\nFinally, while it's unfortunate, it isn't uncommon for first printing of games, whether they're Kickstarted or not, to have small typos and print errors. While we work hard to avoid those, there's always a chance they may come up. In the past, we've reprinted and replaced cards with errors at our cost, but we may not always be able to provide that service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Change is Constant Bundle", "descp": "Get the Change is Constant bundle, which includes TMNT Adventures: Change is Constant, The Stan Sakai Character Box, and the Loner Raph Alt Sculpt and 3 additional Raph hero dice.

Never fear, the Gangfight Skirmish Game System is here! With our all new hardcover rulebook, you will learn how to play games in any setting, with any miniatures you want! Perhaps you'd like to see if a Warjack can kill a Dreadnought? Or maybe you'd like to create a heroic warband with fantasy characters from 4 different game systems? All of this is possible with the Gangfight Skirmish Game System!\nFirst, we have our core ruleset. You can use these rules to play most games, but you can take your games further with our included Setting Supplements. The book will contain both Fantasy and Science Fiction Setting Supplements, and with your help we hope to unlock many more with our stretch goals. All supplements we are able to unlock in this campaign will be included in the book, increasing the page count and overall value.\nWant to check it out for yourself? Click below to download the preview rules!\nThe preview rules are still under construction, but this PDF will give you a good idea of how the book will look when it's finished, and you can start playing now! This preview includes the Fantasy supplement, the Science Fiction supplement will be added soon.\nCreate the characters in your gang by increasing their attributes, like Strength or Ranged Combat. Next assign them some skills and equipment. Each character is worth a certain amount of XP, and each character's XP adds up to your Fame level. If both players have a gang of equal Fame, your game will be balanced and fair. Most gangs consist of around 10 unique, 28-32mm scale miniatures, all with their own special skills and weapons.\nPlayers alternate activating one character at a time. Characters have a set number of actions each turn, allowing them to move, shoot, cast spells, grab some loot, dive through windows or bash each other's brains in. Like other common tabletop battle games, gangfights are played on a board with your own terrain pieces to decorate it, and distances are measured in inches.\nWhen you fight, you roll a number of six-sided dice equal to your combat attributes with a set target number to reach. For each hit scored, the enemy target will roll dice equal to his Defense attribute for a saving throw. If he doesn't roll high enough to block the attack, he loses a Health point. When his Health is all gone, he's out of action.\nMost games last for 6 turns, and often come down to just a couple of gangfighters still standing. You have the option to take your games further by including special objectives to capture, or special scenarios to play that could have victory conditions beyond just getting the most kills.\nInterested in a our western horror skirmish game, Blackwater Gulch? The rules are exactly the same, but this Gameworld Rulebook features a rich background & history, fiction, gang bios, unique items, special powers and a lot more! Simply increase your pledge amount to include any of the below items and we'll ship everything together!\nIf you are interested in adding on additional copies of the core Gangfight rulebook, you may increase your pledge by $25 for each additional copy, or $20 if you are an Early Bird backer!\nWe can ship our rulebook to anywhere in the world. Shipping will be charged separately after the campaign. When your rewards ship, if you happen to be hit with any additional VAT or customs charges, you will have to pay your postal service to receive your item, but we will reimburse you for these additional fees via Paypal if that happens. We have increased our funding goal slightly to cover these random charges, should they occur. \nWe expect our US shipping cost for one rulebook to cost roughly $10 or slightly less.

The company specialises in War game rules, table top games and miniature figures based in Nottinghamshire, UK. http://www.standtogames.co.uk/ \nIn recent years we have both had success with published rules sets, the Warlord Games Black Powder supplements Albion Triumphant volume 1 & 2 being good examples of our work. Following the launch of our successful rule set \u201cOver the Hills a Napoleonic War game\u201d, we also launched our \u201cOver the Hills Fatigue Board\u201d project on Kickstarter in Spring 2017;  this also proved successful and we delivered to backers within 6 weeks.\n In August 2017 we launched our first skirmish wargame entitled Forager the Napoleonic Skirmish Game accompanied by our very own 28mm Napoleonic figure range including French, Portuguese, Spanish and British characters for the Forager game. The campaign funded in three days and was a huge success with project delivery times being met. \n We now are pleased to announce the  launch of our next exciting new project Rise and Fight Again the American Revolutionary Wargame. \nRise and Fight Again Front Cover\n When designing Rise and Fight Again we set ourselves several key objectives: - \nWe wanted to Produce a fast paced easy to play game where the Psychological effect of warfare was strongly reflected throughout the game and the rule mechanics.\n Command and Control and AWI tactics should be firmly rooted in the game . Whilst National Characteristics should shape how each nation fights.\n We also wanted to ensure that Players can use all the modern figure scales available e.g. 6 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 28 mm and The game must accommodates numerous model to actual men ratios, with no rebasing required. \nAs we worked through the rule set we constantly revisited our aims and objectives to ensure that we did not stray from our goal.\n The Rise and Fight Again rulebook is split into two sections, the first is entitled the Game Rules , and here you will find all you need to play a fast paced AWI game. This section contains over 50 pages that includes full colour diagrams, photographs and structured easy to follow rules. \nContents Page Rise and Fight Again\nThe final section is the appendices, were you will find information on how to set up your games of Rise and Fight Again a comprehensive list of units that took part in the War, as well as detail on brigade and divisional structures and much more. \nBasing and Scale of the Game\n True to our objectives, the rules can be played in most figure scales and the rules are so flexible that players do not have to rebase their armies and armies based to different rules systems can be played against each other. \nUnits in the Game \nAnother of our foundation stones for Rise and Fight Again is the way we represent the capabilities of infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. We wanted to keep this as simple as possible and decided that a unit be they infantry cavalry or artillery would have only one statistics, a Fatigue Score. The Fatigue score of a unit is a numerical representation of the unit\u2019s combat capabilities based on its Grade and its \u00c9lan. A units training, combat experience and psychological state are all rolled up into the units Fatigue Score. The higher the Fatigue Score number, the better the troop type will perform...\nFatigue Scores Rise and Fight Again\nNational characteristics and a unit\u2019s number of officers and men can also affect a typical unit\u2019s Fatigue Score. This Fatigue Score can be modified during the game, when units suffer Fatigue Hits taken during the movement, shooting and combat phases. To counteract that, commanders have the ability to rally units, a commander who successfully rallies a unit removes a number of Fatigue Hits.\n A Fatigue hit marker can be something as simple as a dice or counter whilst some players have created mini dioramas for their markers. It does not matter as long as whatever you choose has the ability to record the number of hits that a unit has taken.\n Command and Orders \nIn the basic game we take a simple approach to command and control. Commanders have a command range; subordinate commanders have to remain within the command range of their direct senior officer, whilst units have to stay within the command range of their commander. Commanders and units that fall outside command range are restricted to half moves or no move depending on their situation. To represent effect of the \u2018close\u2019 terrain of the battlefield and the near company level of independent command all units have to roll a D10 whether in or out of command \nCommand and Control Rise and Fight Again\n Commanders have two other factors that define them, their Control Factor and their Inspiration Factor The commander\u2019s Control Factor is a measure of his and his staff\u2019s skill and flare for command. It includes such things as how good they are at following orders, their ability to show initiative in the field and their tactical ability. A commander\u2019s Control Factor is represented by a number from 1 to 3, with 1 being the poorest and 3 the best. This number is used in the Rally phase of the turn as it identifies the number of units in his command that the commander can influence per turn.\n A Commander\u2019s Control Factor is also used in our Optional rules for Orders and Combat bonuses Some commanders have the ability to inspire troops to do great things, others just don\u2019t cut it. A commander\u2019s Inspiration Factor is a measure of just how good they are at rousing their commands and the factor ranges from -1 through to +2. A commander uses their Inspiration Factor when they are rolling to rally troops under their command. \nThe Turn Sequence \nThe turn sequence makes sure that in Rise and Fight Again your enemy cannot move swiftly across the battlefield and then pour vollies into the ranks of your army that is waiting idly by. In Rise and Fight Again one side moves and then the other fires. This breaks up the classic I go; you go turn sequence in a subtle way. In simple terms the turn sequence is as follows: Side A checks command and moves Side B Fires Side A and B Fight Combats The turn sequence is then repeated with Side B moving and side A firing. \nThe Turn Sequence Rise and Fight Again\nMovement \nIn the movement phase of a turn each unit can move a number of move segments. The formation a unit is in effects the number of move segments available to a unit e.g. an infantry battalion in Line formation has two segments of movement available to it, each segment being of six inches. This means a battalion in line can move up to 12 inches in a turn, but if it takes the second move segment i.e. moves over six inches it will take a Fatigue Hit. Contrast with this an infantry battalion in Open Order Line , this unit can make two move segments of eight inches. In this way there are clear advantages to manoeuvring in OO.\nMove Segments Rise and Fight Again\n The way a unit interacts with terrain is also left up to the player; a player can push their units on through terrain taking Fatigue Hits as they go or they can be more cautious and move through terrain at a reduced speed to prevent their units from taking Fatigue Hits. Changing formation is completed by sacrificing move segments.\n Firing and Combat\nA unit\u2019s Fatigue Score is used in the shooting phase, the higher the Fatigue Score the better chance of a unit scoring hits on enemy units. As a result, better quality units and those that have not suffered much from the turmoil of battle should do well. The Fatigue Score is effected by such factors as range, skirmish class, firer/target formation and cover, plus others.\nShooting Phase Rise and Fight Again\nA D10 is rolled against the modified Fatigue Score and for those of you like me, low rolls are good. Any hits scored are recorded on the target unit as Fatigue Hits. In Rise and Fight Again no figures are removed, once a unit is reduced to zero fatigue it is removed from the game. Rules for units starting to waver and rout are also covered \nIn the close combat phase of a turn represents really close range musket duals for infantry and the actual clash of arms for any other combat type. Units fight using their Fatigue Score, to this are added various combat tactical factors which include the type of unit fighting, and its formation, to name a few. \nAs with the shooting phase a D10 is rolled against the modified Fatigue Score. Combats are decided by the number of Fatigue Hits scored and can range from draws to significant victories for one side or the other. Individual combats can be fought for up to three rounds in each turn. This can lead to very bloody affairs or on occasions combats that ebb and flow one way and then the other.\nCombat Phase Rise and Fight Again\n Winning the Game \nNow some of you may be thinking, \u2018if you can score Fatigue Hits on a unit, which in turn can be rallied off by commanders, how do you win the game?\u2019. Well, once units start to take lots of Fatigue Hits, commanders find it hard to rally those hits off the unit, as the number required, on a die 10, to achieve success is quite low. Whilst commands that take Fatigue Hits across a number of units are also difficult to rally, especially if their commander has a low Control Factor. Rise and Fight Again offers players many optional ways on how they can win the game. I will focus on my favourite:\n Players add up their total army fatigue score e.g. a British Division in 1777 has nine battalions of infantry each with a Fatigue Score of 8 and two artillery batteries with a Fatigue Score of seven. The total Fatigue Score for the division is 86. Players keep a running record of every Fatigue Hit that their army takes and Fatigue Hits that are rallied from units are not removed from the running total. Once an army has taken more than 50% of its total Fatigue Score it is classed as broken and has lost the game. Continuing the example given, the British Division would break when it had taken 44 Fatigue Hits. Players take great delight in seeing their opponents record \u2018the butchers bill\u2019\n The Appendices \nThe Appendices are packed full of new rules and information to allow the player to shape their game the way they want, how you play a game of Rise and Fight Again is really in your hands. Here are a few examples Setting up a game , flank marches, sub units , skirmishers, Militia rules, Points , weather, field works, army lists and national characteristics\nThe 80 +page  rulebook has been professionally edited and contains numerous fantastic photographs obtained via Warlord Games and the Perry Twins. The rulebook taken as a whole has been described as stunning.  \nStretch Goals\n With the project doing so well we have decided to introduce a number of exciting AWI scenarios into the mix. Each Scenario will be released for each \u00a3200 pledged over our original project goal. \nEach scenario will have a scenario back ground, detailed and full colour battle map as well as orders of battle with unit statistics specifically for this rule set. \nThe scenarios will be released in PDF format and hopefully with your backing there  will be  a good number of them to form a stand alone PDF supplement that compliments the ruleset.

While these will complement the existing Crooked Dice range and 7TV skirmish rules, they are suitable for any fantasy, horror or modern gaming settings.\nThe miniatures have been brought to life by the sculpting talents of Ernst Veingart, Steve Saleh, Andrew May, Iain Colwell, Mark Evans and Paolo Fabiani.\nIf we are successful, we have a number of stretch goals that will give backers the opportunity to purchase extra Add Ons for more magnificent and malevolent miniatures - including three large resin models.\nIn addition, the campaign will help fund production of a supporting 7TV Programme Guide and profile cards to allow you to play a Children of the Fields cast.\nAll miniatures are supplied unpainted.\nSO WHO ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE FIELDS?\nThe Children of the Fields is the name given to the occupants of the peculiar village of Winterly. It seems a place out of time, with no trappings of modern technology.\nThe community, led by Lady Sylvia Winterly, has an innate grasp of the wild forces of nature, each member's talent manifesting in its own peculiar way. It is rumoured that some can command the crops or even bring the very scarecrows to life! Others say that the villagers practice pagan rites after dark in worship to some ancient and bloodthirsty power.\nOutsiders scoff at these local superstitions but, if they stay within the village limits after sunset, they may find themselves involved in dreadful rituals to ensure a good harvest or to see unborn children grow up healthy and strong. So don't stay too long...\nInspired by many influences from the darker side of 70s children's television and fiction, this folk horror programme guide draws on the spirit of Summerisle, Devil's End, Mileaway, Milbury and many more to help realise the village of Winterly and it's bizarre inhabitants.\nWHO ARE CROOKED DICE?\nCrooked Dice Game Design Studio has been part of the wargaming hobby since 2010. We specialise in wargames rules and 28mm miniatures inspired by the many and varied iconic worlds of 60s-70s Cult TV. We have a range of over 300 miniatures and an extensive selection of resin terrain and vehicles.\nWe also publish 7TV - wargaming in the world of cult tv. These fun and flexible skirmish rules allow you to recreate any type of cinematic action on the tabletop.\nSO WHAT IS 7TV?\nThe basic rules allow you to put together a cast of between 3 and 24 (or more!) models and fight other casts in abandoned warehouses, secret volcano lairs, forbidding jungles and underwater bases \u2013 in fact anywhere you like! Use your star qualities, special effects and gadgets to get your mission accomplished before the countdown ends and the episode is over. \nThe core rules are generic so, if you\u2019ve seen it on screen or had a dream about your perfect lineup, you can put your cast together quicker than ever before. You can find out more and download a FREE copy of the 7TV rules here.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nKickstarter has been chosen as a way to help fund production of this new set of miniatures and rules. Successful funding via Kickstarter will be the quickest way to deliver more miniatures than if we used our traditional release schedule. So simply more minis, much faster! Plus the reach of Kickstarter is huge, and a community in itself, so we hope it will introduce Crooked Dice to a whole new audience.\nFUNDING TARGET\nWe have set our initial funding target at \u00a32000 which will cover production costs for over 20 new pewter miniatures in the core pledges and the printing of a new set of profile cards for this cast. \nTHE TEAM\nWe are lucky enough to work with some very talented folks and this project would not have been possible without them. Sculpts have been brought to life by Ernst Veingart, Steve Saleh, Iain Colwell, Andrew May and Paolo Fabiani.\nThe painting of display models (sorry folks - the minis all come unpainted) has been brought to you by the talents of Simon Bradley, Andrew Taylor, Mark Dixon and Kevin Dallimore. Kev also provided photography for the campaign and for the Programme Guide, while illustrations are from artists Wayne Peters and Andrew Maclachlan.\nChildren of the Fields was an original idea from Helena Nash, who also provided additional material for the guide. Thanks as always to her and Morgan Nash for their support and ideas in helping me drag the guide kicking and screaming into life!\nSHIPPING\nAs a long standing mail order business with a successful web store, we ship packages all over the world, every day.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster.

This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language of your game during the Pledge Manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs.

Being hit in the legs, has a different effect from being hit in the arms, chest, or head.\nEach soldier is different from the next, they have their own list of skills, and weapons load out. \nDeck building\nBuild a deck, and kit out your soldiers with various skills, and equipment.\nEach player chooses 3 cards per soldier, and places them onto each soldiers Character card: but will keep them secret from the other players.\nFor example: Tactics, and equipment cards\nExample of cards:\nA 'Tactic' card.\nKill Box.....This can be used by a defending soldier. The attacking player may not know you have it.\nPossible result:\nFires at the first enemy soldier appearing in the defenders line of sight, and is within range of their weapon.\nSome Equipment cards\" can include special 'Skills'\nEquipment card example 1:\nFlash Bang grenade:\nYou may carry one extra Flash bang.\n-\nEquipment card example 2:\nMedi-pack:\nYou may carry one medical pack.\n-\nEquipment card example 3:\nRocket launcher:\nOne use of the M72 66.\n-\nEquipment card example 4:\nHeightened senses:\nCan't be stealth attacked.\n2 soldiers can use.\n-\nEquipment card example 5:\nFaster than fire:\nDue to rapid reaction training, the user\u2019s reflects are so finally tuned, that his accuracy maintains perfection, even while being shoot at.\n1 user only.\nCan continue to use throughout the game.\n-\nExample of Soldier skills.\nEach soldier has various skills, and there is a variety of equipment available.\nSkill example 1:\nTransition:\nDoes not cost action points to change weapons.\nSkill example 2:\n-\nAirborne Toughness:\nThis soldier starts the game with 1 extra wound: totalling 11 wounds instead of 10.\nSkill example 3:\n-\nRadio man:\nCost's 5 actions, one use per game, d10s mortar strike.\nResult, 3-2 wounds if hit.\n-\nSkill example 4:\nKnife fighter:\nIf you hit the legs, or arms while attacking using 'Unarmed Combat', then you can choose which area is actually hit.\n-\nSkill example 5:\nRocks for breakfast\nOne use. Use 1 action to shoot (-2 accuracy), and throw a grenade at the same time (D6S+3\u201d)\n-\nCountry skills:\nWhether your mixing, or matching your team, soldiers come with various skills; depending on their country.\nCountry skills are the same for modern, and World War 2. Below is an example of some.\nThe British are the best at unarmed combat (melee). They only need a 4+ to hit, and always strike first, even when charged at in close combat fights.\nThe Royal Marines Commandos are the best Unarmed Combat fighters in the game; needing only a 3+ to hit.\nThe Americans carry the most grenades.\nThe Germans have the shock trooper skill; meaning if they decide to charge a position, then gain extra inches to movement, but can not shoot.\n-\nRegimental Army Skill.\nEvery regiment, corps or squadron has one extra skill which applies to each individual; If the soldier is a member of the SAS, then he has the SAS skill. \nBelow is an example of some.\nRoyal Marines Commando; Stalkers; If an enemy soldier, that you have not already attacked, is within 6 inches, then you can sneak-up, and Commando dagger the enemy. One dice per Marine. Rolling a 10+ equals an insta-kill. Anything else rolled, equals 1 wound per attack. Wounds are allocated by the enemy player, (He can chose which body-part receives the damage: arm, legs etc).\nSpecial Air Service; Camo & Concealment; The SAS section can only be fired upon if an enemy soldier is within 20 inches. Snipers however can still see soldiers with the Camo & Concealment skill.\nWaffen SS; Elite Shock Troops; Can shoot once whiles charging.\nThe modern day soldiers rules include 12 different regimental skills.\nIts up to you, which one you choose, when building your team. \nBritish Forces\nSAS - Special Air Service\nRoyal Marines Commando\nSBS - Special Boat Service\nSRR - Special Reconnaissance Regiment\nParatroopers\nGurkhas\nAmerican Forces\nNavy Seals\nArmy SF Green Berets\nMarine Recon\n101st Airborne\nDelta Force\nArmy Rangers.\n-\nRegimental units for World War 2 \nBritish\n British Commandos (Royal Marines Commandos) \n Paratroopers \n Royal Engineers \n Gurkhas \n Scots Guards\nGerman\nWaffen SS \n Paratroopers \n Panzerjager (Anti tank)\n-\nCharacter card example: \nThis is a example design, and is not the finished version.\nThe stats apply to this particular character only, and differ from other characters.\nYou get 20 different character cards with the rules, 10 Modern, and 10 WW2\nMore characters, and equipment cards can be unlocked in the stretch goals, for teams; such as the Chinese, and Russians.\n-\nC8 Carbine, and the UGL Grenade Launcher are the two main weapons this character uses.\n-\n'5.56mm', and 40mm is the caliber of the round. This determines the damage caused, calculated by where the damage is received, and type of armor the enemy soldier is wearing.\nA 7.62mm round is more powerful than a 5.56mm, and can easily pass through Kevlar armor, but if the defender is wearing 12G (heavy armor) then the attacker may need to hit the arms, or legs instead.\nBlasts are also determined by a direct hit, or shrapnel hits.\n-\nPoint-blank shooting range shows what is needed to roll on the D12 to hit (3+). 6+ for close range, and so on. This apply to that particular weapon.\nSome soldiers carry two different styled weapons (possibly a shotgun, and SMG), so both of their weapons will require a different rolling result.\n-\nBlast Weapons\nYou need to roll: D6, D10, or a D12 for the grenade launcher, when firing a blast weapon, depending on the distance fired.\nYou will also roll a scatter dice, If the scatter dice roll is a hit, then its a direct hit, and everyone under the five inch blast marker is hit.\n-\nRadioman, Gun-slinger etc, are the soldiers skills.\n-\nKevlar is the type of armor this particular character wears.\n-\nUC is unarmed combat, 4+ is needed by the SAS soldier to hit. UC is used when your soldier is within 1 inch of the enemy soldier.\n-\n40mm x2, smoke, and tear, are the types of grenade the SAS soldier carries. He has two shoots with his grenade launcher, plus one smoke, and one tear-gas grenade.\n-\nRifleman lets you know the category he belongs too.\n-\nSAS Rifleman Character Stats SAS Rifleman Character Stats, but you can choose to give him a different 'Regimental' skill, if you prefer him to be a member of the Paras, or SRR etc. \n-\nBrief example of the rules:\nThe rule book is named 'Close Quarter Battle' rules, and written by Vander McLeod.\nThe game is played with a D12 (12 sided dice). Every soldier in the attackers turn has 5 actions each, and the player uses them how he wants to: move, shoot, reload, use a rocket launcher etc.\n-\nSome actions like using a rocket launcher will cost 2 actions.\n-\nYour soldiers are free to go where ever they like, they do not need to be within range of a friendly unit.\n-\nThe defending player also gets to use actions in the attackers turn, but only 3 actions per soldier, and only if attacked; if your Rifleman fires, and hits, or misses, the defender has options. The defender can shot back, run, run, and shoot, or charge.\nEach option has a list of negatives, and more negatives apply if the defending soldier is actually hit.\n'Running' means he can run to cover, if cover is within range, as each member can only move 3, 4, or 5 inches per action, depending on their equipment load.\nIf running, then the attacker can choose to shoot again, but with a -1 accuracy to the roll.

It was comfortable. It felt like something that should come in a fancy paint kit. It specifically helped getting even coverage when I used a washes to bring out details and add low-lights in larger pieces. Being able to easily see the piece from all sides meant I could detail the base as a unit without going back to fix missed spots made the pieces I painted look more cohesive.\"\nJohn S. - \"...a very nicely designed tool. Really enjoyed using it and I have already backed the kick starter. ... really looking forward to the injection molded vice 3-D printed version.\"\nPainting KD:M's Percival on The Hobby Holder\nAfter a lot of research, injection molding is the best option for produceability while maintaining the strength and finish the Hobby Holder needs to stand up to the crafting table. However, injection molds are not cheap to produce, especially with multiple \"side pulls\" (that's a term I learned talking to the manufacturer). Add in the fact that the Hobby Holder requires two molds; one for the handle and one for the base. If we are successful with the funding goal we will be able to produce the molds, enough Hobby Holders for all backers and the official packaging\nI love board games. I love D&D. I love building and painting miniatures. And I love sharing my creations with my friends.\nLike many miniature painters and hobbyists, I began by mounting miniatures on bottle caps, wine corks and paint bottles. I began working on the yet to be named Hobby Holder several years ago while I was looking for a way to improve my technique, comfort, speed and most of all enjoyment while painting miniatures. While I was casting miniatures one day, I had an idea and cast a soda bottle neck and a champagne cork. Hooking them together, the first official version of the Hobby Holder was born.\nFor a while this worked well, and I could see other people wanting to use it for their hobbies. However, I wanted to create something that was easier to use and more comfortable over long painting sessions. I began sketching some designs and looking into the feasibility of producing a marketable version for other like-minded painters.\nI brushed up on my 3D modeling skills and began creating the first renderings of the Hobby Holder. Using 3D printing, I produced a plethora of prototypes for myself and other painters and sculptors to test.\nFast forward more than 30 versions, and I felt the Hobby Holder was complete. After putting it through final testing it received the thumbs up from volunteers in the painting community.\nThroughout the process, I have remained in close contact with the injection mold manufacturer making sure the Hobby Holder was easily producible while maintaining all injection molding standards.\nI am working closely with a US-based manufacturer and have the Hobby Holder\u2019s final files submitted and in standby mode. Pending any issues with the molds, I was quoted a three-week turnaround for the final samples to be built, produced and delivered to me. During those three weeks, I plan to send out surveys to select options and add-ons based on your pledge levels.\nAfter the order is placed, I anticipate receiving all the Hobby Holders during the first weeks of January. Packaging and mailing should take place the following two weeks. US-based backers should be receiving their rewards early February while International backers should receive theirs shortly after that.\nAll backers at The Hobbyist level and above will receive the final injection molded version of the Hobby Holder and all applicable stretch goals. Backers can choose to receive the official blue and green retail Hobby Holder or mix and match the available colors.\nMix and Match 7 Handle and 7 Base Colors\nThe Hobbyist $20 USD (Early Bird - $18 | Not As Early Bird $19)\nThe Dungeon Crawler $40 USD (Early Bird - $36)\n \nThe Wargamer $60 USD (Early Bird - $54)\nThe Professional $100 (Early Bird - $90)\nAdditional Hobby Holder Base (Green, Black, Red, Midnight Blue, Pink, Silver) - $10\nAdditional Hobby Holder Handle (Blue, Purple, Silver, Marigold Yellow, Black, Orange) - $10\n10x 28mm Bottle Caps (new) - $2.50\n44mm Plexiglass Base Extender (affix to a cap of your choice) - $2\n3mm x 40mm carbon fiber cork popper (the quickest way to remove cork) - $2\nAdditional shipping will need to be added for orders over 8oz. Weights and shipping will be added automatically in BackerKit.\nThe Funny Man and The Flying Rat Color Combo\nFire and Ice Color Combo\n   My name is Kit Peteranecz, and I am the founder of Game Envy Creations and the creator of the Hobby Holder. I\u2019m a husband, father of two humans and two cats and am employed full-time as a graphic designer while also maintaining a freelance graphic design business. Throw in the fact that I\u2019m a tabletop gamer, hobbyist, inventor and a board game designer with a love of painting and building miniatures and models \u2013 and you can see, I don\u2019t have a lot of time. But, I dedicated myself to bringing an awesome product to the market that I love and wanted others to experience as well.\nThank you so much for considering pledging to bring the Hobby Holder to life. I get so excited imagining the Hobby Holder in the hands of all skill level and ages all over the world.

Previously the shadowy members of the Thieves Guild, they have opened their doors to keep the citizenry safe. Of course, this protection comes at a price, and those that don't pay it... well there are lots of disappearances in Venice, who's going to miss one more person?\nThe Guild work to overwhelm their enemies with numbers, using multiple citizens to support their specialists, and led to battle by the enigmatic and acrobatic Capodecina. The Guild need to work together to protect themselves, striking in numbers to defeat any foe.\nThe Guild's Faction Box contains a dizzingly fast Capodecina to lead your gang, a deadly Barber, a Butcher to hold the line, and two Citizens.\nThe Guild Bundle A contains some of the more esoteric members of the faction.\nA King Pulcinella leads his Pulcinella and Ostrich Riding Pulcinella. These citizens have decided to eschew all responsibility and focus solely on causing havoc. A Madame takes to the streets to protect her two Harlots, both male and female. These characters support your warriors and are demure enough that the opponent will never see the short knife coming when they turn their backs.\nThe Guild Bundle B gives you more tactical options than ever!\nThe Bundle is lead by a Prince of Thieves, offering some sneaky support to your gang. He's backed up by a Baroni, who is a pistolier with no equal. A Dog Keeper with two Dogs, a Recruiter to bolster your Citizens, a Gondolier and a swift Pilferer complete this set.\nThe Guild stole a shipment of magical artefacts, and within they found these lamps. The lamps exude an other-worldly energy that seems to counteract the effects of the Rent, cancelling out magic wherever they shine. The Black Lamps take them to battle to protect their fellow Guild-members.\nThe Rialto Assassin is even more shadowy than The Guild themselves. He (they?) didn't originally get along with The Guild, but has since reached a mutually beneficial shaky truce.\nBaba-Yaga's origins are a mystery. People say that she has been living in Venice for centuries. A blood sacrifice is required to summon her to battle, and The Guild don't undertake that pact lightly. But times must, and her magical expertise is unsurpassed, meaning that her cauldron is often overflowing crimson.\n The Rashaar\nIt's a good bet to say that if there is a monster roaming the streets at night, it will be one of the many creatures of the Rashaar. Summoned by a Magi-Rashaar or members of the Cult of Dagon, the Ugdru, Radru, and Agl\u00e1ope all consume and consort with the cult's members, becoming stronger or transforming cultists into new monstrous hybrids.  \nThe Rashaar are a faction heavily invested in both magic and monsters, with the most mages and the toughest characters in the game, the Rashaar have a multitude of play styles.\nThe Faction Box of the Rashaar contains the powerful Magi-Rashaar to cast magic into battle. He's supported by a hulking Ugdru, the alluring and magical Agl\u00e1ope, and two Slaves to get in the way or become food!\nRashaar Bundle A introduces the Cult of Dagon. Lead by The Voice of Dagon, the two Officiants and joined by an Agl\u00e1ope showing her true form. The four of them accompany a Kaceros-Rashaar, a dangerous and vile creature summoned forth by the Rent.\nThe Rashaar Bundle B contains a whole host of monsters and dregs of society. A Priest of Dagon joins forces with a majestic but deadly Siren, leading two Advanced Hybrids, a Hybrid, and a Hybrid Gondolier. Finally they are all joined by the colossal Radru-Rashaar, a monster as deadly to its opponents as it is to any Slaves in the gang, as it can eat them whole to regain its stamina!\nThe Flame That Burns Underwater is a mystic creature, emerging from the depths to terrify her quarry and drag them back to from whence she came.\nThe Karcharos is the ultimate predator, combining the cunning and bloodthirsty nature of a deep sea creature with legs to fully traverse the ground of Venice. Don't be caught by one in an alley!\nWe said that the Rashaar had the biggest monsters, and we weren't lying! The Morgraur towers over men and buildings alike, bursting forth from the depths of the canals of Venice to feast upon hapless citizens.\nDoctors of the Ospedale\nOriginally built as a mental institution, the Ospedale dei mente Santa Maria dei Senzatetto now serves a much more sinister purpose. Using the insane to power their magics and technologies, The Doctors quickly burn out the minds of their unfortunate charges, necessitating the need to stalk the streets and bring in the homeless and needy to the dark and bloody dungeons of the Ospedale.\nThe Doctors make heavy use of special attacks and abilities, channelling the power from their madmen to boost them. With lots of specialists the Doctors are able to tailor their gang to deal with almost any threat, just as long as they keep their madmen alive.\nThe Doctors Faction Box contains a vile Plague Doctor, out to do nefarious experiments on the people of Venice. He is joined by a Doctor of the Arsenal, who using stored magic potential to power his spirit cannon. Finally a Warden keeps the two Madmen in check, so that the Doctors can siphon their magical energy for themselves.\nThe Doctors Bundle A contains a Doctor of the Mind, performing his experiments with the help of a Nurse. The Unleashed Madman is the result of the experiments, and a Warden is there to keep them in check. The Doctor of Beasts forces a Winged Ape to traverse the streets, bringing pain to the citizens of Venice.\nThe Doctors Bundle B has all the support a gang will need. With a Doctor of the Beasts herding a mutated Lion into battle, he's joined by his Lab two Assistants and a Carrion. An Alchemist Doctor follows, throwing his concoctions at opponents, destroying their bodies and minds in the process.\nIf you feel like you don't quite have enough weird creatures, the Doctors' Menagerie bundle is for you! A modified Crocodile and Rhinoceros will bring all the damage you need to your gang!\nThe Morgue Doctor brings The Being to life and to the streets of Venice. This twisted creation will tower over even the most stalwart of fighters, taking as much pain as they can give out without even flinching.\n\nPatricians\nWealth, power, arrogance. Few words describe the patricians more, the ruling class of Venice spend their days gambling and attending parties. By night the nobles roam the streets looking for a fight, flanked by other nobles and their attendants. The patricians only care about a good time. If that involves killing unfortunate citizens on the street in the dead of night, so be it.\nThe Patricians are an expensive faction, but get what they pay for. Each character is individually strong, and more of their characters are able to pick the weapons they are equipped with than any other faction. With more possibilities of ranged weapons you can play to the Patrician's defensive strengths.\nA Noble leads his gang into battle. His followers include two Barnaboti - nobles in everything but name - his stalwart Butler, and a fierce Maid.\nThe Patricians play out a constant carnival, but use their wealth to buy off the city to continue their perverse pleasures. Patricians Bundle A sees them recruit a City Guard Commander, Guard Captain, and three City Guard. The bundle also includes a Foreign Noble, Foreign Spy, and a greedy Merchant.\nPatricians Bundle B contains all the support staff, friends, and characters a noble can surround themselves with. A Fencing Master trains the house, while a Butler, Maid, and two Courtesans help keep the noble happy. A White-Collar Thief has made her way into high society with her daring raids, while the Adventuring Noble has done so with his stories of far off lands and magic learned whilst there. Finally the Syphilitic Noble shows the hidden side of noble life.\nSun & Moon are two Patricians who have been affected by the Rent. They manifested magical powers but rather than renting out their services to the highest bidder with many other Gifted, they use their magics to show off in front of their other noble brethren. While flashy and mysterious, their powers are a welcome addition to many a noble's gang.\nThe Vatican\nOriginally the recipient of the Herald's knowledge, members of the Vatican transcribed many magics before having him assassinated. This would cause a great shift in the church as the assassination caused the great Rent in the Sky to appear over Italy, shattering the very land itself. After the destruction of Rome the Holy See needed a new pope, electing the very same man that had plotted the downfall of the Herald. The Pope now sends a delegation to Venice, to bring the light of God back to the city, as well as look for a copy of the book made from the knowledge of the Herald and the man that stole it.\nSynergy is the key to the Vatican, using the right miracles and skills will ensure the dominance of the church. While each individual of the Vatican may not be the strongest, or the fastest, they form part of a whole and need to work together to being the light of God to Venice.\nThe Vatican Faction Box contains everything you need to get started with the Holy See. An Inquisitor leads two Priests to battle, accompanied by their Altarboy. The darker side of the new church also shows its head with the mighty form of an Executioner.\nThe Vatican Bundle A has eight fighters that show the varied nature of the church. An Exorcist and Inquisition Commissioner lead, supported by a Cross-bearing Deacon, and the healing hands of a Lacrimosa. A Prelates of the Flaming Sword and a Knight of Malta provide offensive capabilities, and two Martyrs show their devotion.\nDomonique de Pierre de Bernis leads this envoy from the Vatican in France. He brings with him two Bishop Guards, two French Guard, and an Altar Boy. The Witch Hunters Felix Baumgartner and Thomas Thieme join them - whilst they might not be completely in line with The Vatican's thinking, they are reluctant allies in the madness of Venice.\nThe Summoner Priest calls for a mighty Golgotha from the very paving stones of Venice itself. A once-pure summoning ritual has become twisted by the vile nature of the city itself, warping into a bloodthirsty creature with a single purpose.\nStrigoi\nThe Rent in the Sky awoke a man that should have been long dead, Vlad Tepes Dracula. Gathering his strength and what Strigoi he could muster, he learned of the Rent and knew that beyond it he could sate his eternal thirst. Slaughtering his way to Venice Dracula regained the aid of the Romani people as well as brought the curse of the Varcolac back into the world. Gaining new allies in Venice the Strigoi are not a force to be trifled with.\nThe Strigoi rely on their powerful vampires to do the heavy lifting, while the mortal elements of a Strigoi force are there to support their vampire masters. With more unique characters than other factions the Strigoi need to be careful to protect their more expensive characters and get the most use out of them.\nThe Strigoi Faction Box contains a Noble Strigoi, fitting in with high society, a Strigoi, a bloodthirsty Newborn Strigoi, and two Servants.\nVlad Dracula is the most infamous Strigoi in the lands. In Strigoi Bundle A he's accompanied by his three Brides: Miriam, Ceres, and Cibele. The three have a collection of monsters with them: a Strigoi, an Aquatic Strigoi, a crazed Reaper, and a deadly and mobile Strige.\nStrigoi Bundle B contains two of the ancient and frail Nosferatu, a perverse Strigoi Priest, and a Romani train. Two Romanis help the Stirgoi during the daytime, and are led by a Blood Crone, and supported by the fierce Varcolac.\nGifted\nThe Gifted are a band of loners. They are from all walks of life, united by one thing: the Rent in the Sky. They got given strange powers during the event. Some see these as a blessing, and others see them as a constant reminder of those they've lost, and the world left behind. The powers given often have a bittersweet taste, manifesting as forms of their shattered psyches.\nThe Gifted aren't a faction in themselves, but can be taken alongside any other gang... for a price. They give powerful abilities to help your warriors or act as one-warrior armies, battering your opponents into oblivion.\nIl Capitano, Il Dottore, Pantaleone, Colombina, and Brighella make up the Commedia dell'Arte, a troupe of actors who have been changed by the Rent in the Sky. As time goes on they sink more into the characters they once played on stage, becoming a twisted reflection of humanity.\nGifted Collection 1 contains a whole selection of the weird and wonderful beings that have been changed by the Rent. Fate and Justice are two sides of the same coin. Only one shows up at any time, but can become the other with but a second's glance away. Fadhila-bint-Dahab has learned to control her powers, able to push attackers away and protect her friends. The Duke is a most enigmatic of individuals. No one quite knows who he is or what he can do, but he has a twisted sense of justice and a code that he follows to the letter. Finally, the Aberration is a result of The Doctors' twisted arts. A man who was changed by the Rent and then experimented on, an otherworldly energy erupted forth from his body, mutating him forever.\nGifted Collection 2 contains some of the greatest heroes and most depraved monsters in Venice. Harlequin is so fast that he is almost impossible to hit in combat, which makes his upbeat personality even more frustrating to his foes. White Dove flies through the air, stopping opponents with her magical blasts. Divuorafuoco is a man turned mad, his puppet Burattino coming to life and enacting a bloody vengeance on the city. Finally, Black Spectre is what remains of a man that has passed through death itself. The Rent destroyed his family, estate, and the man he was, coming back from the other side to torment the survivors of the city. \nVenetian Scenery Bundle A contains a whole set of card buildings and card playing tiles. Just like the 2 player starter this will now contain 16 buildings!\nVenetian Scenery Bundle B contains 8 MDF buildings to replace the card ones in your 2-Player Starter Box. Please note this bundle cannot be chosen as one of the pledge level A or B bundles.\nVenetian Scenery Bundle C includes enough MDF board sections to make a full 3' x 3' Venetian table.\nA host of resin accessories.

I was far from certain that we would get there, but had in mind a couple of packs to create for a second stretch goal if that came about; reading and taking note of a couple of comments from different sources, I've decided on a third pack to go alongside these.  \nI'll also be producing another figure which will go out free to backers who pledge for 4 or more stretch goal 2 packs. Here is a quick concept sketch of the figure, he is a Compagnies Franches officer in capote and mitasses. As there is no command pack planned for the La Marine in capotes, this little character should prove pretty useful.\nThe packs will be: \nFIW FCF11: Compagnies Franches de la Marine in capotes and bonnets.\nFIW FCF12: Compagnies Franches de la Marine in capotes and tuques.\nFIW FCF13: Compagnies Franches de la Marine in coats advancing*. \n * I have yet to conclude the last part of the above pack title, as I'm not 100% sure this covers it properly. The plan is that while some of these figures may be advancing with muskets held across their bodies, others may be moving a little more \"tentatively\", I may even include the \"odd\" standing figure. These could be used as a group of their own, or mixed in with some of the firing and loading stances to create a unit skirmishing in coats. \n As with stretch goal 1, you'll be able to add the packs you want, in combinations of your choice at \u00a39.75 + 75p extra shipping = \u00a310.50 per pack. \nI hope you like the idea of these extra packs, the target for stretch goal 2 is \u00a39500.00 and we still have more than two weeks to go.\nT-shirt\n As with our previous Kickstarter project \"Redcoats\", we're releasing a T-shirt as an add-on for \"La Marine\". The T-shirt will be silk screen printed in blue onto an \"ash\" coloured Gildan heavy cotton T (99% cotton, 1% polyester).\nSizes available are: Small (34\"-36\"), Medium (38\"-40\"), Large (42\"-44\"), XL (46\"-48\"), XXL (50\"-52\") and 3XL (54\"-56\").\nIf you would like to add one or more of these T-shirts to your pledge, just add \u00a313 + \u00a32 additional postage (first T-shirt only - additional T-shirts \u00a313 but no extra postage). \nWe'll add these to the online shop after the Kickstarter pledges have gone out, at \u00a316 + postage.\nWe reached our target within 24 hours - en avant!\nFor our first stretch goal for this project, we'll be targeting the Compagnies Franches de la Marine in battalion firing line with regimental coats over their small clothes and carrying ammunition in the shoulder slung giberne, instead of the waist belt mounted gargoussier (both were different from the cartridge box types carried by the fusiliers and grenadiers of the infantry).  \nIllustration for uniform style only by the great Eugene Leliepvre, published by the Company of Military Historians.\nIf we reach the stretch goal for these packs, you'll be able to order as many as you want of each at the special price of \u00a39.75 per pack + an additional \u00a30.75 shipping. Just add \u00a310.50 to your pledge for each pack and make a note of which you've added so you can let me know later if we're successful which you want as your extra rewards. The packs will be:\nFIW FCF8: Compagnies Franches de la Marine in coats firing.\nFIW FCF9: Compagnies Franches de la Marine in coats loading.\nFIW FCF10: Compagnies Franches de la Marine Command pack in coats.\nThe command pack will contain an officer with fuzee, two ensigns, a sergeant with musket, a drummer and a cadet 'a l'eguilette.\nThere will also be a free character figure to accompany pledges for 4 or more of these additional packs, more on this in a few days. \nYou'll be able to add-on Compagnies Franches de la Marine flags by Flags of War for \u00a32.50, no extra shipping.\nTo help us reach the stretch goal, I'm introducing add-ons of our existing French and allies at special prices:  \nCanadian Militia x all 4 packs for \u00a333.00 + \u00a33.00 additional shipping\nHuron x all 4 packs for \u00a333.00 + \u00a33.00 additional shipping\nCanadian Militia x all 4 packs + Huron x all 4 packs for \u00a364.00 + \u00a35.00 additional shipping\nOur stretch goal is set at \u00a37000.\n\nProject description:\nGalloping Major\u2019s range of French & Indian War 28mm figures for wargamers and collectors has gained much praise and a loyal following among our growing customer base. Thanks to our supporters on Kickstarter our first campaign enabled us to release fourteen new packs of Redcoats. If you\u2019re new to our figures, please take a look on our website: www.gallopingmajorwargames.com you\u2019ll also find us on facebook as Galloping Major Ltd Wargames. \nWith your help through Kickstarter, we are planning to add to our French forces with soldiers of the Compagnies Franches de la Marine. Your support could enable us to take another big step forward with the FIW range and if successful, help to create a stronger platform for further releases. \nAs a small company relying on sales of existing packs to finance the release of new ones, before our first Kickstarter project we had been prevented from making new releases available to customers as quickly as we would like to. The high quality of our castings is frequently remarked upon by reviewers and customers alike, and that\u2019s equally important to us, we don\u2019t believe in increasing margins at the cost of \u201ccutting corners\u201d. Producing figures at this standard requires ongoing investment \u2013 but the results speak for themselves. \nWhere we have been able to make savings from the outset is that with all our figures being sculpted by me, unlike with most miniatures companies we don\u2019t have to pay fees for commercial sculptors, nor do we have to wait for their availability to work on our projects; this also guarantees consistency of style, quality, extensive research and attention to detail. The sculpting work has already been completed on many of the first figures for this project and we\u2019ve already invested in master castings for many of them. If enough of you will pledge your support we\u2019ll be able to move forward to completion for you.\nThe Compagnies Franches de la Marine and the French & Indian War\nUntil recently the middle decades of the eighteenth century have been rather sadly overlooked and underrated by manufacturers of 28mm miniature figures for wargamers and collectors, particularly the French & Indian War, which has been a favourite period of mine since childhood.\nWhen I set about creating our French & Indian War range, what I most wanted to build was the most comprehensive, well researched and engaging range of 28mm figures available for the period. We\u2019re well on the way to that objective with our Mohawk and Huron Native Americans, Canadian Militia, Anglo-American Rangers, Armed Settlers, Militia and Provincials, 18th Century Sailors and now our British Regular \u2018hatmen\u2019; time now to move forward with our first French regular troop type.\nThe Compagnies Franches de la Marine were regular soldiers raised in France for colonial service; in New France the majority of their officers were Canadian born and bred. They were regular soldiers but independent of the French army. The soldiers of \u201cLa Marine\u201d were not the ships\u2019 marines which served with the French Royal Navy, but were Independent Companies who boarded ships to be taken to the French colonies which they were raised to defend and where they kept the peace through policing duties; they were encouraged to, and many did, settle in the colonies with a grant of land after their term of service was up, then joining the extensive Canadian militia system. The Compagnies Franches were first raised as early as 1622, only to be stood down five years later, not to be raised again until 1671 \u2013 by the beginning of the 18th century there were twenty-eight companies serving in Canada.\nAs Independent Companies, La Marine garrisoned forts and outposts by company or detachment throughout the frontiers of New France as well as the more settled areas. Commanded by Canadian officers, most of whom had already gained twenty to thirty years\u2019 experience of wilderness warfare, they fought alongside the Canadian militia and French-allied Indians in skirmishes and raids against Anglo-American and allied Indian settlements. In this way as disciplined regulars, they learned to serve in a light infantry role. As Independent Companies they had no battalion structure, though Montcalm did form a service battalion of Compagnies Franches de la Marine in 1757, Levis organised two battalions in 1760.\nOur first packs for the Compagnies Franches will comprise soldiers in two orders of dress: FIW FCF 1-3 in Canadian/outpost clothes \u2013 dressed in shirts and mitasses (Indian leggings), FIW FCF 4-7 in vestes etc. They will be equipped with the gargoussier (waist cartridge box) and powder flask for their muskets.\nThe French & Indian War was the vital North American theatre of the Seven Years War. With the rise of popularity of several sets of recently released skirmish rules alongside an increase in gaming the decisive battles of Europe and North America, we hope that this, our second Kickstarter project will be well received. If successful, we plan to continue releasing more troops for French and British armies alongside more North American participants for both sides \u2013 at an ever increasing pace. This all rests on your support.\nThe reward levels comprise combinations of the these seven packs:\nFIW FCF1 Compagnies Franches de la Marine in Canadian/outpost clothes and Bonnet  \nFIW FCF2 Compagnies Franches de la Marine in Canadian/outpost clothes and Tuque\nFIW FCF3 Compagnies Franches de la Marine Command in Canadian/outpost clothes\nFIW FCF4 Compagnies Franches de la Marine in Veste and Bonnet\nFIW FCF5 Compagnies Franches de la Marine in Veste and Chapeau (tricorn)\nFIW FCF6 Compagnies Franches de la Marine Command in Veste\nFIW FCF7 Compagnies Franches de la Marine in Veste and Mitasses (Indian leggings)\nEach pack contains 6 different figures.\nWho we are:\nGalloping Major Ltd is a small one-man company in the rural East Riding of Yorkshire, England, run by myself, Lance Cawkwell, with help from my family, especially my wife, who has a degree in history and a background in jewellery design. I design and sculpt the figures, we pack and post out the castings which are produced for us by probably the world\u2019s top-rated craftsman casting service here in the UK. As I know from many years as a designer and illustrator, quality of design and production are mutually essential to be able to achieve the best results, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been aiming for from the start.\nWhy should I back this?\nYou\u2019ll be helping us to make these figures available to you more quickly and with greater variety.\nYou\u2019ll get your exciting new Compagnies Franches de la Marine at a price advantage and before they go on general sale.\nWe will be thanking everyone who backs our project with special free figures.\nOur first free figure for all backers of our Compagnies Franches de la Marine project who pledge for 6 packs or more, will be this gentleman (concept sketch):\nA figure representing Montreal born Daniel Hyacinthe de Lienard de Beaujeau at the battle of Monongahela, but could easily well be used to represent other officers of La Marine in \u201cnative dress\u201d. \nIf successfully supported in our Kickstarter, we\u2019ll add a Stretch Goal that we think may be equally well received.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis being our second Kickstarter project, I can say that we learned a lot from running our first project, both in the

Players control a party of medieval fantasy survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of zombie orcs controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!\nHere's everything that's been added to the basic Horde pledge:\nAnd here's everything you can add if you want:\nClick the links to find out more about Friends and Foes, No Rest for the Wicked, Paul Bonner box, Adrian Smith box, Ultimate Survivors, Extra Tiles Pack, Rat King & Swamp Troll, 3D Plastic Obstacles, 3D Plastic Hedges, Massive Darkness Crossover,  Fatty Bursters, and the Classic Optional Buys: Deadeye Walkers, 3D Doors, and Plastic Token Pack.\nZombicide: Green Horde expands upon the fantasy universe introduced by Zombicide: Black Plague. A new group of Survivors of different species will bring their unique expertise to the fight against the undead armies threatening to crush the kingdom.\nGreen Horde's survivors: Rolf, Megan, Asim, Berin, Johannes, and Seli.\nAs they explore the ravaged villages, Survivors gather all manner of equipment to aid them in their quest. From swords, hammers, bows, and armor, to magic scrolls and flasks of dragon bile! All of that equipment is neatly displayed in each Survivor's plastic dashboard, with appropriate slots for each type of card, as well as trackers for wounds, skills, and experience.\nBerin's Dashboard with a full inventory.\nSome of the equipment in Green Horde have a special synergy with other equipment. For example, carrying a Norse Sword is certainly not bad at all. However, it will become a lot more effective, rolling 2 extra dice, if you also manage to equip a Norse Shield on your other hand!\nThe highly detailed Green Horde survivor miniatures.\nThe Survivors will need to be well prepared to deal with the new menace they'll face: Orc Zombies! When the black plague hit the orc tribes, it spread like wildfire, creating a swarm of undead brutes. Orc zombies are stronger than their human counterparts, being able to tear apart the most resilient of Survivors. An attack from an Orc Walker deals 2 wounds, while the attack of an Orc Fatty or Abomination deals a whopping 3 wounds! The little Goblin Runners only deal 1 Wound per attack, but they are fast and numerous, so don't judge them by their size. And finally, while the Orc Necromancer is not very deadly in itself, you'll want to eliminate it quickly, as its powers bring even more Orc Zombies onto the board.\nThe Green Horde: Orc Walker, Goblin Runner, Orc Fatty, Orc Necromancer and Orc Abomination.\nAs lethal as the Orc Zombies are, probably the scariest thing about them is their ability to launch surprise attacks by unleashing an overwhelming horde against the Survivors. Every time an Orc Zombie spawn card is drawn, one extra zombie of the indicated type is added to a \"Horde area\" outside the board. As the game progresses, players will watch with dread as the looming threat of the horde grows in number, just out of sight. When an \"Enter the Horde!\" card is drawn, all miniatures in the Horde area are placed in the spawning Zone. The situation just got a lot more dire!\nThe imposing Orc Zombie miniatures.\nTo give them a fighting chance against the green horde, the Survivors have gotten their hands on a mighty trebuchet! This ingenious catapult can hurl all manner of payloads across great distances, striking powerful blows against the undead invaders. This siege engine is extremely difficult to operate, requiring 3 actions to either push it to the next zone, or to fire it against the enemy. However, the Trebuchet can fire at any zone in the game (and even against the looming Horde), with no regard to distance or line of sight. Survivors can also choose among 3 types of ammunition to use, from a scattershot that can decimate a swarm of Walkers, to a boulder that can kill an Abomination if aimed right!\nThe powerful Trebuchet makes for an amazing miniature.\nZombicide: Green Horde expands the action into the outskirts of the kingdom, where the villages blend with picturesque crops and hedges. The crops have withered in the abandoned villages, and some streets are flooded with the irrigation water, but these features create new challenges and opportunities for Survivors. Waterhole zones slow down the Survivors (and douse Dragon Fire), but some of their edges are steep ledges that Zombies are unable to climb out of, forcing them to make a detour while you run for safety. Hedges block line of sight, but not movement, allowing Survivors to play a dangerous game of hide and seek with the Zombies (however, you never know what might be waiting on the other side of a hedge).\nWaterholes and Hedges on the new tiles.\nZombicide: Green Horde comes with:\n9 double-sided game tiles \n72 miniatures  \n6 survivor plastic dashboards, color bases, and ID Cards \n48 plastic trackers\n6 dice \n133 cards \n68 tokens \n1 Rulebook\nPreview Rulebook:\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nWe invited Rodney Smith, from Watch It Played, to try out Zombicide: Green Horde, and give you all a brief overview of its rules as he plays through a bit of the game.\nHorde Pledge\nFor $120, the Horde Level pledge gets you: Zombicide: Green Horde core box (SRP $100) + the Kickstarter Exclusive Feral Dragon pack (ERP $30) + All Applicable Stretch Goals.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only.\nDragon Bile had to come from somewhere, right? The Feral Dragon is a Kickstarter Exclusive expansion that all backers will receive. It adds a massive foe which will shake your game experience to its foundation! Spawned similarly to an Abomination, the Feral Dragon enters the game by stomping the central Zone of its tile, reducing any building there to a pile of rubble, and scattering or killing any being unfortunate enough to be there.\nTowering above everything else, the Feral Dragon sees all, showering the nearby Zone with the most Survivors with its deadly dragon breath, or flying to the next adjacent tile to further smash the village and chase its prey. Bringing down the Feral Dragon will certainly not be easy. Each time it lands it features a vulnerability to only a specific weapon type, and damaging it only makes it fly away, waiting to dive into the village again when a new Spawn card is drawn. Only once all of its 8 Vulnerability cards have been used, the Feral Dragon is finally eliminated for good from the game (its Spawn cards now bringing some respite to Survivors).\nScale comparison between the Feral Dragon and Asim, the Survivor.\nTo help Survivors in their quest to bring down the Feral Dragon, this pack comes with a new Siege Engine: a Ballista, including its awesome miniature. Lighter than the Trebuchet, the Ballista can be moved or fired by spending only 2 actions. The Ballista's piercing bolt is able to target several Zones in a straight line, wiping out loads of enemies.\n3D render of the Ballista.\nFind out more about the Friends and Foes expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the No Rest for the Wicked expansion HERE.\n Find out more about the Ultimate Survivors HERE.\n Find out more about the Extra Tiles Pack HERE.\n Find out more about the Rat King & Swamp Troll HERE.\nFind out more about the Paul Bonner Special Guest Box HERE.\nLearn more about the Adrian Smith Special Guest Box HERE.\nLearn more about the 3D Plastic Obstacles HERE.\nLearn more about the 3D Plastic Hedges HERE.\nLearn more about the Massive Darkness Crossover HERE.\nFind out more about the Fatty Bursters HERE.\nCLASSIC OPTIONAL BUYS:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on the Zombicide: Green Horde Kickstarter page and in the pledge manager add the amount of the items you'd like to get. We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 27th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is about to begin the shipping process, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch and Rising Sun which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Green Horde.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

His hordes of death are the inspiration!\nTriumph of Death: 28mm Renaissance skeleton army miniatures cast in white metal for gamers and collectors, by Skull and Crown Stratagem, Inc.\nEvery idea or mad scheme starts with a back story...\nThe first miniatures wargame I played in was an epic battle between a Renaissance skeleton army vs. Romans. The miniatures were old Minifigs models from the late 70's or early 80's, with stylized Romans and a fantastic undead/skeleton army. They were possibly the first skeleton minis ever made and modeled after Hans Holbein's Dance of Death, or \"Totentanz\" renaissance wood block prints from the 1500\u2019s. They weren't the best sculpts, but man - did they catch the essence of the period. Those skeleton hordes and that \"Totentanz\" style stuck with me like a first crush. Older than Oldhammer, my bell had been rung!\nI've always wanted to recreate an updated line of minis in the Totentanz style, but never had the sculpting chops to pull it off. Last year I became friends with an amazing sculptor, Drew Day Williams, who shared my passion to create a range of 28mm skeletons in the vein of Renaissance artists like Holbein, D\u00fcrer and Peter Breugel. This is how the \"Triumph of Death\" (or ToD for short) range of miniatures came about.\nThe goal of Triumph of Death is to create a line of Renaissance-inspired 28mm white metal undead skeletal miniatures for collectors and for use in RPGs and table top wargames. In a word, Skeleton Landsknechts!\nGW Landsknechts vs Triumph of Death minis \"Late\" Landsknechts\nHere's the Hook\nI've worked hard to get the Triumph of Death project well underway, with over 14 miniatures designed, and sculpted. A good share of them have also been molded and some prototypes cast- but not enough to share with you all.\nThat\u2019s where you come in! With your help we can get these models out onto the battlefields, and start up a war chest to create the reinforcing units to support them!\nThe Team\nTriumph of Death miniatures are designed by yours truly (Thomas Foss) of Skull and Crown Stratagems, Inc. I've been designing miniatures and games for over 3 decades, and like I said this project has been in my mind and heart for a long while.  Sculpting comes courtesy of the talented and aforementioned Drew Day Williams, who has also done work for Wizkids, Dwarven Forge, and Privateer Press - to name a few. Steve Phillips of Firing Line Miniatures, has been my chief caster and mold maker for almost two decades, and is taking on the title of \"Master Caster\" of these miniatures.\nThis is my second Kickstarter. The project, the sculptors and the production are all located in the USA.\nThe Pledge Guide\nThe campaign starts with a basic pledge level of $1. All the pledge levels above $1 will allow you to make a custom pledge and lets you  include items from the \"add-ons\" list into your pledge. Free models, unlocked based upon achieving stretch goals, will be added in after your pledge has been a totaled. That\u2019s another way of saying \"they won\u2019t cost you\"\u2026 \nFor the pledges which are set up to include units as rewards - the unit selections are below the Pledge Rewards in the \"Unit Choices\" section.\nShipping\nShipping will be applied to your total once you make a pledge. This is always a hard one to balance, and we've worked hard to bring the shipping costs, especially overseas, down to something manageable without losing our shirts.\n        Unit Scale Stuff\nIt's always important, especially these days, to know how your miniatures measure up. When designing my ToD line, I knew that they would be going up against many of my human troops and mixing in with undead from other manufacturers, so we've made them to a scale that would fit in well with most companies. Here's a series of scale shots.\n        One of my favorites. The only old school Minifig mini I have.\n Gallery of Death and Resource Inspiration.\nHere are some more pictures of painted and unpainted minis to whet your imagination and help answer questions you might have. As to questions and comments, I look forward with talking with you!\nThank you!\nThomas Foss\nSkull and Crown Stratagems, Inc.\nThis Hans Holbein piece was the inspiration for the commander with armor\n  A shot of the skeleton marching, unassembled and unpainted with accessories\n  Albrecht Durer's sketch of Death was all the concept needed for our mounted commander\n  More Holbein from his Totentanz series. You'll recognize some \"faces\" from this woodblock.\n  And this is what a proper horde looks like!\nNEW\nI've painted up some master castings! Here's mounted death and the musician horn player\n      For more gallery pictures, concept drawings and shots of greens, shamble on over to the Skull and Crown Blog!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the models of the range including initial stretch goals have already been sculpted, with master mold castings vetted and approved. My caster makes master molds from RTV instead of vulcanized rubber which greatly mitigates any chances of the master models getting wrecked in the process. I have my own laser cutter (thanks to my last KS backers- thank you!) and will be cutting all the bases. \n Other than things outside of my control (like a postal strike) we should be good to go! Remember that Kickstarter does not unlock funds until 3 weeks after the Kickstarter succeeds, so that adds to the time I can get models out to you. That is why shipping is projected at 8 weeks after the KS ends.

When a crew of indentured miners contracted to an interplanetary mega corporation get pushed to the edge, they decide to lash out against the hired security forces that stand between them and freedom.\nBroken Contract is designed for 2 or more players and the average game takes 60-90 minutes. Our goal for this Kickstarter is to raise the funds to release the 32 page softcover Broken Contract Rule Book, along with a bunch of new play aids like the Broken Contract Character Dashboard Set (6 dashboards), the Chit Set (of 30 counters), Critical Successes and Failures Dice Set (4 dice), a 32 card Ability Deck (with 26 new Abilities), a 32 card Equipment Deck (with several cards for new equipment) and a new deck of Blank Character Cards (16 blank Character Cards and 16 blank Character Stat Cards). \nThe Broken Contract Rule Book comes with the complete rules to the game, quick and easy character and crew creation rules, and three fun introductory scenarios. It comes with all the rules you need to start gaming in the Broken Contract universe.\nBroken Contract, as a game, is not just about fighting one another. Achieving your objectives includes classic adventure elements like searching for items, carrying fallen comrades, dive rolling under closing doors, or throwing your enemies down open shafts!\nTo that end, game play in Broken Contract mixes elements from a variety of board games, RPGs, and miniature wargames to give the players a wide breadth of options within the game. Your chosen character doesn't just have the options to Strike, Shoot, and Walk you will also have reason to Crawl or Dive Roll. In cinematic glory you will Jump over carts and Prone Characters, and even beg for Mercy! to potentially halt an attack. And in most cases a simple roll of the dice will determine your dramatic successes and failures.\nBroken Contract is designed to be a scenario driven game with a progressing narrative, where the Breakers try to overtake the Black Squadron Security officers, increase their numbers, acquire weapons and helpful items, and find their way closer to the surface and eventual escape. The Black Squadron officers will endeavor to suppress work stoppage and insurrection before it spreads, often by apprehending the Breakers, sounding alarms, sealing exits, and beating them into submission. You can craft this evolving narrative on your own, with your own scenarios and customized characters, or sit back and rest assured that we will be expanding the Broken Contract universe with a series of supplements based around numerous story arcs, including Loyalist miners, the criminal underbelly within the mines, and, of course, life outside the mines after a successful break attempt.

Now, after over three years of development and playtesting, we want to bring out the rules to the game! \nBroken Contract is a miniature adventure game of dramatic action in a dystopian future. When a crew of indentured miners contracted to an interplanetary mega corporation get pushed to the edge, they decide to lash out against the hired security forces that stand between them and freedom. \n$60 Pledge Level\nBroken Contract is designed for 2 or more players and the average game takes 60-90 minutes. Our goal for this Kickstarter is to raise the funds to release the 32 page softcover Broken Contract Rule Book, along with a bunch of new play aids like the Broken Contract Character Dashboard Set (6 dashboards), the Chit Box (containing 30 counters), Critical Successes and Failures Dice Set (8 dice), a 32 card Ability Deck (with 26 new Abilities), a 32 card Equipment Deck (with several cards for new equipment) and a new deck of Blank Character Cards (16 blank Character Cards and 16 blank Character Stat Cards). \n$120 Pledge Level includes two Faction Sets. Each Faction Set contains 5-6 models and 32 cards.\n The Broken Contract Rule Book comes with the complete rules to the game, quick and easy character and crew creation rules, and three fun introductory scenarios. It comes with all the rules you need to start gaming in the Broken Contract universe.\nThis is a set of six 8\"x8\" double sided tiles.\n The Broken Contract Game Tile Set is an optional Add On that provides you with six double sided 8\"x8\" map sections depicting a room and pillar mine. It includes 6 four-way intersections, 2 \"T\" intersections, 2 straight tunnels, and 2 \"L\" turns. This map set is ideal for getting you up and running playing the introductory scenarios, as well as creating your own! These premium board game tiles are printed on 60pt chip board and have a UV coating for durability. They make a beautiful presentation.\nBroken Contract is a game of action and adventure.\nBroken Contract, as a game, is not just about fighting one another. Achieving your objectives include classic adventure elements like searching for items, carrying fallen comrades, dive rolling under closing doors, or throwing your enemies down open shafts!\nTo that end, game play in Broken Contract mixes elements from a variety of board games, RPGs, and miniature wargames to give the players a wide breadth of options within the game. Your chosen character doesn't just have the options to Strike, Shoot, and Walk you will also have reason to Crawl or Dive Roll. In cinematic glory you will Jump over carts and Prone Characters, and even beg for Mercy! to potentially halt an attack. And in most cases a simple roll of the dice will determine your dramatic successes and failures.\nBroken Contract comes with introductory scenarios that can be played again and again. During most games the players are grouped into two teams, with one team acting as Black Squadron Security officers and the other as the revolting miners called, Breakers. The introductory scenarios detail an initial \"Break attempt\" by the rebellious miners and the security officers attempting to suppress it. It makes for a great evening of entertainment, but the adventure doesn't have to stop there. \nBroken Contract is designed to be a scenario driven game with a progressing narrative, where the Breakers try to overtake the Black Squadron Security officers, increase their numbers, acquire weapons and helpful items, and find their way closer to the surface and eventual escape. The Black Squadron officers will endeavor to suppress work stoppage and insurrection before it spreads, often by apprehending the Breakers, sounding alarms, sealing exits, and beating them into submission. You can craft this evolving narrative on your own, with your own scenarios and customized characters, or sit back and rest assured that we will be expanding the Broken Contract universe with a series of supplements based around numerous story arcs, including Loyalist miners, the criminal underbelly within the mines, and, of course, life outside the mines after a successful break attempt. But for now we are focusing on the core rules and getting people playing the game.\nBreaker Faction Set - $30 Add On\n  Black Squadron Faction Set - $30 Add On\n  Each Faction Set comes with the models pictured above, as well as a deck of 32 cards covering the contained Character Stats, Equipment, and Abilities.\n  Black Squadron Drone Set\n A number of Add Ons will be added during the campaign, as well as hopefully some Stretch Goals. Each of the Miniature Sets come complete with all of the Character Cards, Ability Cards, and Equipment Cards needed to use them in the game. Additionally, most of the Characters have Ability Cards that are unique to themselves. The two Faction Sets each come with 32 cards, and the Drones come with 16 cards.\nThe passionate group of writers, artists, and play testers who have made this project possible have completed the initial development. The rules are written and most of the graphic design for all of the components has been done for a while now, completed bit by bit since the last Kickstarter. The Broken Contract Rule Book just needs a bit more graphic design work and copy editing. \nAll of the initial Add Ons are either ready to go straight to production or have already been produced.  The initial funding goal is to cover the manufacturing of 100 copies of the Broken Contract Rule Book  here in Milwaukee and 100 copies of the Broken Contract Game Tile Set at TheGameCrafter in Madison, WI. All of the miniatures were manufactured by Valiant Enterprises in Madison, WI. This means no long waits for printing or models coming over from China! I can even show up on the doorstep of any of my manufacturers to save on shipping.\nPress\n'Let's Play Broken Contract' from Guerrilla Miniature Games:\nThe Breaker range on Guerrilla Miniature Games:\nThe Black Squadron Security range on Guerrilla Miniature Games:\n A chat about Broken Contract and this Kickstarter with Skirmish Supremacy Podcast.\nTutorials on how to build your own Broken Contract scenery:\nLink to the Broken Contract Design Blog.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe last Broken Contract Kickstarter was a huge learning experience from which to build from.

Professional results, absolutely. \nThese backdrops are made from a non-reflective cloth surface, neoprene-backed material that mutes shadows and won't reflect light (glare). They are durable and will last. We have been making gaming mats (the F.A.T. Mats) with this material for several years and our customers have regularly commented on how well miniatures (collectible and hobby miniatures) photograph on our mats. With that in mind, we believe we can create a set of photography backdrops perfectly suited for photographing collectibles, hobby miniatures, & small works of art.\n[this project ships worldwide and is EU friendly, see below for details and any additional shipping charges for your country]\n[if you are a retailer wanting to carry this product after the launch, you may order cases for shipment after the  first wave or you may contact us at sales@tablewardesigns.com]\n The Mat Material\nThe mat itself will have a thin neoprene rubber, textured back... This means it is non-slip and durable while being thin enough to roll easily and not be heavy.\nThe front of the mat is a non-reflective, cloth surface that we use a heat manufacturing process to adhere a traditionally themed photo backdrop image. Additionally, this material won't crease or fold so you will always have a smooth, clean backdrop.\n15x30\" sized MacroMat: We are starting with a focus on a smaller scale yet big enough to ensure you have plenty of backdrop area; in other words, enough space so that you don't show the mats edge in your picture. This size also fit well in many existing \"Light Cubes/Boxes\".\nBecause the mats are non-reflective while also muting shadows, pictures without professional lighting still look incredibly good. Take a look at these sample shots with just normal in-door lighting taken with a smartphone.\nThe material is durable; it Won't scratch or scuff and is water/liquid resistant.\nHave professional lighting or a small Light Cube/Box? You will see amazing results with little hassle.\nBy using a MacroMat backdrop, you eliminate other items that may expand your depth of field or reduce the quality of focus on your subject\n The Designs\nScale! All of our designs are scaled for small subjects. This means that your miniature will benefit from the intention of the backdrop design. Using a standard sized backdrop designed for taking pictures of large subjects (e.g. photographing people) will lose the backdrop's design when photographing something the size of a collectible or hobby miniature. The MacroMats are meant for small subjects so you will get the intended professional effect from our backdrop design.\nWe are starting out with three designs that will give your a professional look: 'Soft', 'Cool', & 'Blue Gradient'\nThe 'Warm' Backdrop\n   The 'Cool' Backdrop\n  The 'Blue Gradient' Backdrop\n    $20 - Single MacroMat backdrop - Great with an existing mini Light Cube or just up against a wall. Get started with any one design of your choice\n    $60 - Full Set of three MacroMat backdrops with a backdrop stand plus storage/carry bag - Get it all... The stand and MacroMats work perfectly together and you get a great canvas zipper bag with carry straps... Store it all away or carry it to wherever you plan to take pictures of your miniatures.\n  To keep this project simple and realistic to deliver on-time, we are keeping the add-on's limited\n $25 - Custom MacroMat Backdrop Stand (the same stand that comes with the Full MacroMat Set) - This stand was custom designed just for the MacroMats. It is 15\" wide with an innovative mechanism to provide double that width to 30\" (this allows you to turn the MacroMat 90 degrees to Landscape should you have a need). It is has an adjustable height of 12-21\" allowing you to position the MacroMat to exactly the height desired to best highlight your subject. It comes with four durable clamps to hold the MacroMat in place. \nUS, EU, & Australia shipping friendly - we will be shipping directly from three primary locations: our US warehouse in San Diego, CA, our UK warehouse in Rye, UK, & via our Australian base distributor.\nCustomers in the US, mainland UK, & Australia will not pay any additional shipping.\nFor other countries, we will pass along the smallest possible amount of shipping as follows: Canada (via USPS) +$10, EU member countries (excluding mainland UK) +$10, non-EU countries in Europe +$25, New Zealand +$10, & Rest of World +$25.\n  Table War Designs, Inc. is TABLEWAR(TM).

Players compete to collect as many stones as possible before the breaking of the dawn, with bloody combat an almost inevitable outcome with such a prize in sight.\nThe end result of our Pilot Kickstarter campaign which ran in June. Limited Edition Baron Von Fancyhat painted by Ben McIntyre of Brush Demon\nFollowing on from the tremendous success of our Firespitter Pilot Kickstarter, this campaign now sets out to launch the full game, but that can only be made possible with your help and pledges.\nThe game uses beautifully sculpted 32mm scale miniatures. With games only needing 3-6 models per player, you can be up and running with minimal expense and time spent at the painting desk. Turns are played out with alternating model activations between you and the other players, so it is never a long wait before you are back in the action making tactical, insightful, and often hilarious decisions.\nMoonstone makes use of a number of shared custom card decks which uses a combination of bluffing and zero-sum techniques like you would usually find in games of poker and rock-paper-scissors, where usually it is your ability to read the opponent rather than luck of the draw which will win you the game.\nBoth the miniatures and rules have been designed by us at Goblin King Games. We are a small team of tabletop gaming enthusiasts with a combined experience of over forty years in the genre where we have been  creating new games for our own enjoyment for at least 15 years. Moonstone is the first game we have felt is truly deserving of a big investment to push it out of our small circle and into the wider world.\n Update: Sculpt complete!\n**Limited Edition** Open Visor Head.Sculpted by Tom Lishman\n  Here are some examples of the sculpts created for us so far by Tom Lishman and Raul Tavares.

Well don't worry \u2013 we have a plan! We will be running two postage waves. Wave 1 will be the essential items you need to get playing and will ship in the Summer of 2017 while Wave 2 will be any and all of the lovely things we unlock through stretch goals, which we aim to ship in time for Christmas.\nImportant: If your order contains items from both Wave 1 and 2 then we recommend adding the 'Split Postage' Add-on to your order to cover the additional costs of making two shipments. If you don't add this option then we will post your entire order in one go during Wave 2.\nIn short: Brexit won't cause you any problems if you back this campaign.\n    Our full end-to-end production process has been thoroughly tested via the Firespitter campaign which ran, by-and-large extremely smoothly! One reason for this is that 90% of our supply chain is UK based and we are happy to pay a little more in production costs in order to be able to pick up the phone and speak directly with a supplier to resolve any issues quickly. \nAll artwork including character sketches, the Moonstone logo and 3D renders as well as the game rules and materials offered for download at https://moonstonethegame.com/downloads/ are copyright of Goblin King Games and provided for personal use only.

Face new horrors with sword and shild or embrace a dark alliance as they delve into the unknown depths of Relicblade.\nThe Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add rad new characters to Relicblade. These expansions not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and dark new powers that add wonderfully to an already delightful fantasy-battle experience.\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nBone and Darkness\nMysterious skull faced villains stalk the wild-lands. Early reports indicated these sinister watchers had something to do with the Pig-Men. Now we find that these dark wanderers are an evil threat unlike anything we've seen before. \nThe Dark Wanderer model kit includes the option to assemble the character with a Longbow or a Maul. Choose your favorite or buy an extra kit in the add-ons so you can have both builds.\nThe Dark Wanderers are unyielding warriors whose martial prowess is undeniable. They often carry powerful mauls or strange bone-bows. One must never underestimate these foes. Some have slaughtered legendary knights in single combat. Others expertly kill from a distance with jagged bone arrows then silently disappear into unnatural darkness.\nThese wanderers wield dark bone-magic, a new form of necromancy that spurs unnatural growth and creates mutated skeletal monstrosities. Unlike the dead who haunt the ruins, bound to this world by ancient magic, these creatures behave as beasts. They are furious, manic, beings who attack without provocation and with unnatural savagery.\nthe arms swap on these guys.\nThe bone construct is the most disturbing of all. It is a towering creature assembled from the magic-warped bones of multiple bodies. Without any life of it's own, these infernal engines of destruction are powered by life-force torn from its allies. These unstoppable monsters are immensely strong, and are able to unleash a fearsome howl that can shatter the will of the most stalwart hero.\n3D renders of the Bone and Darkness Faction Pack\nThe Lone Guard\nMuch of what we know about the horror of the coming Darkness is through the valiant efforts of the Lone Guard. The Lone Guard is an ancient order of warriors and rangers who patrol the wilderness. They are an ever vigilant force against every kind of impending threat.\nThe Lone Guard Rangers are hardy frontiersmen who travel hidden paths and have an uncanny kinship with nature. Armed with a keen longbow, the rangers are deadly hunters who stalk both powerful game and fiendish enemies.\nSome rangers have forged powerful bonds with the Smilodon Fatalis. These saber-toothed cats are natural predators who take to the partnership in deadly accord. The Saber-toothed cat uses its powerful claws to wrestle its prey into position before using its dagger-like fangs. Working in tandem with a ranger the cat will hold the prey in an exposed position creating an opening for its partner to land a singularly deadly strike.\nA Saber-tooth Cat?! UGH! SO COOL!\nThe Lone Guard Warriors are lightly armored fighters who are quick to respond to any threat. These intrepid fighters dive into combat with razor sharp skill and deadly poise. Their preferred armament is the bastard sword and round shield. They use both as weapons for quick attack and defense, and are a versatile presence on the battlefield.\nOh rad.\nThe Billman brings a useful set of skills to any warband. His polearm grants a reach advantage, while the hooked end can be used to force the enemy off balance. These trained soldiers work in close partnership with whoever hires them, and are ready to hook a shield or deliver a finishing blow as needed.\nHandsome mustache included at no extra charge.\n3D renders of The Lone Guard Faction Pack.\nThe wave two expansions introduce two new character types to Relicblade. The Bone and Darkness expansion introduces the construct character type. Constructs have no life of their own and enter play inert. Through the application of specific magic, players will be able to bring these creatures to bare against their foes. Constructs are a powerful addition to your war band for relatively few points. The real cost to your war party will be what it takes to keep the terrible bone construct empowered. Constructs can only be removed from play by magical attacks while inert, and will likely remain a relevant game-changing piece through the entire battle.\nThe Lone Guard expansion brings the much anticipated companion character type to the game. Companions operate in tandem with the character that hires them. A skilled billman can be attached to your hero for a few extra points. These two characters can activate together to use their skills and abilities to achieve incredible things.\nRanger and companion Smilodon support one another in this dangerous encounter.\nEach of the new Relicblade faction packs will include a special scenario related to the faction. These thematic adventures add fun context to your battles. The scenarios will also seamlessly integrate into the forthcoming campaign rules for Relicblade! \nLearn more about Relicblade on the page for the Original Kickstarter Campaign or at www.relicblade.com\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniatures game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nYour wife won't be mad. It costs less than a (fancy) sandwich...\nTake the oath of the Lone Guard and resist the Darkness!\nNo good-guys for me, thanks. There is only darkness in this mortal shell.\n If you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Bone and Darkness\" and \"The Lone Guard\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and not to mention 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and even snacks incase your pigs get a bit hungry.\nStretch Goals are a lot of the fun of Kickstarter.  I have a few particularly awesome things that I really want to make. Without a little extra success here I won't be able to take on the projects right away. If we are able to unlock these stretch goals they'll be made available as add-ons. So here's hoping y'all love Relicblade half as much as I do, and we can get this mind blisteringly awesome stuff together!\nThe Deep: Guest Artist Series\nAs the creator of Relicblade I have enjoyed unprecedented creative freedom, and thanks to your help I've been able to get my unfiltered imagination onto tabletops the world over! It's such an incredible experience that I want to share it with artists who have styles that shouldn't be filtered before smashing up dungeons around the world. In accordance with what is right and just, I'm launching the Relicblade Guest Artist Series.\nI first saw Keegan Kaya McGee's work on ye olde world wide web. His art delights me to no end. His style is a similar mixture of badass and goofy like my own. However, his work is completely different in so many fantastic ways! This wonderful blend of similar yet completely wacky and unique made him the perfect choice for my first guest artist. Keegan did the illustrations for the cards, we collaborated on the rules, and I'll do the sculpture! It's all very exciting...\nI can't imagine not falling in love with this stuff. but that's up to you. Definitely check out keegankayamcgee.com and use your eye-balls to soak up some @KeeganKayaMcGee and the tag #thingsyoumightfindinadungeon on Instagram.\nThe multi part miniature can be assembled as the Shark Warrior or the Eel Sorcerer!!\nI want the Campaign Rules so bad I can taste it. It's a pretty big undertaking so I needed to place the goal up here at 15k. I know I'll need to take a pretty decent chunk of time out of regular work to make this happen, but I sure as heck want to. I love a good pick-up death-match style game, but especially in a fantasy setting like this I want to see my characters advance and take on dangerous new adventures. \nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Faction sets are right around 65-70 points worth of characters in-game. Since a standard game is 100 points a few Pigs, some extra Bone Stalkers, a Knight, some Thieves, or a noble Cleric of Justice, will bump your war-band to full fighting strength right off the bat.\nUsing the marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. \nShipping\nShipping will be processed through Kickstarter, the old fashioned way. When you select your pledge level you will also be asked to add USA, Canada, or \"rest of world\" shipping. I do my best to ship in the most affordable way I can manage, but it's still pretty costly to ship internationally. I'm sorry for that.\nThe note about \"add-on\" shipping only really applies if you ordered at the digital scholar, or scholar levels. Scholar level will ask for a little shipping, but if you add a box set we'll need to make sure we have enough postage.\nRelicblade miniatures are carefully crafted white-metal model kits. Each figure is supplied unassembled and unpainted. Painting miniatures is a delightful part of the hobby that can, and should, be enjoyed by people of all ages!\nI put together this little video to help shine light on how it's done. It can be hard to know where to start. Here I'll show you how easy it is to make something look decent with very little effort! The first video covers assembly while part-two goes into painting.\nI love this hobby, and It's my pleasure to help you get into it any way I can. In these videos I pretty much say everything I would say if we were hanging out. Give it a watch and play along at home if you like.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn February of this year I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to create Relicblade.

It combines a fresh, modern gaming experience alongside a range of high quality 32mm scale miniatures for you to play with, that have been created by some of the best sculptors in Europe.\nIt is the Age of Purgatory. Our planet is aflame, shattered and broken by the devastating after effects of the War for Heaven. Led by Satan, Angels that once stood guardian over our realm use our world as a battleground where titanic energies and colossal beings wield powers far beyond our comprehension, murdering and enslaving humans by the million. Mankind teeters on the edge of obliteration, but there is hope. Those still loyal to the Gods have been dispatched to right the terrible wrong of their fallen kin.  \nPurgatory has a rich background, steeped in history, alongside a storyline with sub plots that will have you hooked. It has a wealth of diverse and unique characters, each with their own identity, allowing you to connect emotionally and visually. In Purgatory you have the potential for synergy and dynamism as you are able to mix and match characters to create your own unique collection of individuals as you immerse yourself in scenarios and battles set in a colourful, expanding Ultraverse.\nAre you ready to dive into a game that will bring old friends and new together across the table top battlefield? In a world that is underpinned by honest humour and where exciting battles and closely fought encounters will create memories for years to come? If you are, then tailor your force to your unique style of play, supported by Gifts from the Gods, and prepare to face the greatest period of adversity mankind has ever encountered.\nAll that remains now is to choose a side and join the War for Heaven!\n      Above: (Left to Right) Bobby B (Event only Apostle of Soul Train), St Peter (Host of Gangbangers) and Death (Host of Equilibrium)\nAbove: (Left to Right) Siren (Host of Hjanford), Keysha (Soul Train) & Hannibal (Apostle of Murder Inc.)\n Above (Left to Right) Mike (Soul Train) & Jess (Murder Inc.)\n  Purgatory is a skirmish game that allows you to play different size games against friends using a points-based system. You are not shackled to specific races or ranges as in Purgatory you can build your faction from scratch either, for alignment with your host or as a group of mercenaries.  \nThe game works by players fielding their forces and alternating activations during a game turn to complete the scenario or mission being played out. Each activation allows players to use abilities (Melee, Ranged, Movement or other) to secure victory for their side. Each character comes with a stat card that shows the controlling player how they are used.  \nThe world of Purgatory combines old established mechanics with new and realistic takes on table-top gaming using a D6 system. However, you also have the ability to build card decks using Gift of the Gods cards which can have an effect in game, for both sides. To explain all of the rules would require us to include the rulebook on this page, which is unfortunately not something we can do. However, since releasing an initial BETA rules pack the game has developed significantly, and we have made some instructive videos that explain how some of the up-to-date core mechanics work in the game so that you can familiarise yourself with the easy, fluid mechanisms within our world.\nYou can find these in the section 'Videos and Reviews' below.\nSome of the models that feature as part of this project have already been created. (Jess, Mike, Death, Hannibal, Keysha, Erishkigal, Siren and Bobby have all been made)\nYou can also listen to interviews and watch videos to learn more about our project and us, here:\nPod cast by Werenotwizards: http://werenotwizards.podbean.com/\nPod cast by Skirmish Supremacy: http://www.podcasts.com/skirmish-supremacy-390d39dc6/episode/Skirmish-Supremacy-Episode-33-Hanging-Out-in-Purgatory-c281\nReview of Death by Musings of a Bear: https://minimusingofabear.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/death-by-purgatory-review/\nReview by & D & E Miniatures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK_dx4nkF60\nMurder Inc.

No longer is the Seventh Realm illuminated by the eyes of our creators. We have been dismissed and disregarded, never will the races of the Seventh Realm ascend to greatness, nor will any of us become the template of perfection in the quest for the ultimate creation. We are not alone in this, our guardians, the mighty Angels, chief amongst them the brilliant yet volatile War Host Satan remain also, cast aside by uncaring and cruel Gods. Their pain all the keener for they knew that they had failed in the eyes of their masters.    \nSatan took it worst, crestfallen and inconsolable, screaming at the Gods, imploring and beseeching them to reconsider, but to no avail. Initially the great work continued but it was but a thin veneer for rage, anger and frustration. As time passed, frustration and anger turned to cruelty and intemperance. The Gods were true to their word and their eyes never once even glanced at the impending degeneration of the Seventh Realm.  \nSatan laid claim to the Realm as his own, as its master, accusing the Gods of betrayal, a new God for a new age. This action brought about the great schism, where those loyal to the Gods refused Satan\u2019s rule and broke out to bring warning to the neighbouring Realms. But before they could, those in league with Satan fell upon the loyalists, ending the lives of revered Angels in unprecedented slaughter. A few broke out, but these were cornered, their days numbered. The Angel Siren, banished from the Heaven saw this from the Earth. The War in Heaven could be heard across the Realm as blade on blade and brother against brother, echoed across the vacuum of space. Weeping at this sight, she defied her masters and shimmer shifted before them, bringing word of the betrayal. Michael, greatest of their kind roused the Mightiest Choir, the Archangels and descended upon pinions of wrath and fury, cutting through the traitors with martial ease.  \nThe renegades scattered, broken against the Pillars of Heaven. Satan battled Michael on the steps of Arageth, but was beaten. Before the killing blow could land, Satan and the last of the fallen fled into the realm, seeking sanctuary within many of the worlds within it, fearful of the fury that would now forever be their shadow.  \nSome fell to Earth during the period of the Great Pharaohs and Chinese Dynasties. These few went into hiding, cutting off ties and communications with others to ensure their survival. As time passed and retribution failed to materialise, these fallen Angels grew bolder, directly influencing the destiny of mankind until eventually they revealed themselves, slaughtering and enslaving their puppets by the millions. The Age of Purgatory had begun.  \nThe Heavens had stood sentinel, watching for any sign of Satan and his brood and when it was found, those remaining few Angels loyal to their oaths were dispatched to bring judgement upon their fallen kin.  \nThe Earth was not designed to withstand energies, powers and beings such as they and their combined presence fractured and cracked the Earth to its very core. The world stopped spinning and time stood still as Angels fought across cities and lands in a war of attrition where no one side truly held an advantage. So they turned to man. Aware of the wickedness that lurked within his heart they used mankind as a weapon, a never ending conveyor belt of disposable soldiers to fight the never ending war.  \nNow Angels and humans are aligned, scheming and skirmishing over the ruins of this once civilised world. You have the chance to tip the balance, will you restore Earth or will you bring it tumbling to its knees?\n  Below is an example of the initial sketch being converted to colour and then realised as a model, demonstrating our ability to keep true to the concept. \nWe have created other models already that feature as part of the pledge levels and you can see these in the 'Existing Models' section.\n         Miniature games, typically table-top ones, can vary in the products or materials that they use to create their models. This was a conversation that we had very early in the process. Typically, companies will use one of a range of materials; resin, metal (tin), plastic or a hybrid of resin/plastic.   \nWhen deciding on resin as our model the thought process considered a number of factors:   \nIncreased postage costs for manufacture of metal items. Something we did not want our customers to experience.  \nCost of plastic mould is considerably greater, therefore driving the price upwards in the initial stages.  \nResin models capture high levels of detail, are good to work with and is a lightweight substance for postal consideration.  \nHybrid materials are typically flexible and are harder to sand and work with making assembly more arduous.  \nThere is every possibility that should Purgatory grow into something much more substantial that we may explore the possibility of plastic products in the future. It is certainly an aspiration, however we have an excellent team of casters who produce high quality detailed resin models so there is no need to change at this time. Underestimated Games Limited current does and will continue using GRX Creations to produce our models. \n  By the time that Purgatory hits Kickstarter and you are reading this page, 18 months of hard work and commitment has gone into developing a rich background and environment alongside some truly unique characters and miniatures. By pledging for this project you will be supporting us to continue to progress that has been made in the creation of this world. Your pledge will specifically go towards helping us produce the following items:  \nSculpting of the remaining miniatures from the Soul Train and Murder Inc.  \nProduction of the Rule Book, with accompanying background  \nComplete the 60 strong Gift of the Gods card set  \nBring the remaining elements together to complete the Game Box\nSomething we are immensely proud of is the depth of content we have created already with the world of Purgatory. So much so, that it was difficult to choose from the characters we have already created. However, if we are successful and achieve over our pledge target we promise to deliver even more with your support, including (but not limited):  \nMore Gift of the Gods cards to interchange with the game deck as well as pre-made decks  \nPurgatory \u201cAre you Worthy?\u201d UK game tournament\nSculpt more characters and factions from previously released artwork, as well as new characters such as the Apocalypse and Halloween specific miniatures  \nEnhance the game experience further with tokens, objective markers and templates  \nReveal phase two! (yes we have gone that far) Yes, you can get your hands on a Devil!\n  Purgatory is brought to you by Underestimated Games Limited, a new company but with a lot of experience, not only in table top gaming but also in computer gaming, specifically online RPG\u2019s. As a team we have used our combined knowledge and imagination to bring a unique and fresh take on skirmish gaming, with light-hearted fun in mind.  \nOf equal importance or relevance is that the team comprises of professional people of high level management skill, with commercial and financial acumen alongside management and leadership qualities that oversee and deliver multi-million pound projects every single day. Because of this competence, Underestimated Games Limited has already made significant progress behind the scenes. The rules have been tested and re-tested and are complete, models have been produced, sold and distributed without exception all over the world, and where items have \u2018sold out\u2019, they have been replenished, customers notified and fulfilled within acceptable time frames.  \nAll of this gives us credibility and demonstrates to you that we have the capability to make this project happen but for further reassurance, Underestimated Games Limited has already got established links with a range of collaborators:  \nFour sculptors, each model scheduled as part of this project has been assigned in advance  \nSix artists, all of which stand ready to deliver this project\nA proven manufacturer, recognised within the gaming industry  \nA publisher with a proven ability to transform our artwork into high quality printed materials  \nWe can demonstrate our quality and ability not only in the models, art, game and world that already exists, but also in the preparation we have made to showcase the box and game itself that you will receive.  \nAll that remains is your support. With this, we guarantee that our experience and commitment will see Purgatory brought to life!\n  Our backers and supporters getting value for money is very important to us. The Brexit occurring in the middle of our plans was something that could not be avoided. We therefore felt it necessary to be open with our supporters regarding the exchange rate.  \nTypically, an exchange rate will adjust slightly during any given period but the realisation of this, in terms of loss or gain is typically negligible. However, the GBP has fluctuated wildly in the last few months and it does not appear that it will settle during the time in which this project is live.  \nWith that in mind, the calculations for USD and EUR have been made at the closest possible time to the project being submitted for review. This has been done to give you the best estimation of the likely cost at the time the project goes live. However, because of the unsettled rates of exchange, the amounts shown are indicative and have the potential to change. Please consider this when pledging your support. It is our intention to get the pledge manager up at the earliest possible time should we receive enough support so that this uncertainty can be minimalised.\n  If retailers are interested in supporting this project and stocking the game and or the models, we kindly ask that you get in contact with us at purgatoryenquiries@gmail.com\nThank you.\nWhen designing the game box, we decided to go for something bigger than initially required. This purposeful approach would do two things. By choosing a box, that is 24cm x 24cm x 10cm we could neatly fit any basic pledges and any add on items into one box. This also means that anybody selecting a pledge level that includes a game box, can easily work out what their postage might be. It saves us making workarounds that would inevitably see items damaged in transit. We don\u2019t want that. It also means that by having a sturdy solid box, gamers can pick the box up and carry it with them with everything they need in one place.  \nThe box with 2 factions (14 models) weighs approximately 1.7kgs. Therefore, with the threshold for UK postage being 2kg or lower, there is room for you add to your pledge without incurring more shipping fees. Before we list the fees, it is important to communicate that we are a start-up company, which means that we do not have established hubs in strategic places to reduce the shipping costs. However analysis has been done of the options available to give you the best value for money. Fulfilment will be distributed from the UK.  \nBelow are estimations on what packaging and shipping costs will be for pledges including a game box. However once the level of funding is clear, we will endeavour to source the most cost effective means before confirming actual values in the pledge manager.     \nUK \u00a37 \nFrance/Germany/Italy/Holland \u00a315\nRest of Europe \u00a318\nWorld Zone 1 (US, Canada, Asia, Far East) \u00a320 \nWorld Zone 2 (Australia, NZ, Singapore) \u00a326\n As you may know at Purgatory we have tried to keep international shipping low. The rates below are to give an indication of prices for small parcels inclusive of up to 4 models/or rulebook (but not a game box): \nUK \u00a33 \nFrance/Germany/Italy/Holland \u00a34 \nRest of Europe \u00a36\nWorld Zone 1 (US, Canada, Asia, Far East) \u00a37 \nWorld Zone 2 (Australia, NZ, Singapore) \u00a37 \nOur pledge manager will indicate the likely cost of shipping and this will be added to your pledge and will take into consideration your pledge and the calculated weight.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first project from Underestimated Games Limited, though the Purgatory brand has been in existence now for over twelve months. During this time the company has commissioned and released successfully. These models have grown in popularity with each new release. \n\nDuring this time, we have shown that we have infrastructure in place with reputable sculptors, producers, artists and printers. The core of the organisation already exists and we have communicated our intent to Kickstart this project all along, this produces fewer unpleasant surprises. \n\nDespite being a new organisation, the company is made up of individuals that have a wealth of experience in delivering high level projects on time and in full. (One of the team delivers multi million pound projects every single day) \n\nThere is always a risk that the cost model isn\u2019t calculated properly, which can lead to a lack of funds later on and perhaps delays in delivery. We have the benefit of understanding costs and logistics first hand so we have experience with the products we are going to deliver. However more importantly, our team consists of individuals that compose multi million pound budgets as part of their day job. But just to be even more certain, the financial mechanism has been checked thoroughly by an external expert.\n\nLogistics can be a strain, so we have chosen reputable partners who have pedigree in delivery, having changed partners very early on. We have deliberately chosen UK partners for a number of mission critical items so that local control of key items can be managed with tighter focus. \n\nThe project is designed to give us a platform into market and the stretch goals have been created to be sustainable and to give people a chance for extra benefits. However we will not be extending past \u00a350k amid a rush of popularity. The business model has been created taking into consideration the capability and capacity of those that we work with. So, if our project does exceptionally well, it will be a case of producing a higher quantity of our project, not an even larger project with even higher quantities. \n\nGetting the product is very important to you, the people investing in our project and you are at the forefront of our thinking. This is why we have chosen to operate the way we are. \n\nThere is always the risk of delay. Even the simplest service or function can change due to unforeseen parameters. However we know that reputation lives and dies by proactive and positive communication and in the event of any delay we will \u2018own it\u2019 and be open and honest with our backers, because service is everything.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Serial Toe Dipper", "descp": "Pledge a small amount to support the cause and gain access to those all important add-ons later as a backer of this project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Welcome to the War for Heaven!", "descp": "Pledge a small amount to support the cause.

We've got a ton of improvements in mind for our Kickstarter, but some of those changes are too big to implement during an active campaign. We're excited to bring you the best possible version of The Warriors: Turf War, so we're gonna step out briefly to give this baby a tuneup. We'll be back later this month with some surprises we know you'll love. For more details, check out the update here.\n________________________________________________________________________\nIt\u2019s mayhem on the streets of New York City. Police are outnumbered. Rival gangs explode into battle at the drop of a hat. Tensions are at an all-time high and there's nowhere to hide. Do you have what it takes to lead your gang to victory? \nThe Warriors: Turf War is an aggressive strategy board game licensed by Paramount and based on the cult classic film The Warriors. Assume control of one of the film\u2019s iconic gangs and immerse yourself in the action as you fight to take control of the city\u2019s boroughs and add them to your growing turf. Unpredictable events and a growing police presence complicate even the best-laid plans, compelling truces between bitter rivals or forcing gangs to flee in the face of insurmountable odds. Watch out\u2014each choice you make will either reinforce your dominance \u2026 or bring you closer to defeat. Warriors, come out to play-i-yay!\nGame supports 2-5 players. Average game time: 1 hour.\n      Painted or paintable depending on tier\n All Come Out to Play and Warlord tiers (Including Early Birds) now include the Kickstarter Exclusive Mercy Set and Premium Rule Book! Check out the update here!\n             **Come Out to Play and Warlord tiers now have paintable miniatures versions available!**\n    For a complete, detailed rundown of the rules, check out the PDF of our official rule book: Download Here!\nEach game of The Warriors: Turf War consists of three rounds of skirmishes, with each skirmish taking place on a different Turf. When fighting for a Turf, each gang\u2019s goal is simple: annihilate the other gangs\u2019 units. If there is a police presence, all police units must also be dealt with before the Turf can be won. The gang that has won the most Turfs at the end of the third round wins the game.\nGang Units\nWarlord - The leader of the gang, each Warlord grants a gang-specific ability when they show up for a fight. Gang members also receive a morale boost when near their Warlord, gaining attack and defense bonuses. Strong and sturdy, the Warlord is always a threat in a skirmish, but don\u2019t let them fall in battle, or the rest of your gang will have no choice but to flee from that skirmish.\nMuscle - Slow but powerful, the Muscle goes last in a turn but hits harder than any other unit. One hit from a Muscle could be enough to end even the toughest enemy. Muscles inspire their fellow gang members with their brawn, granting them an attack bonus when nearby.\nScout - A keen eye for defense, Scouts offer other friendly gang members sharing their square an additional chance to block. They're decent fighters and aren\u2019t easy to defeat thanks to their slight health advantage.\nArtist - Fast but weak, Artists go first in a turn and start each skirmish with a spray paint can they can use to either tag a landmark, upping speed gang-wide, or stun an enemy gang member. Artists don\u2019t strike hard, but their speed allows them to quickly get in and out of fights.\nSoldier - Soldiers are your base units. They can move a decent distance and attack with a decent amount of force, but they\u2019ve still got plenty to learn. A Soldier can be promoted in between rounds to a Muscle, Scout, or Artist.\nCombat\nTo attack, a player moves one of their gang members into a square with an enemy unit and rolls a number of attack dice equal to their gang member\u2019s attack stat. The defender rolls a number of defense dice equal to the defending unit\u2019s defense value, then reduces the defending unit\u2019s health total by an amount equal to the value of the attack roll minus the value of the defense roll.\nIf the defender completely fails to block an attack of at least one hit and the defending unit survives, the attacker can shove or steal a weapon from the defending unit. To shove a unit, the attacker moves the defending unit from its current square into an adjacent square.\nIf the defending unit\u2019s life total is reduced to 0, that unit is incapacitated and immediately removed from the Turf Board. The incapacitated gang member's character card goes to the player who dealt the ending blow. These defeated enemy character cards can be cashed in between rounds to buy Special Weapons or promote Soldiers to Artists, Scouts, and Muscles.\nEvents\nThe top card of the Tune In Deck is revealed at the beginning of each Skirmish. The Tune In event may bring Police to the skirmish, place Special Weapons on the Turf Board, set up a fight to the death with no fleeing, or any number of other game-changing conditions.\nPolice\nSome Tune In events cause Police to be present for skirmishes. The number and strength of the police units that arrive increase each time the Police make an appearance. If the skirmish's Tune In event doesn't immediately place police units on the Turf, rest assured that they're on their way. A Police Timer tracks the number of turns before police units arrive.\nOfficer - 1 Range. Detain: If this unit rolls at least one hit when attacking and the defender completely fails to block, the defending unit becomes detained.

Worse, BlackRain is showing signs of intelligence. It is a new form of life, hungry and growing on all it consumes.\nThe Lore of BlackRain is the story of this new world and its problems. This story is shown through the eyes of the BlackRain characters, who are not portrayed as god like heroes, but real people with their own past and issues. It is a mature, grim tale of a dying world and its last chance at redemption.\nThe North American Union is embroiled in a constant fight for survival. Where once time and distance kept the N.A.U.\u2019s homeland safe it now fights against multiple foreign powers on its own soil. A UNAS blitzkrieg has seized parts of the west coast, Alaska has fallen to a Russian invasion and EuroLance has established its own beachhead in eastern canada. Yet the N.A.U. fights on, pulling miracle victories out what should be certain annihilation. Whether it is the home field advantage or sheer tenacity, the N.A.U. has ground the hostile advance to a stalemate. \nN.A.U. fights with tried and true tactics. It places its faith in proven technology, solid armor and firepower. This faith is grounded in the fact that each and every member of the N.A.U. war machine is trained and enhanced to be deadly threat to any and all foes. Resulting in a rugged and punishing force that can take and give a beating in equal measure. Every N.A.U. soldier must be a force to be reckoned with, for in this new world the N.A.U. has learned a harsh lesson beset by new enemies and betrayed by old allies: \"Don't trust anyone\"\nA newly founded corpocracy, The United Asia Alliance is a land of explosive technological advancement and totalitarian rule. It is arguably the world\u2019s current number one military power, formed from the merger of asian nations and ruled by the few mega-corporations whose influence is felt in nearly every aspect of life. \nUNAS augments its civilian population and its standing military with cybernetic implants and limbs, giving every member of its society a strong familiarity with augmetics. As a result, its workers can toil industriously to meet corporate quotas and its soldiers enjoy phenomenal performance in combat. The UNAS military can be found on every continent in the world in varying degrees of strength. Outwardly a monolithic entity, in reality the UNAS military is split along corporate lines. Soldiers are largely obedient to the whims of the corporation equipping them and execute aggressive, devastating raids for reasons as varied as the powers they serve. Gifted with superhuman strength and speed through cybernetic technology, shock and awe is their primary military doctrine. They crush the enemy\u2019s morale with overwhelming speed and force, engaging in close-quarters battle where few can match them . They seek to engage on their own terms, and to always have the first and last strike. Mobility is their greatest asset, and they will use it to strike from the best position whenever possible, as fast as superhumanly possible. Velocity kills and in the United Asia Alliance: \"To move is to live\"\nLittle is known about the group calling itself Zadruga. Their first sightings are connected with what is referred to as the \u201cForest Nuke\u201d incident. In this incident whole countries were lost in an sudden and explosive growth of a primeval forest that soon covered much of Europe. The Zadruga were tied to this incident and as a result were given the dubious title of being the most dangerous Eco-terrorists in history. Their reputation began to grow darker when the first reconnaissance and investigation teams sent inside the Forest vanished. The first lone survivors of Zadruga encounters who were found were of little help. All had been driven mad with fear. No mean feat given that mankind had just gone through another world war. As reports of forest ghosts and strange beasts became more and more common the EuroLance forces lost their patience. What was supposed to be a grand operation spearheaded by the newly formed EuroLance 2nd Battalion \u201cThe Iron Sons\u201d, to crush mere eco-terrorists instead became an unmitigated disaster. This was the \u201cLost Sons\u201d incident, an entire EuroLance battalion vanishing into the Forest, only ten minutes after entering it. Soon after that incident a simple message, addressed to the world appeared on every digital device in the world: \u201cThe Forest is our domain and our hunting ground\u201d. Since then the Zadruga are no longer referred to as eco-terrorists but across the old world and beyond are spoken of in whispers and as the \u201cHunters of Men.\u201d\nZadruga forces rely on guerilla warfare, traps and fear tactics. Their highly mobile hunters are equipped with archaic weaponry dating back to the third world war. These weapons are antiques in comparison to contemporary weaponry but with expert modification and in the hands of the Zadruga they become just as devastating as any modern firearm. Gun smithery is not the only unique virtue of the hunters. Either because of their own genetic research or technological theft they have acquired creatures called Bukavacs. These products of genetic engineering are used as hound in the ranks of Zadruga. Always loyal to their master, always merciless to their prey. These creatures reflect the true nature of the Zadruga. They are not engaging in warfare or terrorism, they are simply: \u201cThose who Hunt\u201d.\nContinue to support us and we'll bring more miniatures to the BlackRain range!\nAmerican rewards will be shipped using US Post, while European rewards will be send from Poland using Polish Post Office, both with a fixed cost of 25$.

Using these rules players choose a faction, such as tribals, raiders, mutants, etc., and fight other warbands, gaining power, equipment, and prestige through each victory and defeat. Each battle is hard won though as players not only have to deal with their opponents, but also the challenges of the wasteland, through hazards and radioactive monstrosities.\nThis Is Not a Test was first published by World\u2019s End Publishing in May 2015 and has sold hundreds of electronic copies the world over. The brain child of indie author Joseph McGuire, the rules were written and play-tested over a three year period. Along the way, some of the best industry talent was sought out to the make the rules as beautiful as possible. Hobby luminary Dave Taylor provided graphic design and principal photography and several talented artists, including Spanish artist David Arenas and New York-based artist Matthew Roberts, provided illustrations. As a result of this collaborative effort, This Is Not a Test is not only graphically gorgeous, but we think the book rivals any miniatures ruleset published by the larger hobby companies.\nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nSince first released fans have requested a physical copy of the book. While This Is Not a Test is beautiful on the glowing screen, its excellence demands a lavish physical release. After months of behind the scenes hard work, we are finally ready to offer the print edition. As a small indie company, that is really just one passionate author, World\u2019s End Publishing simply cannot afford the initial financial and physical requirements to produce a 172-page book without help from crowdsourcing. So here we are. This may possibly be the only time the book is available in a physical form. If we fund this Kickstarter, we print the book. Simple as that.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?\nFirst, an awesome book. Second, we intend to keep this Kickstarter simple. No crazy giveaways, no outlandish promises. We want to produce the book, throw in some miniature add-ons, a couple of freebies and offer you a modest discount on some great gaming material.\nWhat if I bought the rules already?\nWe absolutely love our early adopters! Everyone who has bought the rules prior to the launch of this Kickstarter gets a free limited edition miniature add-on Johnny Atomic, the Voice of the Wasteland! If you previously bought the rules from either Wargames Vault or the World\u2019s End Publishing Website, we will be able to verify your purchase. Just use the email address you used to purchase the original pdf. New email address? Contact us.\nSample Pages\nBelow are some sample taken directly from the design files.  This is just  a small sampling of the drop-dead sexy graphic design by Dave Taylor.\nSample page\nSample Warband Pages\nSample Scenario Pages\nThe great armed conflict known as the End War ravaged the world for years, but came to its devastating conclusion in just seconds. In the aftermath of the nuclear attacks, remembered as the Great Fall, the United States was left a scarred wasteland. Millions died, polite society collapsed, and scientific knowledge was lost in a forest of mushroom clouds.\nBut hey, it\u2019s not all bad.\nYou and your fellow survivors live in the Tri-State Wasteland, an unforgiving land of mutants, lost technology and as much opportunity as danger. In this new world anyone can make their own destiny. But it's not easy and you better have grit, cunning, and a willingness to get a little dirty.\nThis is the world of This Is Not a Test, a 28mm skirmish warband wargame set in a post-apocalyptic United States where warbands fight for survival, power and greed in the wastes.\nTry it yourself - Download the This is Not a Test Demo Rules to try out the game with a friend. This 28-page PDF includes the basic rules, a new scenario, and even paper miniatures to get you on your way. Best of all its free to download and distribute far and wide.\nPlaytested rules. Hundreds of games hours have been spent by groups across the world to make sure that TNT has been put through its paces. The rules have been revised and refined to a metaphorical razor\u2019s edge. Be assured that TNT is not just a throw away ruleset to gather dust on your wargaming bookshelf.\nNo I go/U go. Letting one player activate his entire warband before you can go is a bit outdated. Instead TNT uses a dynamic activation system where at any time play can switch between players, allowing for a true anarchic battlefield.\nWarbands of 5-20 models max. There is no need to go out and purchase a huge assortment of models. Chances are you might even have enough models in your collection to get playing immediately.\nSix factions to choose from. Raiders, Mutants, Preservers, Peacekeepers, Tribals, and Caravanners. All have different options and play a little differently. There is a warband for every taste. Plus each faction has a sub-type with different agendas, even friends can be enemies.\nPlenty of mutations, skills, and abilities. TNT has over 60 different mutations, skills, and abilities. Different models types can choose individual skills, which encourages warband diversity. While there are a lot of skills, most models will have one or none, keeping the game relatively simple, and not bogged down in minutia.\nPlenty of weapons and equipment. With more than 60 separate weapons, armor, and equipment there are plenty of options to go around and a great chance you can use any model in your collection, no matter what they're armed with.\nHarness the power of the past. No wasteland is complete without powerful lost technologies littered about. Everything from laser carbines, plasma casters, to the ever popular power armor. There are over 25 separate relics waiting to vaporize your opponents.\nMultiple scenarios and full campaign rules. TNT has five balanced scenarios to challenge your warbands, and more will be released in the future. Further, a fully detailed campaign system is included to keep track of injuries, income, experience, new skills, and overall reputation. Watch your warband go from a bunch of softbellies to full wasteland legends.\nA truly dangerous wasteland. TNT includes full rules for wasteland hazards such as emberquakes, ripwinds and other natural occurrences that are as dangerous to your warband as your opponent. Additionally, a bestiary is included with over 30 entries for various wasteland creatures. Everything from the simple rad zombie to the terrifying landsnapper has been cataloged and presented for your hunting pleasure.\nTry it yourself - Download the This is Not a Test Demo Rules\n Pledges:\nPledge totals do not include shipping.  See further on for details.\nSpecial Edition Miniatures\nTo celebrate our first Kickstarter, we are offering special 28mm miniatures as optional add-ons. For the record, these are not limited to just this Kickstarter, but they will either not be released for some time or only available at special times. So if you want one, now is the time to buy them.\nFirst, we have Johnny Atomic, Voice of the Wasteland. With a rockabilly styling, Johnny is the DJ at Old Line Radio and provides the wasteland with news, Pre-Fall music, and radiation updates on the eights. Johnny Atomic can be yours for $6.50 and comes with a 25mm plastic base. Sculpted by Shane Hoyle and comes unpainted. Remember, if you previously purchased the PDF rules, Johnny rides with you for free.\nJohnny Atomic and Wasteland Nurse\nSecond, we have the Wasteland Nurse accompanied by a Helper Dog. Modeled on the author\u2019s own mother, this miniatures symbolizes that light can shine in the darkest times. The Wasteland Nurse and Helper Dog are available for $10.00 and comes with two 25mm plastic bases. Sculpted by Shane Hoyle and comes unpainted.\nAdd-Ons\nNot content with the pledges above and want more wasteland madness.  We  have you covered!  Add on extra items, PDF's, and miniatures to your heart's delight!  Add-ons can be \"added\" after the campaign closes and the surveys go out. \nFolks love stretch goals and so do we, but to keep things manageable, and deliverable, they will be kept simple. Starting at the first $500 we raise over our starting goal, and for every $1,000 afterwards, we will offer something we think is cool.\nHere are are unlocked so far!\nUnlocked Stretch Goals\nNew Stretch Goal!\nMedia and industry:\nThis is Not a Test is a well written and beautifully presented ruleset with solid mechanics that utilized several clever mechanisms to create a fun skirmish game. - A review from the Attention Deficit Historian.\nThe fine folks over at Guerrilla Miniatures Games have posted a great rules review/battle reports in their series of gameplay videos called Nickel City Stories.\nHarry Crossley of Clearhorizon Miniatures and friends discuss TNT in depth in their podcast In the Garage.\nAnother great vidcast is the chaps over at the Brotherhood of the Fly. Featuring a great discussion of the rules, the post-apocalypse genre, and upcoming products for TNT.\nPlayer comments:\nIt\u2019s fast and fun! I like the setting, and the included fluff. I really like the campaign\u2019s post game feature. I love getting loot and improving my warband. \u2013 Josh L.\nThe way damage stacks and then you roll for it at the very end of the activation step. That increases the tension of each turn and makes players really think about how they want to use their figures. \u2013 Patrick R.\nThe action order keeps things pretty tense and its strongly supported theme tickles my fancy. - Rob M.\nThe game was fast paced and exciting and easy enough to learn that my 10 yr old was able to pick up the mechanics in a few short turns. \u2013 John\nExcellent game that is like Necromunda and Fallout had a baby. - Harold C.\nSpectacular game so far.

Players take command of heroes and monsters as they battle to claim magical relics of the ancient world.\nWill you lead bold heroes on their righteous quest for hope? Or will you harness the unbound fury of the Pig Men; whose craven lust for destruction is only matched by their love for snacks?\nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" two player battle game includes everything you need for start playing full-size games of Relicblade out of the box.\nFully Illustrated Rulebook\nWave 1 Deck: 14 Character Cards, 32 Upgrade Cards, 2 Reference Cards, and 6 Relic Cards\nAll Wave 1 Heroes\nAll Wave 1 Pigs\n6 Dice\nKickstarter Exclusive Relic Card\nALL UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS: Relic Miniature, Thief Character, and more to come!\nThis set is the best way to start playing the game right away!\nRelicblade is quick to learn and fun to play. The characters are represented on the board by detailed 30mm miniatures while their statistics and abilities are shown on convenient character cards. The real depth comes in as players choose from 25 unique upgrades to specialize their characters to gain a tactical advantage. Will you choose to specialize your cleric as a support healer, or bestow her with powerful magic weapons to bring low the adversary?\nBefore the battle players choose characters and upgrades.\nBattles are fought over an unidentified magic item that has drawn the characters to that spot. When characters are finally able to seize the relic it is drawn randomly from the Relic Deck. Relics grant an unnatural boon and are used just like upgrades, however they far surpass any upgrade in power. But if the character wielding the relic is disabled anyone can pick it up.\nThe Knight grabs the Sword of Ruin\nStandard games of Relicblade are played on a 2'x2' area, players usually only field between three and six characters, and the games only last around 45 minutes. Games are fast paced, dynamic, and exciting. It's not unusual to play several games over the course of a couple drinks. \n The Relicblade Core Game has been FUNDED! We are now working our way through awesome new stretch goals!!\nRelicblade is super rad. I know you're going to love it. If we can get a bunch of people behind this project it's better for everybody. You want more characters... I want more characters. So let's do this!\nWhenever we unlock a new goal everyone backing at Bold Adventurer ($89 early bird, and $99) and above will get it added to their rewards for FREE. Everyone wins!\nOH SNAP! I love you guys. Free Relics for everyone!!! (almost)\nRad new hero. Free with \"Bold Adventurer\" Pledge ($89/$99) or more!\nWhat goes into making new characters?\nOh, I'm glad you asked. The Metal King Studio YouTube channel has a whole web series dedicated not only to this question, but to the production of this very character! Follow along as I draw, sculpt, and produce the thief in an aptly titled series called... Thief.\nRelicblade is a good old-fashioned miniatures game. \nPlayers dive into the miniatures hobby as they assemble, paint, and play the game. Relicblade figures are made of high quality white metal, and the miniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted. The process of customizing and painting the characters is part of the awesome collaboration between the creator and players. The ruins of Relicblade are largely unexplored, so the depths of this savage world are open for players to invent and discover.\nMiniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted.\nWhat scale are the figures?\nRelicblade miniatures are made at the 30mm scale. That means from foot to eye level a character should stand at around 30mm. It's ever so slightly larger than the well known Warhammer scale, but slightly less \"heroic\" ( giant hands and weapons). \nRelicblade figures lined up with other favorites from my collection\nHow Relicblade miniatures are made.\nRelicblade is 100% independent and creator owned. However, the process for creating these metal miniatures is extremely similar to the production process from your favorite miniatures companies. I even use the same prototyping company, mold maker, and caster as some of my most loved games.\n1. The first step is to create a character that is at least vaguely interesting. For the Questing Knight I did a bunch of research on knightly arms and armor. I especially lost myself in YouTube videos of Battle of the Nations and other HEMA groups.\n2. Using ZBrush I create a 3D model of the figure. From the very beginning I have to consider how the model will look at the tiny 30mm scale and how it will work for mold making and casting.\n3. Rapid prototypes are a quick low resolution 3D print of the model. Using the Form 1+ printer I was able to see what was working and what wasn't. It's extremely important to see how the parts fit together and make sure everything is at the appropriate scale.\n 4. Once the design is finalized and all the issues are resolved, the files are sent to VisionProto for high resolution prototypes that can withstand the mold making process. These prototypes are quite costly, but offer unmatched detail and fidelity.\n5. The high resolution prototypes are sent to a mold-maker and caster. The master and production molds were made by Fortress Figures. With the molds established the figures are cast by the hundreds in high quality white metal.\n6. The final stage is when players paint the figures and play out legendary adventures. The final product is a collaborative art piece that unites friends, gamers, and hobbyists around the world.\nGreetings friends,\nMy name is Sean Sutter. I am a professional freelance artist and illustrator, and the lead artist on the comic book series B-Squad: Soldiers of Misfortune. As a freelance artist there can be gaps between jobs or even simple hours here and there while you wait for a sketch to be approved. Relicblade was more or less born in these gaps. \nB-Squad Volume 1 Cover Art by Sean Sutter\nI've been obsessed with tabletop miniatures since I first walked into a game shop and saw that they existed. And like many of you, I harbored dreams of creating a game. 20 years later I realized that I'm still crazy about miniatures, but I am also an able illustrator and writer. So I taught myself how to sculpt miniatures in ZBrush.\nZBrush is extraordinary. I've studied drawing my entire life. I did over ten years of weekly figure drawing and have a bachelors degree of fine art. But drawing has always been a process of translation for me. While drawing I work to translate a three-dimensional idea into two-dimensions, which is always the major challenge. But once I learned the basics for ZBrush I was finally home. My thee-dimensional imagination just needs to be transcribed into ZBrush... I can't adequately describe how artistically fulfilling sculpting is.\nI sculpted that bear while I was waiting for a poster design to get approved by the Crocker Art Museum.\nGame design has been a joy, as well. I put forward core design principals and set about creating a game. As I got deeper in the game design I obsessively asked and answered questions through every step. I would toss and turn at night trying to figure out gameplay mechanics. After months of fevered game-craft Relicblade was complete. Now, each time I play it I am delighted at how well Relicblade meets its design goals.\nAsset drawings, card prototypes, and probably a pot of coffee on my desk.\nWhile learning to sculpt and filling notebooks with ideas took place in the gaps between freelance gigs, the hardcore making of the game had to be a full time endeavor. In July of 2015 I started creating Relicblade full-time. It's been a crazy adventure so far, and I really hope with this Kickstarter it is just the beginning. I have ideas coming out my ears and a really great game. \nNow that the rules, cards, and figures are in print I can take a step back and just enjoy the game instead of critiquing it. We are still finding crazy new upgrade combinations and party-builds. Just last night I had one of the most exciting games to date. \nUltra fun Relicblade demos at Great Escape Games in Sacramento. That's me with the cool orange hat!\nI hope you will step out on a limb to try this new game. There are a ton of great games out there, but I know after a few games Relicblade will be one of your favorites, too. Plus, supporting independent artists has intrinsic value. ;)\nYour Friend,\nSean Sutter\nClick photo to go to the B-Squad campaign page!\nB-Squad is a crazy action-packed comedy that follows a band of misfit mercs on dangerous and ridiculous missions. In volume one the squadies did battle with a hive-mind of wiener dogs, and a dangerous band of James Cameron cosplayers. While Eben Burgoon is writing each issue he spins a six-sided whale-bone die to determine which of the six main characters will be killed on the mission. Ridiculous. Dangerous. Expendable.\nGetting paid to draw for B-Squad empowered me to believe in myself and make Relicblade. In B-Squad Volume 2 we will be empowering a new batch of artists! When you #BackBSquad you aren't just getting a book. You're showing artists that they deserve to get paid, and encouraging them to make something awesome.\nIf you back both B-Squad and Relicblade, you'll also receive an exclusive Relic Card modeled after the very dice that slays all the B-Squad characters, The Pequod!\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nYou can tell me about a D&D character you used to play as, or any character you imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them!\nNow that barbarian you have fond memories of playing back in high-school can roam the wild lands of Relicblade!\nYou get the original illustration and a professionally printed copy of your card (Character, or monster, or relic, or whatever...)\nPorter McScotch, B-Squad writer Eben Burgoon's Dwarf Bard\n But, what if I want a miniature of my awesome character?\nIt costs money, but it's pretty amazing seeing your characters come to life this way. Also, these high pledge levels really help support the studio.\nCustom hand-made Relicblade terrain:\nYou want Relicblade? Say no more. I will personally hand craft a 2'x2' board for you in whatever setting you want. I'll do my best studio-quality work to get you a seriously awesome board. The 2'x2' panels hang on your wall while not in use and make really crazy 3D fantasy landscape paintings. It's an absurd amount of work, but you're worth it. I'll even paint up a full set of Relicblade figures to match your adventure setting. Frozen city, ancient tomb, or lava fort? Follow your heart.\n Here is a little chart that should help clarify the pledge levels.\nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Two-Player set is specially designed to give you everything you'll need to get the full Relicblade Experience. But if you want a few extra Pigs this is the way to get the promotional deal available only through the Kickstarter.\n Using the Marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you say, \"I want to make a game.\" people will ask \"have you thought about Kickstarter?\"\n\nKickstarter has become an everyday occurrence for the tabletop gaming industry. Which has, I believe, very positive implications for the future of independent games. But that also means you can get ahead of yourself and start asking for money before you really have a game. I don't want to ask you to support a project that is just an idea. Even if I think it's a pretty good one.\n\nThis risks and challenges section of the campaign is probably the part I've fought the hardest for. At the outset of a project like this you have to ask yourself a lot of questions, and you have to look at each obstacle as gatekeepers. Just past those cold hearted sentinels was the game I wanted to make. Bringing a game from drawings and notes all the way to miniatures and rulebooks was daunting, but it's done. I already went through my delays. There were countless challenges that I wasn't expecting, but I crushed them. And I worked on this game full-time for eight months before it was ready for Kickstarter.\n\nThe game is done. Relicblade is being played by gamers across the entire world, and they love it. But I was only able to make 100 copies, and the game currently exists with the minimum number of characters needed to play. If I write four emails I can have the Relicblade two-player sets ready to ship in three weeks, because everything is done. But I want to make the game bigger and better too. If we can unlock the stretch goals we can do just that.\n\nMaking new characters means new illustrations, sculpts, 3d prints, molds, rules, and cards.

Every character has an original backstory and distinctive role within the Twisted universe: guiding them through our richly-developed environments and exciting encounters will have you on the edge of your seat and wanting more!\nBut beware the power of the Engine! The ever-present influence of the mysterious steampunk Engine pervades the world of Twisted. What makes playing Twisted excitingly unique is that the Engine itself brings a new and intriguing element to every encounter: the Eye of the Engine card deck and the unique \u2018Favour of the Engine\u2019 game mechanic give the Engine an active role in the actual gameplay.\nMaintain the favour of the Engine to enjoy rich rewards, or tempt fate and risk it all!\nThe Engine is the hidden source of steampunk power permeating the world Twisted. But it is more than just a god-like machine: it has a selfish consciousness seeking to transform the world according to its own designs, and a jealous ego unwilling to share this power!\nRumours of the Engine\u2019s influence are spreading throughout the world of Twisted, and competing factions have emerged seeking to discover the secret access points to the Engine\u2019s power: the Nodes.\nThe first faction to stumble upon one of these Nodes is the Dickensians: their discovery of an Engine Node hidden deep beneath the darkest sewers of London triggers an explosion of raw steampunk power as the Engine \u2013 sensing danger \u2013 fights back by summoning the Servants of the Engine!\nTwisted's beautiful miniatures are all individual works of art, designed by us and sculpted by hand, before being reproduced for sale using the finest possible hard resin or pewter metal. Quality is of prime importance to Twisted, and our casting process captures the detail of the sculpted figures almost perfectly.

We have striven to ensure that no Character feels like a \u201cfiller\u201d and that every single model on the table is useful to you in it's own way.\nTypically Twisted plays as an objective-driven skirmish game with detailed and exciting combat and lots for you to do as a player. For casual gamers, Twisted will be playable as a stand alone sessional game where you can nominate a points value for each side, set some objectives from the rulebook, and just have fun.\nFor those interested in immersing themselves in the world of Twisted, are developing a series of story-driven missions that can be played individually or linked together to form a narrative campaign.

The game is based off of IDW's ongoing comic book universe and features missions taken straight from some of the series' biggest moments. Designed by the legendary Kevin Wilson (Descent, Arkham Horror) with input from Kevin Eastman and IDW's entire TMNT creative team, this highly thematic adventure features incredible mechanics and gameplay.

The closer to the galactic center you are, the higher standard of living you're likely to enjoy - while those on the fringe live in poverty.\n\nMany crucial industries in the Alliance, such as healthcare, transport, and energy are controlled by massive corporations, who don't operate in the poorer parts of space - where profits are lower - meaning people on the fringe are often forced to use outdated technology and substandard medicine.\nEvery copy of the Alliance starter set contains the following:\n\n1x Gunslinger\n1x Female Outrider Scout with Sniper Rifle\n1x Male Trooper with LMG\n2x Male Troopers With Assault Rifles in two unique poses\n1x Female Trooper with Assault Rifle.\n\nLets take a close look at the characters you'll be getting:\n\nYou'll get a total of 4 troopers in the starter set: 2 x Male troopers with assault rifles (2 unique poses), 1 x female trooper, and 1 x male trooper with light machine gun. The arms and heads of the male troopers will all be interchangeable, and the arms and head of the female trooper will be compatible with the Outrider:\n The Nexus have been responsible for two galactic wars in their attempts to wipe humanity from the galactic stage. The Second Nexus War saw some of the largest battles in history, and resulted in the Council of Systems breaking apart and many of its members forming their own governments and claiming their own spaces.\n\nThe Nexus are brutal, and their culture is built upon strength and war. The weak do not survive in Nexus society.\n\nMost Nexus are now members of the Nexus Separatist Movement, an independent faction led by the Butcher of Aros, General Varakos. the NSM are waging war across the galaxy, claiming new territories and raiding vessels small and large as they travel the stars.\nEvery copy of the Nexus starter set contains the following:\n1x Nexus Assassin With Sniper Rifle.\n2x Nexus Grunts with assault rifles in unique Poses.\n2x Feral Nexus with pistol and knives in Unique Poses.\n1x Nexus Brawler with axe and knives.\nLets take a close look at the characters you'll be getting:\nNexus Grunts - Showing off the different posing options\n The Nexus Grunt. You'll get two of these in the set, one body in a standing pose, one body in a running pose, and two unique sets of arms and heads. The arms and heads are interchangeable, meaning you will have plenty of posing options.\n\n The Icarus Project is a 35mm wargame. Human miniatures are on average 35mm to the eye, or 38mm to the top of the head. In actual scale terms, this makes them 1/48 scale.\n\nAs you can see in the image above, they fit nicely with a variety of other science fiction games if you want to use them as proxies.\n Our miniatures will also have real variety in sizes when it comes to the aliens. Every miniature will not be the same size!\nOnce we have fleshed out the two starting factions, that's when we can start introducing some of the other races in the Icarus Project.\n\nRaces like:\n\nThe Praesidians, the oldest race in the galaxy, founders of the Council, builders of the Light Gates, and masters of foldspace travel.\nPraesidian Warrior\nPraesidian Spirit Warrior\nThe Ji'tar; one of the richest factions in the galaxy thanks to a rare metal found only in their territory. Even the smallest amounts of it added to regular armour creates far stronger material. This makes the Ji'tar military, though small, incredibly powerful.\nJi'tar Warrior\nOr the Mercenaries; Criminals and guns for hire that can be added to any strike force.\nSpectre, a mercenary sniper.\nKara Mariasha. An ex-Alliance soldier who was abandoned and is now seeking revenge.\nShipping will be charged separately via Paypal after the Kickstarter, close to the shipping date, based on actual costs.\n\nCalculating shipping this way is fairer to all backers, as some pledges will be much heavier than others. By not including shipping in the pledge level, it also means we can give you more stretch goal rewards!\n\nBelow is a table that breaks the world into several different zones and shows you the estimated cost of shipping the different pledge levels to these locations at today's prices and the base weights of the pledges. As we unlock stretch goals this may alter the prices, but I will post regular updates to the estimated costs of shipping as the campaign goes on so you can be as informed as possible. \n\nPlease do not add any shipping costs to your pledge now, you'll be invoiced closer to the time of shipping for the costs of delivery.\nThe project will ship in April 2016, this includes a buffer to account for some delays. However, if we over-fund dramatically there will obviously be more miniatures to design and produce which could delay fulfillment, but that will mean there's more miniature goodness for you to enjoy!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk facing this project is any delays caused by over funding. \n\nI've worked with all the artists, sculptors, printers, and casters previously so am confident in not only their skills, but also their ability to deliver on time. \n\nProduction is taking place wholly within the UK meaning there are no long waits on product coming from China, and all the risks that go along with that. \n\nReally, the only thing that can slow the fillfilment process down, outside of an \"act of God\", is if we fund well beyond expectations and therefor our partners have more units to design and produce. We've worked a reasonable buffer into the timeframe which should account for this, but it is always a risk. \n\nWHAT IF THE PROJECT DOESN'T FUND?\n\nThe other main risk is that the project fails to raise it's funding. I think it's important to talk about this so you all know what will happen. \n\nIn short, it will not be the end of the Icarus Project. If we fail to meet our goal, development work will continue behind the scenes and we'll try to release individual models as and when we can. \n\nIf this happens, we will review what went wrong and what we can improve on, and we will return to Kickstarter in 2016.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Icarus Games\n2 created \u00b7 39 backed\nTabletop Games Company from North Wales, UK.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Work Begins Again", "update_content": "Greetings folks.\nIts been a long time since we last spoke but I've got some exciting news for you; work on The Icarus Project has recently started again.\nAs most of you will know, I stopped producing the minis in 2019 due to a variety of family and personal issues coupled with the cost of making and storing the minis."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "New Icarus Miniatures Kickstarter Live Now", "update_content": "Good afternoon backers.

Beyond that our shipping costs take a turn for the worse (something we've chosen to help mitigate for you beyond 9 sets).  Unlocking more sets also reflects a larger number of backers, which in turn demands higher production runs for some, and eventually all, of the colors.  In order to cover our increased production and shipping costs, we need to take the curve up a notch.  We kinda wrote the book on Kickstarter budgeting, and promise you that these exciting Over-Stretch Goals are budgeted both accurately and honestly.\nThanks for pledging!\nLet's do this!\nA quick FAQ note about A.D.A.P.T.\nA.D.A.P.T. is our newest game, and our next release.  It is a strategic battle card game for 2-3 players, that has never before seen mechanics (that's the way we like to do things), and is a total blast as you forcibly adapt your Guppy into a Master Fish with all manner of fun fish (and not-so-fish) parts.  The PnP takes about 5 minutes to print and set up; the rules take about 8 minutes to read, and the whole thing will cost you less than $1.50 print (if that).  It's a fun way to be the first to playtest our newest game, and maybe even offer feedback.  Heck! You've already helped design some of the Fish and Parts we'll flavor the game with. : ) \nOh, and p.s.... the big secret is... It requires a full set of dice to play! ; O\nHalfsies Dice are all new full dice sets that feature a beautiful new half-&-half color-split design, have a pearlescent swirl within each color, and are semi-translucent for stunningly vibrant colors.  \nAesthetically pleasing, and professionally manufactured these dice are a perfect addition to any collection.\nDice Details\nHalfsies Dice are manufactured in high impact resin with smooth corners, on preexisting, industry standard dice molds for a clean and reliably-balanced roll every time.\nHalfsies Dice have been prototyped in a number of color sets for you to see, but can and will be designed in any color arrangement you can imagine.\nAll sets are complete, the industry standard 15-20mm by die, and include the standard 7 dice:\n*backer favorite renders shown - full sets will be all the same colors\nThese dice sets fit perfectly in any collection, whether you are a casual gamer, a dice collector, or just like shiny objects.\n\"These are your dice.\"\nHere are some dice closeups so you can compare what you have at home to what Halfsies Dice look like.

After that, you choose the rest!\nSet #1) Mithril\nMithril Lore - A legendary metal first mined by the dwarves of Moria.  Some say it is actually an organic metal that can be found forming the scales of certain dragons. Beautiful and engaging, these silvery blue dice make a great companion for any noble gamer.\nSet #2) Orichalcum\nOrichalcum Lore - A rare red metal found only in the sunken city of Atlantis.  Its strength and molecular commonalities with gold made it abundantly valuable.  Bold and strong, this set can roll with the best of them in any dungeon crawl campaign.\nSet #3) Adamantium\nAdamantium Lore - Once known as the indestructible metal Adamantine that held the Greek titans captive in the underworld.  Now, its popular alloy has been used to create some pretty sweet claws.  These gentle green hues will soothe your mind whilst your ranger puts out long range DPS.\nThe color arrangements for the next 5 ...er, make that EIGHT... dice sets will be chosen by YOU, and unlocked by Stretch & Over-Stretch Goals.\nSet #4) The backer chosen: Psionic Combat - Now Available!\nPsionic Combat Lore - In the world of fantasy and legendary heroes there are those that can manipulate reality by sheer force of will.

As they catch a glint of sunlight upon entering our atmosphere, they begin to hum a sound that, together, is almost musical.  We call this, the Moonlight Sonata.\nSet #7) The backer chosen: Treant Dice - Now Available!\nTreant Dice Lore - The ents are trees so old that they've developed consciousnesses of their own.  The drawback to this state is that they can no longer beget new trees; they produce seeds, but those seeds can't germinate as they too have a consciousnesses of their own.  These are your Treant Dice.\nSet #8) The backer chosen: The Heir -Now Available!\nThe Heir Lore - On March 17th 2014, The Heir was discovered.  On November 23rd 2015, 2014, The Heir was born.

Sure, we could pick them all ourselves, but that's not the way we roll.\nTransparency: All Pledge Tiers are already displayed and available from the start.  No mysteries about pricing as the campaign progresses.  We even posted our budget in the FAQs at the bottom of the page, and have reduced international shipping costs 3 times over the course of the campaign.\nFree Stuff: We've added a \"Better the Odds\" Tier, in which you put your faith in this campaign to see ALL Dice Sets unlocked, bettering everyone's odds of unlocking Stretch Goals, and we in turn give you the Yin Yang Dice Set for FREE when we hit that point.  Plus the Saint Patrick's Day Tiers, now the Gift Package Tier!  Free stuff!  ...we're kinda obsessed with free upgrades. \n3) These dice are the lowest prices they'll ever be.\nWe have priced the Tiers as low as we can to make them accessible to everyone, while still guaranteeing successful production & delivery.\nIn retail, these dice will MSRP at $9+ per set + full price shipping.\nHere on Kickstarter you can get them for as low as $7.00 (or less) per set!\nFor designer 2-tone dice, that price can't be found anywhere online.\nDetails and a little math:\nEven at the first Tier, since shipping is included in your order (USA full; International in-part), they are already cheaper than ordering retail from most online retailers (because they charge full shipping in addition).

We think you'll be rather pleased.\nHow are we able to do this?  We kicked this with zero margin on these dice.  We've offered up our profits for your savings.  We'll make a couple bucks selling the left overs after the campaign.  But you get them crazy cheap for investing your trust in us.  That's the way we do things.\nStill unsure? \nWe invite you to back us at the lowest Pledge Tier so you can join in the comments, surveys, and updates to see we do things.  If at the end of all things you're not happy with your time with us, simply cancel your pledge.  You have nothing to lose. \nJust give us the chance to wow you.\nEach Pledge Tier represents a quantity of Dice Sets.  The more sets ordered in a single pledge the less each Dice Set costs.\nAll Tiers include: A number of Dice Sets in plastic dice cases, a shipping subsidy, and entry to Backer-only voting.\nFinal color choices for your order will be made after the campaign closes, at all Tiers.  Pledge early, choose later.\n\n\"Can I order multiples of certain color sets, so this campaign hits all its goals?\"\nAbsolutely!  To do so...\nClick the green \"Back this Project\" button at the top of the page.\nSelect the Pledge Tier that corresponds to the total number of sets you'd like to receive.\nGo tell your friends about these dice, so they can pledge too.\nAt the close of the campaign, simply tell us what color sets you desire; repeats welcome.\nAll shipping charges will be collected after the campaign.\nWe chose the \"pay for shipping after the campaign\" method because it keeps the Funding Goal & Stretch Goals more transparent & accurate, while it also reduces your final shipping charges. \nWe just hacked down International Shipping CONSIDERABLY... again. (3/7/15)\nShipping costs - detailed by quantity of sets ordered, by area.\n\u2020 = \"Friendly Shipping\" with VAT & Customs Fees pre-paid.\n\u2021 = Yes, we managed to successfully unify ALL OF EUROPE, Western, Central, and even Non-EU, etc. for shipping rates.  EU Europe is also \"Friendly\"; while non-EU Europe may be subject to VAT by locality.\n* As we have successfully reached $69,000 in funding.  These prices are locked in.  Congratulations!\nPlease DO NOT add the shipping rate to your pledge. \nShipping will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management.  Because...\nWe continue our pledge: If we find prices less than the ones we've already quoted, we will reduce the shipping accordingly.  It's already happened THRICE so far...\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced as of 2/18/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced further as of 2/28/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced HUGELY as of 3/7/15\nShipping Q&A:\n\"International Shipping got cheaper with each Stretch Goal?\"\nPer set, yes. We budgeted in a sliding scale for shipping subsidies within our Funding & Stretch Goals, so that we could guarantee that USA shipping remains free with every unlocked Tier.  As the USA subsidy grew, so did the international one.  That means, the higher our funding goal grew, the less international Backers have to pay, on average, for shipping!\n-\n...the lost prototypes...\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving already begun manufacturing on The King's Armory - The Tower Defense Board Game, we have gained a lot of experience with game production - including custom polyhedral dice - and we put that experience to work reducing the risks and challenges. \nIt also allows us to foresee potential issues, and solve them in advance.\n\nFor example: we can't be 100% certain what final International Shipping is going to cost for each Backer's unique order, so we did extensive research with multiple companies in order to provide very accurate estimates, and ultimately chose to collect shipping post-campaign. This way there's no \"we ran out of money for shipping\" faux pas, because each person pays what they owe by order and by region.\n\nOur Commitment to Your Excellence: \nIf you get the wrong dice, experience excessive production delays, or are in any way dissatisfied with the way we fulfill your pledge, whether it be our fault or any others', we'll fight on your behalf to make it right. We've done it for our TKA Backers, and we'll do it again for you.\nAnd if we can't make it right, we'll refund your money; thus mitigating YOUR risks and challenges.\n\nGiving Back to Those That Have Helped Us: \nOur experience with game production during The King's Armory campaign really has taught us a lot.

Our 'Modern Combat' range was introduced three years ago and has set the standard for modern-period miniatures ever since.\nPlease visit us at www.empressminiatures.com to find out more and see our current ranges.\nWith your help we are hoping to make a significant addition to our 28mm (1/56th) Modern Combat range of figures.\nAs a 'young' company our resources are limited and, with the cost of development, we are prevented from adding to our ranges in a big way. The masters for our weapons alone cost more than most companies will spend on an entire figure sculpt. These are not cheap models to produce, but for us the quality of the end result is what counts and the many conversations we've had with our customers have shown that you feel the same!\nUSMC Command\nOur aim is to add an entire 'theater' or theme to the modern figures range in one go. We could only dream of doing this normally, but with the help of Kickstarter we feel that we are in with a good chance of making a really meaningful addition to this range.\nThe theme that we have chosen is the Asia-Pacific region.\nPartly inspired by recent events, and mostly as a 'what if' exercise, we are producing figures that would be present during both small scale engagements and larger 'land battles'. Our premise was that the world's super-powers have begun to flex their military might in the region in an effort to grab valuable resources. What starts as a minor dispute over a few islands has escalated as each nation moves it's conventional (and unconventional) forces into the area in greater numbers!\nThis is our take on a modern 'cold-war'. Needless to say these figures will be suitably at home in any modern theater of war, as well as fighting the Zombie-Hordes or Alien Invasion in whatever game scenario you can think of!\nUSMC Combat Pose\nThe project will initially focus on the United States Marines (USMC) with both tropical and 'desert' equipment options (suitable for all theaters) and the Chinese National Army (PLA), with some rather nice extras along the way.\nUSMC Advancing\nUS Navy Hospital corpsman, 2/8 Marines, by J. Kenneth Eward \u00a9 Osprey Publishing Ltd. Taken from Elite 190: US Marine Infantry Combat Uniforms and Equipment 2000\u201312.\nWe are going 'all-out' to produce the highest quality figures that we possibly can for this. With extensive research and attention to detail we will produce 'hi-res' figures worthy of your collection. Both detail and figure posing are second to none in this range already, and these new figures will be no exception.\nUSMC On Patrol\nUSMC Firing M16A4\nEach of the Marine and Chinese sculpts will be unique figures. We don't employ a 'dolly' system for our modern figures and we feel that this adds an important level of realism to your tabletop forces. We will produce 20 US Marine bodies (with a choice of helmeted heads or 'boonie' soft hats) and 20 Chinese PLA figures (mostly with heads cast on). This provides 5 'units' for each force in our initial plans.\nWith luck, we hope to add to this if we manage to reach our goal!\nPLA infantryman in Type 07 digital-pattern camouflage with 5.8mm folding-stock QBZ-03 assault rifle, by Adam Hook \u00a9 Osprey Publishing Ltd. Taken from Elite 194: The Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army since 1949: Ground Forces.\nPLA In Combat\nSo far we have started by having the first figures sculpted and finished to production standard. These are the miniatures which you can see on this page right now. We will be continuing to update these during the Kickstarter project and will share progress with you as we go.\nHere you can see the different units that will be available initially:\nUPDATE: ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WEAPON UNITS\nWe've had lots of requests for different support weapon pledge options ( USMC Unit 4 and PLA Unit 4).\nYou can now add as many of these as you want to your rewards by adding \u00a36 to your pledge for each additional support weapon set that you need. Each 'Unit' contains 4 figures with a range of support weapons from LMGs to sharpshooter rifles etc.\nSee the Unit diagram in the project for more details of what these comprise.\nWe have put our units together to contain troops with a single type of armament (riflemen etc.) and separated out the support weapons. This means that each unit is not a Fireteam (according to Marine TOE) but that you can make fireteams with your choice of load-out by combining Rifleman Units with the Support Weapon Units.\nWe've based this decision on customer feedback over the last few years (originally our early modern releases were designed to be a full fire-team per pack). Changing military requirements 'in-theatre' meant that it became increasingly difficult to keep things up to date and customers often requested a bit more flexibiliy by being able to buy all of the support weapons together in one pack.\nBackers will find that this is a really excellent value Kickstarter, allowing you to get figures at greatly reduced prices compared to when they eventually go on sale. You are also safe in the knowledge that you can get an entire force, complete with all of the expected support weapons etc., at once rather than waiting for the range to develop in the 'usual' way over time.\nOh, and then there is the small matter of the FREE FIGURES! As you would expect from a miniature Kickstarter, we will be thanking everyone who backs our project with free figures exclusive to this project.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE FREE FIGURE\nOur first free figure is a member of the New Zealand SAS. This versatile figure can find a place in most special forces units in the western world and he will not be available after this project.\nWe will add more free figures to the project with our stretch-goals, and these will be available to everyone who backs the project at any level which gives access to stretch goals.\nWe have a number of really exciting stretch goals planned should we be lucky enough to meet and exceed our target. Each of these is designed to fit in to the theme of the Kickstarter Project, while still being useful 'stand-alone' forces in their own right.\nPhoto Courtesy of Nathan Vinson\nThe stretch goals will give you the chance to add new factions and units to your pledge.\nOn top of this we will be adding to the pool of free figures, with additional one-offs and some great figures exclusive to this project!\nWe have lots of exciting options planned to come after these if we are lucky enough to get there, and we will let you know more nearer the time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFigure sculpting is a creative and, often, time consuming process. We use one of the best sculptors in the industry and the very best casting service that the UK can provide.\n\nAs a result our main risks are time-slippage depending on the final total of figures that need to be made, and the turnaround time of our contract casting company to provide the final models.\n\nAll of our master moulds are cold-cured silicone in order to preserve the original master model. This is a straightforward process that both ourselves, our sculptor and our casting company have been using for years with almost 100% success rates. It is more expensive than standard vulcanization but allows us to produce stunningly detailed figures with very little risk.\n\nWe pride ourselves on working with the most professional team that we can muster, and not choosing the 'cheapest' options when it comes to production. In this way we aim to mitigate most production blockers before they occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "New Modern Russians from Empress Miniatures.", "update_content": "Empress have just released a range of Ultra Modern Russians to go with our range of Russian vehicles.\nCheck them out on the Empress Miniatures site.\nAlso look for updates on our Face Book page.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Empress-Miniatures/581342921962834"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Empress New Releases", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Empress Miniatures and Skirmish Sangin Rules.", "update_content": "We are very pleased to announce that we are now stocking Radio Dish-Dash's excellent Skirmish Sangin modern skirmish rules and supplements.
