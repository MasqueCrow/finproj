[{"backer": "Erik Sacino", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Red, White & Broke: Confessions of an American Superhero continues in Issue #2! (Issue #1 also available!)  Don't miss this humorous look at the side of superheroes you never see:  the financial side.\nIssue #2 - Main Cover by Dennis Tirona\nAll Issue 1 covers now available as Add-Ons! Simply pledge on Issue 2 and then select Issue 1 on the next screen (this is a new Kickstarter feature!)\nMeet Robert Rhodes, better known as Captain Stronghold, one of America's most well-loved superheroes. He's super-strong, he can fly, and he's adored by millions. He's also FLAT BROKE. Busted. Bankrupt. Being a superhero is surprisingly expensive and it's hard to keep a job when you keep disappearing for hours at a time to save people's lives. So Captain Stronghold goes on national television to reveal his secret identity and to turn to the people he's saved countless times for help... financial help! Yes, the world's most beloved superhero is launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund his super heroics!\nIn this issue, Captain Stronghold reveals how he got his powers and how he learned to fly, tangles with Dr. Deathmask, shares his first (embarrassing) outing as a superhero, and discovers a new and deadly threat! All this and more in Red, White & Broke: Confessions of an American Superhero #2!\nIssue #2 - Variant Cover by Livio Ramondelli\nRed, White & Broke is a superhero story that's not a superhero story. It's a look at the (literal) cost of being superhero, all told in the wryly comic writing style of #1 bestselling author and award-winning podcast host Mike Spring. Along with rising comic art star Dennis Tirona, we dive deeper into the logistics of being a superhero than you've ever seen before. \nPage 1 of Issue #2\nWe've got a great selection of rewards for backing this project, including three different covers to choose from. You can pick the Main Cover by series artist Dennis Tirona or the Variant Cover by Livio Ramondelli (Transformers, Star Wars) that pays homage to the classic Iron man #128 - Demon in a Bottle!

Final design will vary.\nStretch Goal #3 ($10,000) - TO BE REVEALED SOON!\n\nABOUT THE CREATORS -\nMike Spring (Writer) - Mike Spring is the Amazon #1 bestselling author of the Bloodsucker Blues series, a four-book humorous vampire novel story.

As the creator and co-host of the create-your-own-movie-sequel podcast After the Ending, Mike has gained a whole new audience of fans.

Only drawing professionally since 2015, Dennis has already amassed an impressive body of acclaimed artwork. In addition to several comic book short stories, Dennis art has been featured in the hit comics The Ferryman and The Nefarious Smyths. Dennis describes his artwork as: \"I was not really interested in doing pin-up or poster art, so I studied on how to draw sequential pages. Gave myself a few months to learn as much as I can, made some sample pages then got my first sequential gig in October that year and it\u2019s been freelance work ever since. I always aim for a clear page as I want the story to be seamless, and my art style is definitely on the cleaner side and not too anatomically exaggerated, although I am also developing a style more keen on the noir look.\"\nLivio Ramondelli (Variant Cover Artist) - Livio Ramondelli's art credits include a lengthy run on Transformers for IDW Publishing. His first original creator owned series as writer and artist, The Kill Lock, began being published by IDW in December 2019.

He's super-strong, he can fly, and he's adored by millions. He's also FLAT BROKE. Busted. Bankrupt. Being a superhero is surprisingly expensive and it's hard to keep a job when you keep disappearing for hours at a time to save people's lives. \n\nSo Captain Stronghold goes on national television to reveal his secret identity and to turn to the people he's saved countless times for help... financial help! Yes, the world's most beloved superhero is launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund his super heroics!  After all, those costumes don't just pay for themselves!\nRed, White & Broke is a superhero story that's not a superhero story. It's a look at the (literal) cost of being superhero, all told in the wryly comic writing style of #1 bestselling author and award-winning podcast host Mike Spring. Along with rising comic art star Dennis Tirona, Mike has crafted a 24-page debut issue that dives deeper into the logistics of being a superhero than you've ever seen before. Who makes the costumes? Who pays for them? How many jobs can one superhero hold? Are secret identities worth it? All these questions and more will be answered in Red, White & Broke: Confessions of an American Superhero #1!\nVariant Cover by Ian Chase Nichols (The Tick, TMNT)\nVariant Cover by Drew Moss\nWe've got a great selection of rewards for backing this project, including three different covers to choose from.

The Weerdscience team has been posting thank yous along the way that brief as they were, were always heartfelt and real. So anyway, rather than bore you guys with another thank you, I'd really like to tell you some of the reasons why this was literally a life changing thing for me. Have you ever felt like you let someone down? Remember what a shitty feeling that is? Well that's what Weerdscience became for me in a lot of ways. When we would do a show and 5 people would show up I always felt like it was my fault for not being famous enough or that people expected it to be a fucking Coheed show with thousands of screaming fans.(I do need to point out that these thoughts do not reflect how anyone felt there just my insanity and insecurity). Anyway, I have always wanted to do WS. Always. If that meant in conjunction with a band than that's great. The more music the better! WS to me is the most creatively fulfilling thing I've ever done. To me it is everything.Ok ok ok, so after the last few shows(before this year) were awful and the label doesn't seem interested in releasing \"Sick Kids\" I had basically given up. That was it. I wanted people to care but if they didn't what could I do. After awhile and a lot of hard work by the team(Neesh,Dave,Chris), my best friend and mgr. Ernie Falconer hooked the project up with Horris records and MC Lars. Lars was thrilled to help me put out the record. Needless to say I was over the moon!!! Pumped!! This was what we've been waiting for! After a few meetings Lars brought up the kick starter idea. I hated it. In Ernies basement in Queens Lars said it'd be a great way to see what kind of interest is out there. I thought \" welp, this is the end of this. Lars believes in this thing so much but surely hell be bummed out when there is 50$ on the last day and it was Ernie who put it in there!\" I was terrified. I nervously would say \"Ok, but I hope any one gives a shit\". A desperate attempt to warm Lars up to the idea that nobody will care. After the first day there was like $700 dollars! I was cautiously optimistic. It kept climbing and climbing and all of a sudden this thing that I was so afraid of became such a thrill!! Every time I'd look there were more people pre ordering the record. I honestly couldn't believe it and I thought even if it takes the full 28 days were gonna get to that 4k goal! Nothing could've prepared me for the next 20 days. Not only did we reach the goal but we doubled it. More than doubled it! Over 8,500 raised. I don't wanna get all sappy on you guys but in my heart I feel like this is all because I stayed clean and life makes more sense than ever. And that's priceless. When you guys ordered the LP, and the shirts and hoodies,etc.... it made me feel like I haven't in years. Hungry. Ready to get on stage and go as hard as I can. Harder than ever before.
