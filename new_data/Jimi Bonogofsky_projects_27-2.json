She just wants to be free, she tells Andrea; she wants to see and enjoy the world.\n\nAndrea can relate. And as thanks for her rescue, Carmen offers an incredible reward: eternal life.\nBut this promise of an eternal and exciting future not wasn't what it seemed. And if Darra\u2014 and her newfound ally, Liam, who has known Carmen far too well for far too long\u2014 don't play rescuers themselves, Andrea will surely come to regret her strange and deadly bargain.\nStars, Hide Your Fire is a 162-page, full-color graphic novel, suitable for middle grade readers and up.\n\nWe've done our best to estimate shipping costs, but please remember that these are only estimates.

Part haunted-house tale, part psychedelic fever dream, the story is driven by a vivid cast of characters:\nKeziah Mason, the witch who uses advanced mathematics to travel through time and space; Brown Jenkin, her terrifying rat familiar; and Narylathotep, a sinister Elder deity. This unsettling trio haunt the dreams of hapless Walter Gilman, the Miskatonic University student who became too curious about the ancient Witch House.\nThe Part Flamingo Press edition of The Dreams in the Witch House features full-color illustrations by artist Adam Pernell Deal and the original text of Lovecraft\u2019s tale. \n\"Old Keziah Mason\"\nH.P. Lovecraft\nBlending elements of fantasy, science fiction, and supernatural horror, The Dreams in the Witch House is part of Lovecraft\u2019s Dream Cycle--a series of stories about alternate dimensions entered through dreams, and set in the Lovecraftian universe known as the Cthulhu Mythos. \nIn his lifetime Lovecraft published short stories in pulp magazines and amateur sci-fi publications. He died in poverty and obscurity in 1937. Since his death, Lovecraft\u2019s following has only increased. Today, he is the most well-known founder of the weird fiction genre, and his work has inspired some of the most celebrated horror writers and filmmakers of our time. Neil Gaiman, Guillermo del Toro, and John Carpenter all credit Lovecraft's influence on their work.\n\u201cHe must go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos.\u201d\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nThe Part Flamingo Press edition of The Dreams in the Witch House will be beautifully bound and illustrated--a quality edition for book-lovers and collectors.

In 2019 he co-founded Part Flamingo Press to produce unusual books with an elegant aesthetic. The first book issued by Part Flamingo is the picture book, Knoxville Mermaid. It features linen hardback binding, gold foil lettering, printed endpapers, and other luxe details. It was printed by Edition One, who will print The Dreams in the Witch House.\nWorking exclusively in pencil, ink, and watercolor, Deal\u2019s \u201cotherworldly illustrations give a surreal aspect to even mundane subjects.\u201d --Kirkus Reviews\nLovecraft\u2019s imagery is dense and vivid, especially in the passages describing Walter Gilman\u2019s dreams.\n\u201cGilman sometimes compared the inorganic masses to prisms, labyrinths, clusters of cubes and planes, and Cyclopean buildings...groups of bubbles, octopi, centipedes...and intricate Arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation.\u201d\nDream Abyss\nThese alien dreamscapes present a unique challenge and opportunity for Deal, an artist known for his imaginative and unsettling imagery.\nDeal\u2019s illustrations for The Dreams in the Witch House portray the characters Brown Jenkin, Keziah, Nyarlathotep, and Walter Gilman; the abysses and Cyclopean cities; Gilman\u2019s dramatic battle with Keziah, and the crumbling witch house. \nSome of Deal's original art for the book is available as pledge rewards.\nCyclopean City\n100% American-made\nOur printer, Edition One, is located in Berkeley, California.

We believe our books speak for themselves and hope by presenting our quality work, we will find our people. We hope to have these books printed and available by the winter holidays.

The demon might just be the ghost of an alien queen, Wrathia, seeking revenge on the one that destroyed her empire, a god-like figure named Titan.\nThe story follows Ava as she makes her way across the universe, teaming up with the demon haunting her on a quest for revenge, while fighting her own inner demons along the way. I've been working on this story since 2012 and now that I've crossed the halfway point of the series, I\u2019ve partnered with comic book publisher Skybound to bring you the definitive edition of AVA'S DEMON in print form!\n\"Reading the dark and colorful AVA'S DEMON feels like watching a tv series... all I want to do is binge it!\" - SWEENEY BOO\nWe need to raise $25,000 for our Kickstarter Campaign to be a success! With that, we can bring you the Kickstarter Exclusive version of AVA'S DEMON BOOK 1: REBORN as well as my first ever art book!

Should we reach our stretch goals, the book will also include brand new Ava\u2019s Demon short stories made just for this volume by me and my wonderful team!  \n\"Every drawing Michelle makes hints at a deeper, richer world behind it. Their work has that beautiful balance of storytelling and pure aesthetic indulgence--it's beautiful to look at and makes you want to know more. \" - LOIS VAN BAARLE aka LOISH\nA beautifully made 104-page hardcover art book featuring my work over the past 8 years, including some never-before-seen Ava\u2019s Demon illustrations!

Your continued support has literally made Ava\u2019s Demon possible and I couldn't be more grateful.

This Kickstarter is to print the first volume, containing 100 pages, in paperback. Consider helping me make this come to life, and get a copy for your bookshelf!\n\nMy Illustrated Life started in December of 2017 from an assignment in college. I've had a ton of fun making more comics since then and this December is the comic's 3rd anniversary!\nThe comic is series of journal comics, so you can expect the usual slice of life comics in here. There's also some funny moments from my DnD sessions with friends and even some comics about video games. There's a little bit of something for a variety of tastes! There is of course, a whole lot of comics with my cats. (What can I say? I love the little quirky goofballs.) You'll also find the rest of my family in some comics, and even my friends starring along side me on occassion.\nThe main reward is, of course, the book! This book will be a 9x9\" square paperback book with 100 pages. There's new art for title pages and of course, the cover. Every physical book will come signed as thanks for pledging towards the campaign!\nPLEASE NOTE: These are just mockups for the book and not not 100% a representation of what the book will look like. \nAside from the book being something you can get from this Kickstarter, there's also a poster made by me. This will be 11\" x 17\" in full color from CatPrint!\nThe other rewards besides the book, depend on how much you pledge. You could get a doodle on the inside of the cover, an A5 sized drawing (related to the comic) or even a digital commission!\nI prepared some stretch goals just in case we surpass the original goal! Anything physical that's unlocked will be also available as an add-on when the backer-kit is sent out at the end of August 2020.\nI'll also be putting out more information about these stretch goals as we gete close to funding them! So keep an eye out for updates!\nI've never run a sucessful Kickstarter before, but I've been researching through Kickstarters I'd backed and through people documenting their process; as well as asking questions of my friend Bryan Ballinger - who sucessfuly funded his Animal Gas campaign.  Aside from asking questions, I am the only one running this Kickstarter. I've taken that into account and made sure I'm not adding too many rewards that would slow me down in regards to delivering things on time. However, we all know the postal system can be difficult at times, and as long as all the rewards get to me I will always update backers should anything get in the way of delivering this at my promised time.  As this is my first Kickstarter, I'm very open to learning how to make things better, especially for my backers. I can be reached in the comments and through messaging on Kickstarter, so I can make sure this process goes as smoothly as possible.\nThis image breaks down where the money is going for our initial goal of $1,900. Most of it, of course, is going towards getting the book printed. I have also set some aside to ship your orders to you and to make sure we have the kickstarter fees covered. There's some leftover as a buffer to make sure that we have enough to get everything printed and shipped out as safely as possible!\nThanks so much for taking a look at this Kickstarter. If you can't pledge any money to the campaign at this time, you can always share this with your friends and family. Maybe even ask someone to back it as a present for you? Any support is always helpful, and I appreciate you taking a look!\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that brings people together in order to create things. Your payment is not taken out until (or IF) the project funds by its deadline. If the project is completed, I will send out a backer survey to get additional information from you, such as; adresses for physical rewards, emails for digital rewards, letting you add any aditional items and any other information that I may need to get your rewards to you.

Each episode costs hundreds of thousands of euros, and producing a complete season takes several years, during which time we need to pay the artists' salaries, the utility bills and lots of other expenses, even while the series itself isn't generating any income.\n\nThis is why a series can only be produced with the help of one or more distributors who, beyond merely taking interest in a project, commit to supporting the creation of the series all the way through to broadcast, ensuring that it reaches its target audience.\n\nUnfortunately, WAKFU's evolution toward more mature themes has been an obstacle to this process so far. We still haven't managed to convince the distributors to help us with this project, although we're continuing our talks with them!\n\nWe've got one card left up our sleeve: funding the creation of season 4 ourselves, with your help.

{"campaign": {"story": "Hi! We're Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan and we make sex education comics! \nIn this Kickstarter we're making a follow-up to our first purely sex-education comic book, Drawn to Sex: The Basics. While that first book covered... well, the basics of doin' it, this follow up, Our Bodies and Health, will cover the more science-y and biology-y side of sex. \nOur comics are frank, friendly, and fun. They're here to demystify the world of sex, teach you about your amazing body, and answer your questions\u2014including the ones you didn't know you had!\nDrawn to Sex\nAfter 7 years making weekly sex-related comics on Oh Joy Sex Toy, we've finally acquired enough material for a dedicated line of books purely devoted to educational topics: It's the Drawn to Sex series! We launched with The Basics, a collection of our comics on the fundamentals of having sex.\nIn this second volume, Our Bodies and Health, we're focusing on the biology and science of our bodies and reproductive organs. Its 200+ pages cover the subjects of anatomy, pregnancy, abortion, menstruation, menopause, check-ups, STIs, and more. All of these strips are already available for free on Oh Joy Sex Toy. \nIt'll be 6x9\" with fancy french flaps, softcover (so it's easy to pick up and read), and full color. We'll even give the cover a fancy spot-gloss!\nWe're aiming to get the books to you in November 2020, but understandably there might be delays because of COVID-19. We'll make sure to stay informed and drop you updates if we have them as we go.\nHere's what people have said about our work!\n Drawn to Sex - The Basics, rated at 4.7 stars on Amazon and 4.57 stars on Goodreads, with over 250 reviews.\n \u201cErika Moen is fucking amazing and this book will change your life for the better.\u201d Emily Nagoski, PhD \n \"...the sexual education that everyone in the world needs. One of the most queer-friendly, colorful, and out-right positive webcomics out there.\" Tara Marie, Comics Alliance \n \u201cA great and hilarious resource - some of the best sex ed out there!\u201d - Dan Savage \n \u201cThis is a sex-positive gulp of fresh air.\u201d - Publishers Weekly \n(more quotes and accolades can be found on our Press page!)\nSome sample pages!\nBook Mockup!\n Guest Comics\nTry as we might, we simply can't cover everything under the sun, so we reach out to as many other artists as we can each year to contribute their own work. They add their diverse and unique voices to our collection of comics. In this year's book, we'll be including the following 8 guest comics:\nBody Image Blues By Bingo\nPeyronie\u2019s Disease by Bingo\nMenopause by Ashley Guillory\nPregnancy Sex by Boum\nPoly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome by Ainsley Yeager\nAIDS, HIV and PrEP by Silver\nBilateral Salpingectomy by Rosalarian\nVestibulodynia by Alex Assan\nWe'll be dropping these artists a $100 bonus per comic if this all funds (on top of what they were originally paid to make said comics), and will scale that up if the Kickstarter does super well!\nRewards\nWe like to keep things simple - no rolling extras or hundreds of add-ons. Just the book, PDF, and some bookplates to stick into the book! We'll also offer up some of the previous OJST volumes to keep things interesting. \n $1 - Exclusive Wallpaper: Background for your devices. \n$8 - Book PDF\n $12 - Early Bird Special: PDF and physical book: Limited first-come-first-served as a thank you for early adopters!\n$20 - The physical book\n$30 - Signed physical book\n $36 - BOTH Drawn to Sex books \n $50 - BOTH Drawn to Sex books AND a random Oh Joy Sex Toy book: Worth  $70 in stores, these three books are the perfect introduction to what we do and great bang for your buck. The OJST volumes are bigger, have more of our comics, and are filled with guest artist comics as well!\n $55 - A doodled physical book: Bookplate comes with a quick doodle from Erika to stick inside your book.\n $125 - A UNIQUE illustration in your physical book: Erika draws a one-of-a-kind illustration onto a bookplate for you to secure inside your book!\n $1069 - Unique illustrated physical book and we'll take you out for coffee if you're ever in Portland.  \nWe're aiming to do fulfillment ourselves if the number of backers is small and then use the fine folks at Make That Thing if there wind up being a whole lot of you!\nIf you're not really interested in getting a book but still want to support us, check out our Patreon here! \n\nUnder the Hood Stuff\nWhy do we need Kickstarter? It's the most direct way for you to get our work and for us to fund our tiny business. We've been using this space for years in order to take pre-orders for our books. Since Oh Joy Sex Toy debuted in 2013, our Kickstarter book pre-orders are an essential way we raise the funds not only to produce our beautiful books, but to compensate us for the year's worth of labor that goes into making them, and to crowdfund paying the dozens of guest cartoonists we work with each year a professional rate for their comics.\nThis Kickstarter gets us paid to build this book, fills our basement with copies to sell at conventions, and ensures we keep making comics and hiring artists on OJST.\nErika and Matt\nWe're in our 30s and love the world of sex. It's our full-time job! Together we write and make every comic. Erika is responsible for all the drawings while Matthew colors them and handles all the other business and book-making bits.\nErika is a 16-ish year comics veteran in Portland, OR. She has a desk at Helioscope (Formerly Periscope Studio) and her work has been published by Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, Villard, BOOM! Studios, Penny Arcade, Scholastic, and Limerence Press, among many others.\nWhereas Matt's only been doing the comics business truffle shuffle for the past 7 years - puuuffft, what an amateur.\nLicenses and Thank Yous\nSome thanks to a few people for helping make this Kickstarter possible.\nWe're working with Limerence Press again this year to help print the book and to distribute it into stores and libraries. Thank you, team!\n Make That Thing is gonna help out if we need extra fulfillment. They are the bees' knees.\nThe music used in the video is 'Cute' by BenSounds.

Spike here, founder of Iron Circus Comics and writer of Yes, Roya.\nYes, Roya is a comic I'm exceptionally proud of. It embodies of a lot of the principles of Iron Circus erotica: consent-driven, sex-positive, and thoughtfully plotted. It was one of those Iron Circus books that proved to so many creators that there was a market for this kind of material. And it proved to so many more readers that material like this was being made. It opened the door for so much!\nBut Yes, Roya was originally published in 2016. And, back then, money was just a bit tighter, and our printing connections just a little less solid. We couldn't imagine printing something like this in color. The option wasn't there!\nHowever, the last of the original print run is quickly disappearing; fewer than fifty copies remain. It's time for a reprint. And maybe... an improvement?\nIron Circus Comics has brought aboard experienced professional colorist (and Hugo Award nominee!) Kelly Fitzpatrick to do Emilee Denich's pages some justice, and the prelims she's turned in are already blowing our socks off! The entirety of the story will be brought to life with fantastic mid-century flair: a lot of burnt orange and moss green.\n...Hooray?\nWhatever. I'm just foolin' with ya, it's gonna be great. Check out the sample pages below!\nPage 12!\nPage 30!\nPage 82!\nI'm new to all this. What is \"Yes, Roya?\"\nOh wow, you are in for a TREAT. \nYes, Roya is a 150-page m/f/m femdom graphic novel, set in 1960s California, about what happens when a young, aspiring cartoonist meets his idol, and discovers his hero \u2014 and his hero's wife, Roya \u2014 are anything but your typical mid-century couple.\nIt's an Amazon bestseller in three categories with a five-star average review on both Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and critically-acclaimed by the likes of The AV Club and Oh Joy Sex Toy. We're very proud of this book, and can't wait to give it new life with color!\nBut hey now, what about a Stretch Goal?\nHa ha ha, just kidding! Sure!\nIf this project hits $10,000, we'll bring back Yes, Roya's artist, Emilee Denich, to create an all-new cover for the color edition! Something fun. N' sexy. She's good at that.\nHere's a rough draft of what it could look like!\nAnd... yeah, that's pretty much it! This project is keeping it simple, with a modest goal and just two weeks to fund. We know we can make it, with your help!\nPlease, spread word of this Kickstarter far and wide, and help get us to our goal!\nThanks so much, everybody!

It's about a robot!\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow.\nYou can listen to our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free!\nWe're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, four of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?   \n Our 7th studio album, Teaching a Robot to Love, is 12 songs about the things we care about. IT IS ALSO: a musical. With a plot. About artificial intelligence and the true nature of \"humanity.\" It's funny, and cute, and real, and all the things that Doubleclicks albums normally are. \nWhy this project, why now? The Doubleclicks started in a dorm room 10 years ago. That's wild. We've been writing dozens of nerdy songs about our feelings for a long, long time. What we haven't done is finished something truly ambitious and narrative. This is a huge challenge\u2014much, much harder than we anticipated. But after a few false starts on different musicals (sorry, abandoned projects, we will be back someday...), we have finally completed writing the music and words to a story we're really proud of!!!\nThis project is happening in three parts:\n1. Doubleclicks songs\u2014a whole grip of Doubleclicks songs about anxiety, friendship, love, art, cheese, and our lives.\n2. The audio drama/cast album\u2014most of these very same songs, plus a few more, fit themselves into a MUSICAL. With just a few little narration pieces, a cast of characters, and bonus songs, we will provide you with a full audio drama version of this musical which is a full story about a robot!! There will be talented folks playing all the characters \u2014 and the two main characters are played by the Doubleclicks. \nBoth the digital album and the CD will contain the \"Cast Album\" along with bonus Doubleclicks versions of some songs.\n3. The staged-reading/video\u2014we will at least be producing one on-book staged reading of the musical, and we will film it when it happens. Backers will get a digital version of the video, and anyone who orders the USB will get the video on there as well.\n4. Bonus process streams\u2014Because of quarantine, we are going to be live-streaming the creative process of this musical as much as possible. You can watch the first quarantine concert we did here! Stay tuned to the updates tab on this page and to the Doubleclicks Discord for more announcements! We've already had fun writing the script with some of you in our co-working streams on YouTube\u2014thank you, Team Productivity!  \nWhat's next? Staging a full musical with costumes and choreography is a task that will require some outside funding and production, but we are looking into that, using this album and the funds from this project as a starting point for pitches and workshops. Our dreams include creating a script and sheet music for a full production. To do this, we will need to give ourselves an extension on the amount of time to dedicate to this project\u2014so... yes, this is a stretch goal question.   \nThe Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded, indie operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that\u2014and this is huge\u2014is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n   We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent; to hire musicians and vocalists, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album; to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins; to master and mix the music; to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores; and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n  We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful, especially right now! Nothing can stop our wackiness. Nothing!!\nA note about timing:\n We know that right now is really tough for a lot of people\u2014financially, emotionally, and everything. This was a genuinely difficult choice, but we decided to launch this project now anyway, because making music is our job, and this project pays our salaries. We would be in financial trouble if we didn't keep making music and if we didn't launch this project. However, we recognize that financial strain is real for many of our fans, and so our songs will still be online for everyone to listen to for free after the project is done. In fact, we just made all our old albums free to download on Bandcamp. Also, we are creating NO Kickstarter-exclusives on this project; if it's on this project, you'll be able to get it later. If you are able to donate, we, our cats, and our families appreciate it! If not\u2014please feel our love and support! \nThe Musical/The Story:\nStacy is a lonely, work-obsessed programmer tasked with building the next big advertising artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014a Google-Siri-Alexa-Facebook hybrid\u2014a profitable program that will sell people things based on their behavior in new and unprecedented ways. But when her program, MarshCom, becomes self aware and realizes that people don\u2019t need to buy things to be happy, Stacy is fired, and she takes her program with her.\nWith the help of her lab-tech roommate Jamie, Stacy finds Marsh an android body and they both start their new lives\u2014Stacy as unemployed, and Marsh as the first brand-new, artificially created, completely synthetic human being. When Stacy becomes jealous of Marsh and a fight turns into a city-threatening computer glitch, new friends need to come together to save the day\u2014or lose everything they\u2019ve gained.\n\u201cTeaching a Robot to Love\u201d is a musical about friendship, love, being human, asking for help, and the costs and benefits of loudly being one\u2019s self.\nStacy is played by Aubrey, and Marsh is played by Laser! More casting announcements to come. \nThe Songs:\nCast album/musical track list (click links to listen to demos!):\nEverybody Needs Someone\nFlipping a Switch\nThe Wrong Body*\nNothing To See Here*\nDo Science At Home!\nHow To Be A Person\n Normal Human Party *\nLet's Just Be Friends\nI Know Too Much\nI'm Right\nHack the Mainframe\n Cheddar*\nEverybody Needs Someone (Reprise)\n*Doubleclicks bonus version will also be recorded/included\nWant to listen to a song from the musical? \nThe Pins:\nDesigned by Meghan Murphy! You will get your choice of \"Rockin Robot\" and \"Sensitive Badass\" pin \u2014 and if you can't decide, you can add on the other pin after the project!\nThe Shirt: \nThe new Doubleclicks shirt is designed by Natalie Metzger and will be available in \"unisex\" and \"fitted/ladies\" sizes S-3XL. We will have size charts available for you so you can get just the right shirt! (This is just a mock-up based on an early sketch\u2014the final shirt design will be more polished)\nThe Dice:\nWe are creating an all-new set of three six-sided dice for 2020 featuring these designs: A party cat, a robot, and a T-rex! Here's what our dice look like, but these are old designs. The new ones will be NEW and have different pictures! \nPrevious Doubleclicks Dice design pictured - new dice will have different designs\nPrinted by Chessex! \nThe USB Drive:\n4GB USB Drive\nThe new Doubleclicks USB drive will include all the albums the Doubleclicks have released, plus the new Cast Album & Doubleclicks song bonuses, and a video recording of the staged reading of the musical. It will also have a video of our hour-long concert special \"Uncomfortable In Public,\" exclusive ringtones, and coloring pages. Earlybird USBs will be signed!\n Add-Ons:\nIf you need multiple shirts, dice sets, USBs\u2014we got you. There will be an add-on store launched after the Kickstarter ends through BackerKit. You don't need to worry about it now, but if you want to, you can add $10 for pins, $10 for dice, $15 for CDs, $30 for shirts, or $50 for USBs on to your pledge.   \nProjects like this take a whole bunch of people to make possible and we'd like to thanks some of them! Kim Newmoney took the photos on this page, and is amazing. The piano in our video and for \"Normal Human Party\" is by the talented Sam Johnides. Our Patrons have helped us get through a year of touring and a winter of songwriting, and are amazing. Our parents are extremely lovely, talented and supportive and we are thankful for them. Richard and Marzipan are the true heroes of this Kickstarter.

It began as just one idea that exploded into an exploration of concepts I grew up knowing; Looking through a more critical lens and being honest with my visceral reactions and my learned, habitual reactions. \nCurrently I have four completed pieces with a fifth one built as an empty concept, which will be better understood in the context of the whole series. The finished collection will be a total of eight pieces. I\u2019m preparing a lot of layers for the opening show and *this* is one magnificent one! \nEach painting tells a story in its pieces. There are some things that I\u2019ve shared online, with my patrons on Patreon, or with people who have been in my studio. But, for the most part, a lot of the stories are still locked up inside of me.\nI think the most valuable thing to this series is what makes up the paintings. And I\u2019m really excited to tell those stories in a little zine, what I intend to be the show booklet. I\u2019ve always liked to have a little blurb with each painting at any of my concept shows. I feel like this show and these paintings have so much weight to them, that if someone wants to just see art, they can walk by each painting and feel pleased with the imagination and rich colors. But if someone wants to see the paintings and know the meaning, getting a booklet and reading about each piece could be a really special experience. \nAfter finishing St Anne\u2014my first painting\u2014I knew that I wanted this series to be a community effort. I felt really alone in my journey, but knew it didn\u2019t have to be that way if I opened it up to other people. I shared the concept with some fellow artists and planned some collaborations. Those will be included in their own ways in updates and the show itself. But now, I want to include you! \nI know there are a lot of people who have been following my series, but wouldn\u2019t be in Knoxville for the opening. And I thought asking for community help on building my booklet would be a really meaningful way for me to bring the book into fruition. This way the book has a chance to be and those who can\u2019t make it to the show can experience it in these pages.\nRight now I\u2019m not sure when the show will even be happening due to some change in plans. Ideally it will be closer to the end of the year, but may not happen until next year. The book production and printing will take some time, a few months at least. But everything else will take just a couple of months. These are all things I\u2019ll be keeping everyone up to date with in my posts. \nMaking and printing this books feels like the necessary next step in this artistic journey and I\u2019m really excited to see where else it takes us. \nP.S. This campaign is a \u201dMake/100 project\u201d, because Kickstarter is hosting a larger community project this January where creators can launch projects that either have 100 of one unique, limited item, or capping it at 100 backers. *I* have only 100 reward slots for 100 backers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI imagined that local supporters could pick their booklets up at the show itself, but if the show doesn\u2019t happen for another year and the books are finished within three months of the campaign finishing\u2014assuming I make my goal\u2014then everyone will receive their books before the show takes place.\n\nBuilding the format of a book can be challenging and communicating with the Printer can be a whole thing, therefore it\u2019s possible the book won\u2019t be available until winter. But when they\u2019re finished, I\u2019ll send them ASAP, whenever that is.\n\nI did my best to set an attainable financial goal with realistic and affordable products that will still be quality. Kickstarter asks that you build in a percentage to set aside for taxes. So my goals reflect those things. I may have to pay some shipping out of pocket, or even taxes during tax season, but I\u2019m willing to risk those things, because I feel like this project is really important.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard directly from the monastery", "descp": "Receive a postcard of a surprise print from the series with a handwritten note!\nINCLUDES:\nPostcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Monastery zine", "descp": "Get yourself 1/50 limited copies of The Monestery zine.

We have now unlocked the Artificer, Ally, Mystic, Blood Hunter, Companion and Familiar cards (two each). Plus we have unlocked the Beast, Undead, Aberration, Ooze, Monstrosity, Plant, Giant, Fiend, The Elemental, The Construct, Celestial, the Fey, Humanoid, and Dragon monster cards (4 additional cards each).  Plus two bonus unlocks, one Developer card, and one Designer card. And a bonus new class we're creating to use the deck in 5E gameplay (2 more cards). (102 cards total)\n(Unlocked!) While each card will not have a unique design, each card will have color variations to make it easier to tell them apart. Additionally each monster card will have unique gold text in the spirit of tarot \"I OF ADVERSARIES\", \"II OF ADVERSARIES\", etc.\nThe deck also includes a beautiful matching 2-piece box with a luxurious matte finish, and an instruction booklet, so you can use the deck as an initiative system, conduct oracle readings for your friends or their characters in-game, or use the deck as an actual magic item that can be found in the game.\nWhat's not included? \nThis is not a traditional \"Rider-Waite\" Tarot deck. This means the Major and Minor Arcana are not written on the cards and there is no direct one-to-one conversion to every card in the traditional deck. \nInstead, we are including an original cartomancy guide to use the deck for divination (see below for details.) \nThe Adventurer's Tarot was originally envisioned as an alternative streamlined, initiative system. \n\n\nWe've playtested this system extensively in our home games and at conventions, and we think it's a great alternative to regular D&D initiative. While Dexterity players do take a minor hit, there are significant advantages to this system:\n Quicker Setup; instead of players yelling out numbers around the table to determine initiative, just setup the deck for the combat, shuffle the deck, and begin.\n It creates tension; no one knows who will go next in turn order. Will the second group of monsters go next, or will Alechin the cleric be able to cast a Healing Word before curtains close on Rogers the bard?\n More chaotic combat; combat order changes each round, better representing the chaos of combat.\n Player Engagement;  With the future of the turn unknown, players need to actively think about what their character will do if they go next, instead of spacing out until their turn. (Not that we've ever seen a player space out waiting for their turn to come up!)\nWhat about Lair Actions? The Alert feat? Non D&D Classes? We have special rules for all that, and more in our detailed rules which will be included with the deck. You can see our current draft of the rules here:\n\n\n\nThe Adventurer's Tarot Magic Item \nAdditionally, we will include printed rules for using the Adventurer's Tarot as a magic item in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. This item will function in a similar way to the infamous Deck of Many Things, but be less prone to causing major character changes, disastrous backfires, and campaign-shattering alterations.\nClick here for the Work In Progress Magic Item Rules\n\n\n\nUNLOCKED!\n\n Instagram \n Facebook \n\n\nFulfillment\nOur hard copy proof\nShortly after the Kickstarter ends, we will be sending you a link where you will be able to complete checkout for your backing. This will include the option to purchase additional Add-Ons. We have signed a contract with PledgeManager to provide our post-campaign pledge management.\nWe currently have a hard copy proof and a printer lined up for this deck which means we are ready to go to print. However, we have many new card and artwork stretch goals. Based on the number of stretch goals unlocked, there will likely be additional work for Brenda to create the artwork. If we determine that Brenda needs more time to complete the artwork, we will notify you, our backers, in a timely fashion with a new delivery date. \nWe delivered our last Kickstarter exactly on time, and we are planning to do so again with this one.\nShipping\nSince we are shipping a relatively small and lightweight product, we are able to charge a flat rate for shipping throughout the world.   The price for shipping is for the base deck of cards. \nThanks to the popularity of the Kickstarter with Europeans, we quickly realized we needed to provide EU-Friendly fulfillment. We have partnered with Spiral Galaxy Games based in the UK to provide us with EU-Friendly shipping.  \nWe also have Australia and New Zealand-friendly shipping provided by fulfillment partner Unicorn Games. \nProducts in the US will be either shipped USPS First Class or USPS Priority depending on the size. All non-US and non-AU/NZ international products will be shipped either USPS First Class International or USPS First Class Priority (for larger items.)\nAbout Weird Works\nWeird Works is a small, independent game studio that specializes in creating peculiar products for your tabletop RPGs. \nBrenda Ho (Designer & Illustrator)\nBrenda is a freelance graphic designer based in the beautiful & rainy Pacific Northwest, where she lives with her cats Duke and Lilith.

If that's the case, we plan on notifying our backers well ahead of the deadline (preferable shortly after the completion of the Kickstarter) with our new intended delivery date.\n\nAdditionally, we are heavily reliant on Brenda Ho to complete the artwork for the campaign.

Our four previous installments have established not only a fantastic precedent of killer collections, but literally invented the gold standard of anthology payouts, rewarding artists with nice, big bonuses when the project takes off.\nSmut Peddler Presents: Silver is...\nOur fifth Smut Peddler anthology,\nOur third FULL-COLOR anthology, and\nOur third themed anthology!\nAnd returning for a great, big ol' victory lap, this is another Smut Peddler Catch-Up Project!\nNot only can you grab Silver, but every other smutty anthology Iron Circus Comics has ever put out, at a GREAT BIG DISCOUNT!

Weaver\nRowan Woodcock\nScroll down a bit for some sneak-peeks of their work!\nSmut Peddler Presents: Silver has only one stretch goal: a cover enhancement at $25,000!  We really, REALLY want some foil on Mirjam L\u00f6fgren's amazing cover; no points for guessing which color we'll be going for. \nBut our stretch goals for Silver end there. Iron Circus was the first publisher to include Kickstarter-based bonuses as a part of their projects, and we're continuing that tradition of rewarding our creators with this project.\nThis pre-order event will determine the bonuses of our authors. That bonus is a $5.00 page rate increase every $5,000 the Kickstarter makes over goal. That means the more work an artist has put in, the more they stand to make. This is on top of the page rates they've already earned, and there's no cap on potential pay.\nPre-ordering Smut Peddler Presents: Silver directly benefits the creators and the work you love!\nWe love all our children equally, of course. But real talk? Smut Peddler Presents: Silver is easily one of the most beautiful anthologies we've put together to date. Check it out! \n\"William Wilson and the Man on a Mission,\" by E.K.

My name is Dawn and I am a natural science illustrator in Richmond, Virginia.\nAbout a year ago I stumbled upon The Deck of Many Things during a D&D campaign. This deck is a wondrous item in Dungeons & Dragons that contains 22 cards, each of which have a magical effect on the player. To use the Deck of Many Things the player must declare the number of cards they wish to draw, then randomly draw their cards and let fate take the wheel. \nThis deck really sparked my imagination, leading me to start drawing my own cards. For the past year the Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things has become my passion project. I wanted to create artwork that marries the magic of the fantasy world with natural science illustration. The artwork is completed, and I would love your help in bringing The Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things to life!\nShown: Sun, Moon, Star, Throne, Key, Knight, The Void, & Flames.\nShown: Skull, Ruin, Euryale, Rogue, Jester, Vizier, Comet, The Fates\nShown: Gem, Talons, Donjon, Idiot, Fool, Balance, & card back.\n DECK ADD-ON (+$20) \nYou can purchase additional Decks for your pledge by adjusting your pledge amount under the 'Manage your Pledge' Page. Add $20 for every additional Deck you wish to purchase.\nIf you do purchase an add-on please message me directly so I can make a note of the add-on on your pledge!\nPRINTS OF YOUR CHOICE \nTiers 3-6 allow you to choose the card you are getting a print of. If the campaign meets its funding goal you will receive a Kickstarter rewards survey, which is where you will specify which print you would like. You can see all 22 cards in the first three images on this page!\nMANUFACTURING\nFor the physical Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things I am partnering with PrintNinja to ensure the highest quality project possible. I also have trusted manufacturers lined up for the pins and art prints.\nThe majority of the funding will go towards the manufacturing costs, the rest will go towards packaging costs and Kickstarter fees. \nSHIPPING\nBelow are important things to note in regards to shipping The Deck & any other reward items to you:\n FREE SHIPPING IS INCLUDED FOR ALL US ORDERS. All orders will be sent First-Class via USPS.\n ANY INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FROM OUTSIDE THE US INCLUDE A SHIPPING FEE. The fee charged at checkout includes shipping and nothing more. Any insurance, import/customs fees, taxes, etc. are your responsibility. \n PROVIDE A VALID EMAIL. Reward surveys will be sent out at the completion of the campaign, so the sooner you respond with your address and preferences the sooner your reward can be mailed out to you.\n PROVIDE AN UP-TO-DATE ADRESS ON THE SURVEY. Please ensure that you provide the correct address on your backer survey, including your first and last name. An incorrect address can lead to shipping errors. \nMAKE SURE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IS CURRENT.\n STAY UPDATED.

You will journey to a small village filled with magical girls and other fantastical friends, where you are placed in charge of a run down cat caf\u00e9. Build up your caf\u00e9 by filling it with cute furniture, fun decorations, yummy pastries, and get it bustling with animals again!\nIn Calico, you play as a sweet magical cutie. There are two playable characters to choose from: Heartgirl and Flowergirl! \n Which Platforms?\nCalico will release on PC and Mac (steam included), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4~\n\nUnlike its inspirations, such as Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, there are no negative consequences.  Animals will not die, the shop will not close, and the crops will not rot.  Players are free to explore the joy of a heavily stylized world full of cuddly critters. \nCalico is meant to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The gameplay reflects that with a laid back, low stress creative environment to explore and play in.\nExplore the village to find cats and other animals, including raccoons, deer, dogs, turtles, red pandas, foxes, and many, many more cuties!\nThe player will encounter many animals in the world of Calico. Once befriended, you can name them, add them to your party, or send them to their new home at the caf\u00e9. Animals in your party will follow you everywhere you go and listen to your commands. The animals in your cafe will relax and play with any customers that pop in for a visit.\n All animals are interactive!\nAlong with adding animals to your party, Interact with cats and other animals by petting and playing! Some of the animal interactions in Calico will include playing with toys, dancing, cuddling, petting, carrying, lounging with, and pampering. There will even be special features, like placing animals on your head! Special creatures like koi fish will be able to be fed, and the birds would love to be given seeds!  \n We have big plans for the animals' personalities. Their AI will include things like:   \nHappiness, trust, and energy levels  \nHow active, lazy, or hungry they are  \nHow close they like to be to the player  \nDo they like being picked up?\nDo they listen to player commands? \nWhat other animals do they like as friends  \nWhat\u2019s their favorite toy?\nUnique actions exclusive to specific animals And more!\nFor the \u201cYour pet in the game\u201d Kickstarter tiers, we will ask you to describe your pet\u2019s personality and quirks so that their in-game version will properly capture their spirit! \nCalico takes place on a star-shaped island with 6 different environmental areas. In the middle is a heart shaped town where your caf\u00e9 resides!\nCalico is a cat caf\u00e9 in the middle of a small heart shaped town. For those unaware, a cat caf\u00e9 is a caf\u00e9 that includes cats that can be watched and played with. But animal caf\u00e9s are not limited to cats. Some areas have bunny caf\u00e9s, owl caf\u00e9s, or even raccoon caf\u00e9s!\nThis caf\u00e9 is open to all animals, and needs your care to become a welcoming cafe again!\nDecoration\n Your task in Calico is to bring the town's caf\u00e9 back to life again. This isn\u2019t just achieved by bringing in cats and animals alone, however \u2013 you can also decorate your caf\u00e9 with furniture and toys! We will have a full system that allows you to collect and arrange furniture, decorations, and toys. Some furniture is for the caf\u00e9\u2019s human visitors, while other furniture is meant for your animal friends (like cat trees, scratching posts, and dog beds, to name a few options!). \nYummy drinks and dessert in the caf\u00e9\n Create a wonderful caf\u00e9 by making yummy bakes goods and drinks for the townspeople! We will have a system in which you can create and display pastries for sale in the caf\u00e9 display cases, as well as create a drink menu. Some of the pastries and drinks will be customizable. For instance, the macaroons will have a surface on which you can paint designs~ \n\n Currency System\nWhile having goods on display in the town, residents of the town will be able to come by and purchase your goods and hang out in the caf\u00e9. This means you will gradually start making money. Things that you will be able to use money for include more furniture and decorations for your cafe, more toys for your animals, more available foods and drinks to make, and shopping around town! (Note: this is entirely optional!)\n In town will be multiple shops, including the potion shop. Autumn runs the potion shop at the top of the hill, in a giant moss terrarium. Give her a visit to get potions that can alter animals and the game around you! \n We wanted there to be no limits to how you could find happiness in Calico. Magic potions are a system that allow us to break the rules of what is possible and to find what would be most fun. \nHere\u2019s a taste of what\u2019s to come: the More-to-pet Potion allows the player to magically turn a single animal giant-sized! You can hang out with a giant animal, or even ride a giant cat! \nOr a red panda!\n\nAbout Funds\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise enough money that both Andrew and Kells can work on the game full time for the next year and a half.

We're making an album to fix it.\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow. \nYou can listen to our our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free! \n    We're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, three of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?  \nABOUT THE ALBUM: \n The time since our last album has been strange! For the first time since our inception, the Doubleclicks took a year-long break from performing and recording to live \"real lives.\" We even got day jobs for a minute there! Did you all know that there are entire groups of people in the world who live their lives OFF of the Internet? It's WILD. \n         Our break taught us a whole lot! One of the things we learned is that we are pretty bad at day jobs. And also, reality is pretty cool. And also, the Internet has ruined a lot of stuff. We learned that, then we came back together to write the longest, realest and funniest Doubleclicks album yet. We're also going to bring this big rad album on tour - even to Europe!\n         \"The Book Was Better\" is about a lot of things: gender, dogs, cats, anxiety, Halloween, and pizza are some of the things. But the big theme is this: We spend too much time yelling on the Internet, and we should all try something else. Certainly we can't stop using the Internet, that would be ridiculous. But just a tiny break sometimes, yeah \u2014 that's probably good. Go to a museum. Go roller skating and break your arm. Try to throw a birthday party and don't cancel it when you get overwhelmed at the very idea of human interaction. \nIt's a comedy album. \n         Tracklist:\n Clifford the Big Red Dog \u2014 body image and a dog\n Ode to a Summer Retail Job \u2014 a song about wet money \n Afterparty for One \u2014 an ode to frozen pizza \n Boundaries \u2014 a song about Laser's cat, Marzipan. She's perfect.\n Something I Can Hold \u2014 a song about the House on The Rock \n We're All Gonna Die \u2014 this one's a lot of fun!\n Happy Birthday, Nobody Hates You \u2014 a celebration for the anxious\n Nobody gets it \u2014 A Halloween song \n I'm Winning \u2014 a song about being genderqueer or maybe videogames\n Brand New Year \u2014 a song about the best-laid plans\n I Don't Wanna \u2014 no!\n The Ballad of Millie Rosa Jane \u2014 a sea shanty?\n Panic \u2014it's gonna be ok\n Check out this video for our new song \"I'm Winning\" \u2014 animated by a group of 16 incredible queer artists!  \nThis album is made with all ages in mind \u2014 there are no swears, but also it's not like, \"just for kids.\" It's the music we like, and it's a lot happier and funnier than the last record.\n  The Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that - and this is huge - is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n         We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album, to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins, to master and mix the music, to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores, and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n         We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful! \nChart of project costs\n In exchange for your pledge, we have some rad stuff you can get. \nPINS!\nYou spoke and we listened \u2014 you love enamel pins, and you want one of our little featherless dinosaur friend. PLUS, we'll have a new badge-style pin from a VERY EXCITING ARTIST as well, the design will be released very soon! If you order a pin, you will be able to choose from these options!  \n\nSHIRT!\nThis new Doubleclicks t-shirt design will be available in \"unisex\" (S-4XL) and \"ladies\" cuts (S-4XL) and for the first time, this Doubleclicks shirt will also be available in youth sizes (XS-XL)!   \nShirt Design by Natalie Metzger\n \nREALITY BOX\nWhen you first open this box, you'll see a little pouch to put your phone in. Set it aside and start to enjoy this immersive \"real world\" experience. We bring you to a land... before constantly refreshing twitter and arguing on facebook and getting group texts and work emails 24/7. This is an entire (approximately 10\" x 8\" x 4\") box of activities, gifts and fun stuff that you can appreciate without your phone.\n         The box will include: the Doubleclicks-designed \"reality book\" of activities and puzzles (see below), a way to listen to a Doubleclicks song without any devices, and more! You'll be able to make something, solve some puzzles, play a game, learn a new skill, send a letter, and give a gift. There will be a rock, some string, and some exclusive Doubleclicks merch. We are extremely excited about this reward. \nREWARD NOTE: anyone who backs at the \"reality box\" level (or above) will get both enamel pins, a signed CD, and a shirt or tote. This isn't what it says in the reward level, and though we can't change the text of the reward level, it is TRUE. At the \"two boxes\" level, backers will get *two* shirts and two sets of both pins. \nREALITY BOOK\nLove reality, but hate boxes? This custom Doubleclicks \"field notes\"-style notebook will be chock-full of reality-based activities. Use this word search and find all of the neat, phone-free hobbies you could experiment with! Get some tips about crafting and photography! Read some aphorisms and affirmations! Play a game! Does the whole thing add up to a big puzzle? You bet it does! \n ADD-ONS\n  Don't see the combination of items you're looking for? Don't worry - you'll be able to buy \"add-ons.\" That means, after this Kickstarter ends, you can add extra CDs, t-shirts, books and pins to your order. If your level only includes one pin and you want to get the other one, you can! If your whole family needs t-shirts, you can get them! You don't need to do anything now in order to do that. The only thing that will not be available as an add-on is the D&D game. \n We have been blessed with a whole bunch people who help us every day to live our arty crowdfunded lifestyle. Thank you all so very very much. Some specific shout-outs: Thank you Mom and Dad for your support! Thank you Kim Newmoney for all these rad new band photos!

Perfectly scaled for roleplaying, the PVC miniatures come fully pre-assembled and ready to paint and play right out the box.\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed roleplaying game set in Exandria, which is the world created by veteran voice actor and Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer. Each week, Matthew leads his friends (also fellow voice actors!) on epic adventures.  \nThe first Critical Role campaign centered on the ragtag group of heroes in Tal'Dorei known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot, the Gnome Cleric, Keyleth, the Half-Elf Druid, Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo, the Human Gunslinger, Grog Strongjaw, the Goliath Barbarian, Scanlan Shorthalt the Gnome Bard, Taryon \u201cTary\u201d Darrington, the Human Artificer, Vex\u2019ahlia (and her animal companion, a bear named Trinket), the Half-Elf Ranger and Vax\u2019ildan, the Half-Elf Rogue. The first campaign ended in November 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nCritical Role is now in its second campaign, in which the Mighty Nein begin their adventures together in Wildemount. The Mighty Nein consists of Yasha, the Aasimar Barbarian, Beauregard, the Human Monk, Mollymauk Tealeaf, the Tiefling Blood Hunter, Fjord, the Half-Orc Warlock, Nott the Brave, the Goblin Rogue, Jester, the Tiefling Cleric, and Caleb Widogast, the Human Wizard. Shak\u00e4ste, a human cleric, has proven himself to be a trusted ally of the Mighty Nein.\nVox Machina Party\nFrom Tal\u2019Dorei they hail. Whether cleansing the underdark of an aberrant scourge or preventing a would-be god from destroying the globe, this motley troupe of wayward souls - Keyleth, Vax'ildan, Vex\u2019ahlia (and Trinket!), Grog, Scanlan, Percy & Pike - are the greatest heroes the world of Exandria has ever seen.\nMighty Nein Party\nFjord, Beau, Caleb, Nott, Jester, Mollymauk, Yasha, and their ally Shak\u00e4ste... names that breed fear into the hearts of Wildemount\u2019s foulest foes. On a mission for fortune and glory, these fledgling adventurers may one day be the saviors of the Dwendalian Empire - if they can outrun the shadows of their storied pasts.\nCRITTERS PLEDGE $60/\u00a345\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter are brand new to crowd-funding. Which means we took the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more for the initial offering than they strictly need to and then \u2018bump\u2019 up the perceived value through stretch goals and other complicated ideas like that\u2026it can end up being very daunting to work out what pledge levels go with what and how much you need to commit etc. \nSo to avoid this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have simply given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price. This means that pledge level already includes all the Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals will be available during the campaign. What you see, is what you get...simple! \nHowever, the world of Exandria is a rich and detailed place with many wonderful characters worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, this is just the beginning of this journey for all of us...and don't forget, we're all ridiculously excited about this project and working hand in hand with CR over the coming years to bring the for world of Tal'dorei to your homes. And hey, who knows what random encounters might happen over the course of the KS campaign. \nSo just one question remains: How do you want to do this?\nCaleb Widogast and Frumpkin\nAfter investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. \nKickstarter Exclusive miniatures\nEvery highly-detailed mini is a fully pre-assembled PVC model, ready to paint and play straight out the box.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \n\u2022 United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\n\u2022 USA (US backers)\n\u2022 Canada (Canada backers)\n\u2022 Germany (EU backers)\n\u2022 China (Asia Pacific backers)\n\u2022 Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the sets (2kg volumetric weight).

Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a36-\u00a313 \n\u2022 USA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a317-20 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \n\u2022 CANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \n\u2022 EUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a320-\u00a330 to non-EU countries. \n\u2022 LATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \n\u2022 ASIA: \u00a315-\u00a325 to most countries.\n\u2022 OCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia and New Zealand. \n\u2022 AFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends \n\u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n\u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n\u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n\u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n\u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight. \n\u2022 2-5 Weeks \u2013 China begins packing and shipping Asian hub orders. \n\u2022 6-8 Weeks \u2013 UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping to backers \n\u2022 9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks. \n\u2022 13+ Weeks \u2013 UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders.\nLate confirmation orders and customer service requests for missing/broken items are dealt with via support@steamforged.com.

You\u2019ll watch the attraction between them grow as you play out scenes, taking turns describing what your character says and does. Some of the things you\u2019ll want your character to do are going to increase that attraction\u2014and when that happens, you are going to pull a brick out from an increasingly shaky tower and place it on the top.\nSara Williamson and Joshua Yearsley hoping for one last moment together as two xenobotanists on an unknown planet.\nIf the tower falls, your characters act on their feelings! You decide what happens; the rules will tell you what that means. How many bricks you've pulled will help determine if your love is doomed, triumphant, or something in-between.\nOf course, that tower may never fall. If you make it through the final scene and the tower is still standing, the character never act on their feelings. Sometimes that's the right thing to do. \nStar Crossed takes about two hours to play. You'll need the rules, the cards, some character sheets and a couple pencils. And a tower of bricks, of course.\nEric Mersmann trying to contain his feelings for an undying creature of the night.\n\u201cThe stories are sweet, sad, and sexy as hell.

Don't tell Jesus!\nWhat is Dumbing of Age? It's a webcomic you can find on the Internet, and it's about freshmen entering college. It stars Joyce, a fundamentalist Christian who was previously homeschooled, and her unlikely new friend Dorothy, an atheist who wants to be President. They're surrounded by a varied cast of fully-realized characters, such as Billie, the alcoholic ex-cheerleader with a Resident Assistant problem(?), and Amber, the Internet shut-in who solves her rage issues by dressing up like a superhero and fighting crime. Oh, right, and Joyce's childhood best friend, that unflappable smartass Becky, is hiding out from her jerkbutt dad 'cuz she was caught smooching her roommate!\nRuth and Billie continue to be assholes in love.\nThis book would collect \"Year Six,\" spanning the four storylines that start on August 31, 2015 and complete on September 3, 2016. This includes new commentary, behind-the-scenes artwork, and new character designs into an 228-page tome with luxurious glossy paper all bound up into a sturdy presentation. Seriously, these books are gorgeous. Sometimes when we get solicitors I whip out a book to show them how pretty it is.\nAnd there will be a foreword by Jeph Jacques!  \nIn addition to the year of comics from the DumbingOfAge.com website, the book also includes 24 bonus comics that were originally created exclusively for the Dumbing of Age Patreon!  \nThere are also a few pages of bonus material including unused strips and alternate punchlines!\nTWENTY-FOUR strips not published previously on DumbingOfAge.com, like this one, are included!\nTo print 2000 copies of this first book at over $8 apiece, I'll need to raise approximately $17,000 to afford the printing costs. Add Kickstarter fees and taxes (oof) and the like, and that means I'll have to raise approximately $24,000 total. So that's the number on the board!\nFour years ago I did stretch goals to unlock website updates for Saturday and Sunday. Some of you thought updating 365 days a year would destroy me. Well, it did not!  IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. And so let's keep that going. Stretch goals are in place to elongate those Saturday and Sunday updates for another year. Otherwise Saturday updates end on May 10 and Sunday updates end on May 30.\nIn Book 6, watch Amazi-Girl try to stop Becky's dad from kidnapping her! Seriously, it's a wild ride.\nMore about stretch goals: Last two years I did die-cut character magnets, and that was pretty popular! And so I'm gonna do more, right? Obviously. We're going to do them similarly to last time, as well, by unlocking some pledges for additional characters as we rise in pledges. Ultimately, we will unlock a magnet that everyone who orders physical goods will receive if we reach a certain point!\nA helpful illustration of what magnets look like on a refrigerator.\n So, at $50k, I will send 2\"x4\" Becky die-cut character magnets to everybody who ordered snail-mailable goods. If you ordered any number of real made-of-paper books, you'll get a Becky character magnet with your order! (Sorry, folks who pledge only for the PDF, but there are not envelopes for PDFs in which to put magnets!)\nBut in the meantime, we'll start off with some pledge tiers of character magnets that you can choose from! We got Jocelyne, we got Carla, and we've got both Jocelyne and Carla together! Plus, we have a pledge level where you'll get every single magnet unlocked by the end of this Kickstarter.  \nLet's list these stretch goals all list-like: \n$24K DOA BOOK 6 <--- FUNDED!\n$30K LESLIE AND ROBIN MAGNETS <--- FUNDED\n$34,569 RAPTOR ATTACK DINA MAGNET <--- And that's when the stretch goal comes. Not from the front, but from the side.\n$35K SATURDAY AND SUNDAY UPDATES CONTINUE <--- FUNDED!\n$40K DEXTER AND MONKEY MASTER MAGNETS <---FUNDED\n$44,446K FOOLS!  A GALASSO MAGNET APPEARS!\n$45K I WILL SHOW PLEDGERS A YET-TO-BE-PUBLISHED STRIP FROM...

For $100, $150, and $300, you can get a digital commission piece of artwork of one, two, or two characters totally making out, respectively! Each is at least 6\" long in some dimension, and will be sent to you in TIF and a smaller PNG form, the former of which you can get printed and framed if you like. Each one is unique, even if all of you ask for the same character! At the $300 makeouts commission pledge level, you also get one each of all the magnets unlocked by the end of the Kickstarter.\nLESLIE AND ROBIN MAGNET PLEDGE LEVELS UNLOCKED\n  RAPTOR ATTACK DINA MAGNET sudden dinosaur rampage\n  DEXTER AND MONKEY MASTER MAGNETS UNLOCKED\n  FOOLS!

I gotta get books produced and shipped from across the globe to me! And then I gotta personally mail over a thousand of these books and their rewards to you! And every year the number of you who pledge increases in size. That's both good and intimidating! But I'm pretty sure I can do it. This is my SEVENTH time! I am basically a machine at this by now.\n\nThe only wrinkle these days is my two baby kids! Despite them, I did manage to get all of my Book Five pledges mailed out in time last year, but I also had, like, months more time to do so. (The books arrived WAY earlier than I expected.) But, like, the kids still exist, so, um, who knows how they'll affect my speed in mailing out books and stuff this year. That's the only ongoing \"risk and challenge\" I can think of.

The print will be delivered with rewards from our campaign, around June or October of 2017 (depending on your reward tier).   \nAnnouncing our First Stretch GOAL: $28,000!

Our list of exciting creators includes Sally Jane Thompson (The Ruby Equation), Cecil Castellucci (Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure), Sarah Winifred Searles (Ruined), Irene Koh (Legend of Korra), Suzana Harcum & Owen White (Tripping Over You), and Julia Hutchinson; all of whom are creating FRESH stories about interracial and LGBTQ relationships.\nCheck out these intriguing stories!\nWalk It Off by Suzana Harcum and Owen White features Kat Drescher and Penny O'Neil who are eager to take their first holiday together after graduation, and counting on a grand romantic get-away to temporarily put off joining the real world and entering the workforce. They're not as prepared as they thought they were, however, when said holiday takes an unexpected turn\u2014 and the real world finds them first!\nWalk It Off - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature the first 60 pages of this three-part story that will continue in future volumes.\n One Lucky Bride by Julia Hutchinson is a retelling of Buster Keaton's 1925 silent film \"Seven Chances\" in which Sara, a young entrepreneur on the verge of bankruptcy, discovers she is heir to a distant relative's fortune. The catch? She has to get married by 7:00 PM to collect the inheritance!\nOne Lucky Bride - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature this 40 page story.\n  Under the Oak Trees by Sally Jane Thompson is a country mouse/city mouse romance that asks the question: Do different lives and different temperaments mean more pain than a relationship is worth?\nUnder the Oak Trees - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature the first 60 pages of this three-part story that will continue in future volumes.\nThe Only One by Cecil Castellucci, Sarah Winifred Searle, and Irene Koh is a tale of belated love that tells of a decades-spanning series of missed-connections that eventually lead to a cosmic love connection.\nThe Only One - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature this 10 page story.\nWith these talented creators on board, FRESH ROMANCE VOLUME 2 promises to delight and surprise! \nTell me more about VERONA!\nCover Art by Renae de Liz and Ray Dillon!\nWritten by director and screenwriter Emily Dell, VERONA is a story of violence, passion, and young love. Set in modern-day Verona, the Montoyas and Capulets are warring assassin clans, serving contracts for Henrys, Hamlets and MacBeths. When Jo Capulet and Roman Montoya are thrown together after a mission gone wrong, they see in each other a chance for a new life, even if it means destroying everyone in their path.\nThe gorgeous art was a collaboration between Mollie Helms and Bryndon Everett, with colors by Kennedy Cooke Garza and Eddie Jensen.\nVERONA is the first original graphic novel under the \"Fresh Romance Presents\" banner and stands at 160-pages. VERONA is currently being shipped to us for fulfillment. \nHow will you deliver my digital comics to me?\nFRESH ROMANCE is adopting a seasonal calendar and will be releasing digital single issues in the Spring and Summer.

You'll receive a code to download it directly from the emetcomics.com website on the day it comes out.   \nWondering what happened to the mysterious Fresh Romance Issue #8?

Purchased it already? Email us and we'll give you a free code to download it again! We want you to be happy!\nWondering why The Only One isn't included in the digital release schedule?

We are two sisters who make music on the Internet. We like dinosaurs, cats and self-esteem. One YouTube commenter said it best when she called us \"weird, charming, and heart-warming in a bizarre and yet adorable way.\" We tour all year, play at lots of conventions, host monthly online shows, release videos on YouTube through our Patreon campaign, and write songs. Many many songs. (Stream our last album for free!)\nWe've been on NPR, played a game on TableTop, had two of our albums chart on Billboard, and toured the US, Canada, and Australia! But don't take our word for it...\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret, we love The Doubleclicks\u201d \u2013 i09 \n\u201cOur favorite nerdrocking cello heroes\u201d \u2013 BoingBoing \n\u201cEveryone with a heart should find something to love in the Doubleclicks\u201d \u2013 Portland Mercury \nOur music is influenced by the lyric-focused punk-infused music of They Might Be Giants, the honest rawness of the Dresden Dolls, and the DIY aesthetic of Kimya Dawson, with a dash of nerdy thrown in. Our goal is to represent a positive, empowering and feminist voice inside nerd and online communities... through song!\nNice to meet you! We are asking for your help to make a new album.\n  UPDATE: Our project has reached its initial goal, so now we are making bigger plans!\n   \"Love Problems\" is the 5th Doubleclicks album, and the most personal. The stories on this album come from a lot of places. From science news, from our tour last summer and our trips to many planetariums, from finally going back to therapy, from late nights with comedians, from high school mistakes, from the women who accidentally gave out my e-mail to her son's boy scout troop, and of course, ripped from today's headlines. The songs tell the story of trying to be strong when you don't feel strong, and finding an identity in your gender. The songs exist to make us, and you, feel better, and to help us all find the energy to make a difference.\nTracks will include:\nLord Of The Rings \u2014 \"There are songs I'll never listen to again, but you can't take all the things that make me the way I've always been.\"\nSensitive Badass \u2014 \"You have the strength and though all of the scars may last, you can be sensitive and still a badass.\" \nWomen Know Math \u2014 \"I am a woman, and I'm doing it right...no matter what I do.\" \nBig Bang \u2014 \"We've grown apart, but babe, since the Big Bang, so has everything.\"\nExtra Gin \u2014 \"I like comics and spaceships and cats, and I'm barely holding the panic in.\"\n(and at least six more)\nThe album will be produced by the Doubleclicks (like our last album, President Snakes), but we are scaling up by bringing in a few guests to help us with musical ideas and performance! \n$38,000: Pixel Art Video: UNLOCKED!\nAt $38,000, we're able to add an amazing animated video by James Brooks to this Kickstarter project! The song \"Big Bang\" is a song about a couple \"growing apart,\" just like the universe started growing apart after the Big Bang. The video will be about a relationship on a SPACESHIP! The concept is amazing, and the final version will look like this:\n$44,000 \u2014 Live Drums: UNLOCKED!\nWe'll add live drums! We have just received a final quote from an amazing drummer down in LA who has a rad style and his own studio, and is willing to add an wonderful, organic rhythm section to this album. I hope we can do it, because it will add some extremely great depth to these songs. More information in this update. \n$47,000 \u2014 You Should Write A Song About That: UNLOCKED\nWe have been developing a project called \"You Should Write A Song About That,\" in which a smart and entertaining person tells us about something that we should write a song about, and then we write a song about it! At this level, we will dedicate time to making 5 \"episodes\" of this show - including recorded interviews & songs released on the project's podcast feed. Guests will include authors, game developers, and science buffs. We use this project to write about important things which we need an outside perspective to help us express! More information coming in an update, of course!\n1,300 backers \u2014 New Sticker for all Sticker Backers! - UNLOCKED!\nIf we get 1,300 or more folks backing this project, even at $1 each, we will be able to add a 6th sticker to the currently 5-sticker pack! The design will be of a dinosaur! You can stick Doubleclicks stuff EVERYWHERE!\nsticker design by Natalie Metzger!\n$60,000 \u2014 President Snakes Video Musical - UNLOCKED!\nIf we get to this level we will produce the PRESIDENT SNAKES MUSICAL. President Snakes is a character we invented\u20145 snakes in a pantsuit, pretending to be a person, running for President. She and her campaign team\u2014optimistic campaign manager Danny and skeptical media guru Chanda\u2014face many obstacles, but they always believe, and they always persevere. \nWe have written a lot of this musical, both words and music, beyond the two songs that were on our last album. This musical will be 30 to 45 minutes in length. We'd love to finish it up and share it with you, and, if we hit this goal, we will do this by staging the musical in a relatively low-fi but very rad recorded \"youtube-style\" format. There will be actors, costumes, funny words, and great songs. We have a vision for this that is very adorable and exciting, and with your help, we can make it happen!\nAt 2,000 backers, we will also make a \"cast recording\" and distribute it as a digital EP to all the backers on this project!\nThe Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded operation. With no external label, agent, or manager, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that - and this is huge - is that there is nothing between us. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. \nWe need your help to pay our collaborators and our studio rent, to produce CDs, shirts, merchandise, and promotional items for the album, to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins, to master and mix the music, to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores, and to generally \"create something from nothing.\"\nWe thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful!\nThanks to input from some wonderful supporters and the collaboration of wonderful artists, this project has some wonderful rewards, including our first ENAMEL PINS, STICKER SETS, and some wonderful limited-edition CROSS STITCH ART.\nTHE ALBUM:\nDigital downloads of the album will delivered to Kickstarter backers a day or more before the rest of the world gets it. Most likely, the album will reach you via a download code to the website Bandcamp, where you can download the album in mp3, FLAC, wav, or a number of other nerdy formats. Physical CDs will come in eco-friendly packaging. \nENAMEL PINS:\nWe are very excited to be printing our first enamel pins! They will make an excellent addition to any cool nerd's lapel, jacket, bag, lanyard, or vest.\nAt any level where you get one enamel pin, you will be able to CHOOSE (in the survey after the Kickstarter) whether you want a \"Sensitive Badass\" pin or a \"Women Know Math\" pin. Some levels include both enamel pins.\n\"Women Know Math\" pins are designed by Marlowe Dobbe and measure 1.5\" wide. \"Sensitive Badass\" pins are designed by Meghan Murphy (@kawaiinot) and will be approximately 1.5\" tall\u2014measurement not final. \nSTICKERS:\nThe 5-piece Doubleclicks sticker set will include die-cut vinyl stickers suitable for affixing to your laptop, trapper keeper, or car bumper. Stickers will be on average 3\" square. The stickers will include the following designs: Cats, Dimetrodon, Tiny Paper Elephant, \"Sensitive Badass,\" and The Doubleclicks.\nThese will be created by a wonderful group of artists: Leigh Lahav, Natalie Metzger, Marlowe Dobbe, and Meghan Murphy.\nSHIRT/TOTE:\nWe will be commissioning a new, \"Love Problems\"-specific shirt and tote design from the incredible Natalie Metzger!\nShirts and totes will be hand-screen-printed here in Portland, Oregon. Shirts will be soft and comfortable, will be available in sizes Ladies Small-2XL (size chart) and Unisex Small-4XL (size chart). Don't like shirts? You can get the same design on a jumbo, sturdy eco-conscious tote bag! \nUSB DRIVE:\nDoubleclicks USB drives contain our up-until-now entire discography in both wav and mp3 form, as well as videos, live tracks, and a digital copy of our coloring book. The drive can also be emptied off and used as just a regular ol' 4 GB jump drive, which is pretty neat, too.\nUSB Drives can also be purchased by themselves anytime from our online store!\nHATS!:\nIncredible crafter and artist LeeAnne Minnick is creating 10 unique hand-made knit hats for this Kickstarter with a Doubleclicks-inspired \"Sensitive Badass\" design. Final hats will be made of Merino Wool in a purple and white design. This says \"I'm sensitive, I'm a badass, and my head is warm!\"\nHat mock-up: final yarn will be \"woolier\" and hat pattern may change slightly\nCROSS STITCH ART:\nWomen Know Math artist Alyshondra Stay Meacham is creating a limited run of 10 Doubleclicks-inspired cross stitch pieces. If you back at this level, you can choose from the following four lyrics: \"I love you like a burrito,\" \"You're not a quitter,\" \"Sensitive Badass,\" and \"Rawr, Velociraptor.\" \nEach piece of art will be hand-stitched, will measure 5\"x7,\" and will be framed. \nConcept art\nRINGTONES:\nThe Doubleclicks will record a small batch of custom ringtone songs for backers at this level! You will be given a survey which asks you to pick what you want the ringtone for (the phone is ringing / it's time to wake up / my food timer went off / I need motivation ) and what your name is, and we will record custom lyrics for you over our 20-second exclusive-to-this-project ringtone track! Will the ringtone track have cat keyboard? OF COURSE IT WILL!\nThe Cat Cube!\nAll-star Doubleclicks fan and crafter extraordinaire Lauren, aka @flailsquared, has designed an exclusive Doubleclicks-themed Cat Cube! What is a Cat Cube, you ask? It's this!\nIt's a cat bed, for cats!\nThe Doubleclicks cat cube has a special \"Love You Like A Burrito\"-themed design! The cube measures 17\" on all sides and is made from Blizzard fleece and 1\" hypoallergenic, pet rated HD36-R foam. It's a perfect love-filled room for your cat or other animal.\nInside the cube says \"I love you like a burrito!\"\nThe Very Special Box:\nThis is a new reward and we are VERY excited about it. We are going to fill a cardboard box with some special gifts just for you, based on the things we like to do. \nAngela likes painting (and she's not terrible.) She'll paint you a simple, colorful, beautiful cartoony, unique acrylic painting on a small square canvas. If you have a specific thing you want a picture of, get in touch on Twitter or in a Kickstarter message and she'll tell you whether she can make that happen.\nAngela's paintings look like this. She will paint you a picture of one thing.\nAubrey loves stickers. She's in a sticker club. She will write you an inspirational note and cover it with stickers. \nAubrey's sticker cards make a great point.\nWe have a lot of dinosaurs, and they need homes. We will give you one of our dinosaur figures, and also give it a name and a personality so you know how to take care of it.\nBecause you care, we will send you a postcard from the studio telling you how the day is going, good or bad.\nPlus, you'll be thanked in the album's liner notes for being such a big supporter!\nWe anticipate a couple of questions about this project.\n1. WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? We know we have lots of wonderful family and children supporters, and the themes on this album, though universal, aren't as kid-accessible as dinosaurs and meow sounds. Please know that we love you and we will continue making more kid-friendly music - this project is just the one that came first. The album MAY have a couple swear words on it (it will definitely have the word 'badass'). \n2. WHEN DID YOU GET POLITICAL? STICK TO THE MUSIC, GIRLS! (Yes, people say this to us). We were never \"not political,\" you were just better at selective listening. Please continue selectively listening and give us your money, or go away. We are not going to stop talking about our feelings and what we think is right. That's the whole darn point. And\u2014by the way\u2014silence is political, too. Silence is a statement of approval of establishment behavior. No, thank you. \n3. HOW ARE YOU DOING? Thank you for asking. We're doing ok. It can feel pretty hopeless right now, but we are not going to stop making art. I (Angela) actually wrote a little essay about \"making art when things seem hopeless,\" and that made me feel a little bit better.\nWe have some people to thank for this project already: Thank you to our Patreon supporters, who have sponsored our music videos and our shows as we have been writing the songs for this album over the last two years! Thank you to the 50 artists who illustrated our \"Women Know Math\" video! Thank you to our friends Max Temkin, Christopher Badell, and Mike Selinker who gave us valuable feedback on this project, and Elisabeth Allie and Melissa Harris who helped us spread the word. Thank you to Eli McDonald for creating our header artwork, and Jessie Kirk for taking the header photo. Thank you to our families for their support as we stress out about this, to Rich Malena, Justin Turner, Susan Webber, Stephen Webber, and all of you.

She dreams of breaking out of suburbia and her artistic rut, but she has a lot of self-discovery to do before that happens. The comic follows her funny misadventures as she learns that maybe these (sometimes) friendly felines are just what she needs to get her life on track.\nWe've been posting Finding Molly as a free webcomic since January, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We're stunned by how much our readers love Molly and her gang of cats and artists, and we're ready to take the next step and print the entire book!\nWant to read the comic before you buy? Head over to our Tumblr and see what you think!\nWho made the comic?\nJustine Prado (writer): Justine is a Los Angeles-based feature and television screenwriter, playwright, activist, and cat lady.

I've completed many other comics in that time, like my autobiography with time travel, We Can Fix It, and several stories for the critically acclaimed Smut Peddler erotic comics anthology. Chester holds a very special place in my heart, which is why I think it deserves to be collected in the best book possible. The first Chester 5000 book was published by Top Shelf and they did a gorgeous job. I want the second book to be just as great, maybe even better, that's why I've come to Kickstarter and to you!\nThe first volume told the story of Pricilla, a Victorian woman with needs, who falls in love with Chester, a robot made by her husband, Robert. It's a romance with sci fi elements about empowering women's desire. The book was critically acclaimed and pages from it have been featured at the Museum of Sex in NYC.\nThe second chapter of Chester, Isabelle and George, continues the adventure and explores the character's first meetings. It follows Isabelle, a lonely orphan, reprimanded at every turn by her strict matron, and George, a promising inventor on the cusp of a brilliant invention. It's a romance with dramatic twists about secret desire, industrial corruption, and the oppressive social prisons that get in the way of love.\nThe book will be hard cover, 175 pages. We've also got some great rewards like sexy ebooks, tote bags, stickers, and enamel pins. I'm working with the lovely, experienced people at Make That Thing for this campaign, so they'll handle order and reward fulfillment.\nLet's make this book the best it can be.

Inspired by some of our favorite films, this world began to grow; becoming populated, and developing a rich history. It began to burst with stories to tell. So, here we are, setting out to tell one. We are shooting for a 30-40 minute film.\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?   \nWhile we're waiting on our fundraising our whole team is hard at work creating props, weapons, and costumes. As well as starting construction on the speeder and robot with materials we already have.

Electronics for our robot character, a higher quality camera, lighting equipment, along with things like food and gas during our production weeks. \n WHAT ARE YOUR STRETCH GOALS?\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $15,000 we will be able to afford more film festival entries, and purchase even better equipment.

The planned ship date is in November, perfect timing to give it as a Christmas gift!\nWoo Hoo, a new BONUS AWARD! Click here to listen to some of the songs that are part of this album!\nA brand new pledge level! Includes a hard cover copy of The Great Cheese Squeeze children's picture book! See more about the book HERE.\nGet a second copy: Folks have been asking for an easy way to get an extra copy of the book. Just add $35 to any pledge level and you'll get an additional copy of the book!\nYay! Now all pledges $35 and above will get a digital copy of the super fun picture book I did with Keith Lango, The Great Cheese Squeeze! The ibook version even has wonderful narration by Elizabeth Smith. Tell all your friends and pets!\nNow check out these awesome rewards!\nI've always loved SCRATCH AND SNIFF, and Animal Gas is the PERFECT subject matter for this. Each character in Animal Gas has his or her own disSTINK personality and they try an convince each other that their toots smell great. There are lots of delightful smells in the book along with some really funny bad smells.\nAnimal Gas is also a great book for reluctant readers. The funny smells and the silly rhyming verses will have both children and adults giggling as they read and sniff. I previewed Animal Gas to a large local elementary school here in Indiana and both the kids and the teachers were roaring with laughter.\nSelf publishing a picture book is not cheap to begin with, but it's even more expensive for SCRATCH AND SNIFF books. But I've found a company that specializes in scented printing and they do incredible work. I really think it's worth it. Their Rub4Scent technology is of a very high quality.\nPrinting a hardcover scratch and sniff book costs 2-3 times as much as printing a softcover non-scratch and sniff book. But I feel that the cost is worth it. I designed the book to work with scented printing and scratch and sniff smells bring a whole new level of experience and unique interactivity and fun to the book.\nIn order to bring the cost of the book down to a more affordable level I have to have a minimum of 750 copies made. If I exceed my fundraising goal, I will be able to order even more copies and bring the cost per book down. And then I'll be able to offer some awesome bonus rewards too!\nIn addition to the hardcover SCRATCH AND SNIFF version I'm also creating a super fun ibook and epub version which will feature realistic sound effects and narration. Development costs for this adds to the amount I need to raise too, but again, I've designed the book for this format as well and it's just begging for sound!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause I'm offering the book in several different formats, making sure that I can get them all done will be a priority. Fortunately I have all the art finished for the book and will just need to get it to the printer. I have identified the printing company that I will be working with as well. \n\nI have also been illustrating books for a living for a long time, so I have a lot of experience preparing digital illustration files for print, etc. \n\nI have most of the assets for the ibook version finished, and I've built ibooks in the past, so I'm very excited to make that as well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "HUGE Post Valentines Animal Gas Sale!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Animal Gas Reviews", "update_content": "Animal Gas is now up on Amazon and Goodreads!

Formed from a grass roots movement of folks living communally and pouring into a small town with a very dark history, we respond by making music that is about hope and community. \nIn the last three years we\u2019ve been able to record and release 3 albums, ALL are available for FREE download via BandCamp. Besides playing at some awesome venues in the Midwest, J & the D continues to perform live for non-for-profit organizations, charity fundraisers, and inmates incarcerated in state penitentiaries. We are about to take on our biggest recording adventure yet, and need YOUR HELP! Projects description: This album will look at isolation vs. relationship and youth vs. adulthood. Can we wander our journey together? Is it na\u00efve to hope that young love can remain young even when we grow older? These are a few of the questions these new songs wrestle with. What can you expect of the sound? We hope it will be compared to My Morning Jacket, Band of Horses, or Lord Huron. For you ol\u2019 timers though we will accept The Beatles\u2026this time. \nThe money you donate is going entirely to the album. The largest portion is in Production costs, i.e. the Recording, Mixing, and Mastering of 10 songs, and then about 23% is left for Promotion, this cost includes the vinyl and cd pressing. None of this money is going into our pockets. If we raise more than our goal is set at we will use it to pour further into this album and will make a statement via our website as to what the overflow funds went to. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible.\nTo learn more about J & the D, please visit our website at: www.jamesandthedrifters.com\nThe Handmade Cigar Box-\nThe Vinyl- \nThe Tee- ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA couple of the risks and challenges for this project is the time and ability to get it all done in the 5 days we are scheduled to record. That's right, 5 days! We are hitting the studio Friday evening to meet with Peter Fox and begin pre-production, then Saturday to Wednesday we will be hitting it hard. Some songs will need to be recorded live which presents another challenge. For anyone that has done any live recording you are familiar with the difficulties of being able to hear the necessary components to perform well (not messing up, but mistakes are real and sometimes genius) and not getting a lot of bleed from the other instruments performing. \n\nHopefully the mic placements will eliminate most of the bleed and will be ironed out in pre-production. If we run out of time in the 5 days to get all 10 songs recorded we will then have to set up a couple more weekends with Peter to wrap it up which means driving back up to Michigan and may also mean taking more time off work. \n\nWe can't do this project without all of you - if we fall short of our goal, we won't receive any of the pledged money (everyone gets refunds) - so thank you thank you thank you! Please send this page along to anyone who has ever listened to, loved or made music and everyone who believes in the power of hope to bring change.

We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

So what do you think? Can a 3D printed product get into retail stores? \nI believe the answer is yes but first let me tell you about this cool product and then my plan to get there. You're probably familiar with those wooden unisex dolls in craft stores for artists, right?  You know, the ones with those funny looking ball joints? Well, haven't you wished they made them with the proper proportions and range of motion? Yes? Well so did I, and that's what I set off to do. \nAfter many months of design, 3D printing and iteration, and a thorough four month beta phase with over 800 armature shipped around the world. I've finally come up with a design that has been tested and proven and a production and shipping pipeline well established.\nThis figure, has been designed to simply and accurately portray the human anatomical proportion with a range of motion capable of posing it realistically. Unlike the wooden dolls that are currently out in the market, these, are way more accurate and are better suited to meet the needs of artists and, in fact, has already had positive impacts on my own art.\nThrough this kickstarter I'm releasing the new, 2013 version of the design and also a number of new products and enhancements such as quadrupeds, a 1-1 hand armature, various proportional and anatomical variations and more!\nSo why help me out? The thing is, I've been manufacturing these myself with 3D printers and as you can imagine, it's painfully slow. Right now I can produce about 10 of the large armatures a day, which does not including assembly or possible failure-rate (there's good days and bad days).  Consequently, there's little to no hope of getting it into retail storefronts, as they need to be assured they can order 100-200 on a moment's notice.\nGetting this product into retail stores is the only way this armatures will get the exposure it really needs in order to thrive and become the livelihood I need it to be in order to put food on the table.   If I make my goal, I can raise enough money to expand my equipment and include ten (10) 3D printers, With these I'd be able to produce 50 armatures a day! This kind of output will allow me to meet the initial needs of retail stores in addition to online orders.\nIn exchange for your support, I'm offering many of these armatures at a 25% discount (even over %50 if you get the $200 bundle) and even offering some armatures that will never be available through retail OR my website (such as the 5.5\" armature). Meeting this kickstarter goal will allow me to add the additional printers to my arsenal and pay for the materials and shipment of the rewards you pledge on. My time would be unpaid and would constitute my contribution to the campaign. I'll be handling all the printing, assembly, shipping and the package design for retailers.\nPlease support my grassroots attempt to manufacture this product. Even if you're not an artist, any of these rewards would make a great gift for any artist friends you have.\nSpecial Note:\nOnly those that contribute to this campaign will get their armatures in this limited edition color (pearl & crimson). If you prefer the default brown with dark trim, you can opt out of this choice by saying so in the comments (but you can't back out after you do). The pearl color, uses little to no pigmentation and so it is slightly translucent (similar to skin & marble, so it will provide you with more realistic shading when doing your value samples)\nTo learn more about how to use these armatures for illustration, watch the video listed at the top.\nCredits: \nMusic by Mariya Lincoln & DjembeDJ\nFilmed by Kevin Harris\nNote: I Photoshoped away the background because it had a nasty texture to it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI launched a crowd-funding campaign to release a Beta version of this product late last year with over 800 armatures ordered: (http://www.indiegogo.com/armature9)\n\nI was very thorough and transparent with my fulfillment of orders by providing this public spreadsheet to all contributors so they could track my progress:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJsKv5h1IsCdFJCN2QyUUh5N1lselJCWURwVjQxQ1E&usp=sharing\n\n\nAnd I learned a TON! I faced a number of unexpected issues and learned how to resolve them. As a consequence, I established a sustainable and efficient production and assembly pipeline. Am in the process of solidifying a relationship with a filament supplier. Found an excellent technician to help me with repair issues. Resolved a number of design problems based on feedback I got from customers. Registered with a bulk mailing service and learned how to assemble and package the armatures efficiently. I learned an incredible amount about manufacturing with 3D printers in general and how to get consistent repeatable and non-brittle results. \n\nIn short, I've really crossed my t's and dotted my i's so that I could launch this much larger campaign. So I see very little risk to you, the contributor. I'm sure, however, I will continue to learn new things, once, and if, you help me get my foot in the door of retailers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Important: Last Update for Armature Nine", "update_content": "Happy new year everyone!

Quite a lot, I guess, but we think one of those things is an interesting premise for a horror adventure.\nThe game is heavily based on atmosphere and exploration, and using the two year old child\u2019s perspective. For example you\u2019ll be able to see your own body at all times, and you will have to interact with the environment to find places to hide from dangers.\nOur gameplay prototype from last summer:\nFresh environment teaser:\nThe teasers we have published are captured entirely in-game.\nThere might be threats hiding in every shadow, but there\u2019s no traditional combat.

We aim to include the surrealistic theme of dreams and children's imagination, both as a setting and an active part of the game.\nMore concept art \u00bb\nWhile travelling through diverse environments inspired by our dreams and driven by the endless imagination of the child, you will have to search for comfort and safety.

As a creative collective of friends, we started our current project Among the Sleep as our thesis project, and we decided to continue working on it after graduating.\nWe love this medium, and want to craft unique and interesting experiences to drive it forward. This means that we experiment all the time, for instance by making and releasing creative side projects for free.\nWe're now at the point in development where we have finished the core gameplay, but there is still a lot of production, as well as a ton of polishing and testing left to do. We want to take our time and make the game as good as possible.\nThe only obstacle we see going forward, is that everyone at Krillbite still work part time jobs on the side to survive while developing Among The Sleep. This inhibits our focus and productivity on the game, and we don\u2019t want to lower our expectations to the quality of the finished game, or delay the release. We hope this Kickstarter will help us deliver the best possible experience we can, within a reasonable timeframe. Another reason to use Kickstarter is our wish to stay independent, and free from the creative boundaries of a publisher.\nWe've found that $200.000 is the amount we need to quit our part-time jobs, and continue working all hours of the day on finishing Among the Sleep.\nIf we are fortunate enough to receive more than our goal, what would we spend it on?\nWe are very satisfied with the existing design of Among the Sleep, but there are numerous things that we\u2018d like to be able to offer you on the side of the game itself.\nLike we mentioned in the Oculus Update Video, we\u2019ll be including a basic implementation either way, but we\u2019d really like to spend some time optimizing and exploring some amazing possibilities with the technology.\nWe\u2019d also very much like to include a proper in-game Commentary Track, so that you can hear our thoughts, anecdotes and other stories from the development of Among the Sleep should you choose.\nYou'll find a ton of rewards to your right, including copies of the game, OST, Boxed limited edition, Art book, T-shirts, Alpha testing, your name in the credits a Skype conference with the team and a Personal plush-Teddy, handmade by us at Krillbite!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, our biggest challenge is that all of us work part time jobs to finance Among the Sleep.

There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again.\nUpdate May 07: Wooo! We have achieved our goal of 5,000 dollars. Surprisingly quickly too, after only ten days. Thanks very much to everyone who has supported us and will continue to support us and this project. It could not happen without you.\nIf you wish to see the reasons why you should keep giving us money scroll down to the 'stretch goals' sections below. Or you can just give us more money because you like us. We like you.\nUpdate May 17: We've met our first stretch goal at 7,500 dollars. This is great! I hope everyone tells all their friends so we can reach the next one. You are all great.\nUpdate May 24: We've met our second stretch goal at 10,000 dollars. So we'll be making the game cross platform for the Mac, PC, Android and iOS, hopefully Linux as well but we can't guarantee that.\nGameplay\nIt might be hard to imagine why someone would want to play a game about walking through a graveyard. Have you ever done that? Just walked through a graveyard and spent time examining all the different gravestones and what's written there? You should if you haven't.\nThe gameplay is simple: you move around and examine things. The most obvious things being the headstones, of course. You can also interact with any NPCs you might encounter.\nFree Roaming\nThe game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines.\nThere will be some specific event triggers, yes, but they don't need to be triggered. Maybe today you don't want to talk to anyone, you just want to leave flowers on a gravestone and sit for awhile.\n\nNo Danger\nThe game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you.\nThough they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard.\nDiscover Mystery in the Graveyard\nI don't want to imply the game is aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations.\n\nThe threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone.\nGame Elements and Specifications\nCurrently the game will be released for the PC platform only. Why? Because cross-platform development takes more time and thus costs more money.\nThe graphics will be, as shown in the demo images on this page, pixel art. Why? Because I'm a pixel artist and I have friends who are pixel artists and art is expensive. Also, on a more subjective note, I like pixel art (thus why I'm a pixel artist). I think it helps create a symbolic world that isn't weighed down by photorealism.\nThe music and sound design will be simple but hopefully immersive. A very talented musician wants to work on the project, and there would always be the option to turn his very talented music off if you'd prefer your graveyard experience silent.\nOne thousand grave markers are currently planned, each with its own implied backstory. Why not more? Mainly because someone (primarily myself) has to write each and every one of those.\nSpecifics:\nFancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago.\nThe ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive.\nOne thousand individual graves and epitaphs for you to read! It's the whole point of the game, after all.\nSeveral NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Talk to them, learn their stories.\nA map system! So you will know where you are. Getting lost is frustrating.\nVirtual graveyard! Real depression! Feelings of depression are not guaranteed, but reading epitaphs is not known as a heartwarming pastime.\nThe ability to sit! You'll be able to sit next to graves.\nReal-time mourning! You'll be able to bow your head, leave flowers on gravestones, and look sad. All in real time!\nFigure out what's up with that weird goth chick! She's kinda creepy.\nLie in an open grave! Haven't you always wanted to do that?\nBut mostly, Learn about the history of this town and the kind of people that lived their through the legacy they have left behind in the graveyard boon hill.\n5,000 dollars\nWhen I see a Kickstarter I always want to know exactly what they plan to spend money on, how far along in the project they are at the start, all those sort of things. Thus, for your perusal, here's an itemized list of what our funding would be used for.\nAll of these estimates were gathered from people I trust, or who are actually working on the project currently for free, and most of them were averaged out from a few sources.\n500-800 dollars - Sound design\n2,000-5,000 dollars - Programming\n1,500- 3,000 dollars - Pixel art\n500 - 800 dollars - Writing\nTotal Production cost: 4,500-9,600\nAs you can see, the lowest estimate from every element of the project sums to 4,500. That would leave, after everyone was paid for their work (and underpaid at that), only 500 dollars, which would cover the cut to Amazon and Kickstarter, leaving basically nothing for things like distribution and any kind of marketing. Everything else would need to come out of pocket.\n5,000 dollars is asking for just 1,000 people to pre-order the game at 5 dollars each. That seems like a realistic goal for this strange quirky game, and one I'm excited to try and meet.\nGetting the Game, Running the Game\nCurrently the game is only planned for the PC.  The donation of five dollars or more will guarantee you a digital copy of the game. No physical copies of the game are planned because that costs money. Of course, after the game is made more copies will be available for purchase through online distribution.\nThe system requirements are all up in the air but the game won't be graphically intensive, shouldn't be overly large, and thus should run on all modern PC systems.\nStretch Goals?\nUpdate May 07: Originally we were just focused on getting the bare minimum funding to get the project completed, but as we've managed to get that amount, we wanted to show some of the other features we would love to have the money and time to make.\nSo here they are, the Boon Hill stretch goals.\n$7,500 Reached! -More NPCs and Random Elements. Encounters that aren't static, such as people coming and going from the graveyard. Giving it a more 'living' feel. - We've met this goal and so this will be part of the game.\n$10,000 REACHED! - Part of this one has already been mentioned, making the game cross platform, for PC, Mac, iOS and Android. This hasn't changed. On top of that we'd be adding a 'double' soundtrack. There will be one soundtrack along the lines of the music in the kickstarter video and another rooted in chiptunes. You'd be able to switch between them (or turn the music off) based on your preference. - We've met this goal and so we will release the game cross platform.\n$12,500 - A more fleshed out graveyard with a greater variety of gravestones and other areas such as a pet cemetery. We'd have the resources to really flesh out the world of Boon Hill.\n$15,000 - Improved graphics for the menus and such, as well as a super cool animated intro of the sun rising over the graveyard in pixelated splendor. Other graphical improvements.\n$20,000 - The team would be paid what they are actually worth for their time and efforts. On top of us making a living wage? A character editor. Instead of simply the generic male or female protagonist, you would be able to design your own from different elements to make your avatar feel unique.\nAnything beyond 20K is insanity and can not even be considered right now.\nAll of these are of course subject to change as the project moves forward and people voice their opinions. New goals may be added or edited at any time.\nThank You Kindly\nEven just taking the time to look through this Kickstarter proposal is helpful. If you're interested in the game being made but don't have the money to donate, consider just showing it to a friend.\nThe website for the game is at: www.14hoursproductions.com\nE-mails can be directed at: Boonhill@14hoursproductions.com\nFollow us on twitter @TheBoonHill to receive a daily epitaph.\nA thanks to everyone who has supported the game so far, and everyone who will support it in the future. Dreams die when we do, not before.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo we get the 5,000 dollars. What then?\n\nWe make the game. That is guaranteed. Whatever happens, if the 5,000 dollar goal is met the game will be released. All donation pledge gifts will be honored. The current goal is for the game to be done completely and sent to everyone within three months of the Kickstarter closing. If all goes well, everyone should have everything by or before the end of August.\n\nProblems might arise, as they often do. Many of the people working on Boon Hill are doing it as favors, and even with the 5,000 dollars won't exactly be able to quit their day jobs. While not ideal, delays in the final product are possible. However, even if I have to pay another five grand out of pocket to make sure it gets finished, it will. I love ramen.\n\nAnother possible issue is that a lot of the pledge rewards involve communication between the pledger and the team. With this in mind we'll make sure to have lots of forms of communication open, and want anyone that pledges to do the same. Please ensure the e-mails you present us with are valid, and are not carting things off to your spam folder.\n\nWe would potentially release a whole updated version of the game to everyone for free to fix any issues or mistypes with people's pledge rewards. We want you to be happy with them.\n\nIf you're actually excited to play the game, we're excited to make sure you get the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to Boon Hill up for a Steam Award!", "update_content": "Good morning those that still live under the sun,\nI hope all you Americans out there had a nice thanksgiving and all you who aren't American I hope you had a nice uh... week.\nWelcome to Boon Hill has been nominated for the coveted steam award \"Best Graveyard Simulator\".

We've always wanted to make the process of editing your campaign pages much more organic and natural, and now we have the chance. Watch the video for a quick demo of what we mean by \"natural editing\"\nThere are some significant technical challenges here, which is why the stretch goal is so aggressive. I still think we can hit it, especially as we approach the final push that most Kickstarters get.\nAs with the other stretch goals, this will be a post-reforging target. My best estimate right now is that we can launch this sometime in December of 2013. I wish I could promise it sooner, but this gets to the very core of Obsidian Portal and I don't want to under-emphasize the difficulty.\nMega Stretch Goal - Extra Month at $75,000\nFor every $10k we raise over the initial goal, we will be able to extend the premium Ascendant time for every backer (Hasted Ascendant and above) by 1 month. We've already achieved 6 extra months! So get out there and tell your friends. The more backers we bring in, the more Ascendant time everyone gets!\nShe can't take much more, captain!\nUpdate - Additional Years Available\nBy popular demand, we're offering additional years as an add-on purchase. Simply pledge an additional $35 on top of your chosen backer level for each additional year you want. More details and examples down below the backer levels.\nStretch Goal #4 - Custom Campaign URLs - $50,000 - ACHIEVED\nPart of the reforging is an overhaul to make things look better, so we think everyone would like to make their page URLs look nicer as well. Every campaign will get its own subdomain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.obsidianportal.com\u201d) and Ascendant campaigns can set up their own raw domain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.com\u201d).\nThere will be significant technical challenges with this stretch goal, both in making sure that old URLs do not break and also making sure that all your old links to characters, wiki pages, items, and so forth automatically redirect to your new custom campaign URL. We don\u2019t want to underestimate the difficulty here, so as with our File Storage stretch goal, we\u2019re shooting to complete this stretch goal after the main reforging process. Our target date for the custom URLs would be mid-October 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - File Storage Locker - $35,000 - ACHIEVED!\nWe\u2019ve always wanted to expand our image upload to include files of any type. Every campaign has files they need to share, like PDFs of your world\u2019s history or MP3s of your campaign theme music. If we hit this stretch goal we can add a spot in every campaign to store and manage all your shared files, so it\u2019s easier to keep all your campaign materials in one place.\nPlus, if we can hit this stretch goal, we will be able to increase the storage size limits for both free and Ascendant campaigns. The free limit will climb to 250MB and the Ascendant limit will rise to 10GB. That should be plenty of space to share everything your group needs.\nNote: For this and all future stretch goals, we are targeting a post-August release date. We will do our best to get as much completed as we can by August, but we want to be realistic and open about our timelines. For the file storage locker, we\u2019re aiming for sometime in September.\nStretch Goal #2 - Names! Names! Names! - $20,000 - ACHIEVED!\nSince the beginning, I've wanted a good, solid random name generator as part of the character creation and management. So many times I've been staring at my players, mouth hanging open, waiting for a name to come out. They had asked about an NPC I hadn't prepared, and I just needed a name. Here, let me explain:\nSo what are the particulars of the name generator?\nA variety of different naming \"genres\". You'll be able to quickly switch between Elven-ish, Dwarven, guttural Ork (think lots of Ks and Xs), and so forth.\nFast! - It will be right there when you need it, ready to give you the name you need and keep your players in the game.\nIntegrated - Instead of just spitting a name at you, you'll be able to create a new barebones character on the fly with the name pre-generated. So, when your players ask about that random new NPC 3 months later, they will be tracked normally in Obsidian Portal, just like all your other characters.\n\nStretch Goal #1 - Reworking the Maps - $10,000 - ACHIEVED\nThe campaign maps have been one of our favorite features since the beginning, but just like everything else, they need some work to make them better! If we hit this goal, we will be able to make the following improvements:\nDeeper zoom levels for Ascendant maps - 5 instead of the current 3\nHigher resolution images - 4096x4096 pixels instead of the current 1024x1024\nA library of map markers - Different colors and shapes. Imagine dropping crossed swords to mark a battle, a tower to mark a wizard's abode, and a cave for...a cave. That's the idea.\nBetter connection with the rest of your campaign - Add markers for specific characters and/or wiki pages, instead of only the general purpose markers we have now.\nThe maps are already fun. Now let's reforge them into something truly useful and awesome!\nObsidian Portal Reforged\nObsidian Portal is the award-winning online campaign management system for tabletop role-playing games. We want to revitalize the existing Obsidian Portal by increasing its functionality, adding new features, and cleaning up the design. We are taking the strong core that is Obsidian Portal, heating it up in the furnace, and reforming it into a sleeker and sharper tool. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master, which will make your game the best it can be. That\u2019s what \u201creforging\u201d is all about.\nImprovements\nTo provide you with the best possible experience, we\u2019ll revamp the most frequently used parts of the site and rework them so that they\u2019re easier to use. We will be examining every page for ways to make them flow better, provide the information you need, and allow you to navigate and manage your campaign faster and easier. The redesign will add more features to enhance your gaming.\nA perfect example of this is our plan to create a campaign dashboard that will put the most important details of your campaign right at your fingertips. The dashboard is just the first of many changes that will fundamentally enhance Obsidian Portal and make it a much better tool than it is today.\nA very rough draft of the new dashboard\nWe\u2019ll be supporting these functional changes by improving the overall design of the site. We\u2019ll take our current site and give it a consistent look and feel that will make it more intuitive to use\u2014not a button here and a link there, but a cohesive design strategy.\nWith more of your support, there\u2019s even more we can do to make Obsidian Portal the most robust campaign management system. If we make our original goal, keep an eye out for stretch goals for additional improvements.\nBack us now and get a year of premium Ascendant membership at a reduced price when you back at the Ascendant level.\nWhy Obsidian Portal?\nIt\u2019s free to use and built from the ground up, for gamers by gamers. We host a huge community of tabletop RPG players who are all looking to get the most out of their tabletop gaming experience. You play your campaign and we help you manage it. It\u2019s that simple.\nWith Obsidian Portal, you can manage your tabletop RPG campaign from any computer, anywhere. You can tell your story and get recognized for your innovation and creativity. Now help us take Obsidian Portal to the next level!\nBenefits to Backers\nA year of premium Ascendant membership (Hasted Ascendant level and above). Not a GM yourself? No worries, the Ascendant time can be gifted to your GM!\nCool backer-only souvenirs like campaign maps, custom map markers, profile badges, t-shirts, letterpress cards, and more\nThe opportunity to have a hand in the reforging process. All backers will receive developer updates along the way for an exclusive look at the design process. Plus, Tinkerer Ascendant level and above will be able to provide feedback during the design and beta testing.\nA slicker, more useful, easier to navigate Obsidian Portal. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master and improve your game.\n\nMy Backstory\nWhen I started Obsidian Portal in 2006, I knew I needed to set aside some real time and focus hard to make progress. To accomplish this, I quit playing video games altogether and told myself I wouldn't play again until the site launched. If you're a gamer like me, then you know how hard that is, and also how much time that can free up. I accomplished some amazing things in those first 9 months, and it's thanks to that dedication that Obsidian Portal is where it's at now.\nFast forward to now. Over the summer, I have the chance to focus on Obsidian Portal almost full time. Plus, I have a team of designers and programmers lined up to help out. So, in the spirit of what it took to launch, I'm once again swearing off video games and putting my nose to the grindstone. It will be a hot and sweaty summer, but by GenCon in August we will have some awesome progress to show for it!\nYou've seen what I can do by myself on nights and weekends. Now let me show you how awesome we can be with a real team working near full time!\nBacker Level Details\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n\nExample of the finished postcard thank you\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 20% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 12.5% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\nA custom video made by the talented Mikhail Twarogowski, who composed our Kickstarter video for us.

We just unlocked The Genius Guide to the Godling and BATTLE MUSIC FOR BASTARDS!\nIMPORTANT INFO:    \nWe're in the FINAL HOURS and there are still some terrific backing options available:\n*** Pledge at the $250 level and you could PLAY in the World's Worst Dungeon Crawl at Gen Con! ***\n*** There's still ONE $350 pledge available out there. NAME A PC plus all the $250 level rewards! ***\n*** Pledge at the $150 level and you might become the game's OFFICIAL DICE FLUFFER! ***\n*** We will be making ADD-ONs available AFTER the campaign! ***      \nUPDATE 11 has more extensive details.\nNew Reward Reference Chart\nWe have a great set of rewards for backers. To help you break it down we've put together this handy reference chart.\nHey gamers, over the years I\u2019ve given advice to thousands of players on how to KICK ASS (play a dwarf!) TAKE NAMES (inscribe them on your axe) and CRUSH DUNGEONS IN STYLE (hint: SWEATBANDS) but I\u2019ve largely neglected to help those unfortunate souls sitting on the OTHER side of the screen \u2013 the DM.\nWHY? \nBecause being the DM is EASY. You just read some boring boxed text and send a couple of goblins into the room. A SECOND-GRADER COULD DO IT.\nSome of my critics disagree. \u201cEASY?\u201d they say, as globules of rage fly across the room. \u201cYou think running an inventive, engaging, BADASS RPG adventure is EASY?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. And I\u2019m going to PROVE it by taking the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl and making it AWESOME.\nBased on decades of RPG experience, I\u2019ve culled together the most odious PCs, plots, and encounters and built a Frankenstein\u2019s MONSTER of BADASSITUDE. It\u2019s called Flaming Deathpits of the Minotaur Mage: Descent into Doomfire! It has a hackneyed \u201cSave the Princess\u201d plot. It has pyromancer named \u201cSteve.\u201d It has ROLE-PLAYING.\nYeah, you\u2019re right: it sounds like a total train wreck. And I\u2019m going to climb that train, stoke its engines with 200cc\u2019s of pure, undiluted DUNGEON BASTARD GUSTO and CRASH that thing directly into the BIGGEST, most NOTORIOUS gaming convention of them all: GEN CON 2013.\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 I don\u2019t do things HALFWAY, gamers. If I\u2019m going to prove how easy it is to take the World\u2019s Worst Dungeon Crawl and make it TOTALLY AWESOME, I\u2019m going to do it LIVE, in-person, before a crowd of the world\u2019s most hard-core gamers.\nI hope to present this \u201cmasterpiece\u201d of fantasy adventure not only as a published RPG adventure for you to enjoy with your fellow gamers, but also as a live event at GEN CON immortalized on video to help motivate and inspire your PERSONAL gaming group. Your contributions help create, publish and host the game and document it in the polished, professional style you\u2019ve come to expect from the Dungeon Bastard. The result should be a lot more fun than \u201cThe World's WORST Dungeon Crawl\u201d HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE.\nThe stretch goals continue to tumble like a half-elven thief in a cavern full of storm giants!

Let\u2019s start with experience: I\u2019ve been playing RPGs since I was 14. I\u2019ve been attending GEN CON since its Milwaukee debut. That\u2019s A LOT of gaming. I\u2019ve playtested rules systems, written \u201cdungeon duel\u201d-style Con events, and helped host NASCRAG \u2013 the longest-running independent RPG tournament at GEN CON. I know what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and what doesn\u2019t even qualify for unemployment.\n\nSecond, I know a dirty secret regular RPG authors would NEVER tell you: your game can be fun DESPITE the scripted adventure. That\u2019s my goal here. To take a trite premise and a hackneyed plot and prove that NONE OF THAT MATTERS when you game THE DUNGEON BASTARD WAY.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the reflexively amplifying nature of trying to create the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl: anything that goes wrong inherently makes the adventure EVEN WORSE. You've heard of a \"WIN-WIN\"? This is a FAIL-FAIL-WIN!\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m deliberately trying to tank this thing. On the contrary, I take pride in delivering a QUALITY PRODUCT \u2013 whether that\u2019s the written adventure or the final video of the live event. I\u2019ve worked with professionals in the field, and I share their professional standards.\n\nI have the experience, equipment, and team in place to make the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl TRULY AWESOME.

You use your voice to explore a hypnotic world of sounds and visuals that feel like they are emerging directly from your body. Each tone will navigate you through strobing tunnels-of-light, impossible shapes, and into a meditative trance. The result is an elegant symmetry of image, sound and body that takes advantage of loopholes in the way you perceive to facilitate a new experience of yourself and your world. Each play-through lasts one extremely intense hour. \nThere is no right way to play SoundSelf: Play with different sounds and the game will dance with you, or sustain long tones and SoundSelf will take you deep into your own sonic universe. Play alone, or share the experience with friends - no two players will have the same journey, and no one player will experience what many will together.\nPlay the Prototype for Free\nDownload Mirror 1: \nhttp://wraughk.com/SoundSelfBuild/SoundSelf-2013-04-04.zip\nDownload Mirror 2: \nhttp://evanbalster.com/soundself/SoundSelf-2013-04-04.zip\nPrototype Requirements (the final game will be more light-weight): \nWindows 7 or 8 / Mac OS X 10.6 64 bit\nIntel i5 cpu or better \nHeadphones \nMicrophone (can just be your webcam's mic)\n\nStretch Goal:  \n$36,000: Deep-playa installation at Burning Man!\nBurning Man has been a continuous source of inspiration to the SoundSelf team. Taking this as a deep-playa structure to Black Rock City would give us an opportunity to \"pay forward\" that inspiration to the next generation of interactive art projects, and also provide a unique platform to experiment with SoundSelf as a shared collaborative experience.\nCost Breakdown\nWe currently have a working prototype of SoundSelf that explores the hypnosis sensation, but has a limited amount of content and only feeds off of the player's voice in superficial ways. It is the result of one year of research and experimental development, and it's already an unusual and powerful experience.\n$18,000 in development funds is enough for us to complete SoundSelf to our satisfaction by early 2014. Additional funds would allow us to create more content to support longer, more intricate experiences, and experiment with more intricate interactivity. Even more development funds would allow us to add some exciting new features.\nAbout the Creators\nDeveloper   \nRobin Arnott is the sound designer for Antichamber, and creator of \"that creepy gas mask game\" Deep Sea.\nSoftware Engineer  \nEvan Balster is a programmer whose current workings include current workings include an opensource audio engine and a system for dynamic body language and kinematics.\nArtistic Director  \nTopher Sipes is an illustrator, graphic designer, hoop dancer, and the creative director of Artheism.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nExperiment: The biggest risk is that SoundSelf won\u2019t be what you expect.

With Torment, we're striving to create a rich role-playing experience that explores similar deep, personal themes. Here's the scoop:\nTorment is a single-player, isometric role-playing game.\nYou will play a single, specific character, though you will encounter optional NPC companions you may choose to include in your party.\nThe story-driven game will have a rich dialogue system.\nThe game will be developed in the Unity engine for PC (Windows), Mac, and Linux platforms.\nThe game will be available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish.\nThe game will be distributed DRM-free.

Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well. Just like you, we want Torment to be the best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Updated Our Journal (68): Servant of the Tides", "update_content": "tl;dr: Oom\u2019s debut, Content Update, new bonus rewards from Monte Cook Games, and a check-in on backer rewards.\nHey Exiles,\nEric Daily here.

It'll be printed non-digitally with bright, beautiful colours, wrapped around by seven carefully-created hot-drink-relevant games - and a secret eighth game on the inside.\n(Pictures are mockups and may differ slightly from final print versions)\nTHE COASTERS\nThe coasters feature six different games: \"Coinflip Coasters\", \"That Wasn't Milk!\", \"The Winning Coaster\", \"Acrononymous\", \"Starting Sentences\", and \"Coastdown\".\nThe backs are crammed with mysterious symbols and sigils for use in the games - but you'll have to get the coasters to find out what they're for...\n(Pictures are mock-ups and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nTHE T-SHIRT\nThere's going to be a choice of t-shirt designs; one more graphical, and one crammed full of games. As you can see, this one's crammed with games:\nThere'll be five great games to play while you're out and about, printed on cotton t-shirts (choice of unisex and women's) with a big, bright, non-digital print. The t-shirts will ONLY EVER be available via this Kickstarter.\nCheck back next week for a look at the final t-shirt!\n(Picture is a mock-up and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nMore About Tiny Games\nWe're bringing together every kind of game you can think of: chase games, people-watching games, word games, creative games, shopping games, strategic games, storytelling games and a bunch more words we can't even think of right now. To get a better picture of what kind of games to expect, please watch the video above, plus you can download the complete rules for those games in this PDF.\nYou'll only need to read a few sentences of explanation for any given game; we're trying to create the maximum amount of fun for the minimum amount of rules-reading. You'll also get any digital tools you need to play whatever that game is - dice, spinners, timers and so on - and a record for posterity of the best bits of each game.\nInitially there'll be five locations for games: the home (further sub-divided into living room, kitchen, bathroom or bedroom), the pub, on the road (by bus or train or car), on a walk (whether in the city, the country, or a park), and in one other location to be chosen by a vote of our backers. \nThis is just the start - if successful, we're planning to add a load more games, locations, occasions, as well as special releases for holidays and events, all within the same fun, approachable framework. And to make sure it is fun and friendly, we're thrilled to be collaborating with IGF-nominated art director Luke Whittaker of State of Play Games on the visual design. \nWe're Hide&Seek, an award-winning game design studio based in London and New York. A lot of the games we\u2019ve made haven\u2019t been videogames: they've been games you play in the real world. If you're interested, have a look at the game we ran for 12,000 players in Edinburgh on New Year's Day; or the festival we put on at the Southbank Centre.\nTiny Games in London\nWe've already polished the format of Tiny Games through a lot of practice. Last year, we made 99 Tiny Games for all 33 boroughs of London, in the form of vinyl posters that went up in parks and on busy shopping streets. The project was an amazing success, described as \"brilliantly innovative\" by The Guardian Gamesblog and featured in Wired and the Wall Street Journal. You can read more about the history of Tiny Games here.\nWe've made and distributed our own games before, most notably with the Board Game Remix Kit, which uses four boardgames we've all got and remixes them to create 25 exciting new games, tweaks and mash-ups. BoingBoing called it \"the most insanely clever Christmas gift idea of the year\".\nWe want to encourage real-world play everywhere, not just where we are. That's why we're making this app. \nAccessibility and Settings\nThe app will have persistent settings that help it to choose the right game for you - if you can't run, say, or if you're colourblind, or you're mostly playing with kids and you don't want any games that might tend to the risque, then you can tell the app and it'll take that into account when it works out what game you should play.\nTo make the Tiny Games experience as good as it can possibly be, we need your help.\nWe need the wonderful people of Kickstarter to help us shape the app itself!  We'll be opening up the development process to all our backers - sharing game rules, builds, and design progress blogs - and we'll be depending on feedback from you to help make everything amazing. We hope you'll get involved in playtesting games, letting us know when our explanations aren't clear, guiding the choice of locations that you want to play Tiny Games in. It'll be super fun.\nAnd then, obviously, well, we need money. To make this app as beautiful as it can be, stuffing it with games, pumping it full of tools to help those games run smoothly.\nWe'll use the money for a few different things: \nVisuals. We're a small studio without an in-house designer, and we want Tiny Games to be beautiful. We've got UX experts and amazing artist Luke Whittaker on board, but we need to be able to pay them.\nMore development time. We've made a prototype of the game, and begun refining how it works in practice, but we need to do more work to make sure it's exactly as smooth and seamless and effective as possible.\nMore games. We've designed a lot of Tiny Games already, somewhere in the low to mid hundreds, and we're adding to that number every day, but in order to have a genuine range of games for you - wherever you are, however many people are with you, whatever mood you're in and whatever props you have to hand - we're going to need more than \"a lot\" - we're going to need absolutely loads, and that takes time. We need to playtest, polish and refine, and that takes time too. \n\nWe want the app to be as good as possible and in your hands as soon as possible. We're asking for the smallest amount of money we can honestly do that for.\nWe don't want to get too ahead of ourselves, but we need to lay out some important info about this Kickstarter and about platforms in particular. The \u00a325k target enables us to ship this app on iOS only. We really, really want to be able to extend this to Android too, so we really hope you can help us stretch!\nIf we don't make the \u00a345k stretch goal in the Kickstarter, we still plan on releasing an Android version - it will just arrive after the iOS version has launched. \n\u00a328k - Tiny Games For Queues! **UNLOCKED**\n\u00a332k - Tiny Games For Work and A Coaster for Everyone!\n\u00a335k - Secret!\n\u00a340k - Secret!\n\u00a345k - ANDROID VERSION !

While EN World ain't going anywhere, I'm turning to the community with whose help we can restore much of what was lost within a few months.\nMonte Cook said \"EN World is a good cause\"; Green Ronin's Chris Pramas said \"EN World has been a great center of gaming community many years. I had to back Rebuilding EN World on Kickstarter\"; Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said \"Glad to help EN World get back up on its feet!\"; and Ryan Dancey said \"The ENWorld community is an asset to the whole hobby. Helping them get back up on their feet is just the Right Thing To Do. Back this Kickstarter.\"\nOur goal, put simply:\nEN World will be FAST, it will be RELIABLE, and it will have AWESOME FEATURES. It will also, most importantly, STILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME! And we all want that, right? Right?\nKickstarter staff very kindly said to me: \"Normally, we don't accept website projects, but we talked about what you're doing and we think rebuilding a community website through Kickstarter is a great use of our platform.\"\nI'm calling the hacking \"The Great Breach of 2012\" and the Kickstarter backers \"The Defenders of the Wall\". Gear up, and take your place on the wall now!\n[Lots of people have been asking about backup strategies -- I've added that info to the \"Risks & Challenges\" section below].\nAs a community website, I feel it appropriate that this Kickstarter use the Kicking It Forward system.  This means that 5% of the profits will be spent supporting other RPG-related Kickstarters as a way not only to give a little back but also to foster more cool RPG stuff!\nHere are some of the things that need writing, and the funding targets for each.\nOur goals are quite modest.  We're not asking for the millions or hundreds of thousands that some other RPG Kickstarters have raised.  For example, the first thing - the server optimization and security overhaul - is only \u00a3300 (or about $480).  I've put both UK and US currencies in the descriptions below.\nPre-Funding: New Server\nI've already purchased a brand new, powerful, server, which will be going online this week (being the week this project launches, 13-19 Jan). That bit I've funded myself in advance, and we should be seeing the benefits of it before this Kickstarter ends.\nSite Optimization and Security (\u00a3300/$480)\nFirst and foremost, the immediate plan includes hiring a professional to optimize the entire site, database, and server.  I hired someone to do that late last year, and it worked swimmingly well, but all that work was lost shortly afterwards.  This is actually the most important thing, and so is first on the list.\nCampaign Manager (\u00a3500/$800)\nThe Campaign Manager is a collection of tightly integrated campaign-management tools including a campaign wiki, journal, links and files, picture albums, calendar system, and more. Together, they make a functional and convenient campaign website. Various tools for the GM include permission and privacy settings, the ability to contact players via PM or email, inviting and booting players from the campaign, and more.\nWe have 285 campaigns being run in the campaign manager!  That's 285 active campaigns and GMs who badly need the features returned!\nYou don't actually play your campaign in the campaign manager (well, you could if you wanted, I suppose) - its purpose is to organize your campaign, schedule events, store and distribute information, discuss topics outside the actual game itself, and so on. It's designed for both tabletop and online play. It doesn't matter where or how your campaign takes place.\nDice Roller (\u00a31000/$1600)\nOur dice roller is not only attractive, it is also secure; there is no way for players to cheat it while using it in an online PbP game.  It's one of EN World's most popular features - our play-by-post (PbP) players make hundreds of dice rolls every month.\nOGRE  (Online Generator Randomizer Engine) (\u00a31500/$2400)\nEN World's Online Generic Randomizer Engine (OGRE) is a powerful, flexible framework to create your own random generators and share them with other EN World members. You can create anything from the very simple (a random color generator which rolls a d6 to choose a color) to something very complex (such as an entire, detailed populated village with homes and businesses).\nWe built this in 2012, and there was a whole pile of random generators created by a variety of talented people.  I created some planet generators for space RPGs, someone made a pirate generator, and there were town generators, room generators, NPC generators, and more which all referenced each other.  It was horrible losing all that, because they were such fun to make and use!\nThis is accomplished by the creation of two types of object: tables and generators.\nOnce someone creates a table or a generator, it is available for use by anyone else creating their own tables and generators. In this way, generators can reference and include other generators as part of their own output. So if Bob has created a table which picks a random color such as green, blue, or red, and Alice has created a table which picks a random object, such as box, table, or book, Eric can create a generator which references both of those pre-existing tables to generate an object of a random color, such as a blue box or a green table.\n\nIn this way you can create random generators for your tabletop gaming needs. From random elf names to potion descriptions, to entire treasure hoards and NPCs. \nGamers Seeking Gamers (\u00a32000/$3200)\nOur extensive Gamers Seeking Gamers system has map and distance searches, and with which many gamers met up and formed groups and games.  All the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of members who added themselves to the GsG system are still sitting safely in the database, which means we can be up and running with thousands upon thousands of gamers upon launch! \nIt really is the most comprehensive, fully populated system of its type on the entire internet, with tens of thousands of gamers already in the system, just waiting for the code to be rewritten! \nWhat's this - more stuff? The \u00a325 PDF Reward Level Keeps Growing!\nBONUS ITEM - Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns for the PATHFINDER RPG\nWe've produced an updated, revised version of our best ever selling book, Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns.  Originally for D&D 3.5, this exclusive Pathfinder edition is not available for sale anywhere else.We're adding this to the \u00a325 pledge.\nThe reviews for the D&D 3.5 version of this book were universally glowing!  Folks have been begging for a Pathfinder version for years, and now here it is.\n\"One of the best sourcebooks I ever laid my hands on - you can use it in any Fantasy/DarkAge Setting.\" [from RPGNow]\n\n\"This is one of the most universally useful books I have ever seen. It is also a fun read.\" [read at RPGNow]\n\"Tournaments, Fairs & Taverns is one of those extremely usable books. It\u2019s the type of supplement that\u2019ll see use in more than one campaign, more than one gaming world. It\u2019s the type of supplement that can be grabbed and used by a GM working on a scene on the fly and can be used by a GM in the planning stages. Fortunately, T, F & T is good enough that you\u2019ll want to use it in all these occasions.\" [read at Geek Native]\n\"I loved the electronic version so much I had to order the print version for quicker reference.\" [read at Amazon]\n\"I still have fond memories of this 74-page book. I have tried to find a way to use it in every one of my campaigns.\" [read at RPG Centric]\nThere are many more, but we don't want to bore you!\nWild Spellcraft was our first ever real product.  It was released in RPGNow's first days, and shocked RPGNow owner James Mathe by selling hundreds of copies within hours.  Originally for D&D 3E, we are now updating it for Pathfinder and including it in the \u00a325 EXCLUSIVE PDF reward tier. You should expect this within 3 months of the project's end.\nCONFUSED about what's included at the \u00a325 (and above) PDF level?   At present it's well over \u00a3200 worth of stuff; that's an awesome deal.\nTOURNAMENTS, FAIRS, & TAVERNS for the Pathfinder RPG\nAdmiral o' The High Seas for Pathfinder and D&D 4th Edition\nWar of the Burning Sky 700-page compiled for D&D 3.5\nFive ZEITGEIST adventure path adventures for Pathfinder or 4E (your choice)\nWhat's the Pirate Ship Like, Anyway?  from Raging Swan Press\nVillainous Pirates from Raging Swan Press\nWild Spellcraft for the Pathfinder RPG\nThe Town of Kalas and the Castles & Crusades Quickstart Rules from Troll Lord Games [also please see Troll Lord's own Kickstarter, which is awesome, too!]\nNEW! Plus the Borderland Keep Deluxe 3D paper terrain models from Fat Dragon Games and A0: Crows Nest Island from Adventureaweek.com (both pictured above, added after the big image below was made).\nNEW! Plus the Darklight 4E Bundle pictured below - adventures, amps,a and a sourccebook!\nNEW! Plus the Savage Mojo bundle pictures below - an adventure, and the largest PDF set of map tiles ever in the form of The Leviathan!\nPLUS -- the O.G.R.E. mobile app, which EVERY backer will get!\nPlease note that stretch goals will take longer to provide than the core rewards. I have given rough estimates below.\nGoodness me!  We hit those goals quicker than I dared hope!  I guess it's time for a stretch goal.  This one's for the PATHFINDER fans amongst you, especially those fond of chaos and wild magic...\nUpdate - we made the \u00a33000 stretch goal, which means that everybody who pledged \u00a325 or more will get the Wild Spellcraft PDF.  Thank you - that's astonishing! \nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a36000: MORE OGRE POWER! -- ACHIEVED!\nThanks to you, we achived this stretch goal, and O.G.R.E. will have the additional scripts and functionality to make it truly awesome!\nThe O.G.R.E. system  is something you need to see to appreciate. Its usefulness can't be exaggerated; it's a crowd-sourced, ever-growing library of interrelated random generators. It's a \"generator generator\". Creating and sharing random tables and generators of ever-increasing complexity is easy! Honestly, you could create a generator to detail an entire town, and it could call upon already existing tables and generators that others had made before you - descriptions, names, stats, anything you can think of. The utility of this system is really hard to convey, but once you see it you get it!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a39000: Server Upgrade (and you get THE PERTURBED DRAGON Season 2!) - ACHIEVED!\nSo we have another stretch goal to announce!  This one's a little different to the usual RPG PDF type goal/rewards.  In 2012 we produced a cartoon series.  It was six episodes long, and featured an adventuring group hanging out at their local tavern, playing an RPG called \"REAL LIFE\".  It's called THE PERTURBED DRAGON, and we are very proud of it.\nTo raise some more money for a new server upgrade (we have a new one on its way, but we can add stuff to it to make it faster!), we will make a second season, taking everything we learned making the first, if we reach \u00a39000.  This means shorter, snappier, tighter episodes; more animation frames; and guest stars!  We even have a guest star lined up - you probably already know who Monte Cook is, but if you don't, he helped design D&D 3rd Edition, Planescape, just finished a half-million dollar Kickstarter for his own RPG called Numenera, and a whole bunch of other things in a long, long list of achievements.  Well, Monte has agreed to appear in an episode of The Perturbed Dragon (we're toying with the idea of having him play an artist called Monet Cooke; but he might play himself).  Also appearing will be the winner of our BATTLE OF THE BARDS competition, the wonderful singer Mary Crowell who won with the incredibly catchy song \"I Put My Low Stat\", to sing in it.\nSo, the new stretch goal is \u00a39000 for a server upgrade; if we make that goal we'll make a cartoon.  That's some more money we can spend upgrading the server already en route to us (making the site even faster than it was going to be!) and also helps us arrange a server maintenance contract for a year.  Please help us!\nKickstarter backers will get this before everyone else!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a311000 for a server maintenance contract (and you get a 4E PDF megabundle!) - ACHIEVED!\nI've set a new goal which should appeal to the D&D 4E fans among you. We've got some solid Pathfinder material already in the stuff you're getting (and even some Castles & Crusades stuff), and there will be more if we manage to keep this Kickstarter trucking, but for the moment this one's for the 4E fans. Darklight Interactive has donated what can only be described as a pile of stuff. I've made another of my awesome (read; not awesome at all) infographics below to show you what's in it; but here's the list:\nAdventures:\nA Hero's Journey (level 0, D&D 4E)\nDeath's Edge (level 0, D&D 4E)\nThe Dragon's Master (level 5, D&D 4E and Pathfinder)\nThe Endless Winter (level 12, D&D 4E)\nThe Heart of Fire (level 12, D&D 4E, \"megacampaign\" of 135 pages; we reviewed this on EN World last year -- \"I was very impressed with The Heart of Fire, and I think a lot of gaming groups can enjoy an adventure of this quality. While there are some familiar tropes in this fantasy adventure, they are put to good use making a plot which is fun and exciting, as opposed to being too obvious. The adventure blends a \u201cnew school\u201d sand-boxy encounter series with an \u201cold school\u201d mysterious dungeon delve quite seamlessly, and there is a lot of play sessions packed into one dynamic mini-campaign.\")\nMap Packs:\nM1: The Wayside Inn\nM2: The Ring of Stones\nM3: Crypt Entrance\nOther:\nItems of Legend (D&D 4E supplemental)\nYou don't have to do anything to get all this.  If you pledged \u00a325 or more for the PDF bundle, it will be automatically added as soon as we hit \u00a311,000.  We have 26 days, so there's a good chance we'll do it!  \nThank you all again for this wonderful response.  It's both humbling and gratifying at the same time!\nCourtesy of Darklight Interactive, all this gets automatically added to the \u00a325 PDF bundle if we hit the target of \u00a311000!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a315000 for the O.G.R.E. mobile app! - ACHIEVED!\nThe OGRE mobile app will be free to EVERY Kickstarter backer!\nYou will have read about OGRE above - now imagine you're running your game and you need a random elf name.  You grab your phone, hit a button, and you've got one.  Or ten.  It was there along with the potion description generator, the random weather generator, the planet generator, and the hundreds of other generators all created on EN World by users of both the website and the app! \nOGRE stands for ONLINE GENERIC RANDOMIZER ENGINE.  There's info about it above, and documentation for the web version here.\nIf we hit \u00a315000, I'll have mobile version for iOS and Android made.  If you're a backer (at any level), you'll get it free.  It'll also be on sale in the appropriate app stores.\nThe potential for this application is amazing!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a321,000 to unlock the exclusive EN World dice bolt-on! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal works slightly differently.  I'm lucky enough to be able to offer exclusive EN World dice (pictured below) as a separate bolt-on alongside the t-shirts, as well as an automatic bonus reward for some higher pledge levels (\u00a3100+).  But I can ONLY do that if I make a certain minimum order.  The stretch goal, therefore, allows me to make that minimum order without being worried about not selling enough of them.\nSo it works like this -- if we hit the \u00a321,000 goal, I'll bulk order the dice, and then begin offering them as a separate bolt-on.  I know it sounds a bit odd doing it that way round, but that insulation ensures the Kickstarter doesn't *lose* money, which would defeat the purpose!\nThe good bit for backers of \u00a3100 or more is that you will get a black EN World d20 automatically included in your reward package as a bonus if we make that target!\nNew Stretch Goals - \u00a327,000 and \u00a329,000 to unlock print versions of WILD SPELLCRAFT and Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns! Plus \u00a330,000 for new art! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal took a bit of juggling of schedules and resources, but it's a very cool one!\nThe two new Pathfinder PDFs, detailed above, are incredibly useful.  But I would like to make them into gorgeous, colour softbacks!  So the deal is this:\nIf we manage to hit \u00a327,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Wild Spellcraft!\nIf we manage to hit \u00a329,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns\nIf we manage to hit the lofty heights of \u00a330,000, I will commission a bunch of new colour art for both!\nAs you know, if you've pledged the \u00a325 PDF deal or higher, you're already getting the PDFs - guaranteed.  You will still benefit from this, though - because your PDF will benefit from the new art and layout being commissioned for the print version!  So the PDF you're already getting will look better!\nAnd if you've pledged \u00a3100 or more, guess what?  I will send you one of those softcovers (your choice) for FREE as a bonus item.  Yup, all you have to do is let me know at the end of the Kickstarter which you want. (Hey, and you're already getting an exclusive black EN World d20!)\nBoth softcovers will also be available for purchase separately at your online vendor of choice (RPGNow, Amazon, DTRPG, etc.) at a later date.\nAll that IF we hit the goals of \u00a327,000, \u00a329,000 and \u00a330,000 respectively.  That's quite the challenge - but these books are awesome and useful enough that they deserve to be on your bookshelf!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a336000 for FAFNIR's TREASURE! - ACHIEVED, BABY!\nThis latest reward/stretch goal is courtesy of the fine folks over at Fate of the Norns.  Please pay them a visit!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a339,000 for an OSR Gem - the 1977 4th Edition Tunnels & Trolls PDF!\nVery kindly donated by the fine folks at Flying Buffalo!\nBolt-Ons are optional bonus items that you can add on to your existing pledge.   Simply add the appropriate amount to your pledge.  So, if you have the \u00a375 pledge and you would like a t-shirt, you'd alter your pledge and increase it to \u00a395.  If you want two black d20s, you'd add \u00a310.  Note that backers who have pledged \u00a3100+ automatically get one free black d20.\nFor t-shirts, please add \u00a35 if you're not in the USA (sorry - that's where they'll be shipped from!)\nFor dice, shipping is free in the USA and the UK. For up to 10 dice total, please add \u00a35 for Canada and Europe, \u00a310 for the rest of the world excluding Australia and New Zealand, and \u00a320 for Australia and New Zealand (sorry!) Add the same again foe each additional 10 dice or multiple thereof!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter, you'll need to let me know which bolt-ons you chose.  Don't worry  - I'll be sending out a survey, and you'll be able to note that you selected a bolt-on!\nDice - set of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 (blue/green dice assorted randomly): \u00a320\nDice - single black d20: \u00a35\nT-shirt: \u00a320\nMen and womens' t-shirts, exclusive to this Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be EN World's third Kickstarter, after we successfully raised funds for Admiral o' the High Seas (a naval sourcebook for Pathfinder and 4E) and To Slay a Dragon (an adventure). For this particular Kickstarter, I'll be hiring coders to specifically rewrite certain features to specification; the most challenging part of that is locating reliable coders within the budget, something I've had a great deal of practice at over the last decade. To that end, I have already sourced these coders in order to ensure that, should the funding be raised, progress is quick.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I've discovered working on Kickstarters is the management of stretch goals -- in the unlikely event that we manage to exceed our target, it's important not to set stretch goals which drastically inflate the time period required to provide rewards (which goals like \"OK, instead of a 32 page book, it will now be a 500 page book!\" tend to do). The current stretch goals are all rooted in that core functionality we lost; any later stretch goals, should there be any, will not affect the time required to provide existing rewards.\n\nThe final - and most difficult challenge - will be that of reaching out to the community, to gamers, to publishers and garnering the support I need to make this happen. I do know that the EN World community has proved itself to be incredibly generous in past years, and that many of my publishing friends and fellow website owners have been very supportive. I hope they will be again!\n\nREGARDING BACKUP STRATEGIES -- a number of people have asked \"why didn't you have backups?\"\n\nWe did. The database was entirely backed up (if you go to EN World right now, you can see that every post, thread, and user is still present and correct - no data was lost).\n\nThe code, on the other hand, consisted of a heavily modified vBulletin 3.x codebase. It was a decade old, and subject to exploits over the years. In short, a decade after it was installed, it was no longer secure or reliable -- that's why the hackers were able to get in. In short, it was vulnerable, and the backups of the code were therefore also vulnerable. I made the decision, therefore, to upgrade to the modern, supported, and far more secure vBulletin 4.2. The effect of this was that our code was all rendered obsolete/incompatible. I couldn't just use it again; it was for a different version of the core codebase. \n\nHopefully that explains why I couldn't just use the backups. I could have, but if the site had been restored to exactly how it was before the hack, the hackers would have immediately jumped in again the next week using the exact same method.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Latest Silver Lifetime Subscriber Rewards", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

No worries about rolling them into a heater duct or losing them to a hungry pet. They will stay firmly attached to your hand. Unless you\u2019re a zombie\u2026 then no guarantees. \n  Made from stainless steel - Our rings are made from the highest quality 316L stainless steel, a very strong and durable alloy that resists scratches, dents, and unorthodox abuse (troll punching). Like most other jewelry (even gold), it is an alloy. This type of steel contains 10-14% Nickel. For anyone who does not have a sensitivity to Nickel, these rings will be perfect for you. Unfortunately, we just could not get a hold of any adamantium or vibranium. \n  Produces fair rolls - The numbers are well distributed across the outer spinning band. There are no concentrations of high/low numbers, so they cannot be purposely aimed for or avoided. No cheese rolls.\n  Occupies idle hands - It is an awesome accessory to occupy idle hands and calm your mind. Spinner rings (also called worry rings) are frequently used as a stress relief tool, and are beloved by people with ADD everywhere.\n   Stylish - With these you are looking nerd chic!\nCurrent Available Styles\n(27 Dice Rings, 1 Life Counter Ring)\nr4\nr6\nr6pips - dots instead of numbers\nr8\nr10\nr12\nr20\nr24\nr100\n2r6\n2r6pips - dots instead of numbers\nrCards - draw a random card, including chance of a Joker (the star)\nrFudge - gives the sum result of a 4rFudge roll\nrYN - \"Yes, No\"\nrRPS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" in symbols\nrRPSLS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock\" in symbols\nrElements - \"Fire, Water, Air, Earth\"\nrDirections - \"N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW\"\nrAlignment - Left Band: \"Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic\" | Right Band: \"Good, Neutral, Evil\"\nrAttititude - \"Hostile, Unfriendly, N (for Neutral), Friendly, Helpful\"\nrHitLoc - \"Head, Chest, L Arm, R Arm, L Hand, R Hand, L Leg, R Leg, L Foot, R Foot\"\n3r6\nrHeadsTails\nrElderFuthark\nrTarot\n3r6pips\n3r6sums\nrEnglishAlphabet\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\n$345K - rMoonPhases - 8 phases, using symbols\n$360K - rChineseZodiac\n$375K - rFudgeScale - \"Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, Superb, Legendary\"\n$390K - 2r6sums - Actually a single spinner, showing sum results of a 2r6 roll\n$405K - rEmoticon\n$420K - rWesternZodiac\nRenderings for the new rings will be made after the project closes, so you can see what they'll look like before you have to choose your styles on the end-of-project survey.\nNOTE: Any rings that have 2 bands actually have a physical divider between them, creating 2 distinct grooves for each band.

This same background rule applies to see if the Minor Arcana card was pulled right-side up or up-side down. \nA = Ace, P = Page, Kn = Knight, Q = Queen, K = King\nWhat's so great about the r24?\nHere is some information put together by one of our backers, Greg Rebholz.

This is an animation to show how it works. The purple part in the middle represents a steel wave spring. We used red and purple to distinguish between parts, but the Life Counter is only available in all the same colors and sizes that the Dice Rings come in. Red and Purple are not available as color options.\nThe life counter ring is NOT a normal Dice Ring. It will be more expensive to manufacture because of the wave spring and notches. We also need more time to polish the design before sending it into production, which may take a couple of extra months. If you add an LCR to your order, it may delay shipping (see shipping info below).\nFor this project, you can replace a Dice Ring with a Life Counter Ring by adding $5 for each one. This conversion does not work with rings from the GAMBLER, CLASSIC PLAYER, MONOCHROMINATOR, or DICE RINGS FANATIC rewards, because those are sets of specific rings.\nPrintable Holiday & Christmas cards\nLet that special someone know an awesome gift has been ordered for them and will be with them soon.\n\"Holiday\" printable pdf\n\"Christmas\" printable pdf\nINSTRUCTIONS\nSTEP ONE: Print the file you like best. Make sure you select \"Fit to Page\" in your printer's dialogue box.\nSTEP TWO: Fold your card along the grey, dashed line down the center of the page.\nSTEP THREE: Trim off the excess paper.

(referred to as \"her\" for simplicity)\nScenario 1 - scatter a large selection of cheaper rings across her front steps in each different size. She will come out, stunned by the strange surprise, but delighted. Wait for her to find a ring that she likes. She will jump up and down with joy and go inside to see herself in the mirror. Quickly gather up all of the rejected rings and run back home. Whichever size ring size is missing must be her ring size. Process of elimination.\nScenario 2 - Similar to Scenario 1, but using bowling balls with different size holes. She will invariably select the ball with the most comfortable sized finger holes. Also, you get 3 ring sizes in one shot! 2 fingers and a thumb!\nScenario 3 - Encourage her to poke a hole in play-dough, perhaps with a disarming inquiry. \"Hey, do you feel a weird rock or pebble in the center of this not-strange giant lump of play-dough?\" Freeze it immediately and use the hole to determine her finger size.\nScenario 4 - Challenge her to a sticky-hands pickpocketing contest, and wrap her hands in inside-out tape! Once the contest is over, preserve her gloves for sizing.\nScenario 5 - Take her to a jeweler and say you are getting her a custom set of brass knuckles. You'd be able to get her ring sizes, it's definitely not romantic, and she would have no idea what's coming. Downside - she'll be disappointed if she really wanted those brass knuckles.\nScenario 6 (Best scenario) - see if you can acquire/borrow on of her favorite rings and take that to a jeweler to see what size it is.\nWhere we\u2019re at \nWe have a manufacturer that produces very high quality spinner rings. We need feedback to see which of our designs we should be producing, and at what quantities. You will help shape the very first sets of rings we bring to market! \n*Design Copyright and patents pending\nWhere your gold will go \nOur manufacturer requires large minimum orders for each ring. Also, if we can order above that minimum, we can potentially drive down costs. Our initial goal will allow us to make and ship our first styles of rings in sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 (if smaller or larger have a high enough demand, we can add them).\nShipping for this project will be handled by hand, so we will be procuring the means to get your rings on your fingers ASAP. \nA masterful website will be built with the quotes graciously provided by you, our supporters. \nStretch goals history\nRINGS:\n$34K - rYN - \"Yes, No\"\n$45K - rRPS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\n$70K - 2nd Color option\n$108K - 3rd Color option\nBonus! - Added ring sizes 15 & 16\n$140K - 4th Color option\nBonus! - Life Counter Ring add-on\n$200K - Half sizes\nBonus! - rRPSLS\n$210K - rElements\n$220K - rDirections\n$230K - rAlignment\nBonus! - r24\n$240K - rAttitude\n$250K - rHitLoc\n$260K - 3r6\n$270K - rHeadsTails\n$280K - rElderFuthark\n$290K - rTarot\n$300K - 3r6pips\n$315K - 3r6sums\n$330K - rEnglishAlphabet\nCurrent demand for new styles\nVoted on by our Backers!\nCAN'T DO\nMagic 8 Ball - 20 options, some with multiple words, won't fit on a ring\nPrice is Right wheel - too many colors, we can only do a single color with steel engraving\nRoulette wheel - 3 different colors, can't do\nREWARDS summary\n$5          Immortal Word-Smith - Personal quote added to our website\n$15        Lone Adventurer - One ring + quote\n$40        The Gambler - rCards, 2r6, r100 + quote\n$42        Gamer Lite - 3 rings + quote\n$70        Multiclasser - 5 rings + quote\n$90        Classic Player - r4, r6, r8, r10, r12, r20, r100 + quote\n$130      Game Master - 10 rings + quote\n$200      Monochrominator - Currently 28 Dice Rings + 1 Life Counter Ring, all in a single color, + quote\n$340      Monochrominator 2\n$800      Dice Rings Fanatic - Currently 112 Dice Rings + 4 Life Counter Rings, one of each style in each color, + quote\nCombining multiple rewards\nIf you want to combine multiple rewards, or you want multiples of the same reward, or any combination in between, just increase your pledge to be able to cover the extra rewards. Do NOT add extra shipping for each extra reward. That only needs to be done once for your whole order (if you are an international backer). Look further down at the \"How much do I pledge?\" table. In most cases, it will be cheaper for you to do it that way instead.\nYou CANNOT stack the MONOCHROMINATOR or DICE RINGS FANATIC pledges. The only way to get one of those is by pledging for it. If they are sold out, then they are sold out.\nAdding additional rings\nIf you have pledged for at least 1 ring <LONE ADVENTURER>\nadd an extra Dice Ring for $15.\nadd an extra Life Counter Ring for $20.\nIf you have pledged for at least 3 rings <GAMER LITE>\nadd extra Dice Rings for $14 each.\nadd extra Life Counter Rings for $19 each.\nIf you have pledged for at least 10 rings <GAME MASTER>\nadd extra Dice Rings for $13 each.\nadd extra Life Counter Rings for $18 each.\nAdditional rings can always be any style, size, or color.\nSubstituting Life Counter Rings\nYou can replace a Dice Ring with a Life Counter Ring by adding $5 for each one.\nHow much do I pledge? This is madness!\nFind the row that matches how many Dice Rings you want. In that row, find the column that matches how many Life Counter Rings you want. Pledge that amount, plus shipping! Choose the reward that matches the color code.\nIf you are in the green area, but pledging more than what is on the chart, use this formula:\nPledge = 13 * (# of Dice Rings) + 18 * (# of Life Counter Rings) + Shipping\nShipping\nIncluding Life Counter Rings in your reward may delay your order by a couple months. If you want the rings as soon as possible, you can split your order. The Dice Rings would be sent out immediately, and the Life Counter Rings would be sent as soon as they are ready.\nTo ship your order as a SINGLE shipment:\nUS & Canada - Free (just pledge as if \"In the US\")\nInternational - Add $10\nTo ship your order as a SPLIT shipment:\n(1st shipment for Dice Rings, 2nd shipment for Life Counter Rings)\nUS & Canada - Add $5 (instead of free, still pledge as if \"In the US\")\nInternational - Add $20 (instead of $10)\nOther interesting tidbits", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt was initially difficult to get the rings to spin smoothly and to land on truly random numbers. Waiting to get prototypes from the manufacturer to see if design changes are effective takes time, especially with the high standards we place on our products. \n\nWith our current manufacturing method, the colors that are possible to produce on steel are black, blue, gold, rose-gold, and coffee. These will become available as the project goes on. Enamel scratches off over time, so we went with a process that changes the surface of the steel instead of just \"painting\" it (called PVD coating). \n\nWe do not know the quantities our project will reach, so we had to push our projected fulfillment date to February to be safe. Our manufacturer has no problem fulfilling any quantity, but higher quantities will delay shipment.\n\nWe also did not know how big the demand for these may be, so we are taking a risk starting with a higher goal amount, but with a huge selection of different styles.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "A Few Exciting Items!", "update_content": "We created a super awesome marketing video that we'd love for y'all to pass 'round!

Dad (Jeff), had asked eldest daughter (Kelsey) to produce an album, and record all the tracks in a modified \"bedroom studio\" at home for her summer job. Kelsey, a violinist and 3rd year commercial music major at Azusa Pacific University, after some deliberation, took him up on it.\n The songs bend across genres from folk as in the opening track \"Why\",\nto our bluegrassy, mandolin driven  \"Every Little Secret\",\n to the jazzy tune, \"I Dont Mind\", sung by middle daughter Natalie.\nKelsey learned the software, the gear, and the joys and tribulations of doing a project like this at home. She was also privileged to work with some amazing people outside of our family (i.e. James Brooks, Chris Retallack, Mark Satterfield, Trent Smith and Garrett Hagwood ). Ultimately, she transformed the songs with her extraordinary ear and vision into final arrangements. Finally, the project was taken to Brian Steckler at Stickhouse Productions to be mixed and mastered and graced with the finishing touches.\nAlong the way, Corey McGuire, Founder of protosong.com, came to generously offer his guidance in the promotion of our music, and thus a facebook page was created, music videos were filmed, and now a Kickstarter has formed. We even have cool kepple band t-shirts and stickers.\nThe story started way before this, however, with Dad falling in love with Mom, they married, and the two of them started raising three little girls in a small town in the California Sierras called Quincy (aka Rivendell). It was there that they instilled in them the same values their parents had instilled in them: to love life and love music and to pursue excellence, with countless life lessons along the way. \nLong before this little short story in the universe, the Great Composer was (and still is) singing and playing all things into existence, to Whom we give our deepest thanks.\nTo see and hear more about the Kepple band story, visit us at www.facebook.com/thekeppleband    or  www.thekeppleband.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCovering production costs for an endeavor of this magnitude can be quite challenging.

I had just finished reading The Magicians, by Lev Grossman, and loved the idea of a person's unhappiness dissatisfaction with the world being the source of their magic. So I came up with the better part of the game, but for teaching English and for some kids I knew had trouble with bullying at school. The kids made up characters, chose their name and we came up with a high school together via world building. The core of the game was largely the same - I gave them points for telling me stories about their character's troubles in school and then they used those points to fight monsters and do cool stuff. \nI always wanted to make a version for Korean and other languages but I always ran into the roadblock of needing someone who was proficient in Korean to mentor, mediate or arbitrate the language learning - until I got a smartphone and started using it for dictation. I came up with the idea to use the dictation app to check for pronunciation and to determine success or failure as a resolution mechanic. The rest is a lot of playtesting, tons of hard work and all of my savings going into initial artwork and editing. \nI'm currently majoring in Korean Education (specifically teaching Korean to non-native speakers) and this roleplaying game is going to be the basis for my thesis. I'm working with industry veterans like Daniel Solis and Ryan Macklin precisely so I can do this game justice and so that you, the backer, know that quality is important to me and this project. This has been a labor of love of mine for a long time and with your help I can actually get it out there!\nIf you hunger for more information about Magicians, you can check out an email interview I did at Futile Position, at Game Knight Reviews or one over at RPG.org, where Rukiara got an article up about her thoughts on the playtest despite falling ill and a trip to the emergency room. In addition, Magicians was recently featured in the Korea Herald! There's another, really nice one up over at Cradle of Rabies now too!\nWant the core idea of Magicians explained to you in under 9 minutes? Check out the interview I did with Ryan Shelton at ROLL FOR NEWS.\nAn interview I did with the guys over at SHARK BONE is up! Here are the show notes I came up with in case you have some specific questions you want to hear answered.\nA few days ago I did an interview with the guys over at ED GAMER, which is a really cool podcast about using games in the classroom and for educational purposes. The guys had me on the other to talk about Magicians and the educational aspect of it. Have a listen! This is a great interview where we talk about the language aspect, the story card element and just how the game is organized and how a game is played.\nI recently did an interview with William, Rudy and Alex over at the MOM'S BASEMENT PODCAST and we talked about Magicians with more of a focus for game designers - about kickstarters, the role-playing and core mechanics behind the language and magic system. I guess we'd have to mark it off as explicit though I think the only swear in there was an exclamation about the amount of money the kickstarter has raised so far.\nJenn of the JENNISODES PODCAST recently had me on for an interview to talk about Magicians and it was a ton of fun. We covered a lot of material - it's one of the longer interviews but touches on pretty much all aspects of the game, the kickstarter, even a bit about RPG culture in Korea so if you're interested for something in-depth with a really fun, energetic host like Jenn be sure to check it out!\nI recently did another interview with Stephen of the POSTCARDS FROM THE DUNGEON PODCAST. It was a really great interview that covered a lot of things rpg gamers would ask questions about I think.\nThe guys at GEEKY & GENKI had me on the podcast a little bit ago and the episode dropped today! If you want to hear a bit about rpgs in Korea, maybe some info you didn't know about gangnam style and Korean culture and what the guys were thinking about for their card pack check it out! I also did a really quick interview recently with METAGAMERS ANONYMOUS which was a  ton of fun. The interview I did for GMS MAGAZINE is now up as well!\nMagicians is about having unlimited creativity without complexity. The only thing that restrains you and your character is your own knowledge of the language because the magic system in the game is a language. Doing away with the necessity of a teacher or even dice, all you need is your smartphone and a few hours a week to game with friends to have fun telling a great story and to learn a language along the way.\nMagicians will connect you to your character, motivate and push you to do more, learn more and make you feel like you're living out one of your favorite fantasy novels. People who love books like the Harry Potter series, the Earthsea books or The Magicians will have a great time using Magicians to tell coming of age stories about students of magic learning about power and responsibility, pride and humility, trying to grow up with the ability to remake the world at their fingertips. \nThe setting takes place in modern-day Seoul and adds Korean folklore, superstition and mythology into the mix to create a dense, unique fantasy setting. Long-standing superstitions in Korea like whistling at night drawing ghosts and snakes to you, or insects and mice stealing souls or turning into people by eating their fingernail clippings are woven into the setting. Nine-tailed foxes seduce the unsuspecting and prowl the night, dokkaebi roam the mountainside along with other mythological Korean creatures like the Bonghwang. Dragons live throughout the rivers and other magical creatures are hidden in plain sight. Characters learn magic, deal with high school and university life, and relearn everything they know about the world - secret magical orders that sew sesame seeds into the skin and practice blood art, strange dogs that have human faces lurk in the shadows, bartering souls back to their owners while those who have lost their own prey on the living.\nWhenever you want to cast a spell, you speak in Korean. There are three systems you can use but the assumption is that you have no knowledge in Korean whatsoever. \nProdigy System: Learn and combine 7 archetypal nouns and 6 verbs to create any kind of spell you can think of. \nApprentice System: Takes the training wheels off and makes it so that you have to come up with your own noun and verb to suit the situation and intent.\nMaster System: Has you speaking in full sentences using target grammar and vocabulary.\nIf you're just starting out you can play the game no problem by just learning how to pronounce 13 words. As you slowly build up your ability you can learn the Korean alphabet, build up vocabulary and then finally start learning how to speak in full sentences. \nThe Korean alphabet is one of the easiest to learn in the world, it was invented precisely so that it can be learned quickly and is completely phonetic. Here's a great little comic by Ryan Estrada, his trick to learning Korean in 15 minutes.\nCards in the game are tools for telling no-prep, fun, collaborative stories. Plot cards are whole adventures boiled down into 10 separate elements that are drawn every round by players to make a fun, interesting and unique adventure every time the cards are used. All players need to start a game is a set of cards and their characters! \nAll games require a system to determine success, failure or how the story progresses when there is conflict. Most games use dice to do this - how you roll affects how the story develops. In Magicians, no dice are required (though they can be used for some things); instead, all you need to do is speak the appropriate Korean words or phrase into your smartphone or computer and a free dictation app will tell you if you were correct or not and if you cast your spell properly. \nThere will be video lessons and free materials for you to watch and download that will help you with everything from pronunciation and the alphabet to more complex grammar patterns if find yourself really wanting to dig in. The PDFs will also have audio files built in so that when any Korean is clicked on an audio recording with proper pronunciation will play so you'll never have to wonder how something in the book is pronounced.\nDaniel Solis (Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple) will be doing the layout for the game.\nRyan Macklin (The Dresden Files, Leverage) is already hard at work editing the book and is doing both development and line editing.\nHaoran Zhang will be contributing most of the interior black and white artwork along with Theresa Simons and Jamie Lafond.\nThe book is going to be about 120 pages, will be softcover with a color cover and black and white interior. It will have original illustrations by Haoran Zhang, Jamie Lafond and Theresa Simons. All the artwork is already paid for and has been commissioned; development editing has been paid for and is nearing completion. This kickstarter is to cover the cost of design and layout, line editing, book printing and shipping.\n*UPDATE* Instead of a 120-page softcover, the book is going to be a 180-page hardcover. However, this means that the book will NOT be available in April and will have to be pushed about 10 weeks. \nThere will be an improved playtest document that can be used to play and provide feedback (if you are so inclined) upon the kickstarter's completion at the latest. The physical game I'm hoping to have in everyone's hands by March with the PDF being released as soon as any feedback is taken into consideration, editing is completed and Daniel works his magic.\nAt the student sketch level, you send us a picture of yourself in high school so that we can set you up with a custom character sheet with your high school self on it! I love the idea of being able to choose someone from this booklet for whenever players need a character to come to life in their game. We'll be putting out the booklet separately and free to all backers; that way whenever you play a game it will be like you're playing with other backers!\nAt the professor sketch level, you get to detail the classes you teach. This is one of the ways to limit the type or power of the spells that characters can cast when first starting a campaign. Without class rules, you are only limited by your creativity when casting spells (which may be what you want in your campaign) but adding the option of choosing which classes your character is taking imposes some boundaries on yourself so that you have to be both more creative and specialize in certain types of spells and magic which can make for a fun dynamic at the table.\nAt the professor level you also get to make up your own spell, name it, provide a cool description and I will handle putting in the mechanics and adding it to the book! \n*All these add-ons include shipping anywhere in the world*\nThe signed, numbered, stamped upgrade is the limited edition version of the book. Now that all the books will be hardcover, for helping out with the extra cost of production, shipping, I'm going to get a special stamp made which I'll use to stamp the book. I'll also personalize it by signing it and numbering it and I, of course, won't do this for any books sold after the kickstarter. To keep it fair for all backers and to make it easier on myself, the numbered books will be randomized!\nSecond, Third Book if you'd like to get a second or third book as a gift or to...fill up your bookshelf...I'll be able to provide them at a slight discount, I know it's not much but profit margins are going to be pretty small and more than three books will mean I won't be able to use small parcel shipping so 3 books is the limit, though you can still add in other stuff you may want.\nYour spell in the book is for people who would like to add some content in the book. With the drastic page count increase I'm going to need to commission more art and I'll have more space for more examples. For some spells I will replace or add any examples needed with your own spell and if we get a lot I'd love to make a section for spells you all come up with. You can use a first or last name incorporated in the spell and give me a description of it and I'll add in the Korean mechanics and work on the spell with you. For power levels think similar to Harry Potter - a really high-level spell will kill someone, really big spells are possible but require multiple participants. Send me a message and let me know what you're thinking and I'll work with you on it and I'll provide the mechanics so you just need to worry about something really cool! In particular spells that involve Illusions, Telekinesis, Dispelling, Healing, Precision, Buffing, Clairvoyance, Summoning, Controlling Time and Transformations have a high chance of being illustrated.\n*All of these add-ons can be added to any reward level you choose by clicking on the 'manage my pledge' button and manually raising the dollar amount by however much money is required for the add-on you would like. At the end of the kickstarter I'll send out a survey asking what extra add-ons you purchased for your reward level. Thanks everyone!*\nThe beads, coins and coin pouch can be viewed by scrolling down the page.\nAll T-shirts are from SHIROI NEKO's (white cat) T-shirt line. I will be buying and shipping them here in Korea. All of the shirts are really cool and inspired by vintage manga, retro tattoos, Mexican \"day-of-the-dead\" art as well as other culture aesthetics. Due to the process used when making them, no two shirts are alike and all of them are really good quality, designed in Japan and made in Thailand. As you can see, I will be offering them at a significant discount since I will be buying them from a Korean retailer and friend and then shipping them myself (click on the picture to see the American store). The shirts are only offered in medium and large sizes. \nIf you would like to add a T-Shirt to your pledge, please add $40 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nAll beads are made by Buddhist monks here in Korea. They are high quality and look great. On one side they have both Chinese and Korean writing that says \"health charm\" on it and, on the other, a Chinese zodiac symbol. Upon the completion of the kickstarter, a survey will be sent out in which you can specify which zodiac symbol you would like to have on your beads. These beads inspired a part of the setting as the beads allow access to the school for magic through the great gates of Seoul.\nIf you would like to add a set of beads to your pledge, please add $15 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nThe coins can be used for drama points in the game, whenever players earn them in certain scenes they can grab some and place them on their character sheet in the representative places. The coins are 19th century Korean coin replicas and are very cool, they've got some heft to them as well.\nIf you would like to add a set of 50 coins to your pledge, please add $20 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nThese are some cool, traditional silk pouches you can use for keeping you coins in if you like. I'm only going to be sending out the bigger ones that are about 18cm wide, 24cm tall and can hold well over 300 coins I think so you should be covered. They come in all kinds of colors: plum, dark plum, purple, light purple, orange, light orange, pink, light pink, green, light green, navy blue, sky blue, jade, a light yellowish green, yellow, light/dark brown, red, mustard, pearl grey. \nIf you would like to add a coin pouch to your pledge, please add $8 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nSince we couldn't properly demonstrate the mechanics behind casting spells in regards to using your smartphone to check pronunciation and to determine success or failure, here is a short video to show you what it's like!\nHere is an example of how to use the free dictation app, Dragon Dictation, for iOS in Magicians to determine if you cast a spell successfully or not. You don't have to write down the spell in Korean on your phone if you don't want to of course, you could always just write it down on some paper and if it matches, good! Also, the pdf will play back proper pronunciation of all Korean words in the book so even if you don't have a smartphone you could say your spell, click on the word in the pdf (or do so via google translate, naver, etc) and if it matches, good!\nThe guys over at the Mom's Basement Podcast sent me an Actual Play podcast of them playing a session of Magicians. There is some swearing in there, so be aware of that, and is only audio but it should be useful to see some of the mechanics in a game with different, more serious play compared to our video above and one not led or facilitated by me. You can check it out at the Magicians website complete with show notes.\nFor anyone that is supporting multiple kickstarter projects check down here every now and then to see if you're eligible for a free adventure made in collaboration with other project creators as an extra thank you!\nA Tragedy in Five Acts is a kickstarter project run by Matthew McFarland who has already seen a kickstarter through to a more than successful conclusion. The game is role-playing game in which 5 players work together to create a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. If you're a backer of both Magicians and A Tragedy in Five Acts at a level that gets you the game, $10 or more, you will get an adventure in the form of a 10 card pack created by Matthew McFarland entitled \"Cloud-Capped Towers\", inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest for free as a thank you for supporting kickstarters like ours!\nMotobushido is a kickstarter project run by Nathanael Cole that is about samurai, dueling and motorcycles - think Sons of Anarchy mixed with The Seven Samurai. All of those backers who happen to be backing Motobushido at the $25 level and up will be receiving a free card pack designed in collaboration with Nathanael. In addition, he's going to be giving Magician backers over there a new, exclusive path called the \uac70\ub798\uc790 or the Dealmaker! Pretty awesome!

I am coming to you and Kickstarter in the hopes of creating and producing a collection of comics, pulled from the first year of d20monkey. This is my first Kickstarter project and I'll be honest, I'm as nervous as a virgin at a prison rodeo. I'm sure once a few days pass, my nerves will settle down. sure they will. Hopefully, this grabs your attention and you'll read on to the campaign below. Thanks so much for your time.\nFor more information on d20monkey visit www.d20monkey.com\nd20Monkey: The Short Version\nd20Monkey focuses on the lives of gamers and longtime friends, Sam and Brett. Throughout the comics contained within you will experience gamer habits and culture, game sessions based on unlkely holidays, witness fist fights with Santa Claus, and the wrath of a heartbroken DM. However, the most important thing I hope to bring across with this collection is my lifelong love of gaming and comics, packaged in an all-in-one tome.\nWhat Makes First Edition Special?\nPrinted on high-quality paper, this 156 page of comic goodness measures 8\u201d x 8\u201d and collects every D20Monkey comic from October 2010 through November 2011. These comics include the first Christmas story, Sam\u2019s introduction to Larry the DM, and the Evil Sam storyline. Additionally, I am going back through the archives correcting typos and reformatting the earliest comics to match the size/format of the current comics. In addition to the reformatted comics, First Edition also contains over 40-pages of bonus content including early character sketches, designs, notes, and full character bios. I love webcomics and digital medium but there is just something special about holding a comic or trade paperback in your hands. I want this collection to be above and beyond anything you\u2019re expecting.\nI Cannot Do This Without You\nWith your support, I want to do all of the work to make d20Monkey: First Edition a reality. For any cartoonist, a collection of work is a major milestone and serves to set the pace for years to come. I want to be that guy and I am asking you to help make that happen. As many of you already know, printing (especially full-color printing) is not cheap. All funding received will directly support the printing, freight shipping to me (that is a huge chunk) and the delivery of d20Monkey: First Edition and rewards with an estimated February 2013 release.\nStretch Goals\nOkay guys! With the initial goal in the homestretch, here are the first Stretch Goals for the project. Some of which, I believe to be a nice mix of obtainable and ambitious.\nWhat are the Reward Levels?\nWOO!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLeading up to the launch of this campaign I've worked to reformat old comics for the book and the d20monkey site, as well as beginning the prep work needed to lay out the book. Over the course of the 30-day campaign, I will complete the layout process and additional content for the printer to roll into production as soon as possible. Regardless of whether or not the funding goal is met, I will have a full PDF ready to go. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind if the goal is met and the production process begins:\n\nThe books will be produced through a Canadian printer with overseas connections, resulting in an estimated 90-day turn around time for printing and freight shipment to my place here in Nashville. Granted, there are a lot of things that can hiccup along the way that are out of my hands (poor printing, shipping delays, etc) but I will not accept sub-standard quality of goods.\n\nHowever, I conducted a lot of research before beginning this project, as well as consulting with other comic publishers for printer recommendations. I feel confident in the printers ability to deliver a quality product on schedule. If something does go wrong, you will know first, along with the steps being taken to correct any issues.\n\nAll of the backer rewards will be handled by my proven sources for t-shirts and prints. I have worked with these vendors many times over and have zero concern in their ability to deliver quality products on time. In regards to the one-of-a-kind boner fairy doll, Designs by Anna has assured me that a February due date will not be an issue.\n\nI am a firm believer in constant communication and timely updates. As a backer, you will see the production process from start to finish and you will the first to know about any and all events during production. I want you to see where your dollars are going and share in the experience.\n\nI am excited to make this book (and the rewards) happen. I took the time to research printers and vendors capable of delivering the products I want to offer, with the highest possible quality.

Take it.\nOne Shot is a tabletop roleplaying game about sacrifice and vengeance. Two people work together to tell the story of the Shooter, a normal person wronged, and set for revenge. One player plays the Shooter, on their path to their one shot. The other plays the Forces, the world and people around and in the way of the Shooter.\nVengeance is a sharp, messy thing. One Shot doesn't shy away from that. There are no safe spaces in this game; it's two people working through what it means for one human to exact their vengeance on another. Each game session is self-contained, personal, and intimate. The Shooter strives to achieve their goal at a high personal cost. The Forces play all of those personal obstacles. \nOne Shot is honest, intimate, and personal.\nWhat happens when a normal human has a chance to do something that most people only dream of? What happens when a personal vendetta consumes someone's life? What will you be willing to sacrifice in order to take your shot?\nBased on the Simple Six System by Sand & Steam Productions, the mechanics get out of the way, and let the story take center stage. One Shot is designed to tell a full story in one session, including character creation.\nAlways Open\nEverything produced by Sand & Steam Productions is produced under a Creative Commons Attribution-only license.  That means that once the project is done, you can use the game, the arts, whatever, for any project of your won, as long as you attribute the creator.\nAs well, the game is being developed openly.

If possible every playtest will be broadcast live on G+, and archived on YouTube.\nI believe very strongly in doing everything that I do with Sand & Steam as publicly as I can. I've learned how to do what I do thanks to the good examples that others have set for me. I hope to serve as a good example foranyone who\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nThe funds raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of One Shot in both digital, and print form. As well, any additional funds will help pay for a revamping of the Sand & Steam website to bring it in line with the company's goals.\nWho's on the project?\nTracy Barnett (Writer/Designer) - Owner of Sand & Steam Productions, and writer of School Daze and the Simple Six System. All-around good guy (and modest, too).\nAdam Jury (Layout) - Layout designer extraordinaire, and co-author of the award-winning Eclipse Phase. He also freelances, which is how I got so lucky as to work with him. Check it.\nLeah Huete (Art) - Photographer and artist, Leah is bringing a gritty, real-world touch to the pages on One Shot. The images you see here in this Kickstarter come from her, and are samples of the style of artwork you'll see in the final product.\nJez Gordon (Backer Rewards) - Jez has provided art for a number of RPG products, and will be providing character portraits for the 12 GAUGE tier. Check out his work.\nGeorge Cotronis (Backer Rewards) - George has created covers for a bunch of RPG products, incluidng Don't Lose Your Mind. He's branching out into character portraits for this project, and will bring his visceral style to One Shot. Here's his work.\nSoundtrack\nAs a new addition (as of 10/19/12), Tim Morrison will be providing a soundtrack for One Shot. All of the music will be released as a digital download, and all backers of $15 or high get the soundtrack! Here's a sample:\nMotobushido\nA new, 11th hour promo has been added to One Shot!

This Character Pack will feature a brand new Path, Bike, and Fighting Style, designed specifically with the \"one last shot at vengeance\" themes of One Shot in mind.\nStretch Goals!\nEchoes of the Past ($6,000) - If the campaign gets to this level, I will gather and compile an archive of video and audio clips. These clips will be artifacts from the lives of Shooters; loved ones' last words, angry phone messages, ransom demands, you name it. All things that Shooters keep in their minds as the fuel for their revenge. Maybe even some final moments of vengeance.\nPaths of Words ($11,000) - If the campaign hits this magnificent goal, I'll begin taking submissions for a fiction anthology inspired by One Shot. The goal would be to get around 15 authors to contribute. I'm putting out feelers, and if folks commit, I'l be listing them here.\nAuthors Who Will Submit Stories for the Anthology:\nJohn Adamus, Jason Andrew, Jason L Blair, Jennifer Brozek, Joseph Devon, Steve DiPesa, Matt Forbeck, Hal Greenberg, Jess Hartley, David Hill, Will Hindmarch, Sarah Hood, Tracy Hurley, Shoshana Kessock, Mur Lafferty, Selena McDevitt, Katie Pugh, Josh Roby, Brie Sheldon, Ree Sosebee, Pete Woodworth, Filamena Young\nOther Goals - I'm open to other suggestions for stretch goals.

I was hoping we could hit $3000 by the end, and we did it with 9 days left! Thank you all so much!\n\nFirst, a big new goal, then a few smaller goals along the way in case we don't get there..\n\nIf I can get to $5000 by the deadline, I'll do THREE issues in one volume as a perfect-bound trade paperback, and I'll write them to be a self-contained story. As it stands right now, you're getting two issues in an ongoing series, but at $5000 I'll work it so that one major plot line gets resolved by the end of the third issue. It won't answer every question or wrap up every storyline, but there will be a clear 'through-line' in those three issues, and they'll be collected in one 54-page volume.\n\nBecause that's a pretty big goal to reach in nine days, I'm offering the following mini-goals:\n\nAt $3500, everyone pledging $15 or more will get a print of their choice (in addition to any prints already included in your reward). There will be four to choose from, one of Zoey, and one of each of her three roommates in the dorm.\n\nAt $4000, it becomes two prints.\n\nAt $4500, it becomes three prints.\n\nThis means that if you pledged $50 (the reward that gives you a print), you could end up with as many as all four. Only those pledging $100 will get the rare, limit-15 prints, though. Those backers therefore stand to get five prints - all four of Zoey and her roommates AND the rare, limited edition print.\n\nIn the coming days I'll be posting art of each of the standard prints you can choose from, and some character profiles to give you a bit better idea who each character is to help you choose.\n\nTHE CREATOR\nLarime Taylor is a disabled mouth artist living in California. Life on $750 a month from Social Security isn\u2019t easy, so he supplements his income with his art. Larime draws with his mouth on a Wacom Cintiq tablet generously provided by Wacom. \nTHE STORY \nSome people become killers.\n\nZoey was born that way.\n\nEver since she can remember, Zoey Aarons has felt the urge to kill. For eighteen years she resisted those urges and fought to be someone better than her base instincts would allow. In a moment of weakness and anger, however, she let go and took a life. That hazy Seattle summer day still haunts her, and as she begins college far away from home, she's afraid that she will kill again.\n\nShe's right to be afraid.\n\nInstead of leaving that fateful day behind her and starting a new life as a college freshman, Zoey's about to be tested and face temptation in ways far greater than she could ever imagine. The prestigious women's college that she's attending on a full academic scholarship is in Cutter's Circle, California, and Cutter's Circle has a dirty little secret: it has the highest population of serial killers in the country. The town is up to its proverbial severed head in murderers.\n\nCreator Larime Taylor grew up on the deadpan humor of eighties cult classic Heathers, the quirky absurdism of Edward Scissorhands, and far too many bad slasher flicks. Mixing tongue-in-cheek black comedy with gritty drama and suspense, his resulting creation proudly wears its influences on its sleeve. He writes, draws, tones, and letters the book himself, which is envisioned as an ongoing monthly series of 18 black-and-white pages, densely packed with content in the vein of FELL.\nTHE IDEA\nI'm wanting DARK ZOEY to become an ongoing series at a creator-owned publisher, and rather than simply sending a pitch and 5 sample pages, I want to send potential publishers an entire, finished #1. That's where YOU come in.\nBy helping me cover the costs of creating and self-publishing this issue, you'll get a copy of it of your very own. If it gets picked up by a publisher, great, but either way you get a copy. The best case scenario is that you get a rare #1 BEFORE it gets published and hits shelves. The worst  case scenario is you get a comic book you helped create. \nIt's a win-win situation.\nIf things go REALLY well, who knows? I might just continue self-publishing.\nTHE ART", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "Books To Ship", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Sylv Has Cancer", "update_content": "I've had to change dates for my trip to SDCC this year - I'll be there Saturday and Sunday now instead of Friday.

Gamers have created lifelong friendships because of this game and come in all walks of life; firefighters, educators, computer programmers, entrepreneurs, and yes, even a few documentary film-makers.\nFILMING THE DOCUMENTARY\nWhat it feels like to be interviewed.\nWe love this game and the people that we've met while shooting it. They deserve our best efforts to create something really special. And you, our audience, also deserve something special, to know the story of D&D. A story that needs to be told so that people know how important Dungeons & Dragons has been in our culture. That's why we've set out to create a definitive look at Dungeons & Dragons. And we need a lot of help.\nWe've already shot hours of footage and spent the better part of a year putting this project together. It's been an amazing experience. But we've done all that we can and spent as much as we can afford. We still have a long, challenging road ahead of us.\nWe need to interview people all over the country, find folks who were there at its creation, talk to experts to explain to us why this is such an important game. We also have archival footage to find and pay for. Once we get it \"into the can\", we then have to cut all of that footage together. We need to edit, add music and include some fun graphics, etc. We then have to sound mix it, master it and put all the finishing touches to make it look great.\nAnd we'd like to get all of it finished by 2014, the 40th anniversary of the first publication of Dungeons & Dragons, when the first boxed set was released.\nThe good news is, we travel light. With almost 40 years of film making experience between the three of us, we know where to cut corners and shave time without ruining the integrity of the film. We're filling in where we need to and putting on different hats. With just the three of us, we have to. But now, we need your support to elevate this project to a new level. That means hiring a small crew and paying them slightly more than indentured servant wages.\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nAnthony and James conferring.\nWell, because we love the idea of Kickstarter. We think that Dungeons & Dragons (the game and the documentary) is a perfect fit for this grand experiment. It's a game that's affected millions of lives and there's a built-in community behind it. It was a game made for groups of people and we felt it was a natural conclusion that it should be a film made by groups of people.\nThat's where you come in. We need your support. It's an expensive project and yes, we are asking for a lot of money. But rest assured, transparency will be our focus and our mission. We will be updating our blog, sharing on our social media sites, sending out reports and making sure that every dollar we spend is accounted for. You will be with us the entire way, at every interview, during the edit and at the mastering. We will need your support making decisions, helping us spread the word and see us through the moments of despair.\nThis is what makes the Kickstarter idea so exciting for us. That you, our investors, will be with us, that together we can make a great film. Something we can all look back on and say, \"yeah, you know that cool little doc about D&D, I was a part of that.\"\nWHY WE NEED WHAT WE NEED\nAt the original, long-abandoned TSR offices in Lake Geneva.\nMaking a movie isn't cheap, but we've managed to cobble together some figures that might help explain what we need and why need it.\nIf we get our goal of $150,000, we get to shoot the film. This is the minimum we need for actual production, crew, equipment, flights and lodging.\nIf we get $250,000, we get to edit, add music, mix the sound, add some graphics and do the Mastering. We get to pay for the archive footage, which, we are learning, is expensive. This pays for all the finishing costs. The $250K level brings everyone to the first of our FIRST STRETCH GOAL, a beta version of our smartphone app: GAMER FINDER. Find gamers around you using your smartphone's geo-tagging features. Now, if you want to play a game and your friends are too busy, just use your app to find gamers near you.\nAt the $500,000 level, we get to market the film. Yes, marketing is expensive. Even the extra $250K is never enough. This helps us send it out to film festivals (Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca, to name a few) and eventually, cross our fingers, sell the film to a distributor so they can get it to theaters. The $500K level brings everyone to our SECOND STRETCH GOAL (and this one, we are very excited about). Everyone who donated $100 or more will automatically receive the Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary Companion Book. This beautifully bound, illustrated book, published by Green Ronin and edited by James Lowder, will chronicle the creation of the documentary and will include essays from interviewees and other special guest contributors. Those who payed less than the $100, will be given the opportunity to increase their pledge to the $100 (or more) level and we will send the book along with your other rewards.\nFINALLY\nIf you can't help us monetarily, help us by spreading the word. Share your stories on our social media sites, follow up on what we're doing with our blog and website. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about how influential this game truly is. Everyone should know the legacy of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson and how they changed the world. We hope that with this documentary, they finally get their due.\nThanks, everyone.\n\nA FEW CLIPS\nADDED REWARDS\n- At the $3,000 Level, you can have this one-of-a-kind item. Once someone snatches this reward up, it's gone. What you are pledging for is a Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary Banner that we've had specially made. We will have everyone who either worked on the film or was interviewed sign their autograph.

I'd never read it, or at least I don't remember reading it, but I was profoundly moved by it. It was strange, but it's like a personal metaphor of the way my life has been going for the last two years. There are things happening around me, big things, personal things. Some will happen sooner than later. \nI find myself disturbed by the tone some things are taking in the industry. Darkness where darkness didn't dwell, bitterness for the sake of \"relevance\". it seems that in certain corners, there's no room for magic, and light. It bothers me more than I can say. This not to say that superhero stories can't be serious, or adult. However you can achieve those things without making them dire, and unlikeable. I need to be the one to make the changes I want to see.\n I can only say \"I\" because my tastes only end at the tip of my nose. There is room for fun, there is room for magic, there is room for genuine good in comics.I need to be the agent of change now. I've been moving towards it, now I need to step up that effort.\nOh, the places I will go.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Jamal Igle and I\u2019m a 22 year veteran of the comic book industry, having drawn everything from Action Comics to Firestorm the nuclear man, 52, Countdown, Daredevil/Shi, Iron Man, Iron Fist/ Wolverine, KISS, New Warriors, Noble Causes, Nightwing, Spider-man, Supergirl, Superman and Zatanna. My work has appeared in projects for the European market such as L'arm\u00e9e Des Anges for Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9 and Perry Rhodan, reprinted in a number of languages internationally. I\u2019m also a former editor, marketing executive and art director, I\u2019ve worked in television animation on series such as Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles and Max Steel. Last year, I received the Inkpot Award for achievement in comic art. Currently I\u2019m completing work on KISS for IDW Publishing and SMALLVILLE Season 11 for DC COMICS.\nWHO IS.....\nMolly Danger is the story of the world\u2019s most powerful 10-year-old girl. A seemingly immortal, super strong hero, Molly has protected the city of Coopersville for the last 20 years.\nAn animated styled Molly treatment Rich Maurizio and I drew in 2004\n\nKept in constant isolation and watched closely by D.A.R.T. (The Danger Action Response Team) an organization created to assist in her heroic deeds and monitor her movements, Molly battles the Supermechs. A team of cybernetically enhanced beings with unusual powers, Molly always defeats them and yet they always managed to mysteriously escape. Molly longs for a real life, with a real family, something she\u2019s been told she can never have. Her life changes when D.A.R.T. recruits a new pilot, Austin Briggs. Briggs has his own motivations for joining the team, newly remarried; Austin is having trouble forming a relationship with his new stepson, Brian. Austin wants to use his connections to impress Brian, an avid Molly Danger fan. However things get turned on its ear when Molly and Brian form a friendship of their own.\nShe believes she\u2019s an alien, whose family died when their ship crash-landed on Earth and before the atmosphere could fully alter them. She also believes that she\u2019s alone, the last of her kind.\nEverything she knows is wrong.\nThe Origin of Molly Danger\nThe original character turnaround sheet I drew back in 2001\nMolly was conceived originally on a car ride with my friend, Rich Maurizio back in 2001. At the time we were trying to pitch Molly as an animated series but later decided to re-envision the project as a comic book series. We began production 2002; with the intention of self-publishing through Rich\u2019s company Airwave Comics. \nAs my career picked up it became harder for me to take the time to draw the book. We then hired another artist (Sonic the Hedgehog Artist Jamal Peppers) to redraw the script I had written at the time. Eventually the project fell apart due to time commitments. I never abandoned the concept and would continue to revisit the possibility over the next three years. In the mean time, life changes. I signed a six-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. I got married and had a daughter; I became a teacher and a lecturer, traveling around the world to conventions and conferences. In all that time, I never abandoned my girl. \nIn  2008 I became the artist of the comic book series, Supergirl and something became very clear to me. Whenever I would talk to fans, two things kept coming up. One was the lack of all ages\u2019 material in the U.S. Comics market. The second was the lack of female heroes who weren\u2019t an offshoot of a male hero or weren\u2019t sexually exploitive. That\u2019s when the seed really began to take root again and why I\u2019m now attempting this massive undertaking. This is my solo first creator owned project. I also co-created the miniseries Venture with Noble Causes,Dynamo 5 and Near Death writer/ creator Jay Faerber in 2003. \nThis, however, is a story that I feel needs to be told and that now is the time to tell it.\nSample art\nWhat will the money be used for?\nMolly Danger is planned as a 4 book 8.5 x 12 Hardcover, European format Graphic Album series scheduled to be published beginning September/October of 2013. I'll be re-writing the script and redrawing the book, since I think I've improved artistically since 2004.\nEssentially you're pre-ordering this limited edition. \nThe money will go to the production, printing and shipping of a Molly Danger: Book One limited edition of 2000 copies available only to Kickstarter backers. The funds will also be used to create and ship the incentives being offered.  Any additional funds raised for  Book one will immediately be used for Book Two and so on. The series is set to ship bi annually (Two books per year) and once completed will be packaged as a collected 200 page graphic novel.\nWe also stretch rewards planned should we surpass our initial funding goal.\nAs you may be aware, producing a book of this type, in the format size and scope I'm planning is an expensive endeavor. The money raised will be used to hire professional talent to help me flesh out Molly's world.\nArt by Sonic the Hedgehog artist, Jamal Peppers \n I have assembled a top-notch creative team in inker Juan Castro (G.I.Joe: Snake Eyes for IDW, Incorruptible for Boom Studios, Elders of the Rune Stone) and Colorist Michael Watkins (Sonic the Hedgehog, Transformers).\nI've teamed up with Action Lab Entertainment, a publisher known for their high quality, all ages, creator owned products, such as the Glyph award and Will Eisner Award nominated series Princless. They also feature other diverse genre projects such as Jetta: Tales of the Toshigawa, Fracture and Double Jumpers.\nFormed by four independent creators with over 20 years of media experience and creator-owned content, Action Lab Entertainment\u2019s goal is to develop, create and distribute original comic book series as well as create original animated and various forms of entertainment that challenges and competes with the media industry as a whole.\nConcept art of the Supermechs Bonnie Double, Two Fisted Tommy and Lil' Cavey\nWhy aren\u2019t you drawing it now? Why wait until December?\nMostly because I\u2019m currently busy with other projects, However I'm currently hard at work writing a new draft of the book one script. The plan is to begin penciling in December and have book one completed by July of 2013\nWhy should I pledge to this project?\n Molly Danger is a concept and a character that I believe is needed in the current marketplace. I\u2019ve been in this business a long time and have watched it become darker and direr for years. As the father of a young girl, I\u2019ve found myself disheartened that there isn\u2019t a female superhero character for my daughter to read that hasn\u2019t been turned into a killer, or overtly sexualized. A character that isn\u2019t joined at the hip to a male hero or subservient to one. I like to think of Molly as a cross between Astroboy and the Powerpuff girls, the perfect type of character for young, burgeoning superhero fans. \nThere's room in the comics market place for more all ages action adventure stories.\nI believe in Molly, so much so that I'm putting my money where my mouth is. One person who pledges $10,000 dollars or more will receive 38 pages of original art from Book one. Ten others who donate $1,000 or more will receive a page on top of the other incentives I'm offering starting with:\nThe D.A.R.T.  Membership Card which will give you exclusive members only access to the Molly Danger production blog. Backers will be able to track the development from scripting, to design to finished pages, etc.\nNot final product\nMolly Danger T-Shirts and More!\nAll rewards will be shipped in stages\n The membership cards will ship to all backers first followed by posters, T-shirts, preview material and the rest. There will be new rewards shipped to each backer at each stage of completion.\nThank you for taking the time to look at my Kickstarter page and for your kind consideration.\n$500 commission reward sample", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "The new Molly Danger Campaign is now live!", "update_content": "We're up and running.

The idea is to produce the issues, have them ready for solicitation before hand and ready to print so that they ship on time.

You can use wet erase markers and the huge pile of tokens you'll be getting along with it. Yes, it's kind of weird that one of the rewards for our digital, space saving gaming grid is a normal, non-space saving gaming grid.\nPersonal Tokens Designed By Lost Decade: 1 Available to \"Troll\", 4 available to \"Giant\", 6 available to \"Golem\", 12 available to \"Lich\" and above.\nJust like the custom tokens you can design for yourself, except for these you'll get to tell the good people at Lost Decade precisely what you want and they'll make it for you. As before, the tokens can be just for you or shared with the whole universe. Lost Decade still won't break any copyrights or do anything lewd.\nVinyl Gaming Mat: Available to \"Minotaur\" and above.\nWe'll print out our basic gameboard, with a stylish 20x20 (or maybe more) grid of 1\" squares, on a vinyl mat and send it to you to play tabletop RPGs on. You can use wet erase markers and the huge pile of tokens you'll be getting along with it. This also gets the prize for most ironic reward. \nDesign a Tileset: Available to \"Golem\" and above.\nGot a campaign in mind? Angry that we didn't publish tiles appropriate for your homebrew steampunk insect people time travel campaign? You're in luck. You can design a full tileset, either yourself or with the help of the people at Lost Decade games, which will be made available to either just you or the entirety of our userbase. Nothing lewd, be nice to copyright holders, etc.\nSmart Device With A Gelaskin: Available to \"Lich\" and above.\nIf you were thinking about replacing your smartphone now's your chance to do it for a mere $5000 (or more). The good news is that you'll be supporting us and you'll get a lot of other stuff. We'll also put a gelaskin on it designed by our own Andrew Kostuik, sign it... we'll also think you're awesome. Really, really awesome. You pick the device, basically any currently made iOS or Android phone, tablet or handheld device. \nCustom Development: Available to \"Dragon\" level backers.\nYou know what feature we should add to this? Well, tell us. We'll put it in. As long as it takes 20 hours of development time or less we will include your feature. If we think it's really, really awesome, we might be willing to put in more. You should probably email us before getting this.\nGaming Session With Brass Monkey: Available to \"Adventurer\" level backers.\nIf you can get yourself to Boston we will run a 24 hour gaming session for you and up to 4 of your friends. We will provide a venue, food, drinks, an adventure, an appropriate screen to use Dragons Gameboard in all of its glory and iPods with custom gelaskins for all of your guests... which they can keep! Somewhere between one and three of us will run the game session in any system which we know the rules for.\nNaming Rights: Available to \"Giant Space Hamster\" level backers.\nHave you thought of a better name for this product? Do you think it should bear the title of your favorite PC, NPC, significant other... house pet, whatever? As long as it's not lewd, doesn't infringe on copyright and in any way indicates what the product actually is we'll let you change the name of the thing, we'll change our logo to be whatever you want and as long as people use it they'll have to refer to it by whatever title you've given it.

Also, you'll want to read this as well. I know it's lengthy but there's a lot of information you'll want to have for the weeks and months ahead.\nBacker Reward Levels: This project has grown astoundingly in the last few weeks. Stretch goals have taken us way past what we initially offered for rewards. But Kickstarter doesn't allow us to edit the rewards listed on the right hand side. So, instead of looking there to see what each level gets, scroll down to see a complete list of rewards for each level and the shipping costs for each for those outside North America.\nModify Your Reward: You can tailor your reward by using the \"Manage My Pledge\" feature. Look toward the bottom of the page for a list of Reward Add-On items you can add onto your existing reward. Just add the appropriate amount to your pledge. When the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll be asked which add-ons you want.\nQuestions? Please check out the FAQ at the bottom of the page before contacting me directly. Also, asking a question in the comments allows other backers to chime in with answers to questions that have been answered many times before.\nPayPal: If you would rather pay for a backer level via PayPal, click here.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe have reached 30 different stretch goals in this project. To take a look at the list of rewards we have already achieved (it's worth it), click here and scroll down a bit. \nLatest Stretch Goal Reached: $450,000. If we reach that point, we'll add significantly more art to the corebook and the hardcover books in the line. Like, say, at least 15-20% more than we were planning (and these were already art heavy books). This is going to make these books downright lavish, in my opinion. REACHED!\nNext Stretch Goal: At $500,000,I'll produce a Numenera short film. This might be animated, or it might be live action. I honestly never thought this would even be in the realms of possibility. If it happens, it will certainly be a way to reach a lot more people about the game in the future.\nT-Shirts: These are now available to backers! Check out the Reward Add-Ons.\nMen's Back\nMen's Front\nI'm really excited to announce that I'm working on a new game called Numenera. It's a far future, science fantasy, post-apocalyptic game with streamlined rules that prioritize the story, the action, and the wild ideas. If you're a fan of outside-of-the-box gameplay such as that found in Planescape, Dark Space, or Chaositech, the far-future stories of Gene Wolfe, Michael Moorcock, or Jack Vance, or mind-blowing visuals like those found in the work of French artist Moebius, you're going to love Numenera.\nNumenera is set a billion years in the future. Civilizations have risen and fallen on Earth. Even though the current inhabitants live at about a Medieval level of technology, the leftover remnants of these advanced societies lie all around them. Some of these are extremely helpful: advanced tools, valuable means of communication and learning, transportation, defenses, and weapons. Others are dangerous: genetically altered monstrosities, flesh-warping radiation, creatures transplanted from distant stars, and clouds of out-of-control nanobots, just to name a few. This setting, called the Ninth World, provides all manner of opportunities and challenges to those that call it home.\nThe game system that drives Numenera is meant to be fast-moving and simple, so that it facilitates the stories the group wants to create, the imaginative places and creatures the GM needs to describe, and the mind-blowing ideas the world encourages. Everything in the game is designed with these goals in mind. \nI've assembled a great team to work with me. Artist extraordinaire Kieran Yanner is the lead artist. He and I are working together to create a unique visual look for the setting. The excellent Shanna Germain is the lead editor, and she and I are working on some amazing concepts both for the game and the presentation of the material. I've got the developers at 3 lb Games designing an app that will make it easier and more fun to play with your smartphone, tablet, or PC. But I'd love to see you join the team too, either as a backer, or even a contributor (see the backer levels for more information).\nFor more information, go to Numenera.com. There is a lot of information there about the game, and much more is coming! And keep checking back for frequent updates and more previews!\nThere are many backer reward levels, each offering different things. Below you will find a detailed list which is much more accurate and complete than what is listed on the right hand side of the page (which we cannot edit at this stage). For more information about these individual rewards, click here.\nPlease let me draw your attention to THE REAL DEAL, however. This is the main package and an incredible value. For $60, you get the printed hardcover corebook, the PDF of the same book, a PDF of the Player's Guide, and PDFs of three 32-page adventures, the Ninth World Bestiary, Sir Arthur's Compendium, the GM's screen, and more.\nALL LEVELS\nContribute a quote\n6 HD Wallpapers\nNumenera Theme digital download\nDABBLER $3 Level\nApp (Android, iOS, or PC)\nSUPPORTER $5 Level\nApp (Android, iOS, or

People who make content learn to like it, because they want to make content, and they also want to eat food and sleep under a roof, and the opportunity to do both at the same time seems like a pretty good idea. \nAfter the \"dot com bubble,\" we ran the site entirely on donations for over a year. The word crowdfunding hadn't been invented yet; back then, people simply called it \"begging,\" but I think it's clear that those days are long past. We look back on that period with incredible fondness, and I don't think we're the only ones. It was just two of us then, not the juggernaut that it is now; we have mouths to feed, as it were. I think we had assumed it wasn't possible to do it that way anymore - to operate a site at this scale without advertising dollars - but it occurred to us that we'd never actually asked. People often want to know how they can support the site in a way that doesn't involve t-shirts or looking at advertising, and I think we may have a way. What I'm saying is that we want to sell out, and we would love to sell out to you. \nHow Do You Intend To Do That\nBy doing this. \nLeaderboard Ad Removed, $250k Goal\nThat's for the amount you see on the right. If it turns out to be something people want to see, or not see as the case may be, we'll add stretch goals to restore old services we used to offer, convert the entire site to a Creative Commons license, and ultimately remove every ad from the site for an entire year. We intend to be a company that succeeds by making things, specifically things for you, and are orienting ourselves toward that goal. \nAll ads on homepage removed. $525k goal\nSo, we're turning to you. Would scouring ads from Penny Arcade, with everything that entails, be something you\u2019d be willing to reach into your pocket for? The more we considered it, the more we agreed it might just be. Not only would you no longer have to look at advertising when browsing Penny Arcade, but not having ads would create a chain reaction that would lead to a bunch of other interesting stuff. Without the almighty \"pageview\" to consider, why not populate the RSS with full comics and posts? Why not enable and even encourage apps, first and third party, for people to read it however they damn well please?\nThat seems pretty compelling to us, but in keeping with Kickstarter tradition we\u2019ve greased the wheels with a buffet of backer rewards and stretch goals. This is an amazing experiment in our opinion. If it doesn\u2019t work Penny Arcade will be fine. We\u2019ll keep going just like before with no interruption in service and nothing will change. But if it did work, I mean, wow.\n\nThat would be something. \nStretchgoals:\nUpdate #1: $550k Stretchgoal\nOne of the things that excited us most about the idea of trying an ad-free model was the amount of time it would give us to actually make comics. Currently, we do all kinds of creative services projects that are part of the existing model, but in their absence, that's all time we can put to work for you. We have a ton of weird settings, and ideas for more, that are simply not possible with the schedule the current system imposes. What we're talking about would be new projects, in settings you already like, that run ALONGSIDE the week's comics, not in their place. Like, oh, I don't know... THIS?!?\nWe have quite a year planned, if you're game.\nCW(TB)\n-----\nUpdate #2: $325k Stretchgoal\nAdditional Revelations! \nWe're just revealing things right and left around here. It would be our great pleasure to acquaint you with Automata: Silverside in lieu of our typical \"creative services\" work. The first of these projects unlocks at $325,000, and we're chomping at the bit. Or champing at it; I can never remember if you chomp or champ. In any case, there won't be anything left of this bit by the time we're done. We're going crazy on it!\n(CW)TB\n-----\nUpdate #4: Penny Arcade Leaderboard Stretch Goal Unlocked! Stretchgoals up to $999k revealed.\nIt's unbelievable, but the campaign has reached our first funding goal of $250k in four days. We've been blown away by the support thus far, and the interest from people outside the industry makes us think we might be on to something here.\nAs promised, we are revealing the stretch goals up to $999k ... behold! (check out the updated list up top!) The new goals we've revealed are:  \nJerry Cosplay: Jerry has agreed to Cosplay as the character of the community's choice (by vote) for one day at both PAX East 2013 and PAX Prime 2013. \nStrip Search Web Show: Discussed in a flurry of tweets, Penny Arcade: The Series Season 4 will be our version of America's Next Top Webcomic titled... STRIP SEARCH. This incredibly ambitious and expensive production will bring together over 10 up and coming webcomic hopefuls for a week of grueling challenges and horrifying social experiments, hosted by Mike and Jerry. For what? A considerable cash prize and integration into the Penny Arcade offices for one year. \nTwisp & Catsby Children's Book (free online): Mike and Jerry will create and publish online (for free) a Twisp & Catsby Children's Book. \nOriginal Tabletop Adventure: Mike and Jerry will write a completely original tabletop adventure, not tied to any particular system, to be released for free. \nFree PA Comic Reader developed for iOS and Android \nPA Blanks/Creative Common License: We will release, with each Monday, Wednesday and Friday strip, a blank version of the comic (art without word balloons) for your editing and remixing enjoyment. In addition, we will open the ENTIRE PA archive to a Creative Common License under CC BY-NC-SA. \n-----\nUpdate #5: Automata Project Unlocked, More Lookouts Info, Comic Sketch Reward and Additional Q&As!\nWe\u2019ve just crossed the $325,000 mark, meaning the Automata strip for 2013 is LOCKED IN. As a teaser, Mike created this image to give you an idea of what\u2019s in in store:\nOur next goal is to make Jerry cosplay as whatever you want him to, which for those in the office is VERY EXCITING. If that goal is met, we\u2019ll first open submissions via an online survey, and then select the top 5 choices by raw #s. From there, we\u2019ll have another online vote-off.\n\nLooking down a bit further on the stretch goal list, Jerry also wrote this piece to go along with a new sketch by Mike for the Lookouts, Daughters of Eyrewood:\n\ndaughter, daughter,\nkilled her father\nlook at what her\nblood has bought her \nNew Reward - Original Comic Pencil Sketch\nThis isn\u2019t a reward you\u2019ll find on the right side but is actually one that applies to ANYONE that contributes more than $2,500. You will receive in the mail, one of the original pencil sketches from the Penny Arcade archives (and for those donating $5k, you\u2019ll receive two, and so on). \nThese sketches are what are scanned in and digitally inked, so each online strip has ONE pencil sketch associated with it. These are the ORIGINALS. (please note, the strip you receive will be at random) Since Mike no longer does the pencil sketches ahead of time, this part in the process no longer exists making these extra rare.\nWe've also updated the FAQ with some additional questions. Please check them out below!\n-----\nUpdate #6: $350k reached, new rewards added!\nWe crossed the $350,000 mark over the weekend, so it looks like this thing has some legs. After listening to a ton of feedback, we have a few more rewards that may interest you!\n\nPrecipice Promotional 1 GB Flash Drives - $250 (30 available)\nWhen we made Precipice of Darkness, Episode 1, we had manufactured 50 USB Credit Card drives (seen here) for media kits, etc. With this reward level you\u2019ll receive this Flash Drive in the mail filled with the digital versions of Books 1 and 2 and the remastered Jerry tracks! We have two versions of the drive (Gabe and Tycho) \u2013 which you receive will be picked at random. Add $10 for International addresses.\n1 lb of Jerry\u2019s Coffee Roast - $300 (10 available)\nJerry will ship to you a one pound bag of his signature coffee beans that he roasts himself. Add $10 for International addresses.\n\nLogo Design by PA Design - $1500 (10 available)\nGive Kiko and Erika the name of your company and a synopsis of what exactly it is you do, and delivered to you will be the one-colour AI/PDF/PSD files for your further manipulation. This is the team that designed the PAX Logo, the Trenches Logo, the Child\u2019s Play logo, etc.\n\nBrew with Jerry - $2500 (4 available)\nIt\u2019s no secret Jerry loves brewing, and this reward gives you the opportunity to brew with Jerry in Seattle. You only need to handle your transportation, and Jerry will take care of the rest. Must be 21 or older.\n\nPing Pong. Your Team vs. Team Inferno - $5000 (1 available)\nInvite you and up to 9 of your friends for an officially sanctioned match against Team Inferno in Seattle, WA. The most expensive pizza you have ever purchased will be included. You just need to handle transportation.\n\nPA will crash your birthday party - $5000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry and possibly some other people will crash your party and totally eat all of your food and drink everything in your fridge. Must be in the Seattle area.\n\nKhoo will plan your bachelor party - $7500 (1 available)\nThis is for planning and day-of execution only. Robert Khoo will take whatever your pre-determined budget is and plan a\u2026 uh\u2026 experience for you and your friends. A more detailed description to this reward would be against the code. See PA:TS S02E28 for reference.\n\nMike and Jerry DM - $8000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry will be your DM for you and 3 of your friends, running an adventure just for you. You just need to handle transportation to Seattle.\nWe\u2019ve also been getting some really interesting ideas for stretchgoals from readers \u2013 if you want to suggest some before we announce our next set of them, send an email to ks@penny-arcade.com. Thanks!\n-----\nUpdate #8: The Final Cosplay Vote + More details on Strip Search\n(Note: Skipped #7 since it was just the initial cosplay vote)\nWe've crossed the $375k mark, meaning Jerry is on the hook for cosplaying as the character of your choice. We did open submissions in Update #7, and after over 15,000 suggestions, here are the top 5 to vote on:\n\n1. Bayonetta\n2. Sailor Moon\n3. The Fruit Fucker\n4. Tycho\n5. Yummy Chan\n\nHonorable mentions go to Strawberry Shortcake and Lollipop Chainsaw. ;)\n\nAlright, vote here!\n\nGabe also just posted an update on Penny Arcade about Strip Search, but you can read it here as well:\n\nI admit to being a huge fan of reality tv style game shows. I love shows like So You Think You Can Dance, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Master Chef. I even watch shows like Ink Master and Shear Genius. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s singers, chefs, fashion designers or gardeners. I love watching groups of people pushed together to compete at something they are good at. I don\u2019t know a thing about cooking or dancing but I can\u2019t get enough of these game shows. I\u2019m always amazed when the challenge is something like \u201cmake a fruit tart\u201d and one guy says \u201cshit I\u2019ve never made a fruit tart before\u201d and then he proceeds to make a fucking fruit tart. I could never do that and maybe that\u2019s why I love watching it so much. Could you pull a theme out of a hat and then write and draw a comic strip about it? Probably not, but I\u2019m guessing you might like to watch people who can.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea for our new show Strip Search. It is the next goal in our Kickstarter and It is a reality game show for web cartoonists. Like any of these other shows I mentioned it is about watching incredibly talented people face off in a competition with a reward that could change their life.\nIn the case of Strip Search we are talking about ten people. Each one of them a talented cartoonist. They will all live together in a house here in Seattle. They will compete in a series of challenges that will test their skills and we will slowly whittle them down until we are left with one winner. This cartoonist will win a cash prize along with integration into the Penny Arcade machine. That means a studio in our office but it also means access to our business people, our merchandising operation, our designers, and our ping pong table. The winner will get plugged into the Penny Arcade family for one year. We will not own any of their work, and there will be no evil contract to sign. We will just be there to support them and help grow their comic in a way that very few other organizations could.\n\nTycho and I will be the hosts and participate in the judging but we won\u2019t be alone. We are very lucky to have friends in every corner of the industry from syndicated newspaper comics to book publishers, and web comic pioneers. We\u2019ll be bringing these folks in as guest judges and mentors throughout the competition. You\u2019ll also see everyone here in the office working with these contestants. It\u2019s a huge undertaking for us but incredibly exciting I think.\nThere is something magical about watching a comic strip come together. I think Strip Search is a show that could appeal to a much bigger audience than anything we\u2019ve done before on PATV. So if you could help us get the word out I\u2019d appreciate it. Tell your friends who like reality TV and tell them to tell their friends. I\u2019d love to see Strip Search get funded and if it does we are very close to the goal of all ads removed from the home page and our Daughters of the Eyrewood Lookouts comic.\n------\nUpdate #9: More Lookouts Art, a New Reward, FAQ Update, Jerry Cosplay\nWith 15 days left, we've raised almost $400,000, which is nearly a half-a-million dollars, which is basically a million! Right? Or...? Listen. We don't have time to thrill you with our incredible mathematics right now. It's time to reveal the terrifying revelations of Kickstarter Update 9!\n\nMore Lookouts!\n\nGabe drew more concept art for Daughters of the Eyrewood to further entice you:\nI know this level seems out there, but we still have 15 days! We are also adding another reward level at $50 for a hi-resolution, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the above Lookouts image sent to your door. Please add $5 for international addresses. (this level also includes all previous rewards!)\n\nJerry Cosplay Poll Results!\nI'll be honest, I'm actually a little shocked at the result. The winner is... the Fruit Fucker? I just feel like... that doesn't have a lot of shame-factor to it. This was an opportunity to really get some ridiculous photos of Jerry, and the community chose the Fruit Fucker? All right, we'll try to do something with it that will maximize embarrassment.\n\nOh! And I forgot to mention in the last update with honorable mentions that we also got a lot of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew suggestions, which would have also been really funny.\n----\nUpdate #10: Kickstarter Shirt Revealed!\nWe\u2019re less than $40k away from hitting our Strip Search stretchgoal, and we figured you would want to see the Exclusive Kickstarter T-Shirt commemorating the campaign! \nThis is at the $150 reward level and also includes The Dickstarter Print, Digital Versions of Books 1 and 2, Remastered Digital Singles of Jerry\u2019s PA musical works, an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the Lookouts image from Update #9, a copy of Rainslick 3, names for your band AND your pet by Jerry, thoughts of you during coitus from Mike, and of course, the glue that holds this whole campaign together, Mike chasing a duck around while he shouts your name.\n----\nUpdate #11: Strip Search UNLOCKED! Call for entries begins NOW.\nWe\u2019ve just hit the $450k/Strip Search stretchgoal! We move fast, so it\u2019s time to get the process rolling. May I present to you, the initial call for entries.\n\nAs mentioned in previous updates, the winner will get office space (for free!) at Penny Arcade HQ in Seattle, WA AND access to all of our facilities and resources (Mike, Jerry, Biz Guys, Merch Guys, etc) for one year on top of a $15,000 cash prize.\n\nThe deadline to submit is midnight, 8/24/2012 (TWO WEEKS FROM NOW). What you\u2019re applying for is to be on our new reality show, Strip Search, later this year. The process to get to our final participants will be incredibly thorough, so please know this is only the first of many steps.\n\nSome quick notes on the show:\n\nThere will be no cost to you, other than your time.\nYou will be asked to sign a video release.\nYou will be asked to sign an NDA.\nYou will NOT be asked to sign anything regarding the rights to your existing or future works.\nYou need to be 18 or older and legally be able to enter the United States.\nYou will need to take about two weeks of your life later this year for this and this alone.\nIf there are any other questions, please ask them below, and I'll get them answered.

Just add $5 to ANY reward level for an extra copy for a friend. Get as many as you like.\nUpdate #4: Brandon Quinn joins the cast!\nUpdate #6: Jennifer Hale joins the cast!\nUpdate #11: A Taste of the Music.\nWhat type of game is this? Imagine experiencing a real life hostage situation where your next move means life or death for your friend. Oh...and it's played in real world time.\nWhen you get the opportunity to work on something as creatively groundbreaking, and technologically cutting edge, as \"The Hostage Trials\" what can you say but \"Hell yes.\" - David Hayter -\nFirst of all...don't think of it as a mobile game. It's more like a game you play while mobile.\n\"The Hostage Trials\" is a narrative game with a story. It's also a social game that you play with a friend. It's a game played in Real World Time that keeps you on your toes. It's like an ARG (alternate reality game) but not quite. We've come up with our own term for it that just seems easier.\nIt's called an RTMA. A Real-Time Mobile Adventure and because of the unique game play, it can only be played on mobile devices. Let us explain.\nMost mobile games are pretty casual affairs allowing the player to pick up their phone and play a few rounds until they lose interest. And while these are fun for a while, we were looking for something that required a little more from the player, something that gave you a real sense of accomplishment. And last but not least, we wanted something that just felt...well...more real.\nThat's what spawned the idea for \"The Hostage Trials.\" Imagine that one day you're minding your own business taking out those annoying green pigs when you get a strange call on your phone from an unknown number. The mysterious voice on the other end then informs you that one of your family members or friends (that you choose) has been kidnapped, and you need to follow very specific instructions in order to save them! That's the basic premise of \"The Hostage Trials.\"\n\nIt's all about time.\nAs a player, most of your interaction with the game will come through phone calls with different characters. The most important of which is \"the villain.\" But unlike a traditional \"pick up and play\" game, the player is at the mercy of \"the villain.\" He could call at any time and when he calls...you'd better be ready!\nPlaying a game in Real World Time also means that any references to times of day or periods of time are literal. If the villain says you need to do something before 9pm, you'd better do it!\nSo how often does he call? On average you will get one call a day from the villain at a random time where he will give you a challenge in order to keep your friend alive. He may give you a window of time to expect his call, or he may not. Depends on what kind of mood he's in. What happens when you miss a call? Well you'll just have to live with the consequences, whatever they are. Remember, we're going for realism. You can also expect to get a random text or e-mail every so often.\nNow because you'll be communicating with the villain so often, it goes without saying that the better the voice, the better the game.\nHave you ever wanted to hear what Snake would sound like as a villian? Now's your chance!\nDavid Hayter made Solid Snake's voice legendary and has now committed to play the role of the villain in \"The Hostage Trials!\" You can't believe how much we're geeking out about this. It's gonna be epic! Just think. Everyday you'll be expecting a disturbing call from David Hayter! YEAH!\nTHE CAST SO FAR...\nWe're still casting for the other roles in the game and we'll be sure to keep the backers updated on this front. Suggestions are welcome so use that comment board!\nWhat will the game look like?\nFirst of all, this is very much an audio based game and many if not most of the game's challenges will force the player to depend heavily on their ears. Our backgrounds are in sound design and we are working hard to craft a unique auditory experience.\nThat being said, the visuals for the game will be quite simple. We're going for realism with this game so the user interface will be made to look like that of a standard smart phone. Think of it as a virtual game phone complete with all of the necessary apps. It's your portal into the world of \"The Hostage Trials.\" You'll have a contact list, a dial pad, email and texting apps, a banking app, and more, all contained within the game. The villain will also have the ability to send you specialty apps for specific purposes throughout the game. We don't want to spoil too much of this beforehand since it will be way cooler to find out as you play.\n\nHow long are the trials?\nThe game will be divided into four different difficulties. There will be:\nA 3 day real-time trial.\nA 7 day real-time trial.\nA 14 day real-time trial.\nA 30 day real-time trial.\nSo it's pretty self explanatory right? Attempting the three day trial means that you have to last three whole days following the villain's instructions in order to successfully retrieve your friend. The seven day trial takes seven days and so on.\nThe game is a complete story. We can't stress this enough.\nWe want to emphasize that this game is a complete experience. Each trial (3-day, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day) is a new part of the \"Hostage Trials\" story, and the story continues all the way until the very end of the 30 day trial. The only way to experience it all is to successfully save a hostage in each of the four difficulties. And we've also got some cool secret content for in between the trials for the backers that pledge at higher levels.\nInitially this may sound like playing this game would consume your life, but it will only take a few short minutes of your day to do what \"the villain\" asks you to do. But that doesn't mean it will be easy!\nIn reality, the time you spend actually playing this game will probably be less than the time you spend on a more casual game that you play at your leisure.\nThere is a reason behind every challenge the villain gives you. Every challenge advances the storyline.\nSimply put, it will feel like someone is really calling your phone. He'll give you tasks and assignments, ask you questions, and get information from you. Some things you'll be able to do right on your phone, others will require a little interaction with the real world.\nIt will soon become apparent that this is more than a simple ransom situation and that the villain is using you for a much grander scheme. The challenges are super varied and will always keep you on your toes.\nHere are some examples of what you might have to do.\nPlace a call to a specific number and see where it leads you.\nTravel a certain distance in a certain amount of time. (not in WiFi version)\nHelp the villain launder money.\nRemotely control an alarm system.\nChange your elevation. (not in WiFi version)\nPiece together clues from electronic documents.\nAnswer questions about your hostage.\nRemotely activate an audio bug at a certain time to hear an important conversation. Do it at the wrong time and you won't hear anything.\nMatch voice prints to help the villain find specific people.\nAnd way more!\nAnother element that we are very excited about is how you'll interact with your real-life friends. Link with your friends through Facebook or e-mail so they can take on the role of the hostage. Every so often, they'll be given \"Hostage Homework\" and using their input, your game will become a completely unique and personal experience. It's their chance to put their own spin on the game. Rest assured that the game will be fun for the hostage too!\nAs the hostage a player will be contributing to the game in a multitude of ways including:\nphotos\nvoice recordings\nanswering questions\npicking challenges\nand more!\nOn the flip side, you'll be able to act as the hostage for someone else's game. Will they have what it takes to save you?\nThis won't be like your typical social game where you're playing 30 games at a time with countless other friends. We want the focus to be on one hostage. That's the realism factor again. At any given time, you'll be able to have two games going. One where you're trying to rescue a hostage and one where your acting as the hostage for someone else. This makes it much more fun and personal.\n\nWhat platforms?\nWe are developing the game simultaneously for both iOS and Android platforms. At times the game uses GPS technology and cellular data so the ideal platform to play it on is a phone. But it will also be available for iPad and users will be able to play on one or both devices. We are also planning to have an option to play with challenges for WiFi only devices such as iPod Touch. This version of the game won't make use of GPS or challenges that require cellular data connections. There will be something for everyone. Rest assured, if you have an iOS device or an Android (version 2.2+) device, you'll be able to play this game.\nWhat's even better, is that it will be cross-platform so iOS and Android users can play with each other.\nThe Rewards and Secret Content\nNOTE: All backers that pledge $30 or more will get two copies of the game. One for you and one for a friend. If any backer wants 1 or more extra copies, just add $5 to your chosen reward level for the number of extras you want.\nWe're determined to keep the cost of this game low when it is released, somewhere in the $5 range so the initial pledge to get the game is super low. But we would need a lot of peeps if everyone became backers at this level. So we've worked really hard to come up with some creative rewards that should be worth your while. Take a good look at the different tiers. We're sure you'll be excited about a lot of the stuff we're offering.\nWe miss the days of secret codes, and we're working really hard to offer certain game content that will be exclusive to our backers so don't miss out on some really cool hidden stuff within the game. None of this is necessary to beat the game, but it will enrich the gamer's experience.\nThere are FOUR different tiers that offer access to exclusive game content ($10 $20, 30 and $75). We vow to never release the information to these secret sections to anyone but the backers that pledge at these levels. Trust us. These are easter eggs that you won't want to miss out on. Here's a breakdown.\nLevel 1 ($10) - Bridges the gap between the 3 and 7 day trials. \nLevel 2 ($20) - Bridges the gap between the 7 and 14 day trials.\nLevel 3 ($30) - Bridges the gap between the 14 and 30 day trials.\nLevel 4 ($75) - Includes the physical dossier on the villain and some really cool secret game content that no one will be expecting.\nThis secret content will include additional mini-games and story elements that the non-kickstarters will miss out on. And just to clarify. This content is not an additional download or patch but already contained in the game. You just won't know how to access it unless we tell you how!\nOther Rewards\nAs for our awesome t-shirts and hoodies, we'll be coming up with additional designs so they'll be more than one to choose from.\nFront: logo Back reads: \"I backed The Hostage Trials...he left me no choice.\"\nThe hoodies, unlike the t-shirts, will be exclusive to backers.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBoth Jared and I come from film backgrounds and specifically sound editing and design. This is why so much of this game is about the audio. As the player, you have to listen more than look. Our part in this along with being the designers of the game is to be the leads over all of the audio elements of the game. We'll be in charge of the voice over, the sound effects and design elements. incorporating the music and so on.\nAs for the programming side of things, we need more personnel. That's why Gnarly Tooth has teamed up with Social Jitney based out of San Francisco. We knew that we needed an awesome team of programmers that had a proven track record and experience developing something that hadn't been done before.\nThis is the same team that helped Bad Robot Interactive develop Action Movie FX. They've worked on a ton of critically acclaimed and successful apps such as Zombie Highway and the ultra popular music app Band of the Day. We know that working with Social Jitney and using the audio assets we will provide, we can bring the vision that we have for The Hostage Trials to life. This process has already started but we'll need more funds to take the game all the way through every phase to completion.\nIn my film experience (I have a little more since Jared is still finishing school) I've worked on award winning sound teams, most recently on Transformers 3, the Ben Affleck directed Argo, and the upcoming GI JOE: Retaliation. We've been on Hollywood's biggest sound stages with some of it's biggest stars. With so much of this game relying on the voice over and the quality of the sound, you can be sure that we know how to get what we need. We can utilize the best ADR stages and voice over supervisors, and we have access to the knowledge and know how of some of Hollywood's most experienced veterans in sound. So...\nHere's the breakdown of funds.\n45-50% of funds will go toward the actual programming, gameplay design and visual design. We want the game to be done quickly and efficiently, in other words, by pros.\n40-45% will go towards the actors, recording studio fees and sound design. (This is a SAG production and there are minimums that we can't go under.) And we need to record A LOT.\n10% for the standard fees and taxes.\nThanks for taking the time to check out this project. We hope you'll consider backing us. Our goal is to truly bring a new type of gaming experience to mobile games. And with your input, we hope that we'll be able to make this game even better. We can only do it with your help.\nSincerely,\nJoel and Jared Erickson and the Gnarly Tooth team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Joel and Jared Erickson - Gnarly Tooth\n2 created \u00b7 16 backed\nBrothers Joel and Jared Erickson formed Gnarly Tooth Media in early 2012.

A higher funding level also means that we will be able to interview more people, visit more locations, shoot this film on better cameras, bring in additional and talented artists, designers, cinematographers, photographers, and researchers.\nOUR PROJECT\n\"Fight for Space\" is a feature length documentary film that explores the current state and future of the U.S. space program. Since the Apollo era of the 1960s, NASA's budget has been shrinking and our ambitions in space have been decreasing. We are producing a documentary that will examine the reasons why our space program is not all it can be. We are also going to show that space IS worth the time, money, and energy that it needs, not for only exploration and scientific reasons but for economic, planetary security, and cultural reasons as well. We will also be covering the great scientific achievements that NASA is making right now, and we will be examining the new commercial space enterprise by companies like SpaceX, Sierra Nevada, Bigelow, and more. Many problems have occurred in just the past 10 years that have lead to the consistent underfunding of NASA, the cancellation of multiple space systems, and the decline of America's role in space.\nWe are not producing your average space documentary where we show restored footage from the moon landings and CGI galaxy renderings. We are covering the real political and economic issues of the recent past, today, and tomorrow. We are covering both sides of the argument and we promise to produce a fair and objective film.\nThe fact is, the United States as a nation has lost our edge in space, not just as a leader but even as a participant. We want to know the real reasons behind why we are in this scientific slump and what we can do about it. We are asking hard questions to the people that know what is going on and we will not stop until we receive real answers and real solutions to these problems. We are also speaking with everyday citizens off the street, so we can discover how the American public feels about space exploration. In our democracy, all voices must be heard.\nWatch our coverage of Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson's keynote speech at the National Space Symposium:\nWHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR:\nWe have taken the first step and made an initial investment out of our own pocket to travel to many locations and interview the top experts in space policy, astronomy, engineering, astrophysics, the sciences, and space exploration.\nWe visited The National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, CO where we interviewed: Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Robert Zubrin, Bill Nye, Leroy Chaio, and more. We have visited SETIcon in Santa Clara, CA where we spoke with some of the top minds in astronomy. We have traveled to Huntington Beach to interview Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, a key figure on the house space committee. We have interviewed scientists, engineers, politicians, teachers, students, astronauts, astronomers, and many more.\nAs you can see in our trailer above and our listing below we have already interviewed many noted individuals in the space industry field. With your help we can travel to new locations, obtain more exciting footage, and interview additional people from NASA, commercial enterprise such as SpaceX, the US Government, as well as scientists, engineers, educators, and more. We have been invited to rocket launches by some of the top commercial space organizations and will be able to capture some amazing footage of these events. Only with your support can we succeed.\nWe have received an official letter of interest from PBS for this film and if we receive enough financing, our film will be broadcasted to millions of households all over the world.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nYou can be involved with the making of this insightful and inspiring film. With your help we can bring awareness to this issue and come closer to making our space program a priority for this country once again.\nWe need your help to finish this film. The fact is that we simply do not have enough money to produce this feature length film. By donating to this project, you are helping to ensure that the message will make it to the people and in a big way. We intend to distribute this film as many ways as we can. We will distribute it online, DVD, Blu-Ray, and hopefully broadcast television.\nPlease, support our film by donating above and share this project with your friends, family, and anyone you know who cares about space exploration or cares about the future economic and national security of this country.\nIn order for this project to be successful we are counting on you to share this project on as many social media platforms as you can. We urge the use of Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, E-Mails, phone calls, or just tell people about us! We have 30 days to complete this campaign, please post daily or weekly about our project so all your friends know about us! However you communicate, please share this project with all!\nLINKS\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/FightForSpace\nWebsite: http://www.fightforspace.com\nHD Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYEdougccY&feature=player_embedded\nWE NEED FUNDING FOR\nTravel Expenses\nCamera & Gear Rentals\nCrew Expenses\nMotion Graphics\nOriginal Musical Score (Composed by Star Trek TNG composer Ron Jones)\nMusic Licensing\nVideo Footage Licensing\nMarketing\nPost Processing for Video\nAudio Mixing & Mastering\nBroadcast Distribution\nWHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON\u2019T REACH OUR GOAL\nIf we don't reach our goal then we receive nothing, no rewards will be sent, and you will not be charged, you are only charged if we meet or exceed our goal. We must reach or exceed our goal or this film will not be made. The level of support we receive will directly reflect on the nation's desire for an ambitious space program.\nWHAT HAPPENS IF WE GO OVER OUR GOAL\nWe are asking for the bare minimum amount of money we need to finish this film. If we can exceed our goal then we will use those funds to create an even better and more comprehensive documentary. We will be able to use better equipment, travel to more locations, and interview people that we may have not been able to before. In addition to that we will be able to provide higher quality rewards and give back more to you.\nEDUCATION\nThe United States is rated 23rd in Science. Fight for Space will focus heavily on the need to boost the study of science in our schools. If we don\u2019t reinvest in this essential curricula, we risk America\u2019s health and security. A strong space program will help drive our nation's children to study science and engineering which will help usher in a new generation of dreamers. With this, we won't be 23rd in anything.\nWe are interviewing educators from the elementary school level to the astrophysics level so that we may explore all levels of science education. We will learn how our kids are being taught in the science classroom, what is exciting them, and what is turning them away.\nFALLING BEHIND\nChina's space program is rapidly catching up with us and will surpass us soon at its current rate. In a short amount of time they have launched 4 crewed spacecrafts to orbit and recently launched and docked with their own space station. China has many more ambitious goals for the future including a moon expedition and a mission to Mars. Attention from the mainstream media was limited and did not truly describe the implications of this event. What are they up to, how does this affect us? We are going to find out.\nAlthough we are now allies with Russia, our former space race competitor, Russia has no problem with having ambitious goals of their own. In May of 2012 they stated that they will put a permanent colony on the moon. Media coverage of this announcement was almost unheard of except within those that closely follow space news. Vladimir Popovkin, head of the Russian space agency was quoted saying \"We're not talking about repeating what mankind achieved 40 years ago.\" Clearly Russia has something rather large planned.\nInteresting? You bet it is! Why has this been ignored, and what kind of an effect will it have on the national culture of this country?\nTHE ECONOMY\nWhen interviewing individuals off the street we often hear the answer \"we must fix problems here on earth before we go into space.\" Here's the problem: we will always have problems here on earth. If we wait to solve all of our problems here first, we will never reach the full human potential. We must be allowed to explore, discover, and innovate for the better of all mankind.\nWe are fighting for a strong space program because government handouts, tax rebates, more teachers, or new job programs are not a permanent fix. These are band-aids. We will be able to close this wound permanently if we create a mood and culture that compels the American public to want to innovate and be better tomorrow than they were yesterday.

If you are in the Donors' Circle, you will get to hear scratch tracks and works in progress, as well as some additional cuts or experiments.  If we pass $50k, I will add more songs to the list!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nDear Reader: I am a traveling singer-songwriter living in Alaska. My music is sweet and lyrical and spicy, sort of cinnamon vanilla cayenne something; I'm acoustic but extra funky, layered and nerdy and complicated yet accessible. My artistic godparents are Joni Mitchell, Jonathan Coulton, Regina Spektor, and Ogden Nash.  Like this: http://mariancall.com. Or like this: http://youtube.com/mariancall. I tour North America all the time with awesome guitarists like Scott Barkan, and it's time to adventure farther than I have before.\nI plan to record for you a LIVE ALBUM this year. YESSS!\nI wish to record it in Europe and the UK. YESSSSSSSSS!\nThe plan is to travel in autumn, October-November, with the utterly staggeringly amazing guitarist (and songwriter in his own right) Scott Barkan. We'll record the live album at concerts across the ocean, and make a video too.  We'll mix, master, and launch the live album immediately upon my return to Alaska. To that end we're doing a Kickstarter!  And a lot of other stuff too.\nSo this Kickstarter is how you guys pre-order your live album, MARIAN CALL LIVE IN EUROPE, no matter where you are in the world.  If you just want the album, that's $15.  Snag it in advance and it'll show up on your doorstep this fall!\nYou can get other good things too, like downloads of all my available music at a steep discount ($35), my Quest Log of the Europe trip ($42), voicemail messages in your inbox, ($75), and all my music EVER including unavailable stuff like the Bootleg album ($125). So! Music for you in advance! Or for you to share, if you have it already! Images and details about the stuff can be found at MarianCallAdventureQuest.com.\nIf that's all you need to know, sign on!!!  The rest is just frosting!  The rewards are awesome!\nRewards!!!\nThis Kickstarter is also how you tell me WHERE to play in Europe.  How does it work? It's an adventure quest game thing!\nPledge to the Kickstarter *or* enlist as a volunteer\nYou've earned Questing Coins!! They are imaginary!!!!\nYou'll receive a private link to a survey if you pledge or enlist. \"Spend\" your Questing Coins on the country and city of your choice by filling out that optional survey.  That's a vote for your town!\nAny nation that acquires enough Questing Coins or funds will be added to my itinerary.  You will decide, by voting with Questing Coins, which countries and cities go on the itinerary!  To get a show near you, get your friends and neighbors to pledge (with money) or enlist (for free)!\nNow that the trip is funded, you can simply \"Buy a Concert\" -- meaning you can just make a show happen in your town for enough money.  You are welcome to do it yourself, or go in on a concert as a group or organization.  Write europe@mariancall.com to make that happen!\nThe stats on every nation -- which ones are close to funding, which ones are just starting out -- will be at http://mariancalladventurequest.com. Nations will light up as surveys come in and they gain support! It's awesome! At least I think it is.\nThere are real Gameplay rules, and if you're a nerd like me who's interested in that, read the Rulebook. Here are links to everything:\nMarianCallAdventureQuest.com has most of the details! Visit!\nSpecific details on every item available (includes delivery dates, limitations, etc.)\nRulebook for the MCEAQ\nEnlist! Volunteer information or help to get more Questing Coins!\nFAQ's (I'll keep updating as questions come in)\nMailing list signup\n^^^ this last one is important. Get on the e-mail list.  You are likely to miss a show in your area if you rely on Twitter and Facebook and G+ alone. The e-mail list is the key to everything, no matter where in the world you live!!\nBelow the break, there's some background info and a more detailed bio for you; more info about the game and FAQ's are at the links above. Again, you don't have to do all the complicated Questing Coin stuff unless you want to bring me to a specific city in Europe; most of you can just pledge and be done with it!  Only get as involved as your enjoyment allows.\n{{I love you, Nerd Who Reads Everything And Asks More Questions, because I have thought this through carefully and I hope someone out there reads all the stuff I've thought out. But I'm sure I haven't thought of everything. So read it all if you want to know more, and ask questions afterwards by writing europe@mariancall.com. Note the order of operations: read FAQ's first, ask questions second.}}\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nMarian Call ready to Quest a Quest. Photo by Studio Valette, http://studiovalette.com.\nMore about Marian and the Live Album:\nIn 2010, with the help of thousands of amazing people like you, Dear Reader, I toured all 50 United States and most of Canada -- mostly on moxie and the power of Twitter. I'm a floor-sleeper and a tough traveler; I play 5-6 nights per week together with some incredible guitarists who put up with a lot. We drive hard, we play our hearts out nightly, and I try my hardest to reach the fans who want to hear me as often as possible. I made it through All The States and home again with money in my pocket.  Because my fans are amazing.\nIn 2011, I released a fan-backed double album called Something Fierce. I invented my own pseudo-Kickstarter organization called the Donors' Circle to help make it happen (Kickstarter was still too new to serve my purposes when I started fundraising, but it was along the same lines). The record makes me very very very proud, but I'm especially proud that it was a group effort, me + fans, with almost no middle men. You should hear it sometime!\nAnd now it's 2012. You guys have been asking for a live album for a long time now, since my show in person sounds different than what I do in the studio. So let's do it! This Kickstarter is not just to fund Europe, it's to fund the live album I've been longing to make for you.\nEuropean fans have been asking me to come visit for upwards of five years, and I've attempted twice (to no avail). I just don't have the cash up front for the many expenses that have to be paid before I land. In the U.S. it's just two plane tickets & a rental car, and as I drive and play and sleep on floors, the costs amortize.  To get across the ocean it's a bit more complicated than that.  But I've been touring for years, and I am confident this will work out -- once the funds I'll need up front in hand.  I've posted my budget publicly here to give you an idea what the expenses are, and I'm keeping it on the cheap side (and anticipating earning a little once I get rolling; most of the fundraiser expenses are things I have to pay in advance).\nSo a boost is required.  We get by with a little help from our friends.\nCan I do this? Absolutely I can. I have studied music since I was a child, so my concerts are successful concerts, artistically and emotionally as well as financially; I have played hundreds of shows, I have driven and flown tens of thousands of miles every year, and I have earned my road warrior stripes. I have traveled in Europe and the UK four times -- three times for school and once for personal enrichment -- and I know I can make this happen.\nAnd I know that the Live in Europe Album will be awesome.\nI hope you'll get on board, at the $5 level or the $2000 level. Hopefully this will be my first of many more live albums, and the first of many trips to Europe which will one day fund themselves just like my US tours do.\nLET'S ADVENTURE QUEST GUYS OK READY START!!!\n************************************************************************\nP.S.

The Village by the Sea is a beautiful, horrible place. And I want to take you there.\n\nThe Guide covers neighborhoods, families and coverups and over a hundred years of history, for a town that exists outside of time and place. This could be the town you stopped in as a child on your way to see family. It might be your hometown. This could even be the town just down the road from yours.\n\nThe Village by the Sea was founded on the coast in 1850. Its founding families still exert force on the course of Village history, its borders have crept over devoured nearby settlements, and its piers are washed in blood. The monuments to dead sailors cast shadows in the park. There are always new missing posters outside the market.\n\nThere is never a year without a candlelit vigil for the dead.\n\nI\u2019ve got the village in my blood. I may not be nice all the time, and days of cutesie teen detective work are long behind me. I may have issues, but letting people die isn\u2019t usually one of them. I came back here because I didn\u2019t have a choice, and writing the guide is all I have left.\n\n-\"The Guide to the Village by the Sea,\" Ashley Hart\n\n\nThis is a work of fiction, end to end. You can read it and walk away, or read it and bring your friends on a trip to the Village by the Sea. No matter what role-playing game system you pair the Guide to, That Which Sleeps Beneath will still be waiting.\nThe Guide to the Village by the Sea is a manual for surviving the coastal home of modern horror.\n\nI want to tell you this story. And I want to tell you about the people helping me.\n\nMy editor is Richard Dansky, who was the line developer for Wraith: The Oblivion, currently works at Ubisoft as the Central Clancy Writer. Lisa Grabenstetter, who has done work for everyone from museums to Crossed Genres, is the genius behind the seal of the Village, interior illustrations and art-related rewards. Sarah Troedson is my cartographer, and spends her days working as a GIS analyst.\n\nAs for me, I'm a horror writer and journalist raised in Washington State, which has one of the weirder and more gruesome histories of the territories. I've published a number of strange stories with some very lovely people; The Edge of Propinquity took my first Jewish horror story, and The Irish Times took a shine to a ghost story that grew out of a childhood with my Irish Gram.\nI'm also synesthetic; my senses cross-wire and trigger in overlapping ways. The whole world has tastes, smells, colours and textures for me that are wildly different than one sense tells me. My eyes tell me green but my mouth says something green can taste pink. Fire alarms are painful and echoes can stretch like fun-house mirrors. This is my first book where I leave those sensory impressions in, and get to write in a way that's normal for me. The narrator of the Guide has synesthesia, and it literally colours her perceptions.\n\nWhen you back the Guide, you\u2019re coming for a visit. You\u2019re becoming a part of it, burrowing into every dark shadow and corrupt garden party the Village has to offer. And you get to borrow someone else's senses while you do.\n\nI hope you enjoy your stay.\nVideo Editing: Jeremy Keller.\nAutographing E-Books: Since I've had a few questions about it, I wanted to clear up some confusion. Yes, you can totally autograph an e-book.

Check our blog for larger images of the concept art.\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\nWhile hammers fells like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep,\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells.\n-from The Hobbit (Dwarves Battle Song)\n\u2015 J.R.R. Tolkien\nDwarves have long been a fixture in fantasy literature and games. These sturdy little humanoids excel at taking on great odds and at consuming large quantities of potent ale. Any dungeon crawl or quest that lacks dwarves is depressingly empty. In addition to being a warm and welcoming people dwarves are also often the first line of defense against the slime-ridden denizens of darkness. Despite these laudable qualities, they are considered a lesser race by many of the other humanoids, little better than halflings. The haughty and self-important elves, in particular, seem to despise this diminutive yet noble breed. Help us show those pointy-ears once and for all by making your next hero a dwarf!\n\nThe Dwarven Adventurers Box Set Project is about creating miniatures to represent a set of 5 dwarven heroes. The Group will include a paladin, a berserker, a cleric, a mage, a rogue, a mechanist, and a necromancer.The goal here is simple: get the 7 miniatures sculpted, cast, and distributed to all of you! Depending on the level of funding that the project reaches, the miniatures will either be cast in a durable urethane resin or white pewter metal. The Dwarves will represent a relatively balanced adventuring party and or a selection of dwarven heroes to lead in any fantasy army.\nThe Dwarves will be sculpted on a 28 millimeter heroic scale and will fit well with almost all tabletop wargaming and RPG miniatures. \nHere are some 28mm scale miniatures I've sculpted as studies of popular miniature lines:\nBelow are our Goals! All reached!\n\nWhen stretch goals are reached extra value is added to existing rewards. As we pass these funding benchmarks, these benefits will become available.\nWhen we hit $1500 Character Sheets for each dwarf will be produced and made available to backers in PDF format for each of the dwarves for DND 4th ed. and Pathfinder rules (possibly other rules systems as well depending on demand).\nBecause of the costs involved in pewter casting, it is only feasible for us after a certain order size is reached. When we hit $3000 the miniatures will be cast in pewter instead of resin.\nWhen we hit $3500 An additional dwarf, the Mechanist, will be  produced and included in every box set at the $25 backer level and above. This means each boxed set will contain 6 dwarves instead of 5!\nWhen we hit $4000 Scenic bases will be sculpted, cast in resin, and included with each miniature.\nWhen we hit $4500 Backstories will be written for each of the Dwarves and made available in .pdf format for all backers. This will be written by author S.B. Coates who has recently launched his own project: Zombies Ate My Teacher a family friendly Zombie Survival work of interactive fiction. Check it out!\nWhen we hit $6000 A second additional dwarf, the Necromancer, will be produced and included in every box set at the $25 backer level and above. Now each box set will have 7 miniatures instead of the original 5!\nNw that we've made it past the stretch goals its time for EPIC GOALS!!!!!\nEPIC GOALS are not part of the stretch goal benefits but are an entirely different thing that works exactly the same. How do you access these EPIC GOALS? By pledging or increasing your pledge to a clearly marked pledge level with EPIC GOAL benefits! \nThese benefits are listed below. \nAt the $10,000 benchmark EPIC GOAL a Dwarven Bard miniature will be included in each EPIC GOAL qualifying set along with the 7 other minis.\nWhen we hit $15,000 in backing a ninth dwarf, the Druidess AND her animal familiar (a smaller mini) will be added to each EPIC GOAL eligible pledge level for a total of 9 dwarves and a critter.\nWhen we hit $20,000 The Undead Dwarf is added to the EPIC GOAL eligible box sets to make 10 dwarves total!\nWe've reached all of our EPIC GOALS, it's time for the addition of...\nMEGA GOALS work much like EPIC GOALS in that eligible reward levels include all of the benefits from the EPIC GOALS and Stretch goals but include 5 additional dwarves! All 15 dwarves will be in your hands well before Christmas!\nHere's the rundown on the MEGA GOAL dwarves:\nWhen we hit $25,000 the Monk, a dwarf trained in unarmed combat, will be added to MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 11 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $30,000 the Huntsman, a master beast slayer, will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 12 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $35,000 the Witch will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 13 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $40,000 the Highwayman will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 14 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $45,000 the Fallen King will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 15 dwarves per set.\nWe've reached all our MEGA GOALS... now for our:\nAdd-on Goals are different from Stretch, EPIC, and MEGA goals in that they are not automatically added to a pledge level once they have been reached. Instead, once these goals have been passed, the benefits of the goals may be added to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge by $4.00 per benefit.\nStill confused? Here's an example: Jimmy has pledged at the $40 level and is going to receive 15 dwarves + a critter, the scenic bases, .pdf files of the character sheets and backstories for each mini. He also wants to add the $50000 Add-on goal benefit: the Fighter (female!!!) to his order. To do this he simply increases his pledge level by $4.00 and sends us a message to tell us that the Fighter is the Add-on benefit that he would like.\nAlternatively, Jimmy could add $8.00 to get both the Fighter and the Brewmaster included in his set or $12.00 to get both Dwarves and the set of Dwarven Character Cards.\nNOTE: Due to the additional production time needed, adding Add-on benefits to your order will delay estimated delivery of September 2012 shipments until October 2012. We do not foresee any delay issues with any of the other due dates.\nHere's the rundown on Add-on Goals:\nWhen we hit $50,000 the Fighter (a female!) will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $55,000 Character Cards (Cards with the dwarf's concept art on one side and a brief bio on the backside) will be created and made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $60,000 the Dwarven Brewmaster will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $65,000 the Dwarven Miner will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $70,000 we'll add a bit sprue and a d6 die (with our logo [cause you love us] in place of the one pip) to everyone's order who is getting the character cards. The bit sprue will include the following: a canary, a crossbow, an axe, a sword, a badger, a shield, a pack of gear, a large hammer, and a throwing hammer.\nIf your order includes the character cards than you'll get a die & bit sprue at no additional cost. For orders with multiple sets of character cards that means you get multiple dice & bit sprues at no additional cost.\nFor those of you who aren't hobbyists, a bit sprue is a collection of parts that can be used to enhance or customize the dwarves. To utilize the bit sprue, you'll have to be willing to use a little super glue (or green stuff) and elbow grease.\nAt the 75000 level we are going to have bit sprue 2.0 (full of generic objects) made available at no additional cost to those at the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS. Outside of this level it will be $4 to add-on to your order. Bit sprue 2.0 will include: a bag, a bottle, a treasure chest, a book, a cauldron, a tankard, and 3 dwarven skulls.\nAt the 80000 level we are going to have a small print made of the all of the dwarves at no additional cost to the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS. Outside of these levels it will be $2 to add on to your level.\nAt the 85000 level we are going to have the unconscious dwarf made available to all those at the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS at no additional cost. You can decide if he is unconscious, wounded badly, or dead (yay!). Outside of these levels it will be $4 to have him added. There will be no .pdfs attached to this guy.\nTHE FOLLOWING ARE EXTRAS, NOT ADD-ONS. THEY ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGES!\nAt the 95000 level any Backer (from the $12 Backer Reward Level and above) can add this Troll (for your dwarves to fight) for an additional $10. The troll will be 66 mm tall, he'll be cast in resin. He'll be unpainted ($50 to get him painted [limit 1] for our painted levels). He will not have any .pdfs attached to him. This limited edition model will be kickstarter exclusive. He'll be ready in November 2012 (If you would like him to ship separately from an earlier order add an additional $3 for domestic & $5 international).\nThere has been a small group of vocal commenters that have asked for a blacksmith, so for those who are interested in one: at the 100000 goal level our backers (from the $12 backer reward level and up) can purchase a Female Blacksmith (anvil included) cast in pewter for $4. She works just like the troll and t-shirt. Unlike the troll, she gets a backstory. [Also, remember, if you are not interested in her no need to add her! :)]\nShe'll be ready in November. Painted levels can have her added to be painted [We'll increase the limit on how many extras we allow by 1 to fit her in]. If you'd like her to ship separately from an early ETA box set, then ($3 for domestic & $5 for International).\nFINAL GOAL!\nWell, the idea of progression miniatures was tossed out awhile ago, which led to an amusing discussion about babies and tombstones (it may have gone the way of zombie babies as well). So this is what we've got:\nSo, to our Backers! At 125000 goal level (100x our original goal!) we are going to give every pledged backer (from the $12 backer level and higher) 1 sprue that has a baby dwarf, boy dwarf, girl dwarf, and a tombstone. You read that correctly, IT'S FREE (the first one is free!). We are not planning on painting them (painting levels can discuss this with us via messages). No .pdfs attached to these guys. Bases are not included. The kids will be 15mm to the eyes. The tombstone will be 25mm tall. The baby will be proportional to the kids in size. ($4 for additional sprues - if you want them)\nAdditional info:\nFor the rewards that offer painting: the painting will be done by Mike or by Cam Kendall of Big Squid Studios. Here is a miniature that Mike sculpted and painted. Here is a link to Cam's blog where he put up some of his painted minis.\nMike worked as an in-house painter for Blue Table Painting until May of this year when he decided to pursue sculpting full-time.\nDISCLAIMER: The term \"Box Set\" is a term used in the miniatures industry to denote a collection of miniatures that is sold as such.

This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.  The series will highlight the larger recurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.  I\u2019m going to need your help to make it happen!\nAs a gamer, a pop culture critic and a fan, I\u2019m always working to balance my enjoyment of media while simultaneously being critical of problematic gender representations. With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce. I will be researching and playing hundreds of titles from across the gaming industry (including some truly awful games that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone!). Your support will go towards production costs, equipment, games and downloadable content.\nPlease pledge any amount you can and become a backer of Feminist Frequency\u2019s Tropes vs Women in Video Games!\nFeminist Frequency is an ongoing web series of video commentaries focusing on representations of gender, race, class, sexuality and ability in pop culture. \nLast year I released a video series called Tropes vs Women analyzing female representations in the mainstream media.  This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!

We will be re-launching in July 2012! Look for the newly launched version by searching for \"The Hostage Trials\" in the search box.\n\nCheck out other articles on \"The Hostage Trials.\"\nnerdist.com\ngametyrant.co\nripten.com\nmacgasm.net\nNew World Notes\nTechnabob.com\nWhen you get the opportunity to work on something as creatively groundbreaking, and technologically cutting edge, as \"The Hostage Trials\" what can you say but \"Hell yes.\"                                                                                                                                                                        - David Hayter -\n\nDon't think of it as a mobile game. It's more like a game you play while mobile.\n\"The Hostage Trials\" is a narrative game with a story. It's also a social game that you play with a friend. It's a real-time game that keeps you on your toes. It's like an ARG (alternate reality game) but not quite. We've come up with our own term for it that just seems easier.\nIt's called an RTMA. A Real-Time Mobile Adventure.\nWe've developed this game from the ground up. Trust us. There is nothing quite like it! Because of the unique game play, it can only be played on mobile devices. Let us explain.\nMost mobile games are pretty casual affairs allowing the player to pick up their phone and play a few rounds until they lose interest. And while these are fun for a while, we were looking for something that required a little more from the player, something that gave you a real sense of accomplishment. And last but not least, we wanted something that just felt...well...more real.\nThat's what spawned the idea for \"The Hostage Trials.\"  Imagine that one day you're minding your own business taking out those annoying green pigs when you get a strange call on your phone from an unknown number. The mysterious voice on the other end then informs you that one of your family members or friends (that you choose) has been kidnapped, and you need to follow very specific instructions in order to save them! That's the basic premise of \"The Hostage Trials.\"\nAs a player, most of your interaction with the game will come through phone calls with different characters. The most important of which is \"the villain.\" But unlike a traditional \"pick up and play\" game, the player is at the mercy of \"the villain.\" He could call at any time and when he calls...you'd better be ready!\nPlaying a game in Real Time also means that any references to times of day or periods of time are literal. If the villain says you need to do something before 9pm, you'd better do it!\nSo how often does he call? On average you will get one call a day from the villain at a random time where he will give you a challenge in order to keep your friend alive. He may give you a window of time to expect his call, or he may not. Depends on what kind of mood he's in. What happens when you miss a call? Well you'll just have to live with the consequences whatever they are. Remember, we're going for realism. You can also expect to get a random text or e-mail every so often.\nNow because you'll be communicating with the villain so often, it goes without saying that the better the voice, the better the game.\nHave you ever wanted to hear what Snake would sound like as a villian? Now's your chance!\nDavid Hayter made Solid Snake's voice legendary and has now committed to play the role of the villain in \"The Hostage Trials!\" You can't believe how much we're geeking out about this. It's gonna be epic!  Just think. Everyday you'll be expecting a disturbing call from David Hayter! YEAH!\nWe'll also be casting other great voice actors for the other roles in the game and we'll be sure to keep the backers updated on this front. Suggestions are welcome so use that comment board!\nFirst of all, this is very much an audio based game and many if not most of the game's challenges will force the player to depend heavily on their ears. Our backgrounds are in sound design and we are working hard to craft a unique auditory experience.\nThat being said, the visuals for the game will be quite simple. We're going for realism with this game so the user interface will be made to look like that of a standard smart phone. Think of it as a virtual game phone complete with all of the necessary apps. It's your portal into the world of \"The Hostage Trials.\" You'll have a contact list, a dial pad, email and texting apps, a banking app, and more, all contained within the game. The villain will also have the ability to send you specialty apps for specific purposes throughout the game. We don't want to spoil too much of this beforehand since it will be way cooler to find out as you play.\nThe game will be divided into four different difficulties. There will be:\nA 3 day real-time trial.\nA 7 day real-time trial.\nA 14 day real-time trial.\nA 30 day real-time trial.\nSo it's pretty self explanatory right? Attempting the three day trial means that you have to last three whole days following the villain's instructions in order to successfully retrieve your friend. The seven day trial takes seven days and so on.\nThe game is a complete story. We can't stress this enough.\nWe want to emphasize that this game is a complete experience. Each trial (3-day, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day) is a new part of the \"Hostage Trials\" story, and the story continues all the way until the very end of the 30 day trial. The only way to experience it all is to successfully save a hostage in each of the four difficulties.\nInitially this may sound like it would consume your life, but it will only take a few short minutes of your day to do what \"the villain\" asks you to do. But that doesn't mean it will be easy!\nIn reality, the time you spend actually playing this game will probably be less than the time you spend on a more casual game that you play at your leisure.\nThere is a reason behind every challenge the villain gives you. Every challenge advances the storyline.\nSimply put, it will feel like someone is really calling your phone. He'll give you tasks and assignments, ask you questions, and get information from you. Some things you'll be able to do right on your phone, others will require a little interaction with the real world.\nIt will soon become apparent that this is more than a simple ransom situation and that the villain is using you for a much grander scheme. The challenges are super varied and will always keep you on your toes.\nHere are some examples of what you might have to do.\nPlace a call to a specific number and see where it leads you.\nTravel a certain distance in a certain amount of time. (not in WiFi version)\nHelp the villain launder money.\nRemotely control an alarm system.\nChange your elevation. (not in WiFi version)\nPiece together clues from electronic documents.\nAnswer questions about your hostage.\nRemotely activate an audio bug at a certain time to hear an important conversation. Do it at the wrong time and you won't hear anything.\nMatch voice prints to help the villain find specific people.\nAnd way more!\nClick HERE to see what a typical day might be like in the game.\nAnother element that we are very excited about is how you'll interact with your real-life friends. Link with your friends through Facebook or e-mail so they can take on the role of the hostage. Every so often, they'll be given \"Hostage Homework\" and using their input, your game will become a completely unique and personal experience. It's their chance to put their own spin on the game. Rest assured that the game will be fun for the hostage too!\nAs the hostage a player will be contributing to the game in a multitude of ways including:\nphotos\nvoice recordings\nanswering questions\npicking challenges\nand more!\nOn the flip side, you'll be able to act as the hostage for someone else's game. Will they have what it takes to save you?\nThis won't be like your typical social game where you're playing 30 games at a time with countless other friends. We want the focus to be on one hostage. That's the realism factor again. At any given time, you'll be able to have two games going. One where you're trying to rescue a hostage and one where your acting as the hostage for someone else. This makes it much more fun and personal.\nWe are developing the game simultaneously for both iOS and Android platforms. At times the game uses GPS technology and cellular data so the ideal platform to play it on is a phone. But it will also be available for iPad and users will be able to play on one or both devices. We are also planning a version specific for WiFi only devices such as iPod Touch that won't make use of GPS or challenges that require cellular data connections. There will be something for everyone. Rest assured, if you have an iOS device or an Android (version 2.2+) device, you'll be able to play this game.\nWhat's even better, is that it will be cross-platform so iOS and Android users can play with each other.\nWe're determined to keep the cost of this game low when it is released, somewhere in the $5 range so the initial pledge to get the game is super low. But we would need a lot of peeps if everyone became backers at this level. So we've worked really hard to come up with some creative rewards that should be worth your while. Take a good look at the different tiers. We're sure you'll be excited about a lot of the stuff we're offering.\nWe miss the days of secret codes, and we're working really hard to offer certain game content that will be exclusive to our backers so don't miss out on some really cool hidden stuff within the game.\nThere are three different tiers that offer access to exclusive game content ($20, $40, and $75). We vow to never release the information to these secret sections to anyone but the backers that pledge at these levels. Trust us. These are easter eggs that you won't to miss out on.\nAs for our awesome t-shirts and hoodies, we'll be coming up with some other designs as well so they'll be more to choose from.\nThe hoodies will be exclusive to backers.\nWe've got an awesome team of programmers and visual designers behind us. We have experienced sound effects designers who have worked on some of Hollywood's biggest movies. Now we just need the dough. We aren't looking for Kickstarter funds to \"show investor's that there is a market.\" We aren't trying to drum up interest from a big studio. Our plan from the beginning has been to have this game be entirely funded by Kickstarter fans taking it clear from early visual design to a final deliverable product all with your input. It's our only option.\nHere's the breakdown of funds.\n45-50% of funds will go toward the actual programming, gameplay design and visual design.\n40-45% will go towards the actors, recording studio fees and sound design.\n10% for the standard fees and taxes.\nThanks for taking the time to check out this project. We hope you'll consider backing us. Our goal is to truly bring a new type of gaming experience to mobile games. And with your input, we hope that we'll be able to make this game even better. We can only do it with your help.\nSincerely,\nJoel and Jared Erickson and the Gnarly Tooth team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Joel and Jared Erickson - Gnarly Tooth\n2 created \u00b7 16 backed\nBrothers Joel and Jared Erickson formed Gnarly Tooth Media in early 2012.

Today. Thanks for your support!\nFor a long, long time, goblins and fairies have lived in a magical world right beneath our noses. If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called \u201cfairy rings\u201d, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think\u2026\nGoblins Drool, Fairies Rule! is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of 4 Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into 5 rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.\nPlayers begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. 4 cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the \"Fairy Ring\". The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain 6 Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins, or with 6 Fairies, wins the game.\nThe game was designed by David Luis Sanhueza, with illustrations by Mike Maihack.

This summer I attended my very first GenCon, and had an awesome time showing off Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule! to gaming families, as well as checking out the mind-blowing number of other great games that had just come out or would be coming out soon after. New projects and events came my way, giving me opportunities to evolve as an artist, a game developer, and a small business owner.

Here >>\nGrab the HQ version Here >>\nJoin Operation Keep Hope Alive! >>\nVictor asks Top 10 questions: Watch Now >>\nBehind-the-scenes at mo-cap: Watch Now >>\nGarnett, Two Jeffs & Ryan chat: Listen Now >> \nAbout the game:\nYou receive a desperate phone call from Hope, a young woman trapped within a shadowy totalitarian state. Using a stolen phone, she calls and begs you to hack into the nation\u2019s surveillance system, assume control, and help her escape from the clutches of the omnipresent Overseer.\nDeveloped by industry veterans behind AAA games like Metal Gear Solid, Halo, F.E.A.R., Kinect,and cutting edge videos like the Skyrim television spot and the iconic iPod \u201csilhouette\u201d ads, R\u00e9publique represents a strategic alliance between Camouflaj and Logan to make an epic action game designed specifically for touch-based devices.\nOn October 31, Logan founder, Alexei Tylevich, and I wrestled with feedback we received from industry colleagues who told us that our ambitions were too big. They suggested we do something simple and small like so many other games on iOS... Alexei and I spent hours reviewing the production and financial risks. We discussed our belief that gamers will embrace iOS when more games are made for them. By sunset, we were even more committed to doing something different, big, and risky. \nHere are the goals we outlined with the teams:\nDesign a game and write a story for touch-based devices\nCreate an intense action game without a focus on killing\nFeature a believable, non-sexualized female lead\nExplore heavy topics, say something meaningful\nPush cutting-edge graphics on mobile\nOn Halloween night 2011, R\u00e9publique was born.\nWe immediately went to work on developing a gameplay system that drives the symbiotic relationship between Hope and the player. Our internal design pillar is \u201cHope is Alive,\u201d meaning Hope is not a marionette for the player to manipulate, but rather a smart, believable, and empathic hero.\nBooks like 1984 have served as key sources of inspiration not only for the narrative, but also the core gameplay. In R\u00e9publique, players become Big Brother: Hope\u2019s protector and growing threat to the Overseer\u2019s grip over his secret nation as players gain control of any network-enabled devices, introducing really cool puzzle scenarios. With the tap of a finger, players can power down lights, wiretap calls, summon elevators and \u2013 like a good big brother or big sister \u2013 protect Hope by slamming doors on her pursuers.\nHere are the specs Camouflaj and Logan are building to:\n4-6 hour campaign\n\"Stealth Survival\" hybrid genre\nMetroidvania exploration & 3D map mode\nBranching, gripping, pull-no-punches story\nFull voiceovers\nReal-time cinematics\nIn the event that we surpass our initial funding goal, every penny will go into building an even bigger game with features that you will help us define.\nThanks to the global proliferation of iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, hundreds of millions of people are now carrying a powerful gaming device with them every day. Finally, game makers can truly speak to a global audience, an audience that \u2013 thanks to touch controls \u2013 can easily jump into the interactive experience. \niOS is becoming a great gaming platform, but where are the games for people who love intense action and story-driven experiences? Where are the AAA games designed specifically for touch-based devices? As someone who loathes virtual joysticks, I have great respect for what Chair Entertainment did with Infinity Blade: they built an action game specifically for touch devices. We aim to do the same.\nWithout fail, every company we\u2019ve shown our game to has expressed sincere excitement about its creative ambitions. In unison they proclaim: \u201cYes! This is exactly the kind of game I want on my iPhone and iPad!\u201d But when it comes down to dollars and cents, the most consistent feedback we get is: \u201cYou have to prove that there\u2019s a market out there for this. And don\u2019t use Infinity Blade as an example unless you can guarantee your game will also be featured in an Apple national TV spot.\u201d\nIf you believe like I do that that there are millions out there who want more serious games on mobile, please support R\u00e9publique and send a message.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is that it allows us to have a a direct connection with the community and have a dialogue with them. Upon announcing R\u00e9publique for iOS, we received an incredible amount of buzz for the game. It also generated a lot of commentary on the chosen platform. We as a team are still committed to iOS, but now, thanks to the community's feedback, we are committed to delivering a unique version of R\u00e9publique specifically designed for PC and Mac with new features, gameplay and story elements that speak to the strengths of the platform. Look for a video update next week where the team at Camouflaj discusses the direction we will take the desktop version of R\u00e9publique!\nDigital platforms like Steam and the App Store are great, but there's something lacking with digital products. I miss the physical connection (and smell!) of game boxes, strategy guides, and maps. This is why I\u2019m excited to announce the R\u00c9PUBLIQUE JOURNAL, the physical half to the game experience. This high-quality book is a \u201creplica\u201d of the one Hope finds in the game: a musty-worn book passed between secret revolutionaries that features hand-drawn maps, writings from undercover dissenters, newspaper clippings from \u201cThe Outside,\u201d sketches of the Overseer\u2019s inner circle, and even a translation guide to the graffiti found in the world that may lead to hidden supply caches and audio tapes.\nThis pocket-sized book is the ultimate companion to the R\u00e9publique experience. While it's not required to finish the game and understand the story, we know players are going to love it.\nJust like the R\u00e9publique Journal, the Collector's Edition is being designed as a believable artifact from the game world. More specifically, the Collector's Edition features a hollowed-out copy of the Overseer's Manifesto that Hope uses to hide contraband items. Everything from the journal to the CD and DVD are designed to look exactly like they do in the world of R\u00e9publique.\nAnd continuing our theme of products hidden from a watchful eye, here is the concept we'll be using as we create our special iPhone case. Since phones and communications with The Outside are not only prohibited in the world of R\u00e9publique but can get you down right killed, some have chosen to take the risk and retrofitted the Overseer's Manifesto pocket edition into a case that snugly fits a contraband phone:\nThe design fits in with the fiction but also needs to be functional. I think we struck the perfect balance.\nWe estimate that R\u00e9publique will cost north of $1 million to complete. After months of meetings and due diligence, we believe that we can raise the necessary additional funds to complete R\u00e9publique from potential outside investors, but there is some risk that our efforts will be unsuccessful. Before we enter into any financial agreements, we want to prove through Kickstarter that there is a market for a serious AAA mobile game. While we may eventually have to share future profits from the game in order to finance development costs, we have no intention of sacrificing quality, creative control or IP ownership.\nIn the very happy event that we exceed our $500,000 Kickstarter goal, this will grant us more financial freedom and will allow us to build an even better game. We will also consider the idea of developing R\u00e9publique for other platforms, however this is not a decision we take lightly, as we firmly believe in developing our games to the strengths of each platform.\n-----------------\nI'm writing this just hours before this page goes live. The team is brimming with anticipation, as everyone is hopeful that there are thousands of others out there who want more AAA experiences on their iOS device. Are we right to assume that? We will all know very, very soon.\nThank you for coming along for the ride.\n-Ryan Payton\n@ryanpayton\nwww.facebook.com/camouflajLLC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "R\u00e9publique VR is Now on Steam!", "update_content": "Hello Loyal Backers!\nAs you may be aware, R\u00c9PUBLIQUE VR released on Oculus Go  back in 2018, and since then we\u2019ve brought our VR reiteration of the game to Oculus Quest & Oculus Rift.

Slowly, they began to write music as a whole as opposed to building on songs already written by Orie, producing a much fuller and more unique sound than before. This gradual change led to a rethinking of what the band was, and ultimately, a changed band. With a name change, and a new perspective on song writing and playing, ODDEPOXY is now very pleased to be writing and performing their music anew!\nAs a band we've always dreamed of taking a month to do nothing but write and record, a dream that remained exactly that for some time due to schedules and other aspects of life that drew our focus away.

We would be in a writing slump for hours, then all of a sudden we would remember that an old riff would flow perfectly next, or one of us would play an idea, and within a couple minutes we would have decided on that part. A few sections were written in a matter of seconds, literally. Orie would come up with a riff on the fly, and we would all say, \u201cAlright, next part.\u201d It was as if the song overall took only a few hours to write, but we spent 4 days getting there.

This was a pretty simple concept in theory, but putting it into practice was definitely a learning process and not as smooth, initially, as we thought.\nWe finished the first song and sat down to write the lyrics together. Writing melodies went relatively well which was refreshing, we came up with some excellent ideas that I wouldn\u2019t have come up with on my own, so that part was a definite success. Then we came to actually writing the lyrics. We tried to decide on a theme, but the variety of feelings was quite wide and it was a lengthy discussion until we actually settled on something.

Support these artists with your pledge!   \nGoing Green: we want our marketing materials and backer rewards to be environmentally friendly, but green printing adds to the budget. Extra funding will help us keep our commitment to being green.\nFestival Frenzy: The average festival entry fee is around $35, and most filmmakers submit to at least 100 festivals! Once a film is in, there's shipping prints, marketing materials and travelling, which all add up. But getting a short film on a big screen near you is our goal, and the more we can put in our festival budget the better chance we have of getting \"A Tangle Tale\" on the next Oscar list!\nProduction Deadlines: Why stop at $12K? If we double our goal, I will be able to take a month off from freelance work and focus entirely on getting the film done ahead of schedule. That means you get your rewards sooner and the party starts early!\nThese are all working artists and technicians that make the cinema experience and they deserve to earn a living. Consider yourself a patron of the arts by pledging your support!\nWho's involved?\nThis film is a labour of love for me, but there are several amazing artists involved in post-production that will be the beneficiaries of your generosity.\nComposer Mark Orton - you may be familiar with Mark's subtle arrangements and textural approach to music from his work with Tin Hat Trio. We're thrilled he will be creating an original score for the film.

Bridgit was manning the desk at the time and she eyed me suspiciously as I let several people with package pick-ups and small transactions go ahead of me. When it was just me and her left, I said, \"Are you ready for this?\" She took a deep breath and with calculated efficiency, began weighing parcels and making organized stacks on the counter. \nBridgit is from the Netherlands - she was quite pleased to see Dutch names on two of my parcels heading to Amsterdam. We chatted a bit, but I was careful not to distract her too much! In 20 minutes everything was done and on it's way!"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 4, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/corriefrancisparks/a-tangled-tale-a-short-sand-animation", "project_name": "A Tangled Tale - a short sand animation"}}, {"backer": "Jimi Bonogofsky", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 4, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smallfish/stripped-the-comics-documentary", "project_name": "STRIPPED: The Comics Documentary"}}]
