[{"backer": "Xona Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "R-Type is a side-scrolling shooter arcade gameIrem Corporationbrought into the world in 1987. \nThe energy chargeable \"Wave Cannon\" with strong offensive capability, the indestructible, remote-controlled \"Force\" protecting the fighter which can be attached to the front of rear of the fighter to fire laser beams, and the bold design of enemies with the merger of organism and mecha, as well as its groundbreaking idea of introducing a stage where player fight against a gigantic battleship that is even bigger than the screen size, R-Type swept the world.\nLater on, sequels like R-Type II (1989), R-Type III (1993), and R-Type Delta (1998) were released from Irem Corporation and Irem Software Engineering Inc. on different platforms. The series came to an end with R-Type Final (2003) released on the PS2. \n\n\nWe are licensed by Irem Software Engineering Inc.and about to make a new title of the legendary side-scrolling shooter game, R-Type. \nThe psychological tug-of-war with enemies, the unique level designs, and the exhilarating feeling that have been polished up by the franchise will further evolve on a 16:9 widescreen.\nWe'll pursue uniqueness of the fighters and coolness of attacks that appeared in R-Type Final.  In addition, more customizable elements for fighters will be available.  You will be able to change the coloring, types of weapons, and decals.\nSometimes people would say R-Type is \"too tough to play\". R-Type Final 2 will make a wider range of difficulty levels available to players with different skill levels.   The higher the difficulty level you play, the more points you will gain. This will enable players to compete with R-Type pilots from all over the world. \n\n New Information: Coloring & decal image of player ships (June 7, 2019) \nThis image reflects the coloring and decal of the ships currently proposed by the production staff.  These are NOT final decisions, but we're working on to create something cool and bold. \nWe have prepared a video of the starting sequence that reflects ships with coloring and decals.  The starting scene in this trailer is not pre-rendered, but a real-time computer graphics just the same as the game, which will reflect the customized ships. \n\n\nNow that the wide screen aspect ratio of 16:9 has become standard, side scrolling shooter games will evolve into something more exciting.  \nWave Cannon attacks by trans-dimensional fighters equipped with firepower equivalent of that of a battleship. This game is thoroughly focused on expressions of how enemies are destroyed.\nThe feeling of exhilaration in the destructions is thoroughly pursued. \nThe Stage Dominated by Decaying Organism.\n       As new enemies are generated from carcasses of the enemies, the more the player plays the game, the stronger enemies he or she gets.  Not only the player's fighter, but also the stages will evolve. That's R-Type Final 2. \nWe prepare 10 or more original R-Type Final 2 stages from the start.\n       Moreover, new stages are planned to be added after the release of the game.\n       In addition, depending on the results of our crowdfunding campaign, more stages will be added as homages to famous stages of the past R-Type series.  \nThe gameplay in which players make full use of Wave Cannon and Force to defeat formidable enemies remains alive.\nThe game will be carefully created to bring about maneuvering and game development that are unique qualities of side scrolling shooter games.   \nNot only the enemy's shots, but also tactics relating to geographical features, as well as ramming attacks by giant enemies pose a threat to the player's fighter.  The tension and thrill of cutting his or her way through huge enemies is something that only R-Type can offer.\n\nSuccessive trans-dimensional fighters make renewed appearances!\nDozens of fighters that appeared in the previous series are planned to make renewed appearances.\n       A greater variety and expressions of the Force and Wave Cannons to be available.\n       Colors and decals changeable as you please. \n\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u8aac\u660e\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Every Achievement, You'll Unlock an Original Decal.\nFollow/ Retweet/ Like Share our Twitter/ Facebook Posts and Unlock the Original Decal.\nFor each Twitter and Facebook achievement (the combined total number of our English and Japanese accounts), we'll share our original decal you can use in the game with EVERYONE (not just backers).

We need the cooperation of many competent creators to realize our plan.\nUntil now, we invite many creators who have been involved in the R-Type series, and also gather creators who are involved in the latest game production.\nHowever, in order to realize it within a reasonably foreseeable time frame, funds are necessary.\n\nWe want to allocate enough time and resources to this project. We want to put all our ideas into the game to make it the best possible.\nAlso, developing a shooter game requires a lot of energy for balancing.\n\nThis time, we challenge for releasing the game on four platforms: PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam. However, depending on the platform, the delivery date may vary.\nAlso, it may take some time depending on which country or region it is delivered.\n\nOur challenge requires your ongoing support and understanding.

It's unknown territory and lets be honest, with any game development, complications and delays are often lurking nearby.\n\nThe majority of the game's engine has already been programmed. The first level is fully playable, bar the boss battle. Each level in the game will be built upon this preexisting engine and will have new graphics and enemies. The island overworld will be structured slightly differently (it's not procedurally generated and will contain story segments), this is one of the key areas to be worked on before completion.\n\nIf you have any concerns, talk to me :) I'm available to direct messaging on Kickstarter or Twitter.

Expect the unexpected as this clown takes you through a world of imagination. Just think, if Super Mario Bros., Yoshi, Kirby, and Little Big Planet had a child, this would be it.\n Acquiring Skills! You start the game with NO skills, only walking. Think Link chasing after his uncle with no weapons at the beginning of A Link to the Past. You need to learn how to clown, before you can jump! (Just kidding, kind of)\nA few of the many skills Ayo acquire throughout the game.\nPlatforming! Each stage has a unique theme and interesting platforms to ensure gaming is fun and not repetitive. Ayo is not the kind of clown to make the same old jokes over and over again. His jokes get better each time. No, really.\n  You don't have to visit japan to experience these rock sumos.\n  Disorienting wheels, it's like being in an amusement park.\n    Just your everyday stroll at the dock.\n  Help me out Mr. Pig.\n    Tire swing for the win!\nComic Book! Ayo\u2019s adventures are so many, we just couldn\u2019t confine them to one game. Discover 3 torn comic book pieces in each stage that form a full comic book page. Collect them all in each stage to put together a spectacular prequel story of Ayo and Bo\u2019s adventures.\nEarly comic book tests.\nVehicles!Take a joy ride on Ayo\u2019s helicopter and tank to do some major damage. No pilot\u2019s license required, which is a good thing because Ayo would never pass.\n  A turtle, on a clown, in a tank...\n  This world looks delicious. Yummy!\n  Early vehicle concepts\nCollectibles and Accessories! Besides the gems you can collect to buy stuff in town, there are also tons of accessories and items you can collect to make Ayo look FABULOUS.\nIt's time to look clown-fabulous.\nSolve light puzzles! Act like a clown detective and solve fun puzzles that get you one step closer to saving Bo! By putting on your problem-solving clown hat, you\u2019ll unlock abilities and useful items that will help you progress in the game.\nHelp Folks! Help memorable characters progress and earn rewards such as new skills and extra life. For Example, if you find a way to help the Shoemaker, he will grant you the jump ability. With each newly acquired skill, you would be able to explore previous areas you weren\u2019t able to reach before. Ayo knows it\u2019s always smart to lend a helping hand!\n  A music loving frog.\n    Show Off! Items collected and trophies earned will be displayed in Ayo\u2019s house that you can visit (maybe even take a nap and use the toilet?) anytime you want. He isn\u2019t an entirely humble clown, but we don\u2019t blame him.\nTown Hub! Ayo can purchase items and extra lives, talk to town folks to hear their stories, and uncover juicy secrets and side quests.\n   What Other People Said!\n  In Ayo\u2019s hometown, things are generally peaceful. He juggles in the park with his talented circus dog, Bo, hangs out at the carnival, and longs after the shoemaker\u2019s daughter. Until one day, his dog goes missing!\nYou play as Ayo, your not-so-average clown embarking on an epic journey in search of his missing (or perhaps ran away, or kidnapped?!) best friend and beloved dog, Bo. What happened to Bo? Will they ever juggle together at the park again? Or put together a legit circus act? You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as you struggle to reunite clown and dog. Like all good adventures, you won\u2019t be all on your own. Ayo\u2019s world is full of friendly people and interesting creatures that are willing to lend a helping hand.  \nYou\u2019ll learn of courage, love, friendship, and the amazing things that happen when you never give up. He might not like to ask for help, but Ayo is ready to admit that he needs you to rescue his best friend and restore peace to his hometown.\n      World Map.\nAyo's world consists of 8 worlds, each of them unique and vastly different. Ayo starts in the Suburb in the comforts of his own home (it may or may not be clown-size), then travels to Town where citizens are buzzing about. From there, adventures abound at the sunny sunflower farm, the strange Sleeping Forest, the fun Flying Whale Dock (Giant sunflowers! Sleeping trees! Flying Whales! Oh my!). At the action-packed Factory, the dreamy Candy Land, the colorful Carnival (Ayo\u2019s favorite hangout), and the exciting Circus, Ayo will be challenged in the most exciting of ways and get closer and closer to Bo!\n  Why are these trees sleeping?\n  Harbor with flying whale, you don\u2019t see this everyday.\n  Watch out for the maniac claws!\n  Everybody loves the carnivals. Where is everybody?\n  Along this incredible adventure, you\u2019ll meet a fat fairy, a giant singing frog, a surprisingly helpful radish (don\u2019t eat him), cake mountains, candy soldiers, and many more fascinating characters. All unique and all very fitting friends and foes for an ambitious little clown on the adventure of a lifetime. These rather creative characters are pictured in the same adorable design as Ayo himself. It\u2019s a feast of color and cuteness!\n  Bo:Ayo's lovely dog. Pan:Ayo's good friend and Shoemaker's daugter.\n  Shoemaker:Pan's grandpa, a grumpy and forgetful old man with a few untold secrets. Balloon Lady:A shy little lady, afraid of needles.\n  Wolf:A very friendly businessman. Thief:Not only good at stealing, but also very foxy.\n    vendor concept arts\n    Enemies and Bosses! Take on bosses bigger than life itself and prove that clowns are much tougher than they seem. Don\u2019t be fooled by Ayo\u2019s handsome look!\n  Watch out for crow droppings.\n            Well, that\u2019s terrifying (and not just for Ayo).\n      Grrrr, I am so cute and round.\n  Depicting the cuter, brighter side of clowns, kids and adult alike will fall in love with the style of this game. We all loved Mario and Yoshi in our childhood. Ayo is our way of giving beloved characters of the past a new life in the form of an incredibly cute clown.  \n\nYou\u2019ll see and hear our inspiration in Ayo the Clown. With a reminiscent look and music score, we\u2019ll take you right back to your childhood (wouldn\u2019t that be nice?). The platformer genre is one that will never go out of style, but we can\u2019t say the same for Ayo\u2019s clown hair.  \n\nAyo the Clown keeps the integrity of the platformer genre while also giving it a clown-tastic spin. The gameplay will feel comfortingly familiar, but still provide a new challenge and a fascinating new story. This game is accessible for all ages with an unforgettable story, and definitely has a high replayability.  \n\nOn a deeper level, we wanted to capture the emotions of loyalty, friendship, and dedication. Ayo develops, just as we all do, throughout the game. By pursuing his best friend and never giving up, Ayo grows into the clown he\u2019s meant to be and that\u2019s something we are incredibly proud of.  \n\nAyo the Clown is also inspired by all the hard working clowns and performers out there. Entertaining others is not a simple task and you haven\u2019t really tried to entertain until you\u2019ve tried juggling knives, blindfolded.\n  More Info. \nImagine your kid playing as himself on this super fun journey.\n  Mockup of Game Box and Art Book.\n  Paper craft Ayo, Poster, and the 3D printed figure(Early Mockup).\n   A clown act isn\u2019t much without music and neither is a quality game. In Ayo the Clown, you\u2019ll hear music from our very talented Nick Dragonas.\n\nThe music of Ayo the Clown will take you back to the fun of classic video games from your childhood with a fitting clown-centered twist. You\u2019ll hear cute squeaks from little Ayo and tunes that will remind you of a joyful circus (we like to make Ayo feel right at home on his adventures). These tunes are all upbeat with a bit of whimsy, just like Ayo, and very fitting for the incredible journey of an adorable clown. It will transport you into the fun and whirlwind world of being a clown with a mission.   \n\n Ayo\u2019s just a little clown, he has a lot of growing up to do. While his maturity is questionable and probably past the point of help, he could use your help laying out his journey.  \nWe\u2019ll send out polls and surveys to our clown-tastic backers letting you choose how dastardly an enemy will appear, what accessories will be available, and more.   \nWe want you to be a part of the fun-filled game-making process. Besides giving us your expert opinion, you\u2019ll also have access to our forum. Whether you\u2019d like to Q&A, discuss a certain clown, or share some fan art, you can do it here.\n  Ayo the Clown is initially planned for PC(Steam) and Mac, but the clown is itching for more.\nPotential platforms include ps4, xbox 360, xbox1, wiiu, 3ds, vita, ios, android.\n  Ayo is not a very well-known clown and neither are we. We aren\u2019t big name veterans from the video game industry nor have we worked on any big AAA games; therefore, we can\u2019t use our fame to share Ayo with the world.  \nWith that in mind, we want to share with you, our passion and skill through our alpha demo (download at the beginning of this campaign). In a previous project, we created the mobile game, Knight Blitz OMG, free in the Apple app store. From this game, you can see how far we\u2019ve come. Ayo the Clown is our biggest and most exciting project and we\u2019re excited to put all our efforts into creating it. We began as just a two man team with our mobile games, but now that we\u2019re creating Ayo (and he\u2019s quite the handful) we expanded to a team of five, talented individuals each with his/her own unique skills.\n Xiu Liang(Director/Artist)-A 2D/3D artist by trade, a gamer by heart. Spent most of his waking hours playing games through the 90s and now it\u2019s time for him to make them. Started Cloud M1 a few years ago and now dedicating 100% of it\u2019s resources to Ayo The Clown. Favorite games: Street Fighter, Mario Bros, Zelda.\nJD Lu(Game Designer/Developer)-A dreamer and a developer, his biggest passion is to make video games. Helped in building Knight Blitz OMG and another very ambitious adventure game under Cloud M1 studio. When it comes to his passion, he doesn\u2019t clown around. Favorite games: Monster Hunter, Dragon Quest, Fallout.\nQuentin Bellay(Developer)-Growing up playing games like Sonic and Shenmue since 1991, only until recently has he figured out that his passion is to develop them. Besides helping making Ayo The Clown a reality, he also partakes in game jams, you know, he likes the excitement. Favorite games: Sonic, Shenmue, Super Meat Boy\n.Mao Liang(Developer)-Having worked with Xiu on all the previous apps/games, Mao\u2019s relationship with him is second to none, also being Xiu\u2019s older brother helps. When not gluing his face to the monitor, he glues onto his fish tank to not miss the tiniest life he\u2019s created in his aquarium. Favorite games(enjoys the most when playing together with his kids): Minecraft, LittleBigPlanet, Disney Infinity.\nChristine Tada(Project Manager)-A casual gamer by day, and casual gamer by night too. Loves playing video games, especially those with a good storyline, gorgeous graphics, and amazing music. Helping with the PR aspect and managing Ayo the Clown and making sure the world knows about it. Favorite games: Witcher Series, Fire Emblem, Diablo III, Portal\nNick Dragonas(Musician)-A musician and composer, since 2000 he composed countless original music ranging from television to video games. He\u2019s capable of composing music in many different musical genres, and his best friend is his guitar. Favorite games: Battlefield series, Batman Arkham City, Rayman.\nBackers-We count our backers as honorary team members and future clowns. Your support means so much to our team and to Ayo. We look forward to talking with you in our community and getting your opinion.\n Video games are expensive and time-consuming to make. Despite his small size, Ayo is a very ambitious clown and so is his game.    \nWe need to give Ayo more love and work on his game full-time. Funding will not only help us concentrate fully on Ayo (no need for moonlighting as a clown anymore, j/k), but it will also help us put food on the table for our families. \nAyo is a lonely clown and we hope to find a family for him at Kickstarter. The biggest benefit of crowdfunding is building a community around the game\u2019s development and having fans to give feedback and build the game with us.\n\n Ayo is one impatient clown, so we couldn\u2019t help but get started on his game.   \nFrom early concepting to a somewhat final design.\nSo far, the character controller and engine is in a good place and the overall game structure is set up. We\u2019ve built part of the 3D assets, including some of the worlds and enemies, which we are very excited to show you. \nThe bigger task ahead, which we\u2019d love the backers\u2019 input on, is to polish the story and design fun, memorable levels. Creating a deep, inspiring story such as Ayo\u2019s takes time and that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019d like to focus on this game full-time.\nWe want to launch this game at the end of 2017 or early 2018.\n Ayo is one handful of a clown and any support we get from you will be invaluable to us and help us make this game even more fun and quirky.\nWe thank you in advance, our clown-loving friends.

Sometimes it\u2019s on purpose and followed by a lemon-cream pie to the behind, but other times he ends a routine with a slapstick comedy piece that wasn\u2019t in his plans. A project this size will have several potential problems that could arise and we will do our best to minimize it or mitigate it without taking a pie to the face. Since most of the engine is done, technically it\u2019s a matter of fixing bugs and designing more fun to play levels and 3D assets.

His original music has been featured on MTV, Comedy Central, The CW Network, NBC, BTN, ESPN and more. His productions have also been incorporated in many US brands and organizations; which include the Ohio State University, and commercial tourism of Ohio and West Virginia. Kelly also has a creative presence with internet media and apps for iOS and Android. His work can be heard in the acclaimed Armored Aces WWII sim game.\nLil Tanks will launch simultaneously for Windows, Mac and Linux in an effort to satisfy every one of our backers!\nCo-founded by Andrew Pungprakearti and Anthony Meschi in 2014, Lead Money Games is a humble development studio located in the Bay Area (Rohnert Park, California). Lil Tanks is the duo\u2019s premier title -- evolving from a tower defense game for mobile to an action-packed desktop side-scroller. Andrew is a self-taught Game Developer who started in visual effects and contributed to more than 35 major motion pictures (including How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2, Rise of the Guardians, and his personal favorite, the ride-or-die guinea pig spy block buster G-Force). Anthony has worked in visual effects for film for the past seven years -- working on titles such as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Alice in Wonderland and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  \nWhile the two have always loved the world of film and animation, developing their own games offered them opportunity the visual effects industry could not. The long hours demanded by visual effects studios can make for some very long days away from home and family. With Andrew being the father of two children and Anthony with a child of his own on the way, the two were searching for a way to spend more time with the people that matter most. Working from home and being able to work their own schedules was very appealing to the two artists. Not only would they have the opportunity to work a flexible schedule, but they would also work on projects with full creative control - something their previous profession rarely afforded them. They would now possess the freedom to create whatever projects they desired, to create the kind of games they loved playing growing up.\nWhat started as idle conversation during down time at work, soon became serious discussion.  Both Andrew and Anthony have been gamers for their entire lives and dreamed about one day making a game of their own.  They began to discuss previous titles that inspired them, brainstorm potential projects and eventually purchased a game engine to begin work.  Over the course of several months the two taught themselves how to code in the engine, building on the scripting background they shared from working in post production. \nThe early days at Lead Money HQ\nBefore long they had a playable demo of their first collaboration.  The game would be built from the ground up using original pixel art and take inspiration from Gradius, R-Type, and Raiden Trad.\nTheir game had begun as a passion project being worked on in spare time and was about to become a full-time endeavor.  In April 2015, the studio they both worked for decided to close down their location in Redwood City.  Both Andrew and Anthony were now without a job.  They decided to take this misfortune as an opportunity -  and devoted themselves completely to Lead Money Games.\nLEED not LED...\nThey spent the next several months developing gameplay, creating artwork and crafting the story they wanted to tell.  The two former Visual Effects Artists were now Game Developers.\nUsing this Kickstarter they hope to raise the necessary funds to see this project through to completion.  While Andrew and Anthony are working on the game full-time, coding, creating artwork and playtesting simultaneously, they hope to increase their available budget to bring on some more artists to help them include some cutscene animations.  They want to bring on a PR firm to make sure their game gets the exposure it deserves and the polish it needs.   They want to make their dream a reality and release their first game: Lil Tanks!\n*Design in Progress\nModel built in Zoxel\nOur plan is to have Lil Tanks ready to ship on Windows, Mac and Linux by Summer 2016.  With our release date coming up very soon we are looking to bring on some extra help to ensure we have a solid build of Lil Tanks on day one.\nThe two of us have made great financial sacrifices over the past year to make it this far and we are determined to see this through to the end.  Lil Tanks will be completed even if this Kickstarter does not succeed, but it will be that much better if it does!\n                                                                                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLil Tanks is our premier title -- evolving from a tower defense game for mobile to an action-packed desktop side-scroller. It is the product of several months of planning, drawing and coding. It is a passion project for us and one we have looked forward to completing for a very long time.\n\nBeing that it was our first project, we were determined not to take on more than we could handle. We were under the impression that developing for mobile would allow us to keep the control and gameplay a little bit simpler. It was a way to ease into game development. From there, we worked for several months on our mobile version. After having some long discussions with other Game Developers, we decided it was best for Lil Tanks to become a desktop title.\n\nUpon switching platforms, it took us quite some time to get Lil Tanks back into the same state again. Eventually the game became so much more than what we had before. Now we have a super fun shooter that we are very proud of and can't wait to complete.\n\nWhile we are rookies in this field, we are seasoned veterans when it comes to facing difficult challenges up against a deadline.

You can email us at feedback@revivalprod.com or join the discussion on Forums.\nVR SUPPORT AND BUILD!\nWe just announced full VR support for Overload, plus there's a playable build for Oculus Rift!  Check out Update #20 for more details.\nWHAT PLAYERS ARE SAYING ABOUT OVERLOAD\nThe creators of Descent are proud to present the ultimate 6-degree-of-freedom shooter, OVERLOAD.  Revival Productions is continuing where Parallax left off and creating an all-new single-player game that combines the best of classic 6-DOF gameplay with modern graphics and technology.  Destroy robots, rescue hostages, blow up the reactor, and escape before the whole thing explodes.\nMULTIPLAYER EXPANSION!\nDue to overwhelming demand, we are now committing (if the Kickstarter makes it) to creating a MULTIPLAYER EXPANSION for Overload. We always wanted to have multiplayer and believed we would eventually, but we did not feel comfortable making a public commitment to it. It's too easy for something like multiplayer to blow up the schedule and adversely affect the single player game. We want to hit our single player date with a great game.\nSo, here's our plan: We will deliver the single player game in March, 2017. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, we will deliver multiplayer as an expansion sometime after that (likely 6-8 months). Everyone who backs the campaign at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of the multiplayer expansion. We are not sure on the scope, but it will include the competitive modes and key features that kept Descent going for over 20 years.\nFREE COPY OF INFERNO 2 FOR BACKERS!\nAll backers at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of Inferno 2 from Radiangames on PC (Steam or direct download).  Inferno 2 (gameplay trailer) is an atmospheric twin-stick adventure-shooter from Luke Schneider, Lead Designer on Overload. \nBonus Trivia: Inferno was also once the name of the game now known as Descent.\nGAMEPLAY TRAILERS\nIn 1993, we founded Parallax Software to build our dream game, Descent. It was the first 3D game that allowed you to move, turn, and fire in any direction. The mind-blowing--and sometimes nausea-inducing--gameplay was matched by the technology behind it, which pushed the limits of what was possible in rendering, AI, and multiplayer. It was a milestone game that sold millions of copies and spawned two sequels.\nBecause of our desire to be close to family, Parallax Software eventually split to form Outrage (Matt Toschlog) and Volition (Mike Kulas). Outrage and Volition remained sister companies and shared in each other\u2019s knowledge and expertise. We\u2019ve remained close friends, but have always wanted to find a way to work together on a project again. The one project that we both really wanted to work on, that we couldn\u2019t not make, was an all-new six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIn 2014, after years of talking about it, we began working on Overload. The core objective with the game is to take elements of classic 6-DOF shooters and use modern technology to push Overload to a whole new level. We\u2019re thrilled with the progress we\u2019ve made so far, but there is still a lot left to do, and that\u2019s where Kickstarter comes in. We need your help to ensure Overload will be the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIntense single-player action in 6-degrees-of-freedom\n15 level campaign filled with explosive combat and exploration \nStory by the writer of Freespace 2\nBreath-taking graphics and spectacular sound, with a soundtrack by Dan Wentz & Allister Brimble\nMore than a dozen sinister robot types and 3 massive bosses\n12 upgradeable weapons\n5 difficulty levels let you tune the game to match your abilities\nFully customizable joystick, gamepad, mouse and keyboard controls\nReleasing on PC/Mac/Linux, PS4, and Xbox One\nMany 3D action games have four to five degrees of freedom in their motion controls. Space combat games allow 3 axes of rotation, but usually only 1 axis of movement, while first person shooters generally allow 2 axes of rotation and 2.5--if you count jump as half an axis--axes of movement. A six-degree-of-freedom shooter gives you controls for all 3 axes of rotation and all 3 axes of movement. While this creates complexity for moving and controlling the player\u2019s character, the reward is an experience unlike any other. Combat and movement are more dynamic, as you are able to interact in 3 full dimensions.\nThough 6-DOF shooters surged in popularity in the 90's, the genre has laid dormant for over a decade. Overload\u2019s early development has focused on merging modern technology with natural and intuitive 6-DOF controls, all while still providing intense robot-annihilating action. Overload has a fantastic feel to the game already, and we can\u2019t wait for everyone to experience the sensational six-degree-of-freedom combat.\nThe primary objective in classic 6-DOF shooters was simple: Find the reactor, destroy it, and escape. Carrying out your objective is where the true essence of the game lay, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on with Overload. Each level will be full of gameplay reasons to move and look and shoot all around you, with secrets to discover, traps to trigger, powerups to find, and cryo-frozen hostages to rescue. Along the way you\u2019ll encounter plenty of robots to battle or flee from. There will be keys to collect, shortcuts to take, and reactors to eliminate. You\u2019ll race to the exit as the timer counts down and be thrilled when you make it out just in time.\nThough Overload's primary focus is on gameplay, it will also have a rich backstory and universe ripe for expansion. The details of the story will be revealed later, and we're happy to announce that it's being penned by the writer of FreeSpace 2.\nWhen we were figuring out how to build a full-3D world for a full 3D shooter in 1993, we decided on deformed cubes and portal-based rendering as an efficient method of creating an indoor environment. That decision was based primarily on the rendering and AI needs, along with making levels relatively easy to edit and create. But it also had a positive side effect of the levels being easier to fly through, and the level designers were able to build levels that we never imagined would be possible within those cube-based constraints.\nLevel concept art\nWith Overload, we\u2019re returning to our roots and using a deformed-cube structure again, but now we\u2019ve added a 3D geometry decal system that allows us to add more detail in a very efficient manner. On top of that, we\u2019ve created a deformation tool that takes a basic cubic structure and turns it into a beautifully constructed cave. We still have the benefits of the deformed cubes, but now they been enhanced to look amazing.\nNot only that, but we\u2019ll be able to share our custom level editing tools with the community and you won\u2019t need to use Maya or 3DS Max to build amazing levels on your own*.\n*You can still use Maya/Max to build geometry decals if you want.\nDestroying a robot is extremely satisfying in Overload. It needs to be, because you\u2019ll be destroying tons of them. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time refining the feel of the combat, the way robots move and fire, and the many ways robots take damage and explode, but we\u2019re not done yet.\nWe\u2019ve established the basic AI archetypes for robots, and every robot type will have customized AI that gives them a unique personality and combat behavior. Part of that personality comes from the sounds they make as well. When you hear the alert scream for a robot, it not only lets you know that danger is coming, but it can fill you with fear as you cringe in anticipation of getting hit. Already the sound of unexpected grinding blades makes us immediately dodge up or down if at all possible.\nThe other major element of combat is the weapons. Though we\u2019ve only done initial passes on 4 weapons, they each feel great to use and have roles that they\u2019re ideal for. We have big plans to expand the weapons system with multiple upgrade types per weapon that you\u2019ll unlock over the course of the game.\nOverload has a classic inspiration, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll look pixelated or have an 8-bit soundtrack. It uses the latest graphics technology to immerse you in the world. With physically-based rendering, dynamic shadows, and realtime global illumination, your eyes will be as engaged as your heart. Even when you can\u2019t see a robot hiding around the corner, its shadow could give it away. And when you turn the tables and blow the robot to pieces, you're rewarded with some beautifully rendered particle effects.\nOn top of the fantastic visuals, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to make Overload sound amazing. We're excited to announce that we've enlisted the talents of Dan Wentz and Allister Brimble. Dan worked on sound and music for Descent 2, FreeSpace, and Red Faction, and has maintained an active presence in the Descent community for the past 20 years. Allister worked on the CD soundtrack for Descent along with many other hit titles over the years including Dungeon Master II, the Team 17 range of Amiga games, Rollercoaster Tycoon & Driver.\nOverload is being developed for PC/Mac/Linux, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.  Though it will look best on high-end PCs and consoles, it will still run great on a broad range of hardware. The game is being built to play well with a gamepad, joystick and keyboard, or mouse and keyboard, so regardless of the platform of controller you choose, you'll still be getting a fantastic experience.\nWe expect the console versions to launch simultaneously with the PC/Mac/Linux version, but they may be a month or two later.\n MOD TOOLS & EDITOR DOCS: We'll add support for custom robots and weapons (data and 3D models) in addition to releasing full Level Editor documentation.\nRevival Productions' team has helped create other milestone gaming franchises, including FreeSpace, Red Faction, and Saints Row. All the team members are seasoned veterans who've worked together on multiple projects and shipped dozens of products between them.\nIn addition to the primary team members above, and the two sound designer-musicians, many former Parallax alums will be contributing their expertise to ensure that Overload becomes the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nREWARD CLARIFICATIONS\nBecause we can't change the reward descriptions, and we added 3 new reward tiers, we want to clarify these issues even though the reward listing does not show them.\nKEYCHAIN: All tiers at $75 and above get the Overload keychain.\nSNEAK PEEK FORUM: All tiers at $200 and above get access to the Sneak Peek Forum.\nLEVEL DESIGN ALPHA: All tiers at $900 and above can choose to get the Level Design Alpha.\nREWARD ADD-ONS\nWe're also happy to offer the following digital add-on rewards to any tier at $25 or more:\nEXTRA DIGITAL COPY: Add $20 per extra copy to your pledge.  You will be able to specify the platform for each of your extra copies at a later date.  PC/Mac/Linux copies include both a Steam key and a DRM-free download (via GOG or another service to be determined).\nThese extra physical rewards are available to all tiers at $120 and above:\nEXTRA BOXED COPY: Add $30 per extra copy to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nEXTRA T-SHIRT: Add $35 per extra T-shirt to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nWe're very passionate about Overload, and have self-funded the prototype, but now we need your support to finish what we started.  The Kickstarter campaign funds will enable us to finish Overload and make it into the game we've always wanted to make.\nWe also want to get the community involved in the game, and Kickstarter is a great way to engage those who are as passionate about the game as we are.  At Parallax Software, we were heavily involved with and influenced by the community, and we want to get to know and interact with the players again.  Your passion and feedback on Overload will help make it the best it can be.\nDescent to Overload on Imgur\nDescent to Overload Visual History on Imgur", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping videos games is an uncertain and risky endeavor. For starters, development schedules are notoriously hard to forecast. Perhaps the primary reason for this is that the key attribute desired of the finished product \u2013 fun \u2013 is so subjective and hard to pin down that games often require extensive revision as original ideas prove ineffective and new solutions must be found. And since games often strive to innovate (in terms of gameplay, visuals, audio, and so on) it\u2019s often the case that there are not established workflows for creating content, leading to further risk.\n\nFor the following reasons, we believe we can manage the risk and deliver a solid game mostly on schedule and with the funds provided by a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\n1. We are working in a genre that we understand \u2013 one that, in fact, we created. We have a deep understanding of what Overload will be, what it should look like, and what will make it fun.\n\n2. We have a team with incredible experience. Our project leaders, Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, have each been developing games for 30 years or more, and other key members of the team also have deep professional backgrounds. We have a long history of making games together.\n\n3. We\u2019re already pretty far along in the development of Overload, as you can see from the game footage included in our video. The look and feel of the game is already established, and most major systems and tools are already implemented. \n\n4. The additional funding we seek now will largely be used for relatively lower-risk development such as game balancing and creating the content (enemies, weapons, and levels) needed for the full game.\n\nThe only significant risk is that the game will not launch by the intended date. We intend to make Overload the best game in its genre, and that could mean a slight delay to ensure its quality meets our standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "March 2019 Update", "update_content": "Hello Overload backers!\nFor some time, we've wanted to provide an update on Revival and Overload.

It's not just combat, it's not just survival, it's both and more.\nCooperative survival and adventure\n\nBoth Online and Local. Hunt while your friend is setting up camp or explore while the other stands guard over your gear.You are free to split up and roam miles apart from each other. \nFixed difficulty and free-form adventuring\n\nThe game allows you to go anywhere you want right from the start of the game. Just be clever enough to survive!\n\nAn open world filled with handcrafted regions\n\nYou will have good reasons to explore the whole world rather than just running around the map from location to location.\n\nA complete adventuring experience\n\nThis game won't do everything for you. Perform multistep rituals to cast spells, strike flint to start fires, and locate yourself on the map using visual landmarks.\n\nFully envisioned survival mechanics\n\nBoiling your water for safe drinking, hunting for your next meal, and bundling up clothes to survive the harsh winters are just a few examples of how far we plan to go.\n\nPermanent consequences to every one of your actions\n\nYou can't simply save/reload before a tough choice or fight. The game is constantly saving and overwriting. \n\nLegacy system to pass down items and skills\n\nDeath and retirement doesn't mean the end of your adventures. Pass down your gear and teach your skills to the next generation.\n\nDynamic quests that continue with or without you\n\nNo one is standing around waiting for you to come along and save them. If you aren't there or choose to ignore those in need, life goes on without you.\n\nDynamic player defeat\n\nLosing a fight against a group of bandits won't simply have you looking at a \"game over\" screen. Instead, you might wake up to find yourself being held for ransom, or being dragged into the woods and left for dead after they've looted your belongings.\n\nFailure is part of life. In Outward, defeat is simply a part of your character's journey.\nAurai is a vast section of land home to a a variety of biomes. From the coastal town of Cierzo to the barren deserts of Levant. It's regions are shaped in real time by it's climate and weather.\nThe land Aurai is dynamically changing throughout time. For example, during the winter snow not only covers the ground but builds up flake by flake until it covers every ridge and fills every tree. As each day passes you can visually see a shift in the environment.\nPLAY\n\nAurai itself is a harsh, near inhospitable land, sometimes due to its weather, sometimes due to the hostility of the creatures that inhabit it, and sometimes due to the opportunistic nature of men.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the Scourge appeared in the northeast of Aurai, destroying what little stability the region had. Resources became scarce as trade caravans were attacked on the roads by both the natural wildlife and creatures from the Scourge.\n\nToday, the region is slowly stabilizing, having only periodic fighting between villages rather than all out chaos. Political tensions are high and every village is fighting for a better life for its people. You as a player are being placed right in the middle of that conflict.\n\nHow do you determine who's in the right when good intentions collide?\nWe think it's ridiculous to have to kill exactly twenty of some monster somewhere, or having an NPC waiting all day and night for you to check on their floating exclamation marks. Quests stacked up in a book waiting to be checked off like a shopping list is formulaic and unimmersive. \nOutward handles quests differently.\n\nSome quests have multiple outcomes based on how you choose to handle the situation being presented to you.  \n\nMuch like how we handle defeat in combat, quest failure is also dynamic.\n\nFor example, in a quest, you might be tasked to intervene in a dire political conflict between an underpaid mercenary camp and a small mining village controlled by one of the leading factions. The situation is urgent and the outcome will play out with or without you. Ignoring the assignment for too long might result in that village getting razed to the ground by the very monsters the mercenaries were holding off, or someone else might come along to resolve the situation.\n\nIn Outward, we'd rather have quests that feel alive than being yet another box in a list waiting for you to check off. In order to accomplish that, we design quest failures and successes as part of your personal storyline.\nOutward's combat reflects that you aren't some godly hero. The enemies can cast spells, use equipment, and fight just as you can. You simply aren't the only one in this world able to grow in power.\n\nCombat is focused instead on outperforming your opponent through clever planning beforehand and manipulating the situation to gain the upper hand.\n\nWeapons types all have unique movesets with each attack having a different pattern, reach, speed, and force. Allowing the player to gracefully overpower their foe and catch them off guard. \nMagic in Outward requires some level of preparation. You won't be able to cast a massive firestorm by pressing a single button. Instead, magic is a deliberate process in which you combine basic spell components together in rituals to unleash your most impressive arcane abilities.\nSpell use isn't limited to just combat. As an example, a basic fire spell can be used to light campfires for you to boil water on. You will need to explore to find out how magic can help in the world around you.\nPart of the deal as an adventurer is to figure out how you are going to survive the harsh environment. Use of appropriate clothing, building shelter for the night, hunting for food and purifying water are all part of your day-to-day routine.\nBeing caught out in a snowstorm or stranded in the desert without proper equipment and tools means near certain death. However, you don't have to face these dangers alone. You and some friends in splitscreen and online can help each other survive by hunting, fighting, and questing together as a team.\nThere are four factions that hold control over the regions of Aurai. You can chose to join one of them to climb its ranks and experience their unique storylines.\n\nThe Blue Chamber Collective is formed of smaller clans that mostly try to keep to themselves. The collective is the most powerful political association in Aurai. Though separated in clans, the one value they all share is the importance of family.\n\nThe Heroic Kingdom of Levant is a new power that tries to take over the Blue Chamber by promising to liberate the population from the harsh obligations of their current lives by creating a new utopia.\n\nThe Holy Mission of Elatt is a religious power that promotes the importance of achieving your utmost potential in order to better protect and serve your loved ones.\n\nThe Soroboreans are a very powerful institution, they are the highest authority in academic knowledge throughout the land. They are also deeply involved in commerce, using information as a key resource in their expansion.\nAs a backer you deserve to know how we plan to budget this project's funding. Below we included a chart to show how the funds will be distributed for this project.\n\nNine Dots has been around for four years and Outward is our third major game project. This is our core team:\nHere are some clarifications about the different reward tiers for our supporters.\nThe lore of Aurai is still in its infancy. This early on in the project, we are still flexible on what could happen. It is you, the backers, who will decide who should become the most powerful faction in Aurai by the end of the game's events.\nAt Nine Dots we always take special care in selecting the music for our games, and we are convinced that the soundtrack will be memorable.\n\nLight sources in Outward are mostly focused on lanterns, not torches. This means that when someone sees you with a torch, they will know that you've been a backer from the very start. You will still need to earn that torch in-game however, you're not paying to make the game easier.\nThe private forum will be a great way to collect feedback, ask for suggestions, discuss of more technical elements of game development and design and build our early community.\n\nJust like the torch, the unique backpack won't be given to you right away, you will still need to earn it. However, only backers at this tier or higher will have the ability to unlock that specific backpack model.\n There will be one tombstone somewhere in the world of Aurai to your name. Will you be able to find it? Also, you get a plaque in the Hall of Builders. The tombstones and the Hall of Builders are connected in an exploration side-quest. Find the different tombstones in the environment of Aurai to unlock rewards!\nThis unique pet will follow you around and while the bird won't be helping you in combat, it will certainly add some life around you during your travels.\nMules are pricy and needs food and water, but they are very conveninent. This agile bird might not be packing as much as some other type of mules, but it will be moving faster than most.\nGet backstage access to the game and see the builds we use internally to track our own progress. These builds will most likely be buggy, but you'll be able to follow development very closely.\n\nAlso, you get to choose the name of an NPC in the game. We still reserve the right to ask for a different name if we feel that your suggestion isn't appropriate for Outward.\nWant to show your company's logo on your tent as you play? Have an image you want to show to everyone else playing with you? Are you part of a guild or community that you want to promote? We will design a unique flag for your camp and no one else will have access to the same design.\nLeave your mark in the world of Aurai by choosing the name of an Inn and its Innkeeper. We will discuss with you to ensure that the names fit in the game world. \nWork with the team to design a unique weapon, shield, or helmet to be available as an item in Outward. \nWork with us to shape the game's mechanics by designing a skill or a spell ritual. We will collaborate to create a unique ability and find the right place for it in the game.\nNavigating the world of Outward will be tricky, and landmarks will be one of the main ways to understand where you are. Help us design a monument or something highly visible in the game's environment.\nHelp design a new variation of enemy. There will be some technical constraints, but we will work with you to create the best expressions of your idea for an epic enemy or monster in the game.\nHelp mastermind a dangerous area to explore, then see how the players fare in your nefarious designs. We are eager to bring your ideas to life in Outward. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere has been some backlash recently towards some Kickstarter projects that failed to deliver on their promise after successfully getting funded. We think that the main reason for this backlash isn't the failure itself, but the lack of transparency.\n\nSo, while it is a hard thing to say, we have to be honest and admit that by backing this project you are taking a risk on our behalf. It is obvious that you can't make an open world RPG with CA $150,000 alone. We already have invested a lot in the project and will continue to do so for as long as we can. However, what will truly make us able to get the project to the end is your support. By backing this project, you are providing us not only with direct funding, but also opening the doors to more opportunities. Better yet, the more money we raise from actual players interested in the game, the less we need from publishers and private investors who might want to dilute the vision. We don't want to make a game for absolutely everyone. We want to make a game for you.\n\nThe team at Nine Dots is incredibly resilient and dedicated. We have completed games in the past and we know what it takes to bring a project to completion. We make things happen. In the game development world you simply can't predict what the future will hold, and we can't promise that everything will go flawlessly. However, our team has overcome pitfalls in the past and we will be doing everything we can to make this game a reality.\n\nWe will be constantly updating backers with any news, good or bad.

The powerful and advanced civilization of Lemuria became too proud and demanded power from the gods. They meddled too deeply in things they could not understand or control. As a result the gods unleashed an undead scourge that devastated the civilization and pushed the few remaining survivors to the sacred and uninhabited holy islands to try and rebuild a once great empire with nothing but the few skills the survivors still had. \nLearn how to survive both the oncoming undead scourge and worse yet... other survivors as desperate as you. \nIn Warriors of Lemuria you will need spend your first few days (45 minutes of day, 15 minutes of night) learning the gathering and hunting skills you will need just to survive. Then you can learn to build shelters... anything from a small shack, to a giant imposing keep, build weaponry, and even discover devastating magics.\nUnlike most sandbox games we allow each person who plays the game to create their own server instead of paying a company to do this for you. This gives you more options of games to join, or if you do not like any servers available to create your own world for others to join.\n Warriors of Lemuria has been a huge and ambitious process! We've spent over 2800 man hours already (all unpaid I assure you!) and invested a fair amount of our own small savings to get the software, and assets we needed to get this far.\nWe've been and hope to continue to be supporters of the Unity Asset Store as publishers there use the money received to fund their own games. It's a great way to support the amazing IndieDev community. As we've worked and learned we've replaced a lot of those assets with our own but would like to purchase and continue to build many more! The game is about 80% complete but now we need YOU to finish. \nThere are still a number of things we'd like to do to make the game a GREAT offering to the players. Such as...\nPurchase Unity Pro so we can get all the features we need to really get the game a great play, and also an amazing visual experience.\nPurchase additional assets to create a richer world, and add some features that aren't really realistic or time/cost efficient to do ourselves such as voice chat. \nDouble or even triple the land mass with VASTLY different climates and places if possible. There are some amazing asset packs that would make this much quicker.\nPurchase some better hardware to make it a little easier to work on. Development often takes much more powerful hardware than it actually takes to run the final product!\nSome of this will run much more than we're asking for. We're not greedy we plan to continue to put as much of own savings as possible into the game but we do need the assistance we're asking for to make it all possible!\n If we make the $5000 dollars and keep going, we can make this game even BETTER! Here are some options for the stetch goals that we've come up with. Feel free to contact us if there's anything you can think of that you'd REALLY like to see!\nAt $6000...\nWe'll double the playable area in the game with at least one other climate available to survive in.\nAt $7000...\nWe'll triple the landmass with at least two other climates. This will include additional survival metrics such as thirst if in a desert or warmth if in a cold climate.\nAt $8500...\nWe'll include seasonal, and/or random world events. Look out for Hallowe'en!\nAt $10,000...\nWe'll implement a cloaks and clan system. This will allow you to have special guild management and also represent your guild by optional customized cloaks.\nAt $13,000...\nWe will include an option to each server administrator to run in \"APOCALYPSE MODE\". This will encourage admins to keep their server running as long as possible, as each day will bring new events of the apocalypse to the lands. This will eventually lead to a MAJOR CATASTROPHIC event that will force all players to band together, or lose EVERYTHING.

(Global Repression and Imprisonment Patrol) has started occupying nations around the world by force. A small group of nations known simply as the Allied Nations, have started to rebel against G.R.I.P.\nYou play as a pair of elite soldiers as they embark on a suicide mission to stop a nuclear strike before it's too late.\nThe core of Red Cobra is shooting 360 degrees in a twin-stick fashion. Sprinkled throughout the game will be \"Metroidvania\" exploration levels as well as environmental and boss puzzles. Objects can be manipulated by picking them up, dropping them, or shooting them. Red Cobra will be heavy on environmental obstacles as well.\n360 Degree Shooting\nExplore and Solve Puzzles\nNavigate Obstacles\nFull Release\nRed Cobra will release on Windows as a Steam release pending a successful Greenlight campaign and as a DRM-free download. A Mac version will also be available. \nPotential Platforms\nWe hope to also release Red Cobra on Playstation 4, Vita, Xbox One and WiiU. These platforms are currently set as stretch goals.\nThe evil organization G.R.I.P (Global Repression and Imprisonment Patrol) has begun occupying countries under the rule of tyranny and slavery. G.R.I.P has recently set their eye on a cluster of small countries to the west. These small countries have banded together and are simply called, the \"Allied Nations\".\nWhen the Allied Nations received lintel that G.R.I.P has become frustrated with the AN's resistance and plans to launch a nuclear bomb, they sprang into preemptive action and launched a nuclear strike of their own. \nOperation Cobra would send a swell of ground and air forces to protect Goliath, the 300-man flying fortress that would drop the nuclear weapon of mass destruction over G.R.I.P's nuclear launch facilities with hopes to end the invasion.\nWhen Goliath was shot down by G.R.I.P's overwhelming forces, a small team was sent on a suicide mission to finish what Goliath had failed to do. Their plan is to stay away from large battles while flying under the radar, in hopes of as little resistance as possible but enemy territory is uncharted and nobody knows what they will face behind the lines.\nDue to the severity and urgency of the mission, Operation Cobra has been upgraded to Operation Red Cobra.\nRydia Cross is the gunner who will protect the duo and clear a path so that they can complete their mission. She wields a modified M-177 Tank Buster auto rifle, designed to be carried by larger soldiers in mech battle suits.\nRook Bishop is an ace pilot who will use his training and talents to navigate his partner and their payload safely to their target. \nThe Dragon Mark V is an experimental air and ground assault vehicle. This very versatile machine can hover, fly at low speeds and can very easily jump to over 300 miles per-hour. When the mission calls for a high speed ground crawling tank, it has that covered as well. \nIt also comes in a variety of stylish colors.\nNot all bosses in Red Cobra will be as straight forward as they appear. Many bosses will require wits as well as skill to defeat. This is because many of the bosses in Red Cobra will be puzzles in themselves.\nEnvironments in Red Cobra will have a smooth and seamless transition from one to the next. New environments will be greeted with a title card, but we are moving away from the traditional \"level, end boss\" pattern and going for something more organic.\nHere are a few of the environments we have already running in the engine:\nThe M-177 Tank Buster auto rifle isn't the only weapon at your disposal in Red Cobra. We have a multitude of ordinance planned to stomp on G.R.I.P's evil faces!\nJust to give a few more ideas of what we have planned, there will be a set of Remote Rifles that follow you around, a futuristic baseball bat that uses an electromagnetic ball that ricochets around the environment, and your go-to grenade is a bow and arrow.\nLike a lot of small indie game studios, each person at Adversary plays multiple roles. The small studio consists of husband and wife team, Ajari and Colleen Wilson.\nAjari Wilson designs most of the gameplay mechanics, enemy types, the heroes of the game as well as sound effects and music.\nColleen Wilson not only designs the environments and enemies but also serves as our programmer and PR rep.\nAjari Wilson is the music composer for Red Cobra. He prides himself in his ability to compose a wide variety of genres while still maintaining his own signature sound.\nThis is an unfinished song that Ajari is currently working on for Red Cobra:\nWhile the music on Red Cobra may not necessarily be of these genres, here are some examples of older work he has created for various projects over the years and examples of why we think the soundtrack for Red Cobra will be something special:\n More of Ajari's work can be found at: https://soundcloud.com/dark-octave\nOver the last few months, we have received a lot of positive feedback over the visuals of Red Cobra. We'd like to let you know that this is only the foundation of what we plan to build for our game. Expect more detailed art and better animations with the final release.\nWith this Kickstarter you are buying us time to plan and focus on every detail of Red Cobra. A successful Kickstarter means a much deeper and detailed game rather than a shallow, rushed one. We would also use funds for some much needed upgrades in the studio, that will help us deliver a better game.\nWe are very active on Facebook and Twitter and also have plans to do regular small video updates during development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest fear would be the need to push back a given release date due to unforeseen problems during development.

Magic is a gift reserved for only the loyal followers of The Creator, while the non religious sects of society are forced to rely upon technology in their daily lives. Upon uncovering a mysterious artifact deep within one of the ancient ruins scattered throughout the land, Julien and friends find themselves thrust into the middle of this rising conflict. Can you solve the mystery of the ancient civilizations and prevent the destruction of your own?\nElysian Shadows is an indie 2D RPG being developed for Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, Ouya, and even the Sega Dreamcast (not even kidding). We fuse aspects of 16-bit classical RPGs with a highly stylized, modern vision by using dynamic lighting, physics, and audio engines along with swapping between 2D and 3D perspectives. Our goal is to create the \"next-generation\" of the 2D RPG in terms of gameplay, graphics, and audio. We want to reinvent and revitalize the aging genre for a new generation of platforms, while still remaining true to the 16-bit charm of the SNES and Genesis classics that we all grew up loving. \nWith Elysian Shadows, we want to push the boundaries of pixel art by creating diverse, lush environments for players to explore with beautifully lit scenes and advanced rendering effects that could not have been possible on older hardware. Our goal is to create a gigantic, open world with an emphasis on exploration and environmental interaction while still retaining the rich storyline and combat mechanics of a full-fledged RPG. Combat is fast, fluid, and action-oriented, sporting particle effects, rigid-body physics, and advanced AI, while simultaneously offering tactical and strategic depth through character customization, unlockable abilities and techniques, and an advanced class system.\nIn-game captured GIF\nOur team spent two years developing a custom in-house engine capable of realizing our ambitious creative vision for Elysian Shadows. \nDynamic lighting with pixel-perfect shadows\n3D environments and dynamic 2D/3D camera perspectives\nFull-fledged rigid body physics and particle engines\nDiverse gameplay styles and platforming mechanics\n3D positional and dynamic audio engine\nIn-game captured GIF\nThe world of Elysian Shadows is a diverse, multilayered landscape consisting of villages, towns, cities, and a variety of different ruins and sub-dungeons. Connecting the various ruins to the societies of Elysian Shadows are many overworld maps the player must explore. They are generally beautiful, lush, and feature a variety of different biomes such as forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, beaches, swamps, and islands. The ruins tend to exhibit a darker, moodier, and more foreboding atmosphere, playing host to ancient, long-forgotten technology and a multitude of dangerous creatures guarding their secrets.\nWe wanted to create an immense and immersive world that is rewarding to explore, playing host to a cast of characters and a culture that are both compelling and emotionally engaging.\nIn-game screenshot\n- No overworld map. The world is open, vast, and full of detail. We wanted to create a world that is continuous and connected rather than disjoint and separated through a world map or menu.\n- No decorative doors. We hate it when games show us a beautiful environment but restrict our ability to fully experience it. If you can see it, you can interact with it. \nIn-game screenshot\n- Real-Time Day/Night System. Time of day affects NPC behavior, monster encounters, sidequests, and offers an entirely new dimension of strategy and exploration.\n- Rich storyline and engaging cast. Our characters are interesting and relatable on a personal level, and our storyline is highly influenced by the philosophical and moral dilemmas of modern society. We want to create an intellectually fulfilling experience, and we want more than anything to engage with you on an emotional level.\nWe've partnered with SpriteLamp, a powerful tool for generating normal and depth maps from pixel art, allowing our engine to apply pixel-perfect 3D lighting effects to 2D sprites.\nWhen dreaming up the gameplay experience of Elysian Shadows, we drew inspiration from not only the great 16-bit RPGs of our youth, but also a vast list of games we grew up loving, many of which aren't even in the same genre. We wanted to create an experience that could also be enjoyed by people who are traditionally disinterested in the slow-pacing of RPGs. We sought to revitalize the old school formula and integrate gameplay mechanics from action games and even platformers to create and even more exciting and immersive gameplay experience.\nIn-game captured GIF\n- Exploration. An important aspect of Elysian Shadows is exploring and interacting with our gigantic maps and diverse environments. As such, we want the experience to be rewarding and engaging, with a plethora of hidden paths, chests, and secrets scattered about the world. We were inspired by \"The Legend of Zelda\" to create highly interactive environments, where the player can chop down grasses and trees, cast spells to burn obstacles in their way, and return to old levels with new items to discover previously inaccessible areas.\nIn-game captured GIF\n - Combat. The combat of Elysian Shadows is action-packed, and our team lovingly refers to it as the marriage between \"Secret of Mana\" and \"God of War.\" Combat takes place in real-time, without a separate battle screen. As such, the player can freely use objects in the environment for a tactical advantage--you can even drop a potion from your inventory and smack a boss in the face with it, for example! The player is able to quickly assume control of an active party member, with the rest operating under the control of user-configurable AI. Spells, particles, and physics are also intimately married aspects of combat, as many spells can set obstacles on fire or lift and throw large objects at enemies.\nIn-game captured GIF\n- Platforming. Julien and the rest of the party are able to jump and interact with their environment in full 3D space. This opens up exploration to the third dimension and allows us to introduce a slew of new gameplay mechanics that have not traditionally been found within 2D RPGs. \nIn-game screenshot\n- Strategy. In contrast to the action-oriented combat mechanics, we wanted to enhance the depth and strategy of the battle system by introducing a slew of opportunities for character customization. Elysian Shadows features a full-fledged class or \"job\" system, where each character's innate strengths, weaknesses, and gameplay styles can be augmented through a wide-array of job-specific abilities and talent trees. These jobs also introduce a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of combat, such as alchemy, smithing, and monster taming.\nLike our vision for the graphics of Elysian Shadows, the sound is also a marriage of old and new. Soundtrack songs fuse authentic chiptune samples taken from actual Super Nintendo and Genesis hardware combined with modern instruments, orchestras, choirs, and electronica. We want to create a sound that is familiar and nostalgic but also exciting and innovative.\nOur powerful audio engine also allows us to dynamically fade in and out additional instruments to match the tension of battles and the surrounding environments, creating a truly captivating audiovisual experience. The sound system is also positional in full 3D, meaning sound effects can be heard relative to their actual position in 3D space with surround sound. \nOur engine was architected from the ground-up being cross-platform, and we take a great deal of pride as developers, engineers, and gamers in making Elysian Shadows all that it can possibly be on each platform, rather than hastily porting it over after production (We are crazy enough to attempt resurrecting the Sega Dreamcast, after all!). Depending on our stretch goals, we would like to give each platform exclusive content, taking advantage of their unique hardware capabilities and accessories, and perhaps even allowing you to move your game saves from one platform to another to experience every aspect of Elysian Shadows. \nIn-game screenshot\nDue to the hardware limitations and the ambitious and demanding graphical engine of Elysian Shadows, differences will inevitably arise between platforms, especially with the more advanced rendering and audio features. We will do everything within our power to push each platform to its theoretical limits, but we want our audience to be aware of these potential differences. None of these differences will be gameplay affecting, as we have been creating the game for each platform in parallel, keeping these limitations in mind. \nExclusive Zelda-inspired \"Master Sword\" \nALL copies of Elysian Shadows purchased through Kickstarter include an exclusive Legend of Zelda-inspired \"Master Sword\" starting weapon!\nDigital Copies of Elysian Shadows\nWindows, Linux, OSX, iOS, and Droid downloads will be available initially, with plans for Steam coming later.

Tell us how you want it to look, what you want to be there, what kind of music you want, promote your game in our game, or put a Sega 32x on your dresser... Go crazy!\nCreate Your Own Quest\n The ultimate creative reward for Elysian Shadows fans. Design your own full-fledged sidequest featuring your custom area or map and NPC, item, or enemy, and let the players experience your personal creative vision. You are optionally invited to come hang out with us at the dev studio to berate us until we've done your work justice and take part in \"Adventures in Game Development,\" showing your quest off to our fans and contributors. \nBe In Adventures in Game Development \nCome hang out with us at the studio for a few days, and you (or your project) will be featured in an episode of \"Adventures in Game Development!\" This is the full, authentic indie developer experience, including crashing on the couch, drinking coffee out of mason jars, being involved in design and coding discussions, getting to complain about Patrick's pixel art, playing with our tools, and getting to beta test the game.\nCustom Consoles\n Custom Elysian Shadows-themed consoles (including controllers and VMUs), designed by our artists, exclusively for Kickstarter.\nLeandros Painting\nActual Painting (WIP)\n A breathtaking 100x150cm original painting by our own Leandro Tokarevski, created at the art academy, featuring a detailed scene from Elysian Shadows. This is a one-of-a-kind art piece, painted specifically as a reward for this Kickstarter, and there will never be another one like it!\nConcepts and Media\nRuins Boss Concept\nForest Creature Concept\nFloating Island Enemy Concept\nTransportation Creature Concept\nIn-game captured GIF\nWe spent the last couple years with our heads down in silence, developing our engine and tools, and creating the initial graphics and audio, so that we could present our creative vision for Elysian Shadows to the world. We did this as full-time engineers, undergrad and graduate students, art academy students, producers, and web developers, never asking for a penny from our fans or from the community until we were satisfied that we had a project worthy of your backing.\nNow that our engine is done, we are extremely excited to move forward full-force with asset creation and scripting, developing the world of Elysian Shadows as we had originally envisioned it. With our ambitious vision, multiplatform support, and the additional complexity of creating art assets for both 2D and 3D perspectives, the project is becoming increasingly demanding of our time, energy, and wallets. We have been funding everything out of our own pockets, and two of our team members even took a gamble and quit their jobs to work on this Kickstarter campaign. With your help, our hard work and the creative vision of Elysian Shadows can see the light of day, resurrecting and revitalizing the 2D RPG genre for those of us who grew up loving it and for those of us who were too young to experience it.\nGame engine architect Falco Girgis leads the team with an iron fist, a thick Alabamian accent, and an unhealthy obsession with the Sega Dreamcast. Previously employed as a software engineer developing fiber optic routing equipment, Falco is also a 4.0 graduate student pursuing a Masters of Computer Engineering with a focus on GPU architecture. He's the team's mad scientist.\nGameplay and Level Design commander Tyler Rogers brings together all the pieces of the puzzle to create the experience we are striving to realize, while drinking his gamedev coffee concoction (which he has dubbed 'the Alabamarita') out of a classy glass jar. Tyler Rogers was previously employed in the telecomm industry as a network engineer working with VoIP technologies.\nLevel Designer and Web Developer extraordinaire Daniel Tindall enjoys tea and crumpets while filtering the team's vast and crazy ideas into a presentable and palatable format. By day, Daniel pays his bills as a professional web developer. \n'Zenmaster' Patryk Kowalik is our lead artist and comic relief who paves the way for the visual direction of Elysian Shadows, sketching fellow team members in uncompromising situations when tensions arise. Patryk is a self-taught artist who has established a vast portfolio including a wide range of art styles. He works as a mobile app developer during the day.\nHandsome devil Leandro Tokarevski churns out new art assets and beautiful paintings like they're going out of style when he's not stealing kitchenware from the Alabamian team members. Leandro is a classically taught artist who studies at a prestigious academy of arts in St. Petersburg.\nQuiet and reserved Eddie Ringle leads the implementation of Elysian Shadows on mobile devices and the OUYA. Though young, he is a self-taught developer who earns his living as a freelance programmer.\nSurvival Horror fanatic Connor Linning is in charge of creating the entirety of Elysian Shadow's audio and slaves away when he is not gazing over at his shelf full of Resident Evil and Silent Hill games. Connor has produced several rock and metal albums and has released multiple solo survival horror albums while attending the university for computer science.\nReward Cheatsheet\n\nOUYA: Free the Games - Double Our Funds!\n\"We are participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games.

We have always strived to be incredibly open with our community, allowing our audience to see first-hand the trials and tribulations involved with creating an indie game. \n\nWe are firm believers in transparency with regards to our development process, as we feel an obligation to be open with the fans who have supported us over all these years, and your feedback and participation help us to create an even better product.\n\nThe biggest risk for Elysian Shadows is regarding the realization of our ambitious graphical and technical vision on the less-capable hardware such as the Sega Dreamcast and mobile devices. Falco Girgis is a computer engineering student working on his masters in GPU programming and computer architecture, so he remains confident that the original creative vision for the project should remain intact for each console, even if certain effects must be scaled down.\n\nWe have also been conscious to make the special effects and processor-intensive additions completely optional, so that the gameplay and storyline can be enjoyed to the fullest without compromise, if the user decides to disable the \"Next-Gen\" effects for performance reasons on older hardware.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "AiGD: Legends and Lore, Dev Notebooks, and The Monster Design Contest", "update_content": "Hello backers,\nIt has been a long while with the holiday break, but we are back to rock out some more development for ES and have some awesome stuff to show you guys!\nAiGD: Legends and Lore\nThis month we went a little bit experimental with our Adventures in Game Development series.

Despite the fact that these last few months have been some of the hardest months of our lives, we have continued to make significant progress on the game and we will continue to do so into 2016.

We're being so conservative with the money that we live on the bare minimal required for our survival and development, and if we have to make a few unplanned development purchases here-and-there, sometimes we have to reallocate funds from elsewhere...

My perfectionism coupled with issues internal to our team causing levels to not be as developed as I would have liked them to be is what has caused such a gigantic delay in Kickstarter updates... We have always been 100% transparent with our supporters in the past, constantly posting behind-the-scenes YouTube updates, and posting on social media daily, but suddenly I lost the courage to show the \"real\" game development once we accepted money from Kickstarter.

Wave after wave of marauding aliens threaten the earth and it's up to you to save the day.\nGame play is vertically scrolling with a horizontal play field (vertizontal). As the player advances and collects power ups they choose how to use them to customize their ship. \nUpgrading the lasers gives you more and faster fire power but makes your ship a bigger target and slows you down.\nUpgrading the fuselage will allow the player to take more damage and carry missiles, but also slows the ship down.\nUpgrading the jets will make the ship faster and help offset the extra weight of other upgrades.\nUpgrading the back wings will allow the player to rotate the ship providing larger firing arcs.\nAlso players will find additional components to add to their ship.\nNukes - the player can carry up to five and using them will hit everything on screen with a deadly blast.\nShields - absorb enemy attacks while they last. \nDeath Ray - a sustained beam weapon players can use to sweep space clear of enemies. Using the Death Ray will drain the ships reserve power.\nTime Warp - slow time to a crawl in order to navigate through intense groups of bullets and ships. Time warp also drains the reserve power.\nViridis will have nine large carefully designed levels with unique hand painted environments. Three alien races with different technology and attacks will provide lots of fun deep space combat. Game play will take the player from the inner solar system to the far reaches of the Oort Cloud and a climatic battle at the mysterious planet Tyche.\nViridis will be produced for the Ouya, PC & MAC. We may also release for other consoles after the PC/MAC versions are completed. Viridis will be exclusive to the Ouya for 2 months and then come to desktops.\nGame Radiator is an indie game studio founded in 2009 by friends and colleagues Stephen Brown & David MacCulloch. Game Radiator's first game Mouse Bros was released on iOS in 2011 and will be available on Android and Ouya during summer 2014.\nStephen Brown wrote his first computer program in 1981 on a Vic 20 and at some point before the salesmen chased him out of the basement of Woolco he was hooked for life. Programming games in BASIC on his Atari-400 at home and a Commodore-64 at school remained a hobby throughout junior high and high school. \nAfter working in television for a decade an opportunity presented itself for Stephen to turn what had always been a hobby into a career. In 2006 Stephen took the reigns of the fledgling interactive department at Huminah Huminah Animation where he served as lead developer for 3 years. While at HHA Stephen developed and designed game play for 'NFL Rushzone' a flash browser based MMO aimed at kids, as well as consulting on interactive projects for Disney, Hasbro, and Showtime. \nSince 2012 Stephen has also been employed developing voice controlled language games for Langa Lab.\nDavid MacCulloch is a dynamic and imaginative individual who loves making things up, he has always been an avid gamer, with a strong interest in both video and tabletop gaming. \nAfter high school David enrolled in the Nova Scotia Community College where he earned a diploma in classical animation with a focus on digital media. During a decade long career as a character animator, David honed his skills while working on many projects for both film and television including Fox Kids' Chaotic,Three Delivery, and Bobs Burgers. \nTransitioning to game design allowed David the freedom to bring his own characters and stories to life while indulging his passion for games. \nRaising funds for creative products can be a real challenge. Venture capitalists are only interested in products that will be the next big thing and return 10 times the investment. Government funds set up to help creative projects end up being more about your ability to fill out proposals and work a committee then they are about your ability to deliver a quality project.\nKickstarter offers an avenue to have like minded individuals fund projects they are specifically interested in. It also provides a valuable tool for getting feedback on your project from it's potential audience.\nWe want Viridis to be a well polished and enjoyable game. We need time to bring the art concepts to life, and create a game with solid controls and performance. \nWe will use the funds to pay ourselves a modest wage while we develop the game. This way we won't have to take on any client work during the production and can focus all our efforts on making the best quality game we can.\nWe are participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games.

Ideas that seemed simple can end up being complex and almost everything takes longer than you planned.\n\nFor us being prepared for the challenges firstly means calling on our experience. We have both worked on many game, film, and audio projects during our professional careers and have lots of problem solving experience. As well our work flow together is well defined we know how to play to each of our strengths.\n\nSecondly it means using solid proven tools with adequate support available. The game will be built with the Unity engine which is a very stable environment for working in and has a large support community actively offering solutions to common issues. For creation of art and sound elements we also use well established software with a proven track record.\n\nThirdly we work in small space generously provided to us by Copernicus Animation & Langa Lab.

If you like platformers, side-scrolling shooters, and RPGs, you might find that it\u2019s right up your alley.\nThe main premise of the game is time travel, but there are also lasers, missiles, and jellyfish. As you advance through the game, you\u2019ll begin to peel back the layers of the rich history surrounding this digital universe. You\u2019ll discover ancient artifacts, see flashbacks of forgotten battles, and learn about primitive technology that could help you save the universe from complete destruction.\nThere\u2019s also a solid team of artists dedicated to making Temporus more than just another platformer. We want this project to showcase video games as the art form that we believe them to be, which is why it\u2019s essential that we raise the funds to pay our talent. We\u2019re planning to release the game on the PC, Mac, and Linux platforms, and we have high hopes that we\u2019ll eventually publish to the PlayStation 4, PS Vita, and Xbox One.\nDescent Pod\nA crew with little hope\nThe backstory for Temporus might remind you of some of the more popular space novellas out there. It\u2019s inspired by television shows like Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica, without all the tangled love triangles and political diatribe.\nThe game takes place against various backdrops, like the planet Temporus and out in deep space. You play the protagonist, a pseudonymous worker who is on the job mining with a work crew for ore. Suddenly, the emergency lights begin blaring on your work ship. It\u2019s an alert from the home planet warning your crew of an impending attack. No one is quite sure what it is that\u2019s on the offense, but you and your crew board the ship and rush back to Temporus.\nOnce you get back to the home planet, it\u2019s completely decimated and barren. You and your crew have no idea what could have happened. Your people have lived in peace for centuries; there were no known threats or hostility. You and the crew set out on a mission to figure out what happened.\nOther time periods\nGameplay\nTemporus is broken up into various levels, each with their own mission and different style of gameplay. Time travel is one essential part of the story, but the other is item collection. Each level will also require that you collect items that will help you on your mission. However, this not a tedious game based on collecting loot; it\u2019s about tact and making every move count.\nCrew Quarters\n Steam Greenlight\nUpdate: We are now Greenlit for STEAM!\nAs if we haven't asked enough, we could use just a little more help on Steam for the Greenlight process. All you have to do is vote!\nOkay, so why do you need money?\nAs mentioned, the goal of this fundraiser is to help contribute to the fund that pays the creative talent behind the game, including the artists, music composers, and quality assurance tester who ensures that this isn\u2019t another game in an app store somewhere that\u2019s crashing your system. This money will also help us continue to build more levels and create the unique environments that make the game. The more money we raise, the more of an enthralling, engaging title we can put forward.\nHere is a simple estimate of where the funds are going.\nRemix Stretch Goal Information\nC-jeff has managed to put together an amazing crew of artists to help craft a REMIX album for the OST. If we hit the first stretch goal, this will become a reality! Here is a list of artists who have signed on already!\n\nVince DiCola  & Kenny Meriedeth \n(Rocky IV, Transformers: The Movie (1986)) \nOne of C-jeff's biggest influences as a music composer, Vince DiCola is known by his legendary scores for Rocky IV, original Transformers: The Movie and Saturday Morning RPG. We're honored to announce that Vince now is a part of Temporus' audio world and will perform a remix of the score.\n\nMitch Murder \n(Interceptor LP, Kung Fury) \nMitch Murder is one of the most notable retrowave musicians nowadays. In his music he brings that crystal clear modern incarnation of the eighties, which would be an unique addition to the audio side of Temporus. BTW, he is releasing his new album Interceptor LP this month, go check it out!\n\ncoda \n(TREE OF KNOWLEDGE, Videoball)\nC-jeff's old friend and fellow composer at Ubiktune from its early days. As a creative and versatile musician, coda produced a number of releases, including a team effort with Surasshu for their TREE OF KNOWLEDGE album, progressively synthesized tracer and is currently working on the score for Videoball.\n\nBlitz Lunar \n(Triptunes) \nAs with coda, Dave is also one of the Ubiktune's composers from its early days. After featuring on a number of team albums, working on different remixes and covers, he debuted with Triptunes , the album that is a marriage of NES/Famicom chiptunes and audio production, particularly celebrating time-honored FM and retro sounds. We're excited to hear his touch on Temporus music!\n\nJeff Ball \n(Tiny Barbarian, Timespinner)\nJeff Ball is the classically-trained violinist and violist, that not only performed on such a titles as Mass Effect 3 and Red Orchestra 2, but also produced original scores for number of projects spanning Tiny Barbarian, Globulous and many others. Jeff also played viola part for C-jeff's latest effort Big Steel Wheels, and currently is working on our fellow Kickstarter Timespinner.\n\nAivi & Surasshu \n(Steven Universe, The Black Box) \nPiano wizard Aivi Tran and fellow chiptune composer Surasshu are one of the most unique collaborations you can hear in the modern video game music. Bonded by their love of classic video games and a fascination for fusing different styles, they released The Black Box, and currently working on music for Cartoon Network animated series Steven Universe.\n\nvirt / Jake Kaufman \n(Shovel Knight, DuckTales: Remastered, Contra 4 and so many more) \nJake Kaufman is a legendary artist who influenced a whole new generation of video game composers, and there is no exception for C-jeff. The work of Jake is probably the main reason C-jeff joining the world of video game music now. Endless inspiration from FX3 and to the Shovel Knight soundtrack, it is a great pleasure to have Jake as a part of Temporus remix project.\n\nFearofDark / Stephen Hemstritch-Johnston \n(Motorway)\nBack in the days of 8bitcollective.com there were many great artists, but one that stood out among the rest was a musician left an impression on C-jeff in particular. His name is FearofDark, who released a brilliant chiptune album Motorway, back in 2012.\n\nStretch Goals\nHere are a list of Goals we have planned out.\nREMIX Album: Huge list of amazing artists.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got for you: (Please note, ELITE packages are limited and not inherited into any other packages.)\nMiniature toy ships. A good friend of Frizz collaborated with us to make these little things. They\u2019ll come in a couple of forms and sizes; some will be color printed, while others will be hand painted by an amazing miniatures artist. These were designed to be used in board games as well and they come with a metal stand so you can display it proudly among your own collection of miniatures. It also comes with a +5% chance to roll a 20 (that\u2019s what we hear, anyway).\nA squee-worthy Plushy. This soft toy is modeled after the main character in the game, though it\u2019s much cuter than Temporus\u2019s protaganist. It makes a pretty decent cubical buddy or squeeze pal.\nDigital Art Pack. This is an archive of random art, including prototypes sketches from various team members. It also comes packed with music that may or may not make it in the game.\nTemporus OST Packs. The full soundtrack available as a digital download. It will also include some of the music that didn\u2019t make it in the game and a bonus extended track.\nBonus Epic 20-Minute long play Temporus track.\nGlossy poster. Need art for your office or bedroom? This will be designed by one of our awesome artists. We haven\u2019t finalized a design just yet, but here\u2019s a teaser of some of the runner-ups:\nButtons and stickers. Okay, who doesn't like buttons and stickers?\n The Crew\nFirebelly, @firebellys, Lead Dev and Doodle Monster.\nHello, I'm Firebelly, I have over a decade of experience in the fast-paced world of enterprise application development\u2014sounds fun, right? I have worked with pretty much every desktop and mobile operating system you can imagine, including various Unix distros and even Apple\u2019s iOS. Now I\u2019m ready to tackle the game scene with the same level of enthusiasm and dedication. I have 10 years of experience programming C#, and over three years of experience with XNA and HTML5. I try to frequent GameJams as I can and feel pretty privileged to be part of the indie game scene. \nPeter Queckenstedt, @scutanddestroy, Lead Artist and Cool Stuff Factory\nPeter heralds from a land of maple syrup, government-subsidized healthcare and thinking toques.

There are a few bugs and crashes but if your'e brave check it out. \n Note- Currently there is  a frame stutter issue that can be resolved by plugging in a second controller. This will be fixed on the next build. \nDownload Demo (v.4)- uploaded December 04, 2013, 8:13:20 PM\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15098641/BulletBrosDemo/BulletBros-PressDemo.exe\nBullet Bros is a throwback to classic games like Contra, Super Mario 3, Bionic Commando and Blaster Master. It started out as an exercise to combine some of my favorite game mechanics together to see if they could co-exist. From there I switched everything over to a physics-based environment, and some really fun and unexpected things started to take shape. Bullet Bros was born.  \nAt the very minimum, Bullet Bros will be equivalent in size to the old Contra games; 10 levels, each with a unique, bad ass boss, and local co-op. I say minimum because I would love to take the scope much bigger if possible, and that\u2019s where I really need the help of the Kickstarter community. The following categories break down what I would love to include in Bullet Bros with your support.\nI want to have a huge world map with 90-plus levels, and game progression similar to Mario 3. I want to add tons of secret objectives, mini-games, and stores to upgrade your gear. I always enjoyed games with cool world maps, because it gives you a break from the chaos. Oh, and did somebody say impossible airships? No? Okay, well I guess I'm saying it.\nThe Vehicles in Bullet Bros will play a large role in the overall design of the game.They will be unlocked throughout the missions, and can be upgraded and linked with other vehicles to create wacky new machines. You will be able to visit the Bullet Bros hangar and test out vehicle combinations without the stress of combat. If you figure out a cool combo, you can have it airdropped to your mission location to test it in combat. I want to shoot for 50 -100 playable vehicles throughout the game, so the player is constantly trying out new combinations.\nVehicle linking was something I'd already been thinking about for a while, when a friend of mine suggested extending the same concept to the characters themselves. The Bros can now perform \"Bro Links\" which, if timed perfectly, attach the two bros in completely non-sexual positions. These strategic entanglements will definitely benefit you in combat while also intimidating the enemy. Who wouldn't want to run around the jungle on the shoulders of their best bro as they slaughter rebel forces?\nIn addition to the vehicles, the Bros will have multiple utility items at their disposal. Here are a few examples that are already implemented, and I plan to add even more.\ngrappling hook: attaches to just about everything, uses include: \nswinging over large gaps\nattaching to a boss so you can get a better shot\nlinking to your bro's vehicle\nlinking to your bro as you're falling to your death \nhooking them into enemies and detonating at your convenience (dangle it from a ledge and go grunt fishing!)\nupgrade your vehicle with one and repeat all of the above!\nparachute: allows the Bros to glide when falling, uses include:\ngliding over large gaps\ndodging bullets by changing your falling speed\nif used just before a double jump, allows you to drift upward \nsand bags: block enemy bullets until destroyed, uses include:\nfortifying an area or specific side\nstacking up to reach higher areas\nlaunching or droping them on enemies\nstacking them to weigh down an enemy or flying vehicle\ngrenades: a grenade-like device that explodes like a grenade, uses include:\nlobbing them over shields to destroy hard-to-hit enemies\ntaking out giant hoards quickly\nslowing your old computer down with 1000+ gibs in the air\nA few months ago my girlfriend (high five!) sent me a link to a Contra cover that completely blew my mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqIRSMHtb2U\nHis name is Fernando Carabajal, and he has dozens of insanely good video game cover songs. I contacted him the next day and told him about Bullet Bros and he agreed to compose a completely original soundtrack for the game. I seriously can't listen to these without an ear to ear grin. \nThe look and feel of the Bullet Bros world is something I've been developing for over 2 years. It originally started as an exercise in creating a fully realized game environment to reinforce the curriculum I teach at FuturePoly. The more I fleshed it out I realized I wanted to create an actual game for the world I had built. Around the same time I started getting back into programming so I was able to use all of the pre-production work and concept art for Bullet Bros. This has helped the project move along very quickly and I still have plenty of existing concept art to work from and implement. \nTo achieve a game of this scope, I can't do it alone. I will need to hire a senior network programmer to handle setting up online co-op play, and another programmer capable of porting the game over to multiple consoles. I will also need to bring on an additional game designer to help with level creation and boss battles. Last, but not least, I'll need a community manager to ensure that your suggestions are heard and that you are able to influence the game in a positive way.\nI've been self-funding this project for the last year, and now I need your help to put together a kick-ass team capable of realizing Bullet Bros' full potential.\n$80,000- Initial Funding Goal. PC release, 10 levels, 10 bosses, 10 unique vehicles. 10 level songs. Local multi-player.\n$90,000- 5 more levels, 1 new boss and 1 new song.\n$100,000- 5 more vehicles, 5 more levels and add the world map.\n$120,000- Hire a network programmer and add online co-op!!! 10 more levels, 1 new boss and 1 new song. *added Linux and Mac release!\n$160,000- Hire a junior designer to help with additional levels and more refined boss battles. 10 more levels, 5 more vehicles and 2 new bosses. \n$180,000- Add comic book style cut scenes between chapters to flesh out the Bros' back-story. 10 more levels, 5 more vehicles and 1 new song.\n$200,000- Horde mode. 10 more levels, 5 more vehicles and 2 more Bro links!\n$250,000- Vehicle challenge mode. 10 more levels, 5 more vehicles and 1 new boss.\n$280,000- Hire another programmer and release on Xbox 360 and PS3. \n$320,000- Hire an animator for more player and enemy animations. 2 more Bro Link positions and 2 more bosses!\n$380,000- Xbox One and PS4 release!!! Crank the physics up to the max and 2 new bosses.\n$420,000- 4-player campaign and various death-match modes. Think Contra meets Smash Brothers.\n$490,000- 4 vs 4 team death match.

The game was born out of love and over the past year the scope has ballooned from a simple programming exercise into a full scale game. To help overcome this, I've waited and developed the prototype to a point where I feel it can be easily scaled up or down based on the interest of the community. \n\nAnother huge obstacle is budgeting the project and delivering it on a deadline. I feel very confident in this because I have owned and operated my own business (FuturePoly) for the last 4 years. With FuturePoly I am able to utilize the office space, workstations, and software, meaning all contributions to Bullet Bros will go directly towards production rather than start-up costs. This obviously takes a huge financial burden away from the project and also makes it much easier to budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jason Stokes\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nI have been working in the video game industry for over 13 years.

I was inspired to build this game because of the amazing experiences I had playing in a band. My vision is to build a beautiful puzzle game that enables everyone to make and share their own music. Everything in the game is rooted in this concept.\nHere's a video that goes into depth with the current prototype.\nAn important aspect of my vision is to help people feel good about the time they spend playing games. I want to give everybody a tangible artifact as a result from their time with the game -- something to be proud of. So you'll be able to record, share, and listen to the songs you make, right inside the game.\nMy goal is to build a vibrant community of players who create, share, collaborate, and encourage each other. I want to enable everyone to be a musician, even if you've never played a musical instrument before.\nI've built the Sentris prototype myself over the past six months, and it's required all of my savings to do so. Your support will enable me to build the best possible core version of Sentris over the next year.\n$50,000 is the minimum budget for developing the core features of Sentris. The completed version of the game will include:\nPuzzle Mode - Solve colorful puzzles and make music at the same time.\nFreestyle Mode - An expanded musical creation experience, without puzzles and with more control over the instruments and progressions of each song.\nLocal Multiplayer - Make music in Puzzle mode or Freestyle mode with your friends. Just like being in a band!\nMusical Instrument Library - A collection of different instruments, samples, and musical textures, compatible with any key signature.\nSong Sharing - Save and share your finished songs with anyone on the internet. Build your own fan base for your music. (Note: this sharing will not be in MP3 format)\nPlatforms - Play Sentris on Mac, PC, Linux, and Ouya.\nI believe that crowd funding is the best option to bring Sentris to the world. I want to be accountable to the people who want to play the game without compromising on my vision. I want to make an amazing game for people who want to play it.\nBeyond the core version of Sentris, there are a number of larger-scope features I would like to include. If the campaign is able to raise enough funds to support these features, they will be included in the first version of Sentris.\n$60,000 - Support for castAR - castAR is an Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality experience. This stretch goal will fund the AR/VR version of Sentris.\n$77,000 - Sound Sample and Puzzle Editors - Create your own sample libraries to use as instruments in any song. Design your own puzzles and share them with your friends.\n$92,000 - Procedural Song Systems - Algorithms for completely dynamic puzzle-songs. Create something completely unique every time you play.\n$110,000 -Downloadable MP3s of your songs - After you've finished a song, download your creation as an MP3 file for sharing with your friends, family, and fan base. (Note: if this stretch goal is not reached, songs will still be shareable in a different format)\nAdd-Ons can be included with any donation. To receive an add-on, first click Manage Your Pledge.\nOn this page, change your pledge to include the price of all Add-ons you would like. You don't need to change your reward tier to include these Add-ons. When the campaign ends, you will be sent a survey to specify which Add-ons you ordered!\nAvailable Add-ons are:\nAn extra copy of Sentris for Mac, PC, Linux, or Ouya - $20 per copy\nKickstarter-exclusive T-shirt - $25 per shirt (size & style will be collected in the survey)\nInternational backers under the $75 reward tier: please include an additional $15 per order for shipping outside the USA.\nSentris DVD Insert, autographed by Samantha - $10 per insert (case not included)\nAs a designer-developer I have a background in rapid iteration, experimentation, and prototyping. I believe these are the best methods to explore variations of design, facilitate learning, and build the best possible game experience. I also believe in exposing the creative process and showing everyone what happens as the game evolves. If this campaign is successful, I'm committing to regular backer-only development update videos that talk very openly about the creative process of making the game. I'm going to be building a lot more prototypes and sharing them in these videos.\nEveryone who backs at the $50 level will receive downloadable versions of these prototypes. These are going to be really cool and experimental, and they'll be unique from the finished game. Here are some examples of a in-progress prototype.\nSharing in-development and incomplete builds is something that doesn't usually happen in game development, and I think everybody will find the prototypes to be really interesting!\nAdditionally, I'd like to share the first images of visual concept designs by Daniel Moyer:\nI brought the Sentris prototype to the Seattle Indies Expo this past summer, and received feedback from about 50 players. Everyone had a chance to provide feedback after playing. Here are some of the things they said:\n\"It's really cool to see and hear the effects that your actions take and how the song comes together.\" - Tom M.\n\"As someone who lives and breathes music video games, you seriously have something here.\" - Nathan U.\n\"Having very little exposure to music games, but quite a lot of puzzle games, I can definitely say this is a game that would inspire me to play more of it.\" - Marie S.\nPlay testing Sentris at the Seattle Indies Expo\n\"As I picked up the concept and started to relax into the experience I was mesmerized by the flow.\" - Zaq W.\n\"Amazingly zenful game experience.\" - Justine M.\n\"Loved the mechanics.\" - Lucas C.\n\"The beat is infectious.\" - Scot S.\nA player tries Sentris for the first time\n\"I feel like this is a great base upon which to build a full game.\" - Brigham\n\"Looks phenomenal, sounds hypnotic.\" - Jacob W.\n\"Beautiful game, I dig the design.\" - Brandon C.\n\"I liked the sneaky difficulty of the game.\" - Maribeth W.\nI'm participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to the goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help Sentris get there and be a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, I commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\nOuya is now a platform option to receive the game when it's released, meaning anyone who has backed at a level that includes Sentris as a reward can choose to redeem it on Ouya.\nI've been working really hard on Sentris for a long time, and I'm ready to build the complete game and share it with the world. I need your help, so please donate and help me finish the game and tell your friends about the campaign. You'll all be able to make music together when the game is done.\nThank you!\n-Samantha", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSentris is an exploration into a new kind of music-based gameplay. Exploring a new idea always includes some inherent risk. In building the prototype, I've already mitigated the largest risks of the project. The provided prototype demonstrates my qualifications to make this new game a reality.\n\nThe remaining risks and challenges for Sentris are localized around differentiation between the final game and the current prototype. I'm committed to using a visual language of concentric circles, and I'm committed to making a game that enables everyone to be musically creative. Details of game mechanics, types of songs, additional platforms, and game features of the final game may vary from what's present in the prototype.\n\nMy plan for maximum risk mitigation includes developing multiple prototypes, and collecting player feedback. I want Sentris to be the best game it can be, and if that requires schedule extensions or seeking additional funding, I am prepared to explore those avenues. I want to be clear that if this campaign is successful, Sentris will be made into a full game, period.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Low key year... and a surprise!", "update_content": "Hi Backers!

If we were funding it purely based on our personal savings & residual royalties from our previous games, we'd have to make serious cuts to the scope & polish of the game. By coming to kickstarter, we'll be able to deliver the awesome game we're picturing in our minds while hopefully being able to involve the community more in the game-making process.\nSo how are we planning on using the projected $100,000? Here's a rough estimate:\nIn addition to any money raised through this kickstarter, we'll also be adding our own money from revenue of our previous games to the pile.\nWhat if the kickstarter gets overfunded? We don't know about you, but we hate it when kickstarters get a lot more money than they expected, drastically increase the scope of the game, and end up pushing the release date back months or even years. What's worse, some of these kickstarters drastically underestimate how much all those new features are going to end up costing with the result that they end up running out of money before they manage to fulfill all of their promises.\nWe don't want this to happen to us!\nWith the December 2014 fulfillment date, we've given ourselves a bit of leeway as far as development time goes. If we get enough money that we decide that we can spend a couple extra months polishing up the game, we'll be able to without pushing back that date. In addition to that, we could use additional funding to increase our audio budget and hire additional help so that we can get more done without noticeably increasing our development time.\nAnd what if after all this, we end up finishing the game and still have a good chunk of money left over? How about using that extra money to develop some free post-release DLC? We've released some major free DLC for our previous games (the alternate storyline in Cthulhu Saves the World & the Epilogue scenario in Precipice of Darkness 3) so we'd be game for doing something similar with Cosmic Star Heroine. Maybe a separate mini-Roguelike mode ala Lufia 2's Ancient Cave...\nEDIT: Note, we've improved some of the higher tier rewards from what these charts indicates. You can read about the changes here.\nIf you would like to customize your reward tier and add additional physical rewards to your pledge, you can! Just select your base reward tier (must be $100 or higher for the T-Shirt/Poster/Physical Molly & Epiphany add-ons; any tier is okay for the extra digital copy add-on) and then add the appropriate amount beyond the base as indicated below. We'll contact you before reward fulfillment to find out which add-ons you'd like.\n+$10 = Extra digital copy of the Game for either PSN (cross-buy so you get both PS4 & Vita versions) or computer (gets you Windows, Mac, and Linux for both Steam AND a separate DRM-Free version). Note, please limit PSN version to no more than 2 total per backer (including any gained through base reward tiers). No limits on the computer versions.\n+$100 = Additional T-Shirt\n+$100 = Additional Poster Set\n+$350 = Additional Physical Copy of Molly & Epiphany\n+$350 = Additional Physical Copy of the Cosmic Star Heroine Art Book\nNote, all pledges that include physical rewards that are outside the US will need to add an additional $10 for Overseas Shipping.\n\"Zeboyd Games is awesome & you should give them all your disposable income!\" - Anna \"Paws\" Marie Privitere who is probably totally unbiased despite having a character named after her in Cthulhu Saves the World\n\"Hey, this looks neat!

Thank you!\nWe'd also like to thank our friends at Sony, especially Shane Bettenhausen, for working hard to get us set up for PS4 & Vita development, helping spread the word, and getting us PSN codes to give away as rewards. Also a big thanks to the great staff at Steam who showed a lot of faith in us way back when we first pitched Breath of Death VII & Cthulhu Saves the World to them and have continued to support us with the Precipice of Darkness RPGs and now Cosmic Star Heroine. Thank you!\nThank you to everyone who backed our previous kickstarter! You guys are awesome! Switching over to PC allowed us to turn game development into a full-time professional career and not just a hobby.

We kick off the final 7 days of our Kickstarter campaign with our latest collection of movies, songs, animations, and artwork of all kinds, from Mighty No. 9 fans and supporters all around the world!\nFINAL GOAL: $4,000,000: ONLINE BATTLE RACE MODE!: REACHED!\nThe ultimate online competition! You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nFor more details on other goals, check out the Stretch Goal section further down the page, and our handy FAQ at the bottom!\nMighty No. 9 is an all-new Japanese side-scrolling action game that takes the best aspects of the 8- and 16-bit era classics you know and love, and transforms them with modern tech, fresh mechanics, and fan input into something fresh and amazing!\nYou play as Beck, the 9th in a line of powerful robots, and the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk. Run, jump, blast, and transform your way through six stages (or more, via stretch goals) you can tackle in any order you choose, using weapons and abilities stolen from your enemies to take down your fellow Mighty Number robots and confront the final evil that threatens the planet!\nNote: All images on this page are concept art and not actual in-game screens.\nEvery aspect of development\u2014art, level design, music, programming, etc.\u2014is being handled by veteran Japanese game creators with extensive experience in the genre, and with Mega Man in particular, all the way up to and including the project\u2019s leader, Keiji Inafune himself! Backers will have unprecedented access to seeing this team at work through blogs, podcasts, videos, concept art\u2014the works!\nMighty No. 9 is being developed for the PC with gamepad support (of course!), and will be made available through Steam and DRM-free digital distribution methods. Other platforms, including home consoles, Mac, and Linux, are a high priority, but only if we can afford them via stretch goals. Should we reach those goals, anyone funding the project will be allowed to choose which version of the game they would like to receive. The estimated release date is spring 2015.\nThis project is on Kickstarter so it can involve YOU, the fans! Not only will this make it possible, through crowdfunding, for us to make the game exactly as we envision it, but it also allows us to bring dedicated fans of this genre together to assist the team in shaping aspects of the game\u2019s design. We need your help! Let\u2019s make something amazing, and let\u2019s do it together!\n  So what makes Mighty No. 9\u2014the character as well as the game\u2014different? Simply put: the ability to transform! Of course our hero, Beck, earns new weapons as he defeats each of his fellow Mighty Number boss robots, but more than that, his body itself can also reconfigure into new shapes, allowing for all kinds of new skills and abilities! \nFor example, his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields... Or maybe extendible spring-loaded hands would allow him to activate far-away switches or work as a grappling hook... Or he could have a tank-like body, easily crossing over spikes and pushing objects around the levels... These are just a few possibilities we\u2019re considering (the game is still in the design phase), but you get the idea!\nAnd it\u2019s not only killing bosses that gets Beck new powers. Taking out other enemies with a certain weapon, or hitting them in their weak spot, can expose one of three types of \u201cxel\u201d (pronounced \u201ccell\u201d) energy Beck can sap (if he\u2019s quick enough), store, and unleash later via his own Mighty Skills! Give yourself a double-jump and speed boost for a limited time, unleash a concentrated flurry of powerful punches directly ahead, or set off a blast that hurts everything on the screen! Whatever final form it takes, this system will add depth and strategy to the action, as you choose how to approach and defeat even normal bad guys to best fuel your special powers.\nOnce, you worked together, side-by-side\u2014but now, your fellow Mighty No. robots have lashed out, taking over key strategic locations across the globe and infesting them with their minions. You have no choice: the other Mighty Numbers...Must. Be. Destroyed!\nBut it won\u2019t be easy. Although they were originally designed for industrial purposes, the Mighty Numbers have all become fierce warriors, seasoned through seasons in the most popular spectator sport of the future: robot-on-robot combat in the Battle Colosseo!\nWe can\u2019t reveal everything about the Mighty Numbers just yet (partially because we wouldn\u2019t want to dump it all out at once, and partially because we\u2019re still working on their designs!), but here\u2019s a taste of what we\u2019re aiming for. Keep checking back for more to be revealed soon, and study what you see here closely\u2014learning the tactics and weak points of these mechanized monsters will be your only hope of defeating them!\nOverheard at recess: \u201cBilly Backer says you can trick him into the water to make him freeze himself and he dies instantly!\u201d (Note: Not true. ...We don\u2019t think.)\n\u201cTommy\u2019s brother heard if you magnet his missile back at him and pause the game right when it hits, he loses all his health down to one!\u201d (Note: Also False. Probably.)\nAny game of this scope takes a team\u2014a big team, way too many to highlight here (keep an eye out for an update with more comprehensive staff info)\u2014but here\u2019s a sample of some key personnel for the purposes of this Kickstarter campaign:\n  That\u2019s where you come in. As a backer to Mighty No. 9, you will become a member of the Mighty community, and in a way, an extended member of the development team, where your input\u2014taken in aggregate along with your mighty brothers and sisters\u2014can help shape the game. How will we get your feedback? Well, for example: \nSURVEYS: Within the first few weeks of a successful Kickstarter campaign, members of the Mighty community can take part in a survey to help judge their overall priorities: difficulty balance, length vs. replayability, favorite features of older games and what you hate\u2014things like that.\nPOLLS: From time to time, the team will ask the community to choose between ideas or characters they\u2019ve come up with. For example, the first poll planned is to choose between several designs to pick the look for Beck\u2019s trusted partner, Call. (That\u2019s right: Beck & Call.)\nYou can vote for your favorite Call from now until the end of our Kickstarter; click on the image above for details!\nCONTESTS: Later on in production, the team will hold a contest within the Mighty community to design an enemy! Come up with your coolest or craziest design and a fun way to sell the team and your fellow community members on it, and who knows? \nAND ??? These are just a few of the ideas the team has already that all backers will have access to. (At higher pledge levels, more involved but necessarily-limited interactions like beta access and more are likewise possible.) \nWhat form will all the final fan interactions take? Hey, you tell us! We can\u2019t promise we can do anything you ask for, of course, but we can promise to always be asking, and more importantly, always be listening. That\u2019s what this project is all about! :D \nWe\u2019re proud to announce we\u2019re working with Humble Bundle for digital reward fulfillment and Fangamer for physical items! These guys have built a name doing exactly this kind of thing\u2014we trust them, and so can you. Now, on with the rewards!\nIf we can make our initial Kickstarter funding goal and nothing more, you can rest assured we are going to deliver a complete and fully satisfying game experience. But given the choice and the necessary funds to make it happen, we have a whole bunch of \u201creally nice-to-have\u201d ideas for additional content, features, and platforms (!) that would be extra icing on our already delicious \u201cneed-to-have\u201d cake! Of course part of any extra money will go toward making up the budget of the game itself, but if the following funding numbers are reached, we're also excited to offer:\n$1,200,000: Two More Stages: REACHED!\nOur initial goal sets the table with six main stages and bosses, plus a final stage leading to the ultimate showdown\u2014but now we can invite Mighty Nos. 7 and 8 to the party, each complete with their own, unique stage!\n$1,350,000: Mac and Linux Versions: REACHED!\nWhy should Windows users get to hog all the fun? Now we can offer Mighty No. 9 on both Mac and Linux as well!\n$1,500,000: New Game Plus and Turbo Mode: REACHED!\nIf we pass this goal, we\u2019ll design a New Game Plus mode that allows those who finish the game but are still thirsty for more to carry over certain powers or items from the first play-through for a more challenging \u201csecond quest\u201d version of the game. We\u2019ll also work in a Turbo Mode that lets you play through the game at a faster speed for extra challenge.\n$1,750,000: The Making of Mighty No. 9 Video Documentary: REACHED!\nGet an in-depth look at the creation of Mighty No. 9\u2014and an unprecedented peek into the typically ultra-secretive Japanese game development industry\u2014with three 30-minute documentary episodes produced by the wizards at 2 Player Productions (the same team behind our pitch video and the amazing Double Fine Adventure documentary)!\n$2,000,000: BONUS Boss Rush Mode: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right -- we\u2019re adding a stretch goal here without pushing any of the other goals back! (Think of it more like a stretch reward.) :) After a lot of feedback (which we agreed with) on the big gap before the next goal of PS3/Xbox 360/Wii U console versions, the team really wanted to have something for everyone to aim for and celebrate along the way. So we took our best-bang-for-the-buck potential future goal and will include it as a bonus feature if we can hit $2 million: a separate mode where you can challenge all the Mighty No. Bosses, back-to-back, with a clock ticking to keep track of your best time, so you can share, compare, and show off your skills to your friends! \n$2,200,000: PS3/X360/WIIU CONSOLE VERSIONS: REACHED!!!\nThis one deserves ALL CAPS AND THREE EXCLAMATION MARKS! Now we can bring this game to the audience that made the genre what it is in the first place: console gamers! Specifically, we\u2019ll make digital versions for release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U platforms. (You\u2019ll be given the option to choose any of these instead of the PC version.) \nThank you so much to all the fans who made this dream possible!\n$2,400,000: Challenge Mode: REACHED!\nSimilar to the Challenge Modes in games like New Super Mario Bros. U, this special extra mode would remix parts of existing levels and enemies to create dozens of mini-missions you can use to test your skills in a variety of enjoyably frustrating ways! \n$2,550,000: Extra End Stage & Boss: REACHED!\nWe\u2019ll add another full stage, complete with an intense, original boss battle (!), to the final area Beck will take on once he defeats the other eight Mighty No. bosses!\n$2,750,000: BECK & CALL ONLINE CO-OP CHALLENGE MODE: REACHED!\nWe\u2019re excited about all our stretch goals, but even so, this one is really special to us: based on your feedback, we wanted to offer something that both included Call as a playable character and put her on equal footing as Beck, while not breaking our schedule or budget. We also wanted this to be something new -- something the genre has never seen before. And that\u2019s how we came up with this: over a dozen missions you can play online with a friend, playing as Beck and his community-appointed partner, Call! Like the single-player offline challenge Mode, these missions will be parts of levels remixed, but this time around the theme of cooperative play. Players will need to use Beck and Call\u2019s different powers to complement each other and defeat these special challenges! \n$2,900,000: Intro Stage and Boss: REACHED!\nWe add an epic introductory stage\u2014complete with a closing boss encounter\u2014that players will take on before facing any of the Mighty No. boss levels! This will help ease everyone into the world of Mighty No. 9, and serve as a nice primer on the basic game systems and controls!\n$3,100,000: Support Character: REACHED!\nBeck will get a faithful sidekick to swoop in with special powers at his time of greatest need! The exact form this character will take is not decided yet, so we\u2019ll all be able to see it get conceived and designed together\u2014but it will be some kind of assistant that will drop in for a limited time, help out somehow, and then zoom away!\n$3,300,000: PS4 and Xbox One Versions: REACHED!!!\nYes! We heard your calls and are proud to report we can finally offer next-gen versions of Mighty No. 9 here! We know by the time the game ships in 2015, many of you will be proud owners of one next-gen system or the other -- or maybe both! If we reach this level of funding, we can add the PS4 and the Xbox One to the list for every backer getting the digital version of Mighty No. 9 to choose from! To recap, that would mean you could choose one of the following: PC, Mac, Linux, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, or Xbox One! \n$3,500,000: PlayStation Vita and 3DS versions: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right! At this level, we can make digital versions of Mighty No. 9 for the two most popular handheld systems out there: the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS! (These will both be added to the list of available systems to choose from, so every backer who is set to receive a download version of Mighty No. 9 can choose either of these as the system for their game download, instead of a home console or PC version.)\n$3,700,000 SINGLE PLAYER CALL STAGE & BOSS FIGHT!: REACHED!\nYes! We heard the feedback from our community, and at this level, we would be thrilled to fulfill this popular wish -- to add an all-new single-player level, including a boss fight, where you can play as Mighty No. 9\u2019s heroine, Call! We agree it would be a fun addition and a great way to mix up the action, so fingers crossed we can make it this far!\n$3,800,000: OPTIONAL RETRO-STYLE CHIPTUNE SOUNDTRACK + FX!: REACHED!\nYou\u2019ve seen the names of the legendary musicians attached to this project: Manami Matsumae, Takeshi Tateishi, Ippo Yamada... It\u2019s a veritable who\u2019s who of veteran game composers. So we thought, why not tap into that retro vibe and cook up an optional chiptune version of the entire Mighty No. 9 game soundtrack, including classic sound effects? That\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019ll remix the entire soundtrack, retro 8-bit-style, and the game\u2019s sound effects, for you to listen to in-game as you play, as an option you can toggle on or off in the settings menu!\n$4,000,000: ONLINE BATTLE RACE MODE!: REACHED!\nThe ultimate online competition! You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nWe're working out the details of our upcoming stretch goals now. More info here as soon as we have it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all know game development is inherently unpredictable\u2014delays and unexpected costs being the two most common \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d The good news is, in their more than 15 year history, developer Inti Creates have shipped over 30 different games on eight different platforms, and our project lead, Keiji Inafune, has either worked on or overseen 30+ games in this genre alone, as well as having lead one of the biggest Japanese studios, and some of the biggest AAA games ever. So not only do we have extensive experience with running successful game productions in general, but also experience designing, building, and shipping games of this type specifically, with an established track record of being on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge: we are working in two languages here\u2014Japanese and English\u2014with developers and backers on both sides. While we feel this is a huge plus, as it adds appeal and makes our project unique, there\u2019s no denying it also adds unique requirements in terms of communication and workflow. The good news here: We all have experience making and marketing games for BOTH English-speaking and Japanese-speaking audiences, and are taking extra precautions in pre-planning and during development to buffer and budget for things like interpretation, translation time, etc., all to ensure we stay on the same page with our backers and with each other.\n\nFinally, what we see as our biggest challenge: properly involving the community. How exactly do you ask for and integrate fan feedback and contributions while keeping a project like this on track in terms of vision, scope, and schedule? This is still something of a wild frontier in the game industry, as it\u2019s only recently that any of us have had the tools to make this feasible. And especially in Japan, where we have honestly lagged behind our Western counterparts in the variety of ways we\u2019ve been able to interact with our fans up until now.\n\nWe\u2019ve been researching different projects\u2019 approaches\u2014and some of us even have experience from similar experiments in the past\u2014but as far as we can tell, there\u2019s really no one established \u201cright way\u201d to go about it. However! We do think, in this case, even knowing that we don\u2019t know all the answers up front is important: it reminds us we need to listen, to establish methods of ensuring we hear our backers\u2019 choices and feedback, and keeps us more flexible. We are trying to work in a new way with this project that will allow us to show more things earlier than we typically would, while ensuring that everyone seeing it will have the correct context to see it in, and that there will still be plenty of nice surprises in the final product. \n\nOne aspect we already know to account for is anytime you ask a (hopefully!) large group of people to choose between options, especially when you\u2019re asking some of the most passionate fans in all of gaming, you are going to end up, by necessity, with some portion of them disappointed, and you\u2019re going to hear about it. We know we\u2019re ready for the ride, and even better, we\u2019re excited as hell to take it. The biggest thing we believe we should all keep in mind, both as creators and as backers: we\u2019ll be learning more and more as we go along, so let\u2019s be patient and work together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #123", "update_userinfo": "IMPORTANT NOTICE from Fangamer / Fangamer\u304b\u3089\u5927\u5207\u306a\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b", "update_content": "Hello Mighty Backers!\nFangamer has recently sent out the following notice.

Taking equal inspiration from hack \u2018n slash dungeon crawlers (procedurally generated dungeons, loot drops, etc) and Metroidvania-style platformers, the game aims to immerse you in its 2D fantasy world full of exciting treasure, deadly enemies, and abundant secrets. \nWe are attempting to create an authentic retro experience similar to the games you remember. Chasm was heavily influenced by games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Diablo. If these games are your style, then this is the game you have been waiting for!\nIn Chasm, players take up the role of a soldier passing through a remote mining town on their journey home from a long war. The town\u2019s miners have recently disappeared after breaching a long-forgotten temple far below the town, and reawakened an ancient slumbering evil. Now trapped in the town by supernatural forces, you\u2019re left with no option but to explore the mines below, battle enemies and bosses, and increase your abilities in hopes of finally escaping and returning home.\nThe mine entrance in Karthas.\n  Current and Planned Features \nExplore Metroid-like dungeons procedurally assembled from hand-crafted rooms in six diverse areas.\nEnjoy challenging retro gameplay and gorgeous authentic pixel art (320\u00d7180 native resolution) \nDiscover new special abilities and powers to reach previously inaccessible areas\nPlay how you want by equipping weapons, spellbooks, shields, and more to both hands\nUncover random loot drops and rare items\nBattle massive bosses & mini-bosses\nAvoid devious traps and platforming hazards\nIncludes Normal and Hardcore (Scored with Permadeath) Modes\nLeaderboards for Hardcore playthroughs featuring quickest time, least damage taken, and more\nWindows, Mac, & Linux versions with Gamepad support\nExploring the mines.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nSince James quit his job last year to focus on Discord Games, he has been relying on income from sales of Take Arms to keep the company running. He knew Chasm was a much bigger game than he could afford to make, but thought that if he could do it right, people would see the potential of the idea.\nWe met our initial goal of a playable demonstration, but funds for development are now depleted. Simply put, this game can not be made without your support.  We've been waiting forever for a game like this, but game publishers today just aren't interested in projects like this one. With your support, we will be able to finish the game ourselves and give you a truly amazing experience. Your generous pledges will go towards: \nLiving Costs: James and Tim still need to eat, pay bills, and afford life-giving coffee while they develop the game.\nPaying Artists and Sound Designer: We will need money to pay our wonderful team for their hard work.\nPolish and Improvement: Making sure Chasm is a quality, bug-free game with enough time dedicated to it.\nBusiness & Legal Costs: To officially sell the game, we need to keep up with administrative costs and other expenses related to the business.\nPromotion & Marketing: We will need to commission awesome final box art, promotional graphics, video trailers, etc.\nGetting the drop on some unsuspecting kobolds.\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $15 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless, we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux. See below for estimated system requirements. We're aiming to be content complete early 2014 and then release the game by May 2014. This is subject to change, and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging $30 or more ($25 for early birds!) will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain, but we will attempt to start it a couple months before the game is officially released to the public.The game will be highly playable at this phase (at least 90% content complete), but we will still be adding, removing and testing features. As a tester, you will have a direct effect on the game by playing and voicing your opinions and feedback on the private Developer forum. This also includes identifying any performance issues and bugs.\nChecking the map for directions.\nSystem Requirements \nThe requirements are subject to change. Chasm is being developed with older hardware in mind, and shouldn't be too demanding. However, due to how XNA's graphics system works, you will need at least a Pixel Shader 2.0+ capable graphics card. If you have any question of compatibility, please download the demo and try it out for yourself!\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7), MacOS X, or Linux\nProcessor: 2ghz+\nMemory: 512 MB\nGraphics: Pixel Shader Model 2.0+ \nFinding a hidden fountain.\n\nThe Team\n James Petruzzi - Producer - @DiscordGames\nJames is the founder of Discord Games, and serves as Producer, Game Designer and Programmer on Chasm.

Paying tribute to classic NES games like Mario, Mega Man, and Metroid, old-school gamers will find Rex Rocket a breath of fresh air, stirring warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia. Rob and Tyler, two passionate indie game devs, have a mission to keep the world of retro games alive. Rex Rocket features one-of-a-kind handmade pixel art, over 100 handcrafted levels connected in an expansive starship filled with a wide variety of puzzles, enemies, hazards and bosses. To top it off, we have an an original, kick-ass chiptunes soundtrack by Saskrotch. Creating this universe and the memorable characters in this game has been a true labor of love.  \n  Set in Earth's distant future, Rex Rocket references the classic story of Man vs. Machine. You play as Captain Rex Rocket, a former war hero who now spends his days transporting scientists around to the far reaches of the universe in his epic Star Cruiser, the S.S. Montana. The game begins on Earth with Rex and crew on a routine mission for the Council of Science - to transplant bio-engineered Terra-Oozlings to an uninhabited planet in the far away solar system of Washington. While the ship's crew are in cryo-sleep, all heck breaks loose when Terra-Oozings escape their tanks and cause the ship's main computer, LAUREN (Logic Analysis User Reactive Entity Network), to go insane. It's up to Rex Rocket to stop the computer, rescue his crew, and save the day!\n  Rob Maher (@r0bbieTheRobot): Web developer by day and Indie-Game Creator by night. Artist, animator, programmer, and game designer\u2014when their powers combine... they form Rob. Rob's love for old video games springs from his time as a child sitting for hours on end in front of the family TV playing the NES with his older brother by his side.\nTyler Bud (@kidexodus) : By day, a mild mannered student at The University of Toronto, but by night you'll find him scouring the city, illuminated by the glow of his laptop screen, slinging 1s and 0s into a story about a forgotten space Captain named Rex. As a young child Tyler grew up with a Gameboy in his hands, playing Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Land over and over and over again. A programmer of various languages for almost 10 years now, what he lacks in actual knowledge he makes up for with an unwitting ability to solve any problem in the simplest, least obvious, way.\nNigel Shields (@saskrotch): The composer, more commonly known as Saskrotch, is an innovator in the field of deciding which notes go in what order and for how long. Since becoming involved in the chiptune scene in '04, he's started two chip labels (Give Daddy The Knife and Handheld Heroes), played multiple Blip Festivals, the Era New Horizons film festival in Poland, and has been featured on releases from 8 Bit Operators, Inti Creates Records, and 8bitpeoples. This will be his 4th game soundtrack.\n  We will release Rex Rocket when we feel it's ready to be released.  But if we had to guess when that would be... January 2014. With Kickstarter funding, we can invest more time and resources into the game's development and pump Rex Rocket to the max.\nRex Rocket is being developed with the XNA framework. We are 100% positive that the game will come out for PC.  If it's called a platform then we want to stand on it! We are aiming to bring Rex Rocket to Macs, iOS Devices, Linux, XBLIG, Wii U, PS Vita, Nintendo 3DS and OUYA but we cannot guarantee them at this time.\n        Gamepad Support\nClassic 2D gameplay\nFast, responsive combat\nUpgradable Jet pack\nTeleporting\nDashing\nWall Jumps\nRegular Jumping!

We have from the beginning. It continues today to be one of our favorite ideas of the last decade. A system that allows for crowd-funded projects to come to life is an amazing step forward into a more open and free world. Making this game has been a dream. The idea that people out there could be wearing Rex Rocket t-shirts and hanging posters on their walls \u2014 there is really no way we would have the opportunity to do this without Kickstarter. Rob has a full-time job and Tyler is a full-time student. We have been working on Rex Rocket during the evenings and weekends and any spare time we can find. Starting this summer we want to focus our maximum energy on the game. It will be the difference between the game coming out at the end of this year and the game coming out at the end of next year. With your help we can do it. Tyler can avoid picking up contract jobs all summer and Rob will drop all freelance jobs to focus 100% of his free time. We're asking for the support of Kickstarter to cover this.\n\nThe basic breakdown is as follows:\n$500 - Provide financial assistance to Nigel to cover running expenses.\n$600 - Failed pledges / Kickstarter / Amazon (approx 10%)\n$600 - Producing physical rewards (approx 10%)\n$800 - Licensing fees\n$1,750 - Support Tyler over the summer so he can avoid contract jobs and work full time on Rex Rocket for four months.\n$1,750 - Support Rob while he drops all freelance work and focuses all his free time on Rex Rocket as well.\n\n\n\nGive us a vote on GreenLight!\n\n\nKeep up with transmissions from space on Facebook!\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals\nEven without reaching these goals we will still continue to work on bringing Rex Rocket to the following platforms - but with these goals met, we can guarantee them.\n-=BEGIN TRANMISSION=-\nGreetings, Cadets!\nAs I'm sure you've heard, we've completed construction of our new Star Cruiser, the S.S. Montana. You all deserve a round of applause for your fundraising efforts.\nWe still have a few weeks before our maiden voyage (beta)- and what a sight she will be! Until then, we've decided to open funding once again to enhance our ship's facilities and increase transport routes. Our new goals are listed below:\n\u2022 $9,000 - New transport destination: Mac\n\u2022 $10,000 - The ship's sonic technician, Saskrotch, will re-write the background music you hear over the PA system, specifically for eons-old technology- he has informed me these relics were called the NES, Game Boy, Genesis, and SNES- and transmit a digital recording to backers at ANY level.\n\u2022 $ 11,000 - New transport destination: Linux - Any cadet pledging more than $10 may submit data to be stored in the information nodes throughout the ship.\n\u2022 $ 12,000 - A special scenario will be uploaded to our simulation room's mainframe, allowing cadets to relive the events that led to earning my nickname, Rex Rocket.\n\u2022 $ 13,000 - New transport destination: OUYA - The ship will be outfitted with additional information nodes, boost reception for news casts and radio transmissions, and we'll pump an invisible gas into the cabin to make your fellow cadets more chatty. Out here in the cold, dark void of space, nothing is quite as comforting as being more informed and in-touch with your shipmates.\n\u2022 $14,000 - The S.S. Montana's facilities will be expanded by at least 25 rooms, creating a whole new area of the ship for you to explore, in an effort to keep you from going stir-crazy, or what the doctors here are calling \"space madness.\"\n\u2022 $15,000 - New transport destination: iOS - Our bio-scientists will get hard to work on a mysterious DNA reconfiguration they have failed to explain to me; they call it a \"Gender Swap\" option.\n\u2022 $16,000 - Despite warnings from both the human resources department and safety technicians, we will allow all cadets access to the ship's INCREDIBLY dangerous docking bay. Our sonic technician will be supplying this area with its own background music, designed to help you keep your wits about you. Again, your captain and crew thank you for everything you've done. The hardest times are behind us, and we now bravely look to the future.\nBe vigilant! - Your captain, Rex Rocket \n-=END TRANSMISSION=-\nGetting Rex Rocket onto any of Nintendo's devices would truly be a dream come true for us. We will do everything in our power to to get Rex Rocket on Playstation devices, Wii U, and 3DS but with the three platforms being closed we can't guarantee them.\nRecent Articles and Interviews\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2013/05/11/rex-rocket-a-platformer-full-of-pixels-menacing-ai-and-space-burgers/\nhttp://www.gamezone.com/originals/2013/05/08/dr-david-s-indie-spotlight-interview-with-rex-rocket-developer-robert-maher?utm_campaign=distribution&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=shared_link\nwww.joystiq.com/2013/05/07/rex-rocket-zooms-past-funding-goal-dev-looks-to-the-future/\nwww.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/developer_interview_rex_rocket_creator_on_bringing_pixel_heavy_action_to_the_3ds_and_wii_u\nhttp://calmdowntom.com/2013/05/should-i-be-excited-about-rex-rocket/\nhttp://jacehallshow.com/news/gaming/preview/20130501/exclusive-rex-rocket/\nwww.nintendolife.com/news/2013/04/rex_rocket_could_come_to_wii_u_and_3ds_if_funding_targets_are_met\nwww.indieretronews.com/2013/04/rex-rocket-2d-platformer-of-8-bit-retro.html\nindiegames.com/2013/04/kickstarter_projects_rex_rocke.html\nhttp://indiegamehq.com/rob-maher-development-greenlight-and-funding-for-rex-rocket/\n \n\nAvailable in Small / Medium / Large / Extra Large", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTyler is a very competent programmer, and he has already built most of the engine and level editor.

That being, to help us add the final features to Humans Must Answer, or else!\nBut first, here's some nice words about the game from humans we are currently holding hostage....\n\"Yes, it does indeed look like a proper shmup in the most classic of manners and does come complete with some fantastic graphics and lots and lots of explosions.\" - Gnome, IndieGames.com\n\"But eggstraterrestrials galaxy-faring coop-flyers are \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 only part of what makes Humans Must Answer intriguing. The other half of that equation, then, is the oh-so-silly shmup\u2019s pedigree.\" - Nathan Grayson, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"There\u2019s more to Humans Must Answer than simply blasting everything out of the skies, as you must creatively use your weaponry to take down seemingly unreachable enemies and trip switches in order to progress forward through the game.\" - Alex Coccia, Greenlit Gaming\n__________________________________________________________________\nSTRETCH GOALS\nHumans Must Answer will be released whether we reach the funding goal or not. The \u00a35,000 will go towards adding the extra polish the game requires, covering living costs and start-up costs that go into finishing and distributing the game.\nWe have the stretch goals in place because reaching those higher tiers of funding would supply the means to add features that we had to cut out previously due to budgeting considerations, as well as adding other features that have been requested such as co-op play.\nEvery extra tier that is reached will mean more work is required and, inevitably, that Humans Must Answer will release at a slightly later date than otherwise planned.\n__________________________________________________________________\nPLEASE HELP GET HUMANS ANSWER ON STEAM BY VOTING \"YES\" ON GREENLIGHT!\nSO, WHAT IS IT?\nEye popping explosions and a spectacular destruction system\nCombine weapons to devastating effect and deploy drone turrets\nSubtle and surprising narrative that is integrated into the gameplay\nShop with a large number of upgrades for the ship and weapons\nTough boss battles that require thought as well as quick reactions\nSecrets to discover and hidden eggs to collect but often at a risk\nQuite simply, Humans Must Answer is a 2D horizontal shoot 'em up, or shmup for short, set in the distant future. It features lots of explosions. You play as the pilot on board a Scout ship called The Golden Eagle, which is manned by a crew of intelligent and dangerous chickens. It's a small but agile ship that packs some devastating weaponry. Being proud of their avian heritage, these chickens crafted the ship in the image of an Eagle to represent their strength and proud nature...but they'd never admit to their inferiority complex.\nThe Golden Eagle\nAs much as we'd love to share the story of Humans Must Answer, we intend for it to be revealed as you play through the game. So, what we are prepared to tell you is that you headed to this particular Yolk System (Solar System, to you humans) to answer a distress call. But when you arrive it becomes apparent that things are not as they are supposed to be. To make matters worse, your first attempts to establish contact with the denizens only returns hostility. Now you're involved in an explosive race to get to the Yolk (the Sun) in one piece and find out what is going on here!\nYou'll have two main companions that will provide you with a number of quips throughout your journey across the planets. They are Ram and Bez. Fear not, they won't be jumping in mid-battle trying to grab your attention, instead, they appear as optional reads in between each level alongside your briefing before jumping into the fray.\nColonel Ram and Professor Bez\nWe've put a lot of effort into ensuring that Humans Must Answer is presented with shiny graphics and a suitably spacey soundtrack. We're very proud of the audiovisuals, and what may be surprising to hear is that each element has been fashioned by just one person. Olexa is our dedicated artist and he constantly wows the rest of us with his colorful vistas. We wanted to show how we put each level together, just so you can hopefully appreciate how much work has gone into making the game look like it does. The video below showcases every layer behind one of the levels set within New Uruk, which is a bustling human city upon Ganymede (Jupiter's biggest satellite).\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK!\nAs said, another aspect of the game that we've had lots of positive feedback on (and that you can grab as one of the perks) is the soundtrack. For this, we hired Morgan David King and he provided songs that hearken back to the games that inspired us but with more modern sounds, just like the graphics and gameplay achieve. The name of the artists and tracks are fictional so as to fit with the game's universe. Altogether there are 12 tracks with variations of some of those too! You can hear a couple of samples below: \nScratch - Chemical Zone\nVIA Magic - Space Fly\n\"Horizontal shmups are so slow...\"\nHush it, human! Some may instantly turn their nose up at the seemingly slow pace of Humans Must Answer (and every horizontal shmup), as they prefer the faster feeling vertical shmups. We're making a horizontal shmup because it allows us to focus on providing more interesting and challenging level design, and that includes some small environmental puzzles, just to add variety beyond merely shooting enemies with satisfying explosions.\nDeployable turrets allow two lines of fire\nAs far as influences go, the two most outstanding games are R-Type and Jets 'N' Guns. As anyone who has played R-Type will know, the difficulty is provided by the level design as much as it is the onslaught of enemies firing at you - this has had a big influence on Humans Must Answer as we want to ensure that you're challenged on as many layers as possible. Evasion and using your weapons in creative ways is a big focus for us, and this is is why we've introduced some puzzle elements.\nThese sections are pretty simple most of the time, providing you practice observation and patience; a juxtaposition to the in-your-face explosions of the majority of the game. Certain levels will require specific weapons to pass through them successfully, such as the \"Space Bombs\" that allow you to cause damage directly beneath your position. Or the deployable turrets that can be used to not only take down enemies more efficiently but also open doors and secret passages.\nDestroying two buttons to open the way\nOf course, the influence from Jets 'N' Guns should be fairly obvious - explosions, destruction, humor, and more explosions! You can replay levels as much as you'd like because there are no lives. The levels are fairly short but packed full of action and you will die lots. Many of the objects in the levels are completely destructible too, and we encourage you to lay waste to everything in order to find hidden eggs (that you spend on new toys) and to increase your score.\nAs you can see above, you're also encouraged to experiment with combining different weapons in Humans Must Answer. All of the weapons can be combined with the support weapon to create a few different effects, and each of these will serve you very well when trying to advance through the more difficult levels, and obtaining a higher score as well.\nMachine guns\nShotgun\nSpace Bombs\nLasers\nCannon Gun\nLightning Gun\nMore...!\nYou'll find all of the weapons, specials (slow-mo, shield) and upgrades available to purchase in the shop, but to unlock them all you'll need to collect the Golden Eggs hidden in levels and earn them by scoring well too. Once they're unlocked you'll then have to spend money earned in the game, and you can very easily sell what you've purchased in order to try out different load outs.\nBuy weapons, ship parts and upgrades in the shop\nSUMOM WHO?\n\nSumom Games is a small independent game studio based in Kiev, Ukraine. It was founded by Denis Matveenko and Eugeny Yatsuk in 2011. Having previously been employed by GSC Game World and Dark Shadows they have experience working on games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Xenus II: White Gold. \nAfter fiddling around with XNA while GSC was laying off staff, they decided to start work on their own game within a genre they loved - that ended up being Humans Must Answer.\nSPREAD THE CLUCK\nIf you like what you see and can spare the change in return for something close to our hearts, then do help us out by putting some money forward so that the game can be even better when it's ready for you later this year.\nIf you can't afford that but are enthusiastic about Humans Must Answer then please spread the word in any way that you can - it will help us out more than you might think!

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others. The more we raise, the more we can do. \nOUYA: THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 29371, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console", "project_name": "OUYA: A New Kind of Video Game Console"}}, {"backer": "Xona Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "UPDATE:\nPLEDGE ON PAYPAL HERE\nCluck Y'egger speaks!\nSpaceVenture is a sci-fi comedy adventure game that combines interplanetary exploration, puzzle-solving, and space travel- not to mention \u201cpant loads\u201d of pop culture satire and some good, clean \u201cpotty\u201d humor.\n\nWhen the spaceport \u201cfacilities\u201d are backed up and stuff\u2019s about to hit the fan...\n\nWhen someone\u2019s darling little spawn tries to flush their pet Narblitz down the john...\n\nWhen your life support ducts are in need of , er...life support...\n\nIt s time to call in a professional!\n\nWho is that professional you might ask?\n\nClick below to find out:\nMicrosoft Powerpoint version click here\n\nPDF version click here\nGOG.com  Credits have been added to the $50 and the $150 tiers!

Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe, aka \u2018The Two Guys from Andromeda\u2019, are back together. No, your optic orbs have not been on a bender. You read correctly. After a very brief 20+ year hiatus, we have joined forces once again and are tooling-up to bring you a new Space Adventure, or SpaceVenture\u2122, if you will.\nA little older, a little wider (well, Mark at least) and a bit more demented than before (a toss-up on that one), we're both ludicrously psyched to be working together again. Combine that with what has been literally years of pent-up intergalactic pressurized cabin fever to go with it and we have some real wonderful\u2026, uh, \u2018stuff\u2019 to share, incorporating that same style of comedy, wonder and delusion you expect from a Two Guys SpaceVenture\u2122.\nYou\u2019d be very surprised to know the range of requests we sought out and have been received from supporters. We know we can\u2019t be everything to everyone but we're working hard to find a happy compromise. The only thing we won\u2019t compromise on is your game-play experience (and maybe caloric intake).\n Scott and Mark will have their hands all over this project with final say on everything, including how much cheese and Orat meat goes in the crust. What this means, people, is that no aspect of this game will come into being without the personal, crusty-eyed, occasionally salivating and barely comprehensible approval of The Two Guys from Andromeda. This is YOUR guarantee, for you fans and friends, that everything you are about to see is ultimately the work of The Two Guys. \nBefore we go any further, lets make clear one major question. What platforms are we working to make the game run on? Scan this list: \nPC\nMac\nLinux\niPad\nAndroid Tablets\nAll of those platforms, from day one of the release!\n\nOur philosophy from day one and game one was to make games that WE would want to play and that, ultimately, YOU would as well. We aren't straying from what has been a successful formula according to our sales then and your feedback since.  We're back to create more while also incorporating what we've learned in analyzing our past work, from you via comments made from the days of snail-mail to the present methods of email and social media. It\u2019s been fascinating to learn what you\u2019ve found fun, funny and/or annoying, and what games you\u2019ve favored. Clearly, not everyone has well-rated taste, but we can work around that. Yes, we're givers!\nThe way games are made and gotten into a player\u2019s home and on to their devices of choice have changed greatly thanks HUGELY in part to Kickstarter. They are helping dreams come true for so many of us. During that time you have continued to talk about the adventure game genre and how you\u2019ve missed it. We're adapting to the changes, taking advantage of them and charting a new course through this new space, and looking forward to finding that \u2018new game smell\u2019 that we can enjoy and to bring to you as well.\nWe have fan encouragement, you incredibly loyal fans who have kept the legacy of their work alive. We appreciate the many fan sites, fan games and fiction, game homage\u2019s and remakes, but probably the best part of the past has been directly related to some very enjoyable, interesting and inspiring emails. Thank you for sharing your stories with us about what the games meant to you from whether you enjoyed them (or not), which puzzle(s) made you mad, and who you played them with. Some were actually quite poignant and those will never be lost on them.\nYes, you read that right. FREE stuff,  another small thing we wanted to do to make your visit to our Kickstarter page special as well as to be a little different than the others, not that they didn\u2019t blaze a brilliant trail for all of us. We think you'll agree that not taking it to the next level would be lazy and sad on our part.\nWe want to give you a small digital \u2018thank you\u2019 gift just for showing up and at least considering supporting us. We never want you to feel we aren't grateful regardless of what you decide. We're nothing without you. This wallpaper image was put together for you by Mark Crowe specifically for our Kickstarter campaign. Thank you for hanging in there and seeing this.

We've invested in the absolute best virtual office environment money can buy (on the cheap). On a serious note, this also allows us to be an Earth conscious company by being able to go Green.\nNo commuting, much less wasted paper and toner, Rogaine for Mark and Clairol for Men for Scott, etc.\nIn doing this, it allows us to hire top tier game developers - all big Space Quest and adventure game fans, of course - to help make this a reality. Having fan-developers means we'll get the best possible results because of the passion they also carry for our style of the genre. This model helps keep costs down on overhead like office space, so more goes into the game.It also allows us to partner with people in quite literally different parts of the world! \n BUT, with all of this we will need YOUR help! In order to make this dream a reality, we are asking our fans and friends to contribute through our Kickstarter campaign and to help us to once again do what is a serious passion we have never lost, and what drives us to make the very best games we can, games you've asked for. Not only do we have some of the top game developers available, we are also pulling in some of the top voice over talent as well! We take multimedia seriously, if nothing else. For voice talent we know you want the one and only narrator, the man with the golden pipes, Gary Owens. Done! But take a look at, along with Gary, a few of the others already on board to voice our characters.\nGary Owens  - Narrator from SQ4 and SQ6, voice of Space Ghost, Laugh-in, and many many others in a long and distinguished career.\nRob Paulsen - Pinky from Pinky and the Brain, Yakko from Animaniacs, Raphael the Ninja Turtle, and multiple characters from Monkey Island among many other characters he has voiced.\nRobert Clotworthy \u2013 Jim Raynor from StarCraft 1 & 2, Senator Evran & Supreme Chancellor from Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Narrator of The History Channel\u2019s Ancient Aliens series, Big Bang Theory, etc.\nEllen McLain - GLaDOS from Portal 1 & 2, Overwatch from Half-Life 2, Administrator from Team Fortress 2, Witch from Left for Dead 2 and many more.\nJohn Patrick Lowrie - Sniper from Team Fortress 2, Sword Control from Halo Reach, Citizens from Half-Life 2 and author of Dancing with Eternity.\nFor musical talent we are talking with some of the best composers we can find. Did you like the music from the Space Quest series? We are in talks with some of the original composers, including the man that brought you the music from Space Quest 3, Supertramp rock legend Bob Siebenberg.\n (THAT EQUALS \u2018WE LOVE YOU' IN GAME DEVELOPMENT LINGO)\nWe fully intend to bring back every element that you guys loved from our original games! You\u2019ve been very clear and concise as to what you enjoyed from our previous efforts. Here\u2019s a short list of things you can expect if our project gets funded:\nA Sci-fi adventure from Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe working happily together as a team once again. \nHilarious death sequences \nTons of the fresh (and moldy) pop-culture references  \nFun and unique humor  \nArt design and direction by Mark\nDialog that will make you blow nostril Tang, written by Scott along with Mark\nNarration of all this by Gary Owens and the voice acting of other characters by the above mentioned quality industry voice talent \nGame music that will hopefully give you chills and wedge in your main orb for the rest of your natural Earth life and make you wish you lived inside your computer!  \nA game that you will feel comfortable playing with your children, but with some entertainment that will safely appeal only to the adult psyche  \nYes, we know, they all say that, but WE really mean it! Fresh from the Sarcasm Cluster and the Hyperbole Nebula, this is the first Kickstarter effort by the Two Guys From Andromeda. We're here to tell you THIS is huge to us.\n We really are going to do things differently than some of the other campaigns you may have seen, even though we love those people, so don't take that in a mean spirited manner. We know you guys are aching for something truly special, so we've been butting heads in the Andromedan luxury bunker to come up with a way you guys can feel extra, extra special while we empty your bank accounts for our own devious, suspect ends: You are going to get something fun to play throughout our Kickstarter campaign! Yeah, you read that right! \nHere is what we\u2019re talking about:\nEvery time we reach another $100,000 milestone, we\u2019ll release another enhanced prototypes version for you to play.\nThe playable prototypes will be the direct ideas of Scott and Mark. (Who else?)\nWe will take your feedback to improve the demos for each milestone.\nEveryone involved in the project will be keeping a project diary, including Scott and Mark! (You may have problems reading Scott\u2019s, but we'll do our best to provide Cliffs Notes or a hieroglyphics translator.) Do you ever wonder why Scott chose a specific piece of dialog to go into a particular game situation? Or how Mark built the Space Quest 2 box or was inspired to create art for a certain game location? Wouldn\u2019t you like to know? \nThese are the things you\u2019ll be privy to in our behind-the-scenes diaries for the new game! The project diary will be dated and time-stamped as everyone involved documents their thoughts and feelings throughout the game development process. (Don't be alarmed by occasional high-pitched sounds that sometimes drown out the spoken audio. It's really just a technical glitch. Those crazy gizmos these days! or bleeps as they are know in the industry.) This will include lots of behind the scenes photos, short videos, and audio clips that give you fascinating insight as to how things were brought to life - and how much we had to tip the cleaning lady to remove trace evidence. \nAlright, let's talk rewards! We know you're dying to be rewarded. (Who isn't?) And we're dying to reward you because, really, we wouldn't be in all this mess without you guys, right? We know that and we appreciate it. We hope you know that. So, apart from the running demo thing, we really want to make sure you get something of additional value.\nFirst of all, everything you have read above is being giving to you at just $15.\nThat\u2019s right, a DRM-free digital download version of the game for PC, MAC, or Linux, a code that allows you to play the game on Steam, as well as all the behind the scenes material turned over to you once the game has been released. All that for just $15! We may even get the Space Quest historian to write you a completely generic congratulatory message - with YOUR name cut and pasted in. Yes, YOUR name! Just for being so awesome!\nOkay, we can sense that won't cut it for some of you. Well, if that doesn't sound exciting enough, how about this?\nFor those that want to step things up a level, we hope you\u2019ll find that we have included some really awesome reward tiers. (Prepare for a nosebleed.) The rewards should tickle the fancy of people who like physical collectibles, autographs, as well as those who love digital goods! In fact, for those of you who live outside the US and don\u2019t want to deal with customs issues, consider our \u201cDigital Only\u201d reward tiers -- the one-stop shop for getting your nerd on without leaving the comforts of your remote, backwaters Earth nation! (As opposed to OUR remote, backwaters Andromedan location.)\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW A PDF VERSION OF THE CHART\nWe created this chart to help you understand the rewards you\u2019ll get for participating in the various tiers of our Kickstarter campaign!\nSome of our rewards allow you to have your name etched in digital eternity by becoming part of the game. One thing you have made VERY clear to us is that although you want to see your name in the game, you also don\u2019t want to take away from the game play. So, to help with this, the game will randomly select a name from the pool of those people who have paid the highest amounts and plop them fully across the screen at regular intervals for the duration of the playing exper-- sorry, that's not right. Of course, we're kidding! Here's what's ACTUALLY going to happen: There will be a very limited amount of names in the intro credits. There will also be many well crafted \u2018Special Thanks\u2019 in the closing credits which will optionally run upon exiting the game. These will not hinder game play or the experience in the least. You may be credited as the Head of the Andromedan Nose Ministry, or maybe the High Council on Mohawk Regulation and Hair Product.\nMany of you want more recognition, so we\u2019re giving it to you. Who are we to argue with vanity? The game will have \u2018hidden objects\u2019. There will be a collection of digital fan cards placed very strategically in the game. When you see one, you simply click on it, and the card will zoom to the front of your screen and tell you about the fan on that particular card. We feel this will add an extra element to the game, get you excited to give to the project, and give us the ability to reward you in the game for finding them all.\nBut if that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, we\u2019ve thought of that too. If you feel this hinders your game playing experience, you can simply disable this feature at any time! But that one idea you guys had actually made a lot of sense. We're not going to force our closest friends and most loyal supporters down the throats of people who couldn't care less. But we ARE going to give the people who truly want it to have the chance to turn on the feature for all to see, and bask in your glory. Oh, and did we mention we love you? Oh, you knew that already, right?\nA personal message from \u201cThe Guys\u201d\nWe wish to express our sincerest thanks and gratitude to some amazingly talented and dedicated folks for helping us get this Kickstarter campaign launched in high style.\nSpecial thanks to:\nBrad Herbert, Chad Briggs and the rest of their visual FX team at Element X Creative for they're truly amazing and heart stirring intro animation. Their passion for all things Sierra and for Space Quest in particular really shows through in this \u201clabor of love\u201d, as Brad puts it. You guys are fantastic. We can\u2019t thank you enough! Everyone should check out all other amazing stuff their up to at: http://www.elementxcreative.com/\nhttp://artofsierra.com\nSpaceQuest.Net has been so amazing for allowing The Two Guys From Andromeda to house their forums with them! \nJustin Crowe for his mad videography, direction, and post production skills. Justin, a University of Oregon Undergrad, studying Journalism and Digital Arts, managed to pull some gripping, Oscar- worthy performances from a couple of old, broken down has-beens from Andromeda- all while in the midst of mid-terms. Check out some of Justin\u2019s documentary work here Justincrowefilm\nMartin Kool and Q42, a studio based in the Netherlands, with a passion for the adventure genre for approaching us with some innovative solutions for bringing our vision to multiple platforms simultaneously. You\u2019ll be seeing more of what we mean in the next few days and coming weeks as we rollout something really innovative and unique to the whole Kickstarter concept.\nNot coincidentally, Martin is responsible for Sarien.net and for bringing some of Sierra\u2019s classic games (including Space Quest) to the iPad.

It follows a group of vigilantes as they fight their way through the streets of a lawless city. We like to think of it as Double Dragon meets Castle Crashers. We\u2019ve already been working on in for 18 months and this Kickstarter project will get us the last bit of funding we need to see it through to completion. We are developing this game in XNA, so we\u2019re targeting a release on Xbox LIVE Indie Games and PC.\nWho are you guys?\nWe\u2019re two brothers, Matt and Jake Lewandowski, who\u2019ve been making and playing videogames together since we were kids. You may know us best as Team Fist Puncher from IGN\u2019s \u2018The Next Game Boss\u2019, a reality show that pitted six teams of indie developers against each other as they raced to complete a fully functional game over the course of one week. We won that show with our game Washington\u2019s Wig, a platformer starring George Washington\u2019s fictional dog, Dogsworth McFreedom\u2026 wearing a powdered wig of course. Hopefully this proves we\u2019re not just a couple buffoons, we\u2019re legitimate indie developers with legitimate indie beards.\nHow do we know Fist Puncher will be any good?\nWe\u2019d like to think it\u2019s already pretty good, but we\u2019re perfectionists and we don\u2019t want to release a game that isn\u2019t all it could be. There are currently 8 playable characters, including Dr. Karate, Steroid Jackson, Kid Justice and Hella Fistgerald. Each has their own unique backstory and move set. There are also over 30 levels, hundreds of unique enemies and tons of hidden and unlockable content. Not only did we win IGN\u2019s Next Game Boss competition, we showed the latest build of Fist Puncher at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) this year. For three straight days we put Fist Puncher to the test with media, industry professionals and hardcore gamers \u2013 and the reception was overwhelmingly positive. We believe we have a really fun game on our hands here, a perfect mix of old school aesthetics and modern playability. We\u2019ve tried to infuse our unique humor and personality into Fist Puncher, but we believe gameplay comes first!  Check out a few Fist Puncher trailers or take a look at some gameplay footage from GDC below:\nWhat do you need $10,000 for?\nSo far this project has been 100% self-funded. We\u2019ve already spent thousands of hours bringing Fist Puncher to the point it\u2019s at now, creating every piece of pixel art and every line of code from scratch. Since we both have full time day jobs it can be slow going creating a game on nights and weekends. $10,000 would let Matt quit his job and devote his time to making sure the game gets finished by this summer. The money would help us officially setup a company, deal with business licensing and start our game studio the right way.  It would also give us extra resources to find a publisher so we can get Fist Puncher to the masses.\nWhat do you still need to add?\nEven though Fist Puncher is fun and fully playable as it is, we want to make it amazing. This is what we plan to add and improve over the next few months:\n\u2022 Better Boss Battles. We have bosses but we haven\u2019t had the time to sit down and make them a real focus. Beat \u2018em ups need to have memorable bosses and we intend to give Fist Puncher some of the best.\n\u2022 Improved Level Design. Beat \u2018em ups have not always been famous for level design, usually they just involve waves of enemies for you to button mash your way through. However, we\u2019re committed to fine tuning the pacing and strategy needed to make our levels more interesting.\n\u2022 Finish the RPG Elements. You can already gain experience, level up and assign skill points to each characters\u2019 various categories, but making the RPG elements really shine takes time and balancing.\n\u2022 More, More, More. We already plan on adding more levels, enemies and unlockables, but we want Fist Puncher to be deeper. Any funding we obtain in excess of our goal will be used to add as much content as we can.\nKeeping you up to date.\nWe\u2019ll post weekly updates and video footage of our progress. You\u2019ll get to see what we\u2019re working on and offer feedback on what we\u2019re doing. Your input matters. Since we\u2019re just a two man team, if you convince one of us something belongs in the game, there\u2019s a good chance it will happen.\nThank you!\nWe\u2019re passionate about making games and we\u2019re excited to put the finishing touches on Fist Puncher and get it out to a wider audience.

If you have any of these 4 weapons, you will have no advantage over another player, just some more options for what guns to choose from =). \nUPDATE #2: We have FOUR brand new weapons that only Kickstarter backers will be able to obtain.

Burn holes in your opponents and dice them into tiny blocks with this new melee weapon.\nUpdate #3: The Guncraft model for the $150+ category finished, and it's awesome!! Check it out in the rewards section below or in the updates section!\nUpdate #4: Gameplay trailer is ready! See the updates section for more info or just watch the trailer below!\nUpdate #6: Gameplay trailer with MMGN.com is up and ready. Had a 90 minute playtest session with them and it was a blast. Check out the highlights.\nGuncraft is a PC/XBLIG first person shooter utilizing voxel (cube-based) based levels and graphics as well as construction elements. We strive for this game to be a mainstream first person shooter experience utilizing all the best features of a voxel engine.\nOther games have touted having fully destructible environments, but you could never create craters in the ground, blow giant holes in the side of buildings, or kill someone by destroying the ground underneath them and dropping them to their untimely doom. We have that. Voxel engines allow us complete and total environmental destruction. But wait, that's not all! We also have complete and total environmental CONSTRUCTION.\nNot only can you build anything and everything using a variety of blocks, but you can also construct, what we call, Prefabs. These are full structures, custom-made by you, that can be placed in game if you have the resources for them. We also have rewards packages that allow you to build turrets, SAM sites, tanks, helicopters, drones, and much, much more.\nWhen you've custom created your own level, share and destroy it with others through competitive online play! Don't be afraid of destroying your creations, because all destruction and on-the-fly construction is reset after every round. There will be many modes, varying from traditional deathmatch, king of the hill, and capture the flag, as well as a few unique game modes, not seen in any other FPS games, that we have yet to announce. There will also be leaderboards, and if we raise enough, full clan support, out of game chat rooms, and other features that will extend your experience beyond just playing the game.\nWe already have many features fully implemented and are well on our way to creating many more. We expect a beta to begin in March, with our full release by June at the latest (on PC). The XBLIG version of the game is still up in the air as far as a release date.\nWell besides donating to our cause and getting cool prizes, there are also a plethora of unique in-game contributions you can help make for the game. Do you want YOUR FACE immortalized in one of the maps? We have a reward for that.Do you want an actual model done of yourself, that can be used in game? We have a reward for that too. You can even get your super awesome map put in the game or implement a gameplay feature of your own! We are offering a TON of ways to contribute to the game, besides monetarily.\nKeep in mind though. Kickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING. If we don't make our goal, we get nothing and you guys don't get your awesome rewards. So be sure to spread the news!\nWe are currently around 60-70% done. The remaining time will go into finishing the remaining gameplay features we have (which will vary depending on how much this Kickstarter raises) and putting the finishing polish on the user interface graphics. These Kickstarter funds will go into the final development of the game and will allow us to afford our expenses to take it to that stage. \nGo HERE to see the rewards at a bigger size.\n$1 Reward\nWe need all the help we can get to make our game a reality.

What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

The film follows the dramatic journeys of indie game developers as they create their games, and as they release those works, and themselves, to the world.\nIndie Game: The Movie is about making video games, but at its core, it\u2019s about the creative process and exposing yourself through your work.\nThe film tells the emotional story of a two-man team, Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes, as they craft and release their first major game for XBOX, \"Super Meat Boy\". It follows Phil Fish, the creator of the highly- anticipated game, \"Fez\", as he shows it for the first time in 4 years at the giant gaming expo, PAX EAST. And, the film tells behind-the-scenes story an independent designer, Jonathan Blow, who made one of highest-rated video games of all-time, \"Braid\".\nFour developers, three games, and one ultimate goal - to express one\u2019s self through a video game.\nThe Music\nWe are extremely excited/proud/lucky to announce that the uber-talented Canadian musician, Jim Guthrie, will be composing the music for the film. In case you don\u2019t know Jim, he is the composer/collaborator/muse behind this year's much-lauded indie game release, Superbrothers: Sword and Swocery EP. (It is beautiful and magical - check it out now if you haven\u2019t!).  You can check his soundtrack ('The Ballad of the Space Babies') and more of his great work on Bandcamp.\nThe Current Status & Why We Need You\nWe're done filming and have a very solid rough cut.  The finish line is wonderfully close and we\u2019re on target to have IGTM complete in mid-August.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve done everything ourselves on this project. The producing, directing, cinematography, editing, and writing for the feature film and all the web videos we\u2019ve made during the process. But, now we need some help from others and support to get the feature film done right and taken to the next level, technically-speaking.\n\nWe're looking for help with the finishing costs of the feature film (audio, colour, and mastering) in order to make this movie the best possible version of itself.\n\nTo date, this project has been solely funded by the original Kickstarter campaign, website pre-orders and personal savings (often ill-advised in the film world :)   \nIf you like what you see in the trailer and on the website, please consider pre-ordering your copy today. These pre-orders are really help us make the film better.\n\nPlease pass on the trailer and tell your friends about the project. We hope to get a lot of people to see this film, hear these stories and learn more about indie games. Many thanks!\nThe Regular Edition DVD\nThe DVD will include the film, deleted scenes, videos about the making of the film, a directors commentary and a real-time commentary of the film from Edmund and Tommy of Team Meat.  Basically, we plan to cram as much extra features as we can on the regular edition.  Whatever can not fit (which will be a lot) will find a home on the Special Edition.\nThe Special Edition DVD\nThe Special Edition will everything in the regular edition DVD, as well as feature new content, stories behind other notable indie games, and expert discussions about games and game design. We will be telling these stories individually and thoroughly, with the same polish and motion graphic treatment of the feature film.\nThe Digital Download Pre-order\nToday, we're now taking digital pre-orders for the film! (Please note that this will include only the main film itself and NOT any of the extra / special features.)\nBut, now, what if you ordered a DVD version over the past year, you'd prefer a digital version? Our solution:  You'll get both :)\nAll DVD and Special Edition pre-orders from start of the project until the end of our latest Kickstarter campaign, will get a digital copy free of charge. After this date, digital copies will likely be sold separately.\nThe Release Plans\nWe're hoping to screen the feature film at some festivals and create a number special event screenings this Fall.\nOur goal is to release the DVD, the digital download, and the DVD educational version/license by the end of this year or very early in 2012.\nThe Special Edition will be release in early 2012. However, those backers will not be left in the cold and will receive a digital copy when the digital version / regular DVD is released.\nWho have we filmed with?\nOver the course of production, we have filmed with the following people - all of whom make appearances in either the film or the film\u2019s Special Edition: Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes (Super Meat Boy), Phil Fish and Renaud B\u00e9dard (Fez),  Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness), Ron Carmel (World of Goo), Alec Holowka (Aquaria/Marian), Derek Yu (Aquaria/Spelunky), Steph Thirion (Eliss/Faraway), David Hellman (Braid), Adam Saltzman (Canabalt/Gravity Hook), Jason Rohrer (Passage/Sleep is Death), Kellee Santiago and Jenova Chen (Flower/Journey), Matthew Wegner (Flashbang/Blurst), Chevy Ray (Beacon/Flashpunk), Mark Johns (Hot Throttle/Space Barnacle), Mark Essen (NIDHOGG/Flywrench), Erin Robinson (Puzzle Bots), Jeff Lindsay (Hacker Dojo), Steve Swink and Scott Anderson (Shadow Physics), Kyle Pulver (Snapshot), Simon Carless (UBM TechWeb Game Network), Brandon Boyer (The Independent Games Festival), Anthony Carboni (Bytejacker), Gus Mastrapa (Contributor Wired, EGM, Edge), Jamin Warren (Kill Screen/Former Reporter, The Wall Street Journal), Chris Dahlen (Kill Screen/Pitchfork/Onion AV Club), and Ken Schachter (Trapdoor/Warp).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "A Closer Look at the Special Edition Box Set", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "IGTM Special Edition", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "THANK YOU.", "update_content": "[Update Preface:  The download codes are currently being sent out.

Life as a touring screening show is an interesting one.  It\u2019s certainly busy, certainly tiring, but showing the film to theaters full of folks who seem to dig the film, immediately makes all that tired busy-ness worthwhile.  Our first stop on the tour was Tommy\u2019s hometown of Asheville, NC.  \n The evening went really well. It\u2019s pretty neat to be able to have this film exist for the guys in the film as a testament to how hard they worked and how crazy development can get.  Because, we\u2019re sure that no matter how much Tommy, Ed & Phil describe to their family/friends what development was like, it must still be eye-opening, and a bit of a revelation to see them actually go through the development process\nAfter the show, we did a Q&A in which we answered some hanging questions and Tommy doled out sage game dev advice to the audience (we\u2019re writing down all of his answers so that we can repeat them later, if asked).  Many of whom travelled jaw-droppingly long distances to be there (Charlotte, Tennessee, Florida, Ohio?!?).  We\u2019d like to think they came exclusively for the movie, but judging from the prevalence of Meat Boy Tattoos (yes...multiples), it\u2019s kinda clear:  They came for the Tommy, but stayed for the movie :)\n After Asheville, with Tommy in tow, we drove over to Raleigh and had a very intriguing set of screenings.  For these screenings, the good folks at  & , helped present the evening & get the word out.  As a result, the audience was packed with Epic, Red Storm & Insomniac employees.  We always believed that, even though the film deals with independent development, that the base motivations & thoughts contained in the film were pretty universal.  But there was still a nagging (and kind of scary) question mark in our heads as to how AAA devs would react to the movie.  There certainly were a lot of those in the crowd at GDC, but this was the first time we had a room of a near-majority of large studio employees.  Were they going to like it?  Relate to it?  Hate it?  We didn\u2019t know - when the lights went down, we were a bit nervous.\nWe peaked into the sold out crowd frequently for the first 10 minutes.  We\u2019ve screened the film enough times to get a pretty accurate vibe from the audience based on audience reaction to specific moments in the film.  So by the time minute nine rolls around, we know if they\u2019re into the film.  \n\nMinute nine came and they were seemed VERY into the film.  It was one of the most enthusiastically audible crowds we\u2019ve ever had.  Their laughs were loud and knowing - you could tell that they\u2019ve been at similar points in their career.  Minute 9?  Huge relief.\n\nAfter the show was another Q & A, lots of lobby talk, hanging out and meeting some super nice, super cool people.  In the morning, it was off to Atlanta...\n This time we were showing at the awesome - and historic - Plaza Theatre. A great theater.  A fantastic upside to booking your own independent tour is that the theaters you end up in mostly independent theaters.  Theaters that they tend to be owned & operated by people who love cinema.  You walk in, and you can feel it - these guys care about & really love what they do.  The places have character - some quirks to be sure - but all of it adds to the experience.\nWith  &  as our wonderful hosts. It was another full house, and another great showing. Atlanta represented in full force. We did a Q&A and later grabbed some beers and met some of the Atlanta indie scene.  A perfect way to cap off our southern swing.\nOf course, no blog post about this tour is complete without an  shout out.  They have been absolutely amazing to us.  Not only is their support making this all happen (seriously, it is), but they are giving out some incredible prizes.  At each of the shows, Adobe gave out an !  That\u2019s a dead-serious prize right there.  In this tour swing alone, audience members walked away with over $12,000 worth of software courtesy of Adobe! We can not thank them enough!\nSo, right now, as we type, we are airborne, en route to Seattle for another collection of screenings.  Thanks to everyone who came out to the shows over the last week.  We had a great time and hope you did to.
