[{"backer": "Rare Audio Works | Joel Young", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "FLYTE is a levitating light which hovers by magnetic levitation and is powered through the air. With FLYTE, we've set the lightbulb free.\n                                                                                         The world moves so fast, so take a break from gravity and experience something surreal that appears suspended in time. FLYTE requires no batteries and powers light through the air via induction. \n \nMAKER KIT: Create your own levitating thingy. The FLYTE Maker Kit includes a base and a magnet with 4 ultra bright LEDs powered wirelessly via induction. Share it with your friends, or combine them to make multiple levitating light sculptures. Light will rotate slowly around the room. We can't wait to see what you'll come up with.\nDesigned in Sweden, the FLYTE base is made of sustainable sourced oak, ash and walnut. We want your FLYTE to look good, feel good and last a long time. We use energy efficient LEDs rated at about 50,000 hours. That's 12 hours a day for 11 years! \nNikola Tesla's Wireless Power System\nWireless power transfer transmission has been around since the days of Nikola Tesla. With FLYTE we've packed some of Tesla's tech and combined it with magnetic levitation, opening up a magical world of possibilities. Our wireless power module transmits about 5V and is completely safe and harmless. Edison and Tesla can finally be friends.\n Power is transferred wirelessly from the base to the bulb.\n\nHow do I levitate FLYTE?\nGently lower the bulb over the center of the magnetic base. The LEDs will start to light up and you will start to feel an upward resistance. When the bulb is positioned exactly at the center of the base, you will feel a gentle release. The electro-magnets will automatically center the bulb in position. Slowly let go of the bulb and it willl lock in position, light up and rotate slowly. \n\nFLYTE custom series features a handmade diamond-cut wooden base. Each unit is unique and numbered, and is made in Sweden from elm wood. Get your limited edition piece crafted from designer and woodworker Dan Henriksson.\nTurning on & off your FLYTE is as simple as touching the surface of the base. Light will turn on & off while the levitation will remain intact.\nOur capactive touch sensor is where the magic happens. Our FLYTE switch feels effortless and smooth, just like touching wood.\nCharge your smartphone...through the air.\nPlace your phone over the base and the built-in induction coil will transform your FLYTE into a wireless charging base station.*\n\n *Requires third parties accessory.\n\n FLYTE is the result of years of research using magnetic levitation and induction technologies.  Here are just some of the designs and iterations leading up to FLYTE.\nWe have secured our relations with our manufactures and ready to start the production process but in order to make this a reality, we need your help. We have moved out of the prototyping phase and are now ready to bring FLYTE to you.

This allows you to keep your original charging cable with you on the go so you will be able to charge your Pebble at work, school or in your car. You will save $15 by not having to buy another charging cable!\nTimeDock with detachable micro USB Charging Cable, Pebble Time model, and Pebble's included Charging Cable\nUSE YOUR PEBBLE HOW YOU WANT\nTimeDock allows your Pebble to be useable no matter what. Keeping the watch propped up ensures that the display is always visible and easy to access even when its not on your wrist. You might not be able to wear your watch all the time, but you should always be able to use it.\nTimeDock White in the Kitchen with Pebble Time model.\nTimeDock White on the Nightstand with Pebble Time model\nWORKS WITH PEBBLE TIME AND TIME STEEL \nThe Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel both have the same charging port, in the same location. The TimeDock can be used to dock and charge either watch!\nTHE TIMEDOCK IS FUTURE-PROOF\nThe TimeDock's charging module is expandable! We've engineered the charging module as a separate piece from the plinth(body), giving you room to upgrade or change as your smartwatches change. \nTimeDock Blue on your Side Table with Pebble Time model\nCUSTOM TIMEDOCK WATCHFACE\nEdwin & Philipp over at LIGNITE Collection designed a custom TimeDock watchface based on input from our backers.

I love my original Pebble and use it everyday. When Pebble launched the Kickstarter for the new Pebble Time, I really wanted one and backed it right away.\nI spend a lot of my time in my machine shop and wearing the Pebble watch is not the best way to keep it out of harm\u2019s way. Since I\u2019m always looking for new things to help organize, I wanted a dedicated place for my new Pebble Time that would not only keep it protected, but keep it charged as well.\nI started thinking about how to build an intuitive charging stand for my new Pebble. I wanted the watch to still be usable and the display visible while on the dock. The watch can be docked to charge and display information while you are at the office, at home, and on the nightstand as you sleep. As the final design materialized, several friends asked if they could also have one made, and I realized that more people like you would be interested. \nOur target goal to bring the TimeDock to everyone is $40,000. This will help cover our manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and keep the shop lights working.  Also, we'd like to get a little back to help pay the people who have helped make this KickStarter possible. I hope you like the Time Dock for Pebble as much as I do.

It's fair to say though that it doesn't quite look as sexy as the final product will. So check out our website or Facebook page to see what the glasses will look like...\nYou can have a say in which product design you want us to make by voting on our Facebook page - just like your preferred style, and whichever gets the most votes is the one we will make!\n\nThe next stage of the Sealz project is tooling & manufacturing. It is expected this process will take up to 3 months. We are partly self-funding this process (as it costs a lot more than our Kickstarter target), but we are asking for kickstarters to help us along the way... and in the process secure themselves one of our first ever products. All money raised will go towards product quality and manufacturing, and if we exceed our target, towards additional product enhancements (such as a ventilation system to prevent fogging in extreme environments).\n Product description & specifications\nMay be worn casually as an ordinary pair of fashionable sunglasses.\nWhen required, an effective yet comfortable air-tight/water-tight seal is activated around the eyes. The silicone seal offers full protection from the environment (snow, wind, water, surf, sand, dust).\nWhen worn in the sealed position, the glasses can be instantly released by pulling the lens piece forward, returning them to sunglasses mode - in order to ventilate the lenses, or just to generally increase the level of comfort. When you're ready, hit the button again and the seal is reactivated.\nMilitary grade, impact resistant, anti-scratch, polycarbonate lens - improved durability and suitable for industrial use.\nFull UVA/UVB protection.\nPolarized lens to reduce glare (cuts out 98% of reflected light).\nAdditional lens features such as hydrophobic coating (to reduce water spots on the outside), anti-fog coating (to reduce fogging on the inside) and photochromic lens are all being explored and may be available depending on the extent of our Kickstarter success.\nMarkets and applications\nWhile the military has continued to show a keen interest in the development of the product, the innovation has also started to gain traction with athletes and sporting communities (in particular water, snow and extreme sports). These communities are enthusiastic about the product's versatility and rapid transition properties, and how these may improve performance.\nTriathlete Anthea Stacey represents Australia in triathlons, and is the current 70.3 Busselton champion (18-24 age group). \"I tried the Sealz prototype out today and I absolutely love the idea. One of the main problems we do have in triathlon, in transition from swim to bike, is trying to coordinate getting the helmet on and the sunglasses on at the same time. You lose valuable time, you lose about three to four seconds, which in sprint distance triathlon can make or break your race if you don't get on the wheels of the other guys.\"\n  PLAY\n\nDrew Stevenson, hailed by many as the 'Godfather' of European snowboarding, has come on board the Sealz team as an advisor, in particular with respect to the snowboarding market. Drew has been a huge force in the development of the sport, having launched and run the TTR World Snowboard Tour and Method Mag, and was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award in 2008.\nOther sports showing interest include skydiving, base jumping, mountain biking, SUP, surfing, swimming, canoeing, sailing - and many more.\nIn addition to the sports segment, there are numerous other applications for Sealz glasses we are currently exploring, including with emergency services and in the health and safety space of the energy, chemical and construction industries.\nGiving back: Soldier On\nIn acknowledgement of the military origins of the project, Sealz is donating 1% of its profits, and 1% of all funds raised on Kickstarter, to a charity called Soldier On. The registered Australian charity supports returning soldiers who are physically or psychologically wounded, working to enhance their recovery and rehabilitate them into the community. \n\n  Coming to life: early drawings...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects involving first time manufacture of a new product, the key risks for Sealz relate to the manufacturing process. Specifically, the ability of the manufacturer to deliver what they say they can, and within the timeframe they say they will.\n\nWe will be working with a manufacturer in China, but in order to mitigate the above risks we will also employ an experienced intermediary with local representatives to ensure we have proper on site communication and supervision of the production process.\n\nAnother common risk with this type of project relates to whether our manufacturer can successfully replicate our prototype using injection molding. However we have held comprehensive discussions with designers and manufacturers and are confident this will not be a problem with Sealz.\n\nCheck out our BIO page to see the full breadth of skills and experience within our team of advisors - which will also go a long way in mitigating the above risks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "James Khng", "content": "None of the emails work and i still haven't received my glasses.

No worries you can Pre-Order your Sarvi Dock by clicking the button below.\n **************Visit www.sarvidesigns.com for more information**************\nSarvi Dock is the first dock with cases as the starting point for the design.\nWe found that today most people use protective cases of different sizes to safeguard their devices. Finding a dock to fit protective cases can be difficult if not impossible. This is why we created Sarvi Dock - a charge and sync dock that works with any smartphone or tablet, in portrait or landscape orientation virtually any case and cable (third party, factory or even flat cables).\nWith Help from Kickstarters we funded and created Sarvi Dock V1 and backers loved it! Now based on their experience and feedback we have improved upon the design and now bring you Sarvi Dock V2.\nWorks With More Cables? - Sarvi Dock has a universal kit that works with factory cables, all MFI cables, virtually all third party cables and even flat cables. We also added more cable channels to fit different sized cables. Designed for devices that work with Lightning, Micro USB and 3.0 USB cables. Sarvi Docks do not come with any cables.\nOne Handed Undocking? We hate reaching for our device and the dock wont let go and dangles in the air.  Sarvi Docks have 4 nano suction pads that keep them anchored to smooth surfaces for stability and easy one handed undocking. They also have cable grooves to keep the cables in place. Sarvi docks won't slide or hold your device hostage.\nNo Tipping or Wobbling - A robust back support with a rubber non slip pad secures and protects your device. The back support design reduces the stress on the connector while the non slip pad eliminates lateral motion and scratches from your device.\nSeriously Any case? Yes we designed it to work with all Apple, Samsung, LifeProof, OtterBox, Griffin, TakTik, Seidio, Gumdrop, Ballistic, Rockform, Speck, Switcheasy, Trident, Kensington, Joy Factory cases and many many more. The universal kit adjusts to fit any case - It adjusts horizontally and vertically. With Sarvi Dock there's no need to take off your case just to charge your phone anymore.\nHere is a link to our Youtube page demonstrating Sarvi Dock with many different cases, smartphones and tablets. Click here for the link.\n Headphones and Sound - An elevated design keeps your speaker and microphone ports unobstructed. This means headphones can be used, your sound is unobstructed or muffled and your calls, Pandora, iTunes radio, video conferencing, gaming and much more are still crisp and clear through the speakers.\nCraftsmanship - Each Sarvi Dock is CNC machined from aircraft grade aluminum then bead blasted and anodized. The resulting piece is a sculptural marvel that looks great everywhere. When you get yours you will have an appreciation for the details and work that goes into each dock \nLandscape Kit - The new landscape kit allows you to use your device in the landscape or portrait position.\nSarvi Dock Everywhere - Devices are very stable and secure using Sarvi Dock. Making it great for FaceTime, second display, notifications, texting, bedside alarm clock and much more. Use yours everywhere.\nSarvi Dock Colors - Sarvi Docks will come in Black, Grey and Gold as shown below.\n Whats In The Box? Each box comes with a Sarvi Dock, Universal Cable Kit, Landscape Kit, Base Cover and 6 screws.\nProduction - Good design takes tweaking and re-tweaking. Over a year has been invested in designing, testing and building prototypes of the Sarvi Dock. We have invested funds into optimizing the manufacturing process to ensure a smooth production run. The right manufacturer with the level of expertise and materials to meet our standards has been secured and with Kickstarters support we can produce Sarvi Dock.\nHow We got Here - If you have ever broken or scratched your device you know that cases protect your investment. You may even have different cases for occasions that need varying levels of protection. The more protective your case or the more times you change your case increases the frequency of removing your device from the case before you can use one of the docks  currently in the market.  Although simple, a lot of time, dedication, engineering and many many failed attempts went into Sarvi Dock. We have created the very first dock for Apple and Samsung devices that works with ANY Lifeproof, TakTik, OtterBox, other extreme cases, naked devices and everything in between using the cable that comes with your device.\nSARVI DESIGNS We formed Sarvi Designs to launch our first product - Sarvi Dock - to market. Our forte is bringing products to life and building relationships with vendors across the world and we are the perfect team to bring Sarvi Dock to life and on time. With kickstarters on our side we will succeed!We need help from the Kickstarter community to produce our first order. We have already invested a lot of our funds and resources into this project and If we can achieve our funding goal Sarvi Dock becomes a reality.\n\n \nDisclaimer: We have no ties or affiliations with the makers of OtterBox, LifeProof, TakTik, Apple, Samsung or other case manufacturers whose products are used for demonstration in the video. No endorsement implied. We are just people who needed a new way to dock :-)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst of all we have done this before here on Kickstarter so we know what it takes to run a project, overcome challenges and deliver a quality product.\n\nWe have spent the last year testing, designing, modifying and retesting and optimizing the Sarvi Dock 2 design for a smooth manufacturing stage. We took all the feedback from our backers on Sarvi Dock 1 and improved on the initial design. Now Sarvi Dock 2 is much better and refined design than Sarvi Dock 1. \n\nAfter many early samples and test models we have made several fully functional final product prototypes with our manufacturer. These samples have helped us finalize colors, finishes and manufacturing details. Our manufacturer has tremendous experience in the area of die casting and we are confident in our timeline. We also have an excellent fulfillment partner to expedite the shipments.\n\nFollowing the first launch of Sarvi Dock on Kickstarter, many inquiries came in requesting more device compatibility. We listened and created the Universal Kit that works with virtually all factory and third party cables including flat cables. This way you can use the cables that you already own and even if you change devices you can be confident that Sarvi Dock will still work for you.\n\nIf we get enough people to believe in our vision of this Sarvi Dock we will communicate effectively, provide regular detailed updates, set the right expectations and strive to produce an exceptional Kickstarter experience for those who believed in our vision. These are the tools we have used to create successful relationships with our vendors and business associates.\n\nEven with all planning laid out manufacturing is always rife with unexpected variables. We are the team to ensure transparency and communication to overcome these variables and achieve the best results.

I didn't slander you, but you did have the audacity to diminish my assertion that this campaign, in my experience, is quickly becoming one of the worst campaigns I have backed on Kickstarter(out of more than 40 I have backed). You can throw around as many claims as you want in a desperate attempt to silence my contempt for what is transpiring, but what I have stated is true and it won't stop me from voicing my displeasure. Since your not the creator, why don't you let the project's creator answer my questions. Your statements about delays and backer priority ultimately mean nothing since you have no connection to the company according to your own comment. Based on your responses, it seems the only way someone can voice their distaste with a campaign and label their interaction with a campaign as one of the worst they have experienced, is if they haven't received anything. Well I haven't received anything, but I challenge that assertion because the campaign is 6 months late and the limited interaction which has been provided has no concrete information pertaining to a ship date for at least 1/4 of backers. These attributes are certainly not consistent with any project that would be labeled standard or good and it isn't a leap to conclude that this could be labeled bad or the worst in a backer's experience. The backers which have received their docks haven't been what I would call elated, since backers have remarked that paint finishes haven't been up to their standards. So why don't you let people voice their concerns and their distaste with their pledge since it is certainly within their right to do so and leave the questions directed at the project's creator, Sarvi Designs, to the project's creator to address and answer themselves. I know, speaking for myself at least, that I don't need you addressing my questions directed at the project creator or your other critiques of my comments. So why don't you do me a favor and keep your diminishing statements of my comments to yourself. As you have stated, before you make anymore statements directed towards me, make sure you don't leave yourself open to any libelous comments.", "time": "over 5 years ago"}, {"username": "Mark Gray", "content": "Not being a creator, I have no idea how Kickstarter sorts backers - if it does at all - and whether that has any bearing on whatever fulfilment platform (or spreadsheet!)

Other cat toys are often mass produced outside the US and quickly fall apart. For the future of this project, we are planning Seattle based manufacturing for job creation and sustainability for years to come. After this project ends Cat Fishin' Toys will be available on our website. http://catfishintoy.com/ Thanks again for everyone's support!\nCat Fishin' Toys\nThe Fishy Blue Mackerel has a sleek shape with mackerel markings. The Nice Red Snapper is slightly fatter with a larger tail for more pronounced swim action and snapper fish markings. The Seattle Salmon is our largest fish with amazing fishy action and salmon markings. All fish work well with either the 12\", 24\u201d or 30\u201d pole but the smaller poles are intended for tight spaces.\nCat Fishin' Toys Deluxe\nCat Fishin' 24 Toys\nCompact Cat Fishin' Toys\nCat Fishin' Football Click the picture to watch video\nThe Cat Response\nThese toys are irresistible. Cats will literally bounce off walls and leap as high as they can. After enthusiastic Cat Fishin', they'll roll on their backs to rest and continue pawing for it. \nCat Fishin\u2019 Maneuvers\nIt\u2019s up to you to discover your cat\u2019s preferences for cat fishin'. Younger cats have enjoyed fast action followed by a pause so they can practice their stalk and pounce routine. For older cats, fast action followed my slower maneuvers within reaching distance may work better. This can be fun for all ages and bring hours of entertainment daily.\nWhere We're At\nCat Fishin\u2019 prototypes have been developed to produce amazing action through the air. We have stamps for the Nice Red Snapper and the Fishy Blue Mackerel and they work great for stamping fish marking and our web address CATFISHINTOY.COM.\nProduction will take place in Seattle, Washington. This will involve stamping and cutting out fish, sewing attachment flap to fish, attaching nylon line to fish and pole, and packaging each Cat Fishin\u2019 order for delivery by April 2014.\n Find us on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/catfishintoy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are familiar with Kickstarter projects. In 2013, we successfully launched a wind turbine on Kickstarter. Only a few problems were reported from delay in shipment due to customs outside the US. We are committed to fulfilling all rewards and will do everything we can to bring Cat Fishin' to your front door as soon as possible.\nCat Fishin\u2019 started last year when I ventured down into the basement to create a toy for our cat, Marla. I've used the feather on a stick dangler toys but they were quickly ripped apart. I needed something more robust, yet tempting like feather. \nInitially, I started with a simple nylon streamer which worked okay, but it needed better action. I then tried fishy shapes which brought significant improvement. The toy now looked like fish, moved like fish and made an irresistible swooshie sound. \nCat play with any dangler toy should be a supervised activity. Owners are advised that cats have been known to chew and eat just about anything. We've been testing with 6 cats over the last year with no problems. \nNontoxic ink is used for stamping. Rip stop nylon is widely used for a variety of products and accepted to be a safe durable material. If the rip stop starts becoming weak with holes appearing, the fish should be replaced. Indoor cats often become over weight from lack of activity which leads to a lower life span. Cat Fishin' can be a fun way to help cats become active again or keep any cat healthy, loving and happy.

Expandable - Build a Mono, Stereo, or Dolby Surround sound system with one, or up to five, hexagonal speakers. For listening to music alone, one speaker may be enough; for listening to music with the neighborhood, five speakers will fill almost any space, wherever that space happens to be. Regardless of the configuration you choose, however, the sound quality remains simply stunning.\n\n2. Portable - Featuring 10 hours of battery life, and a contemporary leather case, portable speakers have never been this stylish or this powerful. The unit does have a certain re-assuring heft, to be sure, but then so does the sound.\n\n3. Quality Built - Unmonday speakers will be made by professional craftsmen from the very best materials, with no visible, cheap-looking plastic parts. The patented hexagonal ceramic housing provides a superlative soundboard for the Alpair 10 full range driver.\n\n4. Durable and Accessible - The porcelain housing is built to last a lifetime, as well as provide an easy access to internal components. Simply open six screws, and the entire speaker can be disassembled, allowing for repair, should your speaker become damaged.\n\nWhatever the situation - movies in surround-sound, gaming in stereo-sound, or music in good old mono - you will never again be subjected to poor sound quality or insufficient volume.\nWhy another wireless speaker? \nSimply put, existing, stationary wireless speakers did not satisfy our own particular listening habits and needs. What we needed was something truly portable and flexible, but also something that did not compromise on sound quality or on good design sensibility.\n\nTrue portability and flexibility were essential to us. Over the years, we managed to collect several sets of speakers, which now sat idly in most rooms of our house. But this idea - that you need a pair of speakers for your TV, a pair for your computer, and one for your record player - seemed hopelessly outdated and environmentally questionable. We needed a simpler solution, one that would allow us to avoid this over-supply of unnecessary and unconnected speaker systems.\n\nFor us, Unmonday is that solution, providing the perfect supply of sound, for every situation.\n\nWith Unmonday, for example, you can position single speakers in different rooms of the house during the day, allowing people to listen to their favorite music, in all its mono or stereo goodness; then, in the evening, collect the speakers together to watch a movie in true Dolby Surround Sound.\nAnd Unmonday loves to be social. In planning your next event with your friends, just imagine everyone bringing their speakers along to the party, ready to fill even the largest space with floor-rattling sound.\nSimply tilt the speaker to the desired channel\nListening to music, wherever you find yourself, should not involve a mess of wires or a tiresome, and often mysterious, hardware pairing process. This is why we designed a speaker that aims for simplicity and usability in all things, without compromising on the most important thing: the sound of the music.\nWe think that once you try Unmonday, all other wireless audio solutions will seem unnecessarily complex.\nHow is all this done? \nWe have developed the Unmonday concept, testing different configurations, for more than three years. \nWe found that Apple's Airplay technology is best suited for our needs. Its simplicity allows for a pleasant and straightforward user experience, and the wireless bandwidth allows for a superior sound quality, especially when compared to other alternatives, including Bluetooth. This also means that our speakers not only expand your aural range, but, like the Airport Express, also expand the range of your wireless network.\nWe also added a motion sensor, similar to the one found in most tablets and smart phones, to determine the speaker's position. This allows the speaker to be assigned one of five Dolby Surround channels, simply by rotating the device. Of course, we could have made the channel assignment through software, or through hardware buttons, but we knew there must be a better solution, an eventual solution that elegantly embeds the user interface, literally, in the design itself.\nOur custom amplifier is made to measure and delivers optimal results from both the ceramic housing's acoustic soundboard, as well as the Alpair 10 driver. Using pre-made parts was simply not an option here.\nWe will also be releasing a free application for managing multiple speakers. While the application is not intended as the primary interface, it will allow users additional control over their system, for example, adjusting volume or monitoring battery levels on multiple devices.\nThroughout the design process, we refused to compromise, which is why we believe Unmonday is unlike any other commercially available wireless speaker system.\nFeatures: \n4.3 Liter Porcelain Housing\nAlpair 10 full range driver \nWireless router \nMotion Sensor \nAmplifier \nBattery life of 10 Hours \n3.5mm plug\n1 button (reset)\n1 wire (charging) \nUNMONDAY  /  AIVAN  /  AIRPLAY  /  LUMI\nfacebook.com/unmonday", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have secured deals with Apple and Dolby on using their technology, we have patents, a supply chain (even packages), and a huge enthusiasm for this project.\n\nThere is however one thing to do before we can call this a finished product:\nIn order to be officially certified by Apple and Dolby, we need to send production-spec speakers to both companies for testing. There is a risk that these test products will not meet their standards and that we will need to make adjustments, and produce a new run.

We've got other goodies to say Thank You for backers at less than $50 (see rewards descriptions to the right ---> ), and we've also got a Fully Custom Super Pipsqueak Bundle at the $200+ level.  Design your own Pipsqueak!   \nHow Does Pipsqueak Work?\nPipsqueak\u00ae is a Bluetooth phone designed just for kids ages 3 and up.  Connecting like a wireless Bluetooth headset, Pipsqueak will work with nearly every cell phone out there including iPhones and Androids (and all Bluetooth capable phones) allowing mom or dad to route an incoming call directly to their child. \nIf we are successfully funded on Kickstarter we will also be able to complete our smartphone applications (iPhone and Android) that will enable mom and dad to select numbers from their contacts that are permitted to pass through to Pipsqueak. This means no chance that a kid ends up talking to someone mom or dad doesn't approve of!\nWhy Pipsqueak?\nPipsqueak is telling Daddy about the homerun he missed while he was away on business.\n\nIt's telling Grandma about the dance recital and thanking her for the flowers she sent.\nIt's handing safe technology to a child that gives them freedom to connect to those away from them, empowering children and their grown Loved Ones to create memories that will last for years to come.\nREALLY Easy to Set Up \u2013 Pipsqueak will work on any Bluetooth capable phone with a few simple steps. After the one-time set up your child can talk on their very own mobile device while your expensive smart phone is safely on the counter and out of harm\u2019s way. \nAny parent with small children and a cell phone knows the risks of handing their pricey cell phone over to their child.  With Pipsqueak parents no longer have to worry about missing that phone call they are expecting or worse yet, getting their phone back with emails deleted or the touch screen damaged.\nOur Story\nAbout 20 months ago I was standing in the kitchen getting dinner ready when our oldest daughter (then 3 1/2) came in talking to her Grandma on my smartphone.  She said \u201cgoodbye gramma\u201d and handed me the phone. \nAs I hung up the call and wiped the cheek-jelly smudges from the touch screen it occurred to me that there ought to be a more convenient phone for our kids than my smartphone.   Not only is my phone very expensive but it's also pretty easy to damage. \nHas this ever happened in your house?\nThat\u2019s when I said to my husband \u201cHow hard would it be to make a Bluetooth phone for Lilah?\u201d \nPipsqueak is Fun, Durable and Safe. A Bluetooth phone for Lilah and every other kid who wants to connect!\nMy husband Michael has been in the wireless phone industry since before we started dating 14 years ago.  His experience has given him just enough knowledge and contacts to be dangerous with this type of idea.  He thought a Bluetooth kids\u2019 phone was a \u201cbrilliant idea\u201d and started talking about a little flip phone with changeable covers and charms, fun sounds and on and on\u2026.as he tends to do. \nFaceplates and Dangles (charms) are easy to change on Pipsqueak, allowing kids to personalize their phone to keep up with their changing interests.\nWe became consumed with this idea, and realized Pipsqueak was the solution to so many problems we grappled with as parents of young children faced with handing them a phone way too \"adult\" for them.  We discovered other parents faced this dilemma, too.  Pipsqueak is the answer!  That's why we founded Yip Yap, Inc. and we've worked exhaustively for a year-and-a-half to make Pipsqueak a reality.  We're now on the verge of our first production run.  But to make that happen we need your help Kickstarter!     \nWhy Might Pipsqueak Be Safer Than a Cell Phone?\nBluetooth has a power output value less than 1/1000th the output limit for cell phones as set by the FDA and FCC. For additional information check out what the American Cancer Society has to say about Bluetooth versus Cellular.\nTell Me What It Does Again\u2026\nPipsqueak allows children to talk with their loved ones in a way that is safe, age-appropriate, affordable, and fun.  Plus, Pipsueak has a lot of great features that make it more than just a Bluetooth phone. \nPipsqueak allows your child to talk on their OWN phone while your expensive smartphone stays safely out of their hands!\nIt\u2019s a Phone \u2013 Your cell phone will think it\u2019s connected to a Bluetooth headset, and your kid will think they are connected on their own phone.   \nNot only a phone, Pipsqueak is also a portable music player with long battery life that stores hundreds of songs. The 3.5mm headset jack works with all 3.5mm headphones and speakers. (As demonstrated by our 7-year old, Lincoln)\nIt\u2019s a Music Player \u2013 Capable of holding hundreds of full-length songs, Pipsqueak plays your child\u2019s existing music loaded via USB from your computer. OR, like a wireless speaker you can stream music via Bluetooth from any Bluetooth music source.\nOptional faceplates like this one will allow children to turn Pipsqueak into whatever they can dream up.\nIt's Fully Customizable - Faceplates, Dangles (charms), Screen Inserts, Alert Sounds and Audio Content allow kids to personalize their Pipsqueak and allows Pipsqueak to keep up with children's ever changing tastes. \nAll Pipsqueak backers will get to vote on our first charging cradle design. Will it be a castle, a fishbowl or something cool that one of our backers might suggest? You decide!\nIt's a Soundboard - By loading audio files into the device Pipsqueak takes on the voice of a child's favorite character or plays novelty sounds that compliment whatever theme the child has at that time.  Updating the sounds is easy enough for children to do themselves at YipYap.com. \nDownloading ringtones and sounds is easy and gives kids the ability to customize their Pipsqueak.\nIt\u2019s a CopyCat Voice Recorder \u2013 Kids can record their own \u201cvoice message\u201d on the device. When they play it back everyone will laugh at how CopyCat makes their recording sound differently each time.\nIt\u2019s a Wander Alert \u2013 When Pipsqueak is with your child and connected to a parent\u2019s smartphone, the mobile app will alert the parent if Pipsqueak loses its connection. The range so far has been in excess of 50 feet.\nHelpful at theme parks, malls, crowded areas and...anywhere your own little \"pipsqueak\" might wander off\nManufacturing: This first run of Pipsqueak devices will be manufactured in San Antonio, TX by a shop that has been in the business for 30 years and stands by everything they do.  When we asked them how many units out of 5,000 would be DOA (dead on arrival) they said \u201cZERO\u201d rather matter-of-factly.  So far their work on our prototype rounds has been great.  We visited their factory a couple months back and were thoroughly impressed with the robotic arms on the assembly lines.

From the beginning we told everyone that all money would be put toward the product and associated expenses, nobody has drawn any income from funds we had available to us.\nMore than 30 people are now contributing to make Pipsqueak a reality. We hope moms and dads see Pipsqueak as an inexpensive, fun, durable and SAFE alternative to handing over expensive smart phones to their kids.\nWe hope kids see Pipsqueak as an easy and fun way to connect, play and learn.\nThere is no telling where this journey will lead us but we know we are having so much fun. And we know that we are doing everything with as much Love and Grace as we can. We pray that Yip Yap, and our first product Pipsqueak, will brighten the world in some way by giving more kids the opportunity to connect with Loved ones and explore technology safely.\nWhere is kid #4?\nWell, our little guy Lazarus arrived 33 days earlier than expected, which was just 6 days before our video shoot!

Guys, thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPipsqueak is nearly done. Although we've done as much as we can to minimize any potential risks to completing this project there remains some risk. We have worked closely with our suppliers on component availability and they have assured us that our necessary board components are available in the quantities we anticipate, but that may change depending on how many Pipsqueaks get ordered on this initial run. Our manufacturing partner in San Antonio has been in the business over 30 years though so we feel good about their forecasting and manufacturing capabilities. We also have a backup manufacturer and supplier identified that could help if the demand for Pipsqueak is more than anticipated. The board design, component selection and layout is complete, so no apparent risk there. \n\nOn the mobile phone apps we feel we've allotted ourselves plenty of time to get those complete before the Pispqueaks deliver in May but there is some risk that those may not be fully complete at launch. Although our media design partner sees no reason why we wouldn't get them 100% complete, if for some reason we fall short at delivery the contingency is that we will deliver whatever functionality is completed by then and release additional functionality through follow-up releases at no cost to Pipsqueak users. \n\nIf any firmware changes are required for Pipsqueak after they deliver, not to worry, all Pipsqueaks will be forward compatible through firmware updates on YipYap.com using the included USB cable. So all Pipsqueaks can have the most current firmware regardless of when they were acquired by users. \n\nThere always remain the \"unknowns\" that accompany any first-time project. We may not know what we don't know, if you know what we mean? ;) But there are a lot of people (more than 30) who are highly skilled in their respective areas of expertise and who are passionate about bringing Pipsqueak to the world. So far there hasn't been anything we couldn't figure our way through so be assured that if something unforseen does arise we will be sure to communicate openly and honestly with our backers about what is happening, and we will do whatever is within our means to overcome it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Angela Smith\nFirst created \u00b7 12 backed\nMichael and I have been married 10 years and are blessed with 4 amazing children.

Now you can do other fun things with your friends like playing real-life, multi-player aerial games \u2013 indoors or out. Try doing this with any other palm-sized quadcopter!\nSee us on Fox 9 the Buzz!\nReal-Life Gaming\nEach NanoQ copter is equipped with an infrared (IR) \u201cphoton cannon\u201d and an IR sensor pod. With a pull of the trigger, you unleash a photon burst at your opponent. If you hit their sensor pod you score.\nOur first game will be multi-team dogfighting. You can select your team through the Mimix controller. The LEDs then display your team colors on both the NanoQ and the Mimix.\nThe red team getting shot with IR \"photon cannons\"\nMulti-team Dogfighting Game Play\n1st Hit:  The NanoQ wobbles and the Mimix controller vibrates\n2nd Hit: The NanoQ\u2019s power and performance are reduced\n3rd Hit: The NanoQ floats down and lands for several seconds\nTo Win: Knock all opposing team copters out of the sky!\nFuture Games\nMulti-team dogfighting is just the beginning. We\u2019re developing even more games with ground targets that react with lights and sound when they\u2019re hit. Advanced versions of the ground targets will include a digital radio so any number of targets can communicate together. In addition, proximity detectors can turn the ground targets into reloading stations, capture points, race pylons, and more. We want Kickstarter\u2019s suggestions on what you would like to see for future games.\nTesting the team color selection LED\nMimix \u2013 Intuitive and Engaging\nWe designed Mimix from the ground up to provide an intuitive, exciting experience. No more two-handed flying. Tilt the Mimix controller forward, back, left, or right and the NanoQ copter responds just like you think it should; you feel engaged and in control.\nPhotograph of the latest Mimix controller\nBased on US Air Force Human Factors data for aircraft controls, the Mimix controller has an ergonomic design that was made for your hand, big or small. By using the latest sensors, radios, and processors, Mimix puts you in command with precise, crisp control.\nErgonomically designed to fit your hand\nIn the Kickstarter video, the flying scenes show our 1st-generation Mimix prototype (the 3D printer had orange plastic in it that day). The final scene in the video shows our 2nd-gen Mimix prototype with its sleek ergonomic design that is hot off the 3D printer, sanded and painted (what looks to be a wire coming from the controller is actually a stand \u2013 Mimix is wireless).\nNanoQ \u2013 Better by Design\nWhat good is a controller with nothing to fly?  Our NanoQ copter is the perfect match for the tilt-based Mimix controller.  The NanoQ can move in any direction at any time, not just forward and backwards like some helicopters.\nPhotograph of the latest NanoQ prototype\nTo increase efficiency, we took the traditional quad-rotor design and flipped it upside-down.  This also means the props don\u2019t run into the ceiling and the motors don\u2019t hit the floor.  Using high-speed electronic stabilization, the craft automatically adjusts 400 times per second to quickly react to your commands. Thanks to mass production of 3-axis gyros and accelerometers, we can now bring you an affordable product with this state-of-the-art high-speed electronic stabilization.\nThe NanoQ copter is designed to fly in small indoor areas, but powerful enough to fly outdoors. Due to the rugged, lightweight construction, and only 4 moving parts, the NanoQ is more durable than current helicopter models. A removable \u201csnap on\u201d ring protects the props when flying indoors. The end result \u2013 a design that is both more durable and more fun!\nDisappointed by cheap RC helicopters at the store?\nSo were we!  They either broke or we got bored.  Here's what sets our products apart:\nReal-Life, Multi-player/Multi-team Aerial Gaming!\nRobust Construction - you won\u2019t be afraid to let your friends fly it\nIndependent Props for maneuverability\nHigh-Speed Electronic Stabilization - easy to learn\nNo more AA\u2019s! All batteries are rechargeable\nKeep flying! The NanoQ batteries are swappable\nThe combination of these features gives you hours of fun...\nSingle handed control lets you fly the NanoQ copter right out of your hand\nA Better Flight Experience\nThe NanoQ was designed for easy flight right out of the box. The electronic stabilization system keeps the craft upright automatically. It ships in \u201cBeginner Mode\u201d to limit the craft\u2019s speed and dynamics while you learn. When you\u2019re ready, switch to advanced mode and the NanoQ will really show you what it can do.\nBy using digital radios to fly the NanoQ and IR signals for game play, we can achieve crisp flight control and accurate game response at the same time. This also allows us to simultaneously fly several NanoQs in the same space. This technology, together with team color selection on both the craft and controller, enables true multi-player team gaming.\nFlying the NanoQ copter\nHow it works\nSimply put, the NanoQ copter mimics the motion of the Mimix controller. We make this happen by sampling sensors in the controller that determine its orientation and sending those signals to the craft. The NanoQ copter uses an advanced data fusion algorithm to estimate its attitude compared to the signals from the Mimix controller. Then, the control system in the NanoQ copter sends high-rate adjustments to the four propellers to make the copter mimic your movements. Thrust and yaw are controlled through the top hat on the Mimix controller.\nPhotograph of the latest Mimix controller\nSpecs\nThe NanoQ copter:\nSize \u2013 5.25\u201d motor to motor\nWeight \u2013 35 grams\nBattery \u2013 Replaceable, Rechargeable Lithium Polymer\nBattery Charger \u2013 2 port, USB compatible\nFlight time \u2013 8-10 minutes\nRange \u2013 Up to 30 meters\nMax Payload \u2013 10 gram\nThe Mimix controller:\nErgonomically designed \u2013 for one-handed control\nWorks for right or left handed pilots, big or small\nBattery \u2013 USB Rechargeable Lithium Polymer\nOperating time \u2013 3-4 hours\nHacking the NanoQ\nThe NanoQ uses an open communications protocol. Connect your computer up to the Mimix through the USB port or optional USB RF dongle and you will be able to communicate wirelessly with the NanoQ to:\nTweak the control parameters\nUpdate the NanoQ firmware\nSend control commands directly from a laptop\nSend customized signals out of the IR transmitter\nReceive craft telemetry such as attitude, control commands, and even raw sensor data\nYou can even connect your own electronics payload, like an Arduino, camera, or homebrewed project to the auxiliary serial (UART + power) port on the NanoQ.\nThere will be a developer\u2019s forum on our website where everyone can share in all your achievements. Let everyone see what you can do! \nWho we are\nQFO Labs team looking like we're working\nBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, QFO Labs is a small team of people dedicated to bringing high-tech, innovative new products to market. Our skills include Electrical Engineering, Software Development, Estimation and Control Systems, Material Science, Product Management, and Intellectual Property Management. Our team first met through a New Product Development course at the University of Minnesota in 2007. We have a broad range of experience in areas such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Manufacturing Process Improvement, Medical Device Design, and even running a science museum.\nThis product is just the beginning.  Over time we plan to introduce a series of products for real-life 3D gaming.  Beyond gaming, our team has many more ideas about what to do with the technology behind the Mimix and NanoQ.\nProject Status\nWe\u2019ve been developing and perfecting our remote control quadcopters for more than 5 years. The Mimix controller and NanoQ copter that you see in the video and pictures are real, working prototypes. We are finishing the Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA) and will soon be releasing both Mimix and NanoQ to manufacturing. We have developed relationships with vendors and obtained quotes for production quantities of our electronic components. Currently, we are obtaining quotes for the electronic assembly of the PCBs, the tooling for injection molding and vacuum forming, and the final assembly and packaging of our products. We are planning on final assembly and testing in North America, which will allow us to be closer to and more involved with the process.\nUsing the latest CAD tools ensures fit, form, and function\nWith your support, we can get Mimix and NanoQ off the ground and into your hands, literally. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will let us bring this product to market.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what we will use the $230,000 for:\nProduction Tooling: $60K\nAward Fulfillment/Component Order: $110K\nCertifications for CE, FCC, UL, etc.: $37K\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees: $23K\nOur first scheduled ship date is March of 2013, which is based on our current estimates for manufacturing using the longest lead times for certain components.

The mechanical structures were created using 3D printers, but our products have been designed to be production molded and easily assembled in large quantities. We have perfected the mechanics, electronics, and software over two years of full time development and many, many iterations. All of our components have been selected and sourced (i.e. motors, electronics, batteries, etc.).\n\nTo take advantage of a new component from one of our suppliers, Nordic Semiconductor, we are swapping out the existing radio in our current design. While this increases the risk to our schedule, we think the increased range and decreased latency is well worth the small possibility of some delay. To minimize this risk and ensure that we can pass FCC Certification without issue, we are working closely with the engineers at Nordic Semiconductor. Other than that, all of our electronics and mechanical designs for the copter and controller are complete.\n\nOur friends, families, and investors have carried us so far. We think our working prototypes are pretty impressive. But we need your support to help fund the production tooling, quantity component orders and government certifications that we need to get to full production levels. Without your support this project simply won't happen.\n\nTooling for molds and longest lead time components will be put on order in November; certifications (UL, CE, FCC, etc.) will begin in December; and production should begin in January. We are very confident that we can deliver at least 5000 units per month starting in March. However, to ensure that we don\u2019t exceed our capabilities we have limited the number of units in our initial reward levels.

The first \u2018bot just sort of appeared in one of my sketchbooks, the way a million (mostly bad) ideas do. For whatever silly reason, this idea stuck.\nI like the absurdity of it - Robots who delivers flowers. It\u2019s both personal and impersonal (robotical?) at the same time. I like that, with an exception or two, the robots deliver only one flower at a time. What could be less cost-effective or less efficient than sending a robot around the world to deliver one, single flower? But I\u2019d sure as hell do it to impress a girl.\nSo that\u2019s where it all started...\nWhat is Wrylon Robotical?\nIt\u2019s the company, started by Rhoderick R. Wrylon, that created and dominated the flower delivering robot market. He opened the doors of the first Wrylon Robotical delivery storefront in 1906 and the company thrived until 1913, when it mysteriously shuttered its doors. The \u2018bots disappeared and it vanished from the face of the earth.\nSo what's the catalog all about?\nIt's all that\u2019s left of Wrylon Robotical - an old catalog, some letters and a few newspaper clippings. But it\u2019s not just any copy of the catalog. It\u2019s Rhoderick\u2019s wife\u2019s copy and tucked in between its pages are a few clues to the mysterious disappearance of the \u2018bots. It\u2019s not the full story. It\u2019s just a tease. The catalog won\u2019t tell you where they went - but it might get you interested. If this Kickstarter is successful I\u2019d love to continue telling the story.\nThe 1912 catalog includes ten main 'bots (with schematics), in addition to a few non-delivery models, sketches, adverts and company history. \nIt's full-color, softcover, 5.75\" x 8.25\" and 42 pages long. I'm working with a great, Los Angeles-based printer who does quality work. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED!\nSorry to interrupt, but this feels like the right place to talk about the first Stretch Goal, since it bears directly on the catalog.\nAt $8,250, 150% funded, all books will get belly-banded. \nYou may be wondering if that's legal. Don't worry. I've gotten signed forms of consent. But I digress...\nThe copy of the catalog you're getting has the 'bots and all that, but it also has a few goodies stuck inside - canceled delivery receipts, some newspaper clippings, bits and bobs, bonus content. It's stuff that's cool and that you don't want falling out and getting lost. \nSo, at $8,250, I'll be wrapping each book with a custom made bellyband that will both make the books look that much more special and help keep everything in one place. \nI'm actually really excited about this and it will be as much a part of the world of Wrylon as the rest of the book (meaning I'm going to make it look cool). It's a nice little perk that most everybody gets to be a part of.\nBack to the story...\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do the 'bots look like?\nI'm still polishing the paintings, schematics and page layouts but here's a look at some of the 1912 model year delivery options:\nAnnouncing Two More Stretch Goals!\nI'm thrilled and exited about how well we've done so far and I'd like to announce two new stretch goals, with a third still in the works (if warranted). \nAt $11,000, which is 200% funded, I'd like to give everyone stickers! I love stickers, perhaps more than a grown man should, and I'm exited to be able to make them available to everyone. \nSome of you have ordered stickers, via the $5 additional pledge, or only pledged for stickers. If that's the case, then you're getting more, an additional pack of five. If you've added $5 for one set and don't want two sets, you're welcome to adjust your pledge to get only the one set (assuming we make this goal). \nThese are nice, diecut, white vinyl stickers, ranging in size between 4\"x2\" and 3\"x5\" and will look great wherever you plaster them. \nAt $13,750, which is 250% funded, everyone who pledges $5 and over gets Official Wrylon Robotical Engineering Dept. patches! \nSomeone's got to keep all these 'bots running, with all the miles they log and Wrylon's engineers were the best in the business, hands-down. You can show your support for these largely unsung men & women by sporting an official patch. They're embroidered, sew-on, fabric patches, roughly 4\"x3\" and will look great. \nThe art shown is WIP but it gives you an idea of where they're going. \nI hope you all are excited about these rewards as I am and thank you all, so much, for the continued support. \nWhat are the backing levels?\n(Additional info on the $150 tier: You get to commission the 'bot. I think we can go two rounds of back-and-forth with sketches to get something you're stoked on - or you can give me a rough idea, \"tank treads and a cherry blossom\", and trust me. Either is totally great. I'm putting two rounds of sketch development out there as a rough guideline, basically to say we would need to nail down a design before too long :)\nThe sketches at that point will be pencil, ink, watercolor, maybe some markers too, whatever works to get a shape & design you like. You'll get all of them. They'll be on different papers, in different sizes and it wouldn't be surprising if the final 'bot ended up being an amalgamation of several sketches, instead of just one.\nThen I'll start painting in Photoshop. I'll paint it at roughly 16\"x20\", 300dpi and print it out on archival paper at any size you like, up to 16\"x20\". I've printed 'bots at various sizes and, for me, I like them a bit smaller. I think the sweet spot for these guys is around 9\"x12\" but it's your call (up to 16\"x20\").\nI'll ship you the finished print and all the sketches, rolled in a poster tube.\nLastly, I'm going to try an experiment with these. I'm going to try to record the Photoshop painting sessions and make a time-lapse video of the entire process. If - and I repeat, if - this works, I'll send you a high-res movie file of the painting being created. I know several other artists who've done this and I really dig the videos. The reason I'm calling it an experiment is because I've never done it before and because I'll be working on a pretty big file and there's a chance that the software will slow my machine down too much for me to paint efficiently. So, consider this last part to be a bonus, not a guarantee!\nThis will NOT deliver by Christmas. I'm giving it an expected delivery date of January, 2013 because I'll be doing these after I do all the other sketches and ship out every book. I'd love to say I can complete this sooner - and maybe I can - but I'd prefer to be conservative with the delivery date.)\nAdd-On Pledges\nWant more? Easy. Just add a few bucks to any pledge and include a message or email me & additional loot is yours!\nSo, what\u2019s the money for?\nPrinting. The books are 90% done & I\u2019m planning to send them to press in the first or second week of October.\nI\u2019m printing locally, a Los Angeles-based printer who will help make this book look the best it possibly can. Working domestically isn\u2019t cheap though. My actual cost per book, even before shipping them to you, is around $24. That\u2019s a lot & It\u2019s more than I\u2019m selling them for, but it\u2019s important to me to work locally, with people in my community and not go overseas just because it\u2019s cheaper.\nWhy am I taking a loss on each book? Because I want to sell them. I want to get these books into your hands. I want you to dig them. I want as many people as possible to check them out. I\u2019d rather sell more books and take a loss - and hopefully make a few fans - than charge too much trying to make a profit - and not sell any. I dig this book. I think you will too.\nWhen will you get the books?\nIf the books go to the printer in the first or second week of October, I should have them back by the first week of November. I\u2019ll start the sketches while the books are printing. Once I have the books I plan to pack them up & ship them right away. Throw in some wiggle room for unforeseen problems and you should get your book by early December (fingers-crossed for sooner).  \nKicking it forward!\nI'm happy to add this project to the Kicking It Forward project, in which creators pledge to spend at least 5% of their profit backing other Kickstarter projects that interest them.\nFrankly, even with the success of this project, I'm expecting to barely break even. Nevertheless, I love the Kickstarter community and hope to be a part of it, both as creator and backer, for quite some time. \nCheck out the Kicking It Forward project here.\nVery, very partial credits.\nA lot of people have helped so far and will be thanked once the book is done, but specifically for the Kickstarter video, I'd like to thank Rich Ramazinski for creative notes, Harris Cohen for the voice over and the music is \"caf\u00e9 connection\" by morgantj, licensed under a Attribution (3.0) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly, the greatest challenge has been getting the book this far. When you pledge, you're pledging for a book that's practically finished, not one I'm hoping to make. I could send it to the printer today, but I'm taking a little extra time, as the Kickstarter rolls along, to make it better and to see how many people are interested in a catalog for a fictional robotic flower delivery company. \n\nThe next biggest challenge will be fulfillment. Once this book is (hopefully) funded, I'm no longer working for me. I'll be working for you - and I'm going to take that very seriously. \n\nI want to get you your books as soon as physically possible. I'm committed to burning the midnight oil to get them packaged and shipped out as soon as I get them, so that you get what you've so generously paid for.\n\nThank you so much.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Hello Old Friends!", "update_content": "Adventure!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Not 'Bots, but Squirrels", "update_content": "Hi gang,\nI don't have a 'bot update today.

This incredible instrument, this miraculous mechanism, produces free art fantastically for just a dollar a unit!  But we need your help to kickstart the Free Art Machine and keep it running...\nThe Free Art Machine is a project envisioned by two Chicago artists and their arts initiative, Chicago The Beautiful. The goal of the project is to produce thousands of pieces of free art made with public submissions, for distribution in various creative ways. The project will support local Chicago artists while simultaneously cultivating art appreciation.\nWhy?\nThe most exciting part of the Free Art Machine is how it self-amplifies.  Once it starts running, all donations are fed back into the machine and converted into free art.  This art will draw more viewers and artists to contribute, producing more and more art.\nArtists can reach art-lovers via the Free Art Machine.  When the art-lover finds a piece that speaks to them, they can pull it off the wall and keep it. The artist's information will be on the back of the block, putting the art consumer in direct contact with their new favorite artist. They will then have the opportunity to view and purchase more work from that artist.\nSo the machine functions as a forum for artists and art appreciators, as well as a catalyst which stimulates third-party exchanges of art beyond The Free Art Machine's initial function.\nThe Art\nThe photo block is our first design for free art. It is a 3.5\" x 3.5\" x .75\" block of wood with a photo securely adhered to the front. On the back will be the edition number, artist's initials and a drilled hole for hanging (thumbtack size). Every image will be made in limited quantities to ensure uniqueness. We are looking upon the abundant talent in this city to flood our inbox with great art. We have open submissions for the free art machine, so send the images you think would make great free art.\nSend your images via our easy to use UPLOADER\nor Email us at info@chicagothebeautiful.com\nDistribution\nChicago The Beautiful will be working with cafes, restaurants, and other venues to display walls of free art. We will install and stock the location with free art. Depending on the venue we will decide on the size of the wall, and how many blocks to supply.\nTo start, six locations around Chicago will be selected to host a free art wall. For example, one of these will be the Jupiter Outpost Cafe in Chicago's West loop. We will spread out the locations to make sure we cover Chicago. If you are in charge of a space in Chicago make sure to contact us to host an art wall.\nEach free art wall includes a donation box, the money collected will be used to produce more art and keep the free art machine alive.\nStudio 914 and Chicago the Beautiful will be hosting many free art events at the CTB workshop/gallery space in West Town, Chicago. The nights will feature original Chicago art, free food, live music, and free art.\n We are looking to you to come to us with your space, ideas and visions for ways that free art can be distributed and appreciated.\nOur Philosophy\nWe believe art is free. Art is everywhere, and like nature, its beauty is both timeless and personal. The act of discernment and appreciation is the starting point for finding this True beauty. Our aim is to inspire these acts of awareness in everyone for their better understanding of the inherent beauty all around us.\nCost Breakdown\nAll pledges are divided 50/50 between free art and the production of rewards.\n- 50% toward production of free art pieces: At $1 per unit, $100 will produce 100 pieces of free art. If we meet our kickstarter goal, the Free Art Machine will produce 4000 pieces of free art for distribution in cafes, art galleries, and at unique events. As an example, if we receive $50,000, the Free Art Machine will produce 25,000 pieces of free art.\n- 50% toward production of rewards: The funds received for production of the rewards includes minimal labor costs, ensuring that even with a massive number of orders our hand-made products will be delivered on time. Local Chicago artists and artisans can quickly be employed to help with the timely production of your rewards.\nRewards\nYa gotta work with what ya got. This what we do, and we are offering it to you in the name of free art.\nThe rewards will be hand-crafted products and services produced by the two artists who first envisioned the project, plus free art produced by the Free Art Machine.  Rewards include photo mounting / resin coating services.\nResin Framing Service - Resin frames are high quality photo prints on handmade wooden frames coated in a two-part epoxy polymer resin.  This seals the print and protects it from the damaging effects of water and UV rays.\n-Our printing is done on a Lambda printer using Kodak Endura paper at 400dpi.\nFor more information visit:\nwww.chicagothebeautiful.com\nwww.914california.com\nPlease contact us, we'd love to hear from you,\nLeo and Max\ninfo@chicagothebeautiful.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge posed to the project will be staying on schedule if we are flooded with orders and contributions. Suppose we receive $80,000 from Kickstarter, we would be faced with the obstacle of how to produce 40,000 pieces of free art, in addition to the $40,000 worth of resin coating services. Doing all that in a timely manner will require an expansion and rearrangement of our operation, but we are prepared. Local artists and artisans from our community can step in quickly to fill the work force gap. Free art pieces can be contracted to talented artists around the country, and the resin service can be performed by novice artisans under our supervision in our Chicago workshop. We've done the math and we're ready.\n\nThe second challenge will be finding adequate venues for distribution. In our experience this will be a lesser issue. Many cafes throughout Chicago are happy to host individual artists on their walls, let alone host a wall of free art without any loss to their business. The free art walls have a magical attractive power that most any retail business owner can see the value in.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "These Photo Blocks are Available for Sale!", "update_content": "It was a long time ago the Free Art Machine was born.
