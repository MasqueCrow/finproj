[{"backer": "Chad Schumacher", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Torshn Puzzle is a surprisingly difficult challenge and an alluring addition to your desk, shelf, or coffee table.\nThe objective is simple\u2013 align the colors to each other by sliding the marbles and twisting the halves. Solving the puzzle may initially seem straightforward, but you\u2019ll quickly find that it\u2019s trickier than it looks! \nThe dichotomy between simplicity and complexity is what makes the Torshn Puzzle a special puzzle for people of all ages and backgrounds. While an 11-year-old may not have a fully developed brain, she does not have the hindering ego of a 30-year-old college grad. While the working adult may have the spatial awareness and problem solving skills to manipulate the puzzle more efficiently, they may not have the patience and perseverance of a retired grandma with time to kill. Everyone that has picked up the Torshn Puzzle thus far has had a completely different approach to solving it and unique challenges specific to their personality and skillset. \nLike the Rubik\u2019s cube and the original orb puzzle, the Torshn Puzzle is complex enough to be fun after multiple solves. However, it is simple enough that it is approachable. You don't need to discover or memorize a bunch of fancy algorithms to solve the Torshn Puzzle, but it sure does help if you do.\nIn a world that increasingly fills your mind with clutter, it\u2019s important to take a step back and focus your energy into a single objective. The Torshn puzzle is a simple challenge yet requires your undivided attention. We\u2019ve found that playing with the Torshn Puzzle allows us to reduce stress and increase our productivity in other aspects of life. It stimulates, yet eases our minds simultaneously.\nThe origins of puzzles go back as far as 2300 BC when Ancient Greeks and Egyptians developed and solved labyrinths. Since then, puzzles have grown and evolved into countless shapes and forms. However, the physical and mental benefits of puzzle solving remain all the same.\nPuzzles exercise the left and right sides of the brain simultaneously. They\u2019re a mental workout that improves problem-solving skills and attention span. Doing puzzles reinforces connections between brain cells, improves mental speed, and is an especially effective way to improve short-term memory.  It\u2019s no surprise that Bill Gates is an avid puzzler!\nBeing a three-dimensional challenge, the Torshn puzzle promotes the development of a wider perception to the process of problem solving. It requires spatial awareness and memory, as not all of the spheres are visible simultaneously. Playing with the puzzle develops finger-eye coordination and requires dexterity to reposition the spheres efficiently. Perhaps most important of all, patience and perseverance are also necessary because it's trickier than it looks!\n\nThere are more than seven hundred thousand different possible ways for the colors to be arranged, and only 6 different combinations that leave the puzzle solved.\n\nThis journey began as a design exploration of the sphericon but quickly became a consuming pursuit to make the greatest puzzle that we could. We wanted to create a unique, forever lasting, and beautiful puzzle that anybody could enjoy and play with.\nWe know that design must embody purpose\u2013 that every aspect of a design must consciously add to its whole. We wanted to make something breathtaking but also ergonomic and simple.\n\nWe combined form and function to achieve these three goals:\nA design that could easily fit into a museum\nA challenge not too difficult for anyone, but tricky enough to be interesting and replayable\nA puzzle built with exceptional quality and in a way that would last forever.\n  We drew inspiration from a puzzle we grew up playing with\u2013 the Orb Puzzle invented by Christopher C. Wiggs and Christopher J. Taylor in 1981.\nAfter months of design, brainstorming, and prototyping, we landed on utilizing the continuous face of a sphericon as cavities for spheres to move along. This allows for extremely smooth and simple movement of the pieces, something that the Orb Puzzle lacked.\nThe dimensions of the Torshn Puzzle was a challenge to perfect. Larger cavities and spheres made the puzzle easier to work with, but created less visually harmonious proportions. Smaller cavities and more spheres were prettier and closer resembled the original Orb Puzzle, but resulted in a puzzle that was more difficult to solve and difficult to manipulate smoothly.\n\nWe played with and tested over 50 iterations of the puzzle. With each puzzle, we fine tuned every curve, track, and divet by as little as a quarter of a millimeter to a develop a puzzle that is as sturdy as a rock, pretty to look at, and graceful to handle.\nLongevity is extremely important to us. We despise how unsustainable plastic is. We wanted to create something that would last forever\u2013 something that will be passed on for generations to come and won\u2019t end up in a landfill somewhere. We wanted something that had little chance of breaking and would be repairable if it did. So we knew the final product would be constructed from a sustainable metal body.\n\nWhen we made our first metal prototype, we were blown away. It became a sculpture that you can play with. Steel was too heavy and titanium was too expensive. We decided on anodized aluminum\u2013 sturdy yet lightweight.\nIt\u2019s not cheap to mill from a solid chunk of metal, but after considering countless different manufacturing methods, it\u2019s the only way to make the best Torshn Puzzle that we can. Metal construction allows us to achieve the strict tolerances required for the puzzle to spin smoothly while being everlasting. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that aluminum is the most abundant metal on the planet and 100% recyclable! +1 for sustainability.\nIt took us a while to perfect the finish\u2013 we wanted something that was smooth to the touch and beautiful to look at under all lights. We tried brushed, coated, polished, but ultimately landed on anodized and finely sandblasted. We think that the result is breathtaking.\n\nWe\u2019re a team of tinkerers and makers with over 15 years of combined experience in industrial design and contract manufacturing. We share a passion for puzzles of all kinds, and want to share our personal creations with the world. Torshn Design is the product of us being tired of working on projects that we lacked autonomy over. Our goal is to create puzzles that are unique, mind-tickling, and forever-lasting. We\u2019re a small team located in Oakland, California, and we\u2019re excited to embark on this journey with you! \nWhy support our campaign?\nYou or someone you know loves puzzles\n  You like conversation starters and desk art\n  You need a stress-relieving escape from everyday life\n  You have a child and you know that puzzles are one of the greatest tools for their development\n  You want to keep your brain sharp and prevent early onset of diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia\n  You\u2019re fascinated by rare mathematical shapes\n   You want to support designers who are truly passionate about the product they build\n  You hate unsustainable products made by conglomerates and want to put your money where your mouth is by helping small creators bring their ideas to life (ok that was a little bit specific...)\n  The design is finished, the manufacturing process is solidified, and we\u2019re so excited to share the Torshn Puzzle with the world. We need your help to make our first production run and bring it to life.\nBelow is a table that represents what our estimated shipping costs are for the Torshn Puzzle. Your pledge does not include shipping and you will pay for shipping AFTER the campaign ends. We are handling shipping this way to get backers the lowest possible shipping price. We don't want to unnecessarily over-charge for shipping. These are estimated costs based on an average range of shipping quotes we've attained from different carriers and may change depending on our final results. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers (shipping directly from our studio) but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers (more fulfillment centers). Please keep in mind that the Torshn Puzzle is heavy and that the shipping costs reflect its weight.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be sending you a BackerKit.com survey which will securely process your color choice, address, and shipping payment which will hopefully be lower than quoted below.\nWe plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so that everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate. Our goal is to make this process as transparent and accurate as possible, without any false promises or unexpected changes.\n\n\nbraag - A boutique pre-launch to post-launch marketing agency leveraging data-driven customer acquisition to fuel record-breaking Kickstarters.\nCharge your backers less while ensuring success.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction\nOur manufacturing process is set in stone, and we\u2019ve partnered up with an extremely experienced factory to bring each Torshn Puzzle to life. They\u2019ve brought great expertise to the table and have been a pleasure to work with. However, in our years of experience in manufacturing and bringing designs to mass production, we\u2019ve learned that seldom does a project go from start to finish without behind-the-scenes roadblocks. We have the experience to deal with that. We\u2019ve mapped out every scenario we can think of to avoid any surprises. However, if anything unexpected does arise, we promise to be 100% transparent with our backers\u2013 communication is of utmost importance to us. We believe that great communication builds great relationships and therefore great trust. We look forward to embarking on this journey together!\n\nShipping & Logistics\nAlong with rising shipping costs in the last decade, the pandemic has only made logistics more expensive. Especially with the weight of the Torshn Puzzle, we have been quoted higher shipping costs than we would have seen before. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers. We want everyone around the world to be able to enjoy the puzzle. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nFrom the very beginning, we set out to make a puzzle that would last virtually forever\u2013 an heirloom that can be passed on from generation to generation.\n\nMechanism:\nWe designed the Torshn Puzzle to be as simple as possible to avoid any complications over time. The cavities through which the marbles move are milled from a solid chunk of aluminum. The precision and smoothness of the cavities prevent the marbles from getting worn down, and the sturdiness of the cavities themselves mean that they won't get eroded by glass marbles either. The spinning mechanism of the Torshn Puzzle is made possible by rare earth neodymium magnets, which are permanent magnets and only lose a fraction of their performance every 100 years. \n\n\nMaterial:\nWe chose Anodized aluminum because it is extremely sturdy and will not degrade over time. It is more durable, wear resistant, and more life-proof than any wood or plastic alternative.\nReusability and recyclability\nAluminum is the only metal that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process.\n\nAlthough our packaging isn't set in stone, we plan to use either cork, hemp, or recycled paper to keep the Torshn Puzzle safe in transit rather than bubblewrap or packing peanuts. Plastic sucks.\n\nWe also designed the Torshn Puzzle to be easily repairable if anything ever goes wrong. The marbles, magnets, and rotational axis are all easily replaceable if broken or lost.\nSustainable materials\nAs we've stated before, aluminum is lightweight, strong, and highly recyclable. It is one of the only materials out there that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio.", "creator_bio": "Torshn Design\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nWe\u2019re a team of tinkerers and makers with over 15 years of combined experience in industrial design and contract manufacturing.

With Amazon Prime, it's free shipping. As a backer, I paid $49 for the game & shipping. Essentially, I've overpaid for this game by $19.

I had no idea that it was only by a few days. While I'm sure I will enjoy the game, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth for the backing of your future games. If I can just wait a few days to get it on Amazon & save $19, then why would I be a backer? After all, $19 is worth another game I could buy.

It's totally different from anything else on the market and is perfect to help any cyclist get from A to B quickly and easily.   \n The Problem \nWe love to explore on our bikes and using a phone makes it quicker and easier than ever. But constantly checking directions in traffic is hassle and can be dangerous.  \nWe've always loved the idea of a phone holder, but hated the way they look and work. We created Loop out of frustration with the existing solutions on the market - they're ugly, clunky to use or need accessories or phone cases just to work.   \nThe Solution\nWe created Loop from the ground up to be right for cycling. That means holding any size phone securely without ruining the look of your bike. We knew it needed to be quick and easy to use and that it shouldn't need any accessories to work.    We wanted to create something robust and beautifully engineered so started with an all-metal construction.  \nWe've made Loop work with all major phones (including an iPhone 11 Pro Max) and all handlebars sizes (22.2mm to 31.8mm - that's 7/8\" to 1 1/4\"). It will fit a lot of stems as well if they are close to round. Most importantly it's designed to look and feel like it's part of your bike.\nIt's completely different from anything on the market - we've protected the design with a worldwide patent pending and extra protection in China (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e13\u5229\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d) with Jiaquan IP.\nSo what makes Loop different from everything else on the market?\n1. Engineered to hold your phone securely\nLoop has been engineered to be secure enough on the bumpiest roads. We've designed it for strength from the start - incorporating industrial springs which clamp your phone in place. \nDespite its strength - we wouldn't recommend it for off-road or extreme riding.\n2. Quick and easy to use \nWe wanted to make using Loop as quick and easy as jumping on your bike. So the interaction takes seconds - and requires absolutely no accessories.  \n3. Looks and feels like part of your bike\nLoop is inspired by your handlebars - low profile and discreet. It's designed to look and feel like it's part of your bike, whatever type of cyclist you are.      \n4. Built to last\nLoop made from CNC technology and it's all-metal construction is built to last.   \n5. Made for every bike & every phone\nLoop is designed to fit small to large phones, every type of bike, and all major sizes of handlebars.      \nHow we got here\n Sketching & Ideation\n CAD & Engineering \nDevelopment & Prototyping\nTesting \nNext Steps\nLoop mount is fully designed, engineered and prototyped. We are looking for your support through kickstarter to help us pay for tooling, complete final testing and certification and produce the first batch of products.   \nRewards \n Specs \nColours\nLoop comes in Black and Silver.  \nWhats in the box\n1 x Loop Mount\nSmall shim \nMedium shim \nLarge shim\nAllen Key\nPhone Sizes\nLoop opens up to 80mm / 3.15\" - that is enough for large smart phone in a case. \nHandlebar Sizes \nLoop is designed to work on all major handlebar sizes (22.2mm to 31.8mm - that's 7/8\" to 1 1/4\"). It can also be mounted on your stem if it's tubular (or approximately circular).  \nCollaborators\nWe're working with some great collaborators to help bring you this project...\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nMore than $30,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this venture is new, our team has delivered dozens of Kickstarter projects worth millions of dollars. \n\nThis project is relatively low risk - largely because there aren't any electronics. The design is also very advanced - we've fully design and engineered Loop and are looking for support to move onto to mass production. \n\nHaving said that, no kickstarter is without risk and we have done what we can to mitigate these. \n\n1. Supply chain. We're working with trusted manufacturing partners - with whom we have relationships stretch back 7 years and with whom we have created 10+ hardware projects in the past. \n\n2. Certification & Testing. \nWe have completed extensive testing of Loop. Having completed tooling we will need to complete certification testing to sell the product formally. This is something we have already planned extensively to help mitigate any delays to the project. The fact there are no electronics really help with this process. \n \n3. IP infringement\nWe have a patent pending on the design and in addition have taken out extra Ip protection in China. This includes engaging a highly respected Chinese IP firm who specialise in protecting IP on a project like this.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Single pack", "descp": "Grab yourself a Loop Mount at the discounted Kickstarter price.

The signature piece is the ice cream truck of which there are 4 and they will be made in 4 different colors. There are 6 tons of 4 different flavors of ice cream that fit perfectly in the back of your truck that you buy and sell with stacks of $500, $100 and $50 bills. \nYou roll the die to drive your truck around the board and the inventory cards tell you the market rates for each ice cream flavor. Each player builds ice cream shops with flags across the country and the first player to build 8 stores and has $3,000 cash wins. The beauty of ICE CREAM EMPIRE is that on a certain level everyone wins as they're building their ice empire. It's not a zero sum game where you whip out your opponents, it's just a race to see who can build their business into a success most quickly!\nIce Cream Empire Before a Game Night!\nGet the game and remember it makes an amazing gift so get as many copies as you can! When you back ICE CREAM EMPIRE it makes us happy to know more people will enjoy this game and it provides the funds to be able to manufacture the minimum run of games including the expensive injection molds for the trucks.\nYou can get many multiples of ICE CREAM EMPIRE with more of a discount per game the more games you get. In the higher reward levels you can actually include yourself or a family member in the design of the game whether it is your face on the money, your kids face on the cover of the game or your brand name on the ice cream trucks!\nBottomline if there is a reward level that you would want just send us a message and we'll try to work with you for the perfect package for you. We'll also be using BackerKit where you can add on additional rewards. If you just want to support the project you are always welcome to make a contribution. With Kickstarter we have to reach our goal of $30,000 by May 31st for anyone's credit card to be charged and it is all or nothing so with your help we'll make this happen so we can create this game for you!\nYou can also have dinner with Colby and Lars in Los Angeles (for those who live or are traveling through LA). We'll cover dinner at one of Colby's amazing restaurants in Santa Monica followed by ice cream for dessert from Sweet Rose Creamery and we'll play the game with you and give you a copy. At the end of the day it is all about the game and we can't wait to get ICE CREAM EMPIRE out to the world!\nSelect a Sweet Rose Creamery Private Party in three Los Angeles Locations!\nIntroducing the Creators: Colby Goff and Lars Thorn\nICE CREAM EMPIRE was inspired by the Saturday morning kitchen tours at our ice cream company, Sweet Rose Creamery, located in Santa Monica, CA. Each Saturday morning we offer public tours of our ice cream kitchen where we walk kids and their families through the process of making cold desserts including ice cream, gelato, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt. Kids and families love these tours. They react with tremendous excitement to the ice cream, the ice cream delivery truck, the production process and the discussion about where we build ice cream stores. In addition, they asked thoughtful questions about ingredients and ice cream economics, all of which inspired the premise for Ice Cream Empire.\nIce Cream Empire was designed to demonstrate the basic tenets of the ice cream business. It\u2019s a simplified metaphor of the business but teaches the principles of supply and demand, investing in ingredients in order to sell the final product with a positive margin, and ultimately driving business growth by building new distribution channels in the form of new retail stores. Put simply, players buy inventory, sell inventory at market rates which fluctuate based on flavor crazes, and then use the proceeds from sales to expand their empire by building new stores. Along the way players run into common business hurdles and competition and must navigate these obstacles. Throughout the game, players leverage their knowledge of simple applied math and US geography along with varying strategies to be the first to build an empire of 8 stores. The game is designed to be played in about an hour with 2 to 4 players and is designed such that all players will experience success in building an empire of ice cream stores, although the winner is simply the one to build their 8 stores first.\nThe game is not a zero sum game. Many classic board games have a single winner once all other players lose completely. Ice Cream Empire is designed such that all players build an empire and will experience success, the winner simply accomplishes success the most quickly.\nColby and Lars met through their mutual friend Mark Leibowitz who Colby had gone to Stanford with and Lars became great friends with on the Obama Campaign. The two game nerds immediately hit it off and Lars new this game was a winner and offered to help launch it and share it with the world. Together Colby and Lars have launched EMPIRE Games and already have a list of new games that they are excited to create and get out to you! \nLars's Fiancee Julia Who Has Gotten So Good at the game that She's Now Called the Ice Cream Empress!\nThe Ice Cream Trucks Are The Most Popular Piece And Hold Your Ice Cream Inventory!\nPlease Enjoy Our ICE CREAM EMPIRE Jingle \nWritten and Performed by Lars Thorn:\nIce Cream Empire!

As well as Brew Ha Ha! in 2016. Both games have become so popular that they have been selected as Amazon's Choice for wine game and beer game respectively. \n\nI have every expectation that Ice Cream Empire will also be a success with kids, families and gamers across the country and around the world. It is of course a lot of work to create a game but we're building off of our past success and going 3-for-3 on Kickstarter and have the all-star team in place to bring this game to you.\n\nWe have play tested Ice Cream Empire for two years to make the game as fun and infinitely playable as possible. Manufacturing overseas as well as the shipping always has unexpected delays so we are conservatively expecting to have the games in your hands by October and available on Amazon well before the holidays!\n\nAs with any bootstrapped projected it's all hands on deck including my Mom who will do a beautiful box cover illustration similar to the sample in the video and pictures but personalized for this project.

Choose the Thinking Egg/s you can relate to most based on their specific metaphysical qualities.\nThe One, The Duo, The Nest , The 1/2 Dozen or the or The Dozen... the choice is all yours. You'll be able to select which Thinking Egg/s you'd like to receive when we send out a quick survey at the end of the campaign.\n  This isn't our first rodeo.

In a world inundated with information and stimuli, we aim to harmoniously intertwine form and function, making designs and systems that provide for the space to be present and aware in our daily lives. We're really excited to share The Thinking Egg with the Kickstarter community and to create a community of our own composed of individuals that desire to slow things down, be more mindful, present and overall more aware in our day-to-day. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox Partner Program which includes risk free Facebook ads and press coverage.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re extremely passionate about the Thinking Egg and committed to doing everything in our power to solve any challenges that may arise along the way \u2013 that\u2019s a promise!\n\nWe have to make sure everything goes according to plan to meet our promised deadlines.

If we reach that amount, new artwork will be created for a Dragon coin.  This was a result of a vote by the backers in the comment section.  A Valkyrie and a female Rogue were tied for second.\nThe Dragon coin will be an additional coin that backers can choose from.\nIn addition, some backers asked if a stand was available as an add on.  The below stand is available for $1 each.  Just add $1 to your pledge for each stand that you want.  The stand comes in two pieces and you insert them together like an X.  It is the best stand I have come across.\nThis is our third Dice Coins project.  Our first two were delivered ahead of schedule and had great reviews. \nHowever, we are doing something different on this one.  Instead of using printed artwork on the coins, the character artwork is being molded into the coin so it has amazing 3D dimensional depth.  In addition, we are only creating d20 coins for this project.\nDwarf. This is a 3D character that can be chosen for a d20 Dice Coin.\n  Minotaur. This is a 3D character that can be chosen for a d20 Dice Coin.\n  Female Elf. This is a character that can be chosen for a d20 Dice Coin. This artwork will be molded into a 3D image.\n  Dice Coins are a different take on dice. They work just as well as regular gaming dice but allow amazing artwork to be displayed on each one. They can also be used as rotatable stat counters and game markers. \nDesigned to military challenge coin standards. \nCoins are made from a solid zinc alloy metal. \nEach coin weighs almost 2 ounces. \nCoins are 2 inches (50.8 mm) in diameter. \n   A Dice Coin d20 template. This was created without any 3D characters. Each coin will feature a different character in the center part of the coin. See above characters.\n  The common side of the coin has a knob molded into the metal. Players use one or two hands to spin the coin like a top. Once the coin is spinning at full speed (which just takes a second), the player puts their finger at the bottom of the coin and stops it. The result is the first completely visible number to the left of the player's finger.  The project video shows them in action.  Listed at the end of project page is more info on how they compare to regular dice.\nCommon side of a Dice Coin. The spinning knob is in the center of the coin. Coins are 2 inches in diameter. They are much larger and thicker than a US quarter.\n    We are creating three separate characters as shown above.  Each character will be in the center of a d20 Dice Coin. \nDwarf - plated in antique gold metal.\nMinotaur - plated in antique copper metal.\nFemale Elf - plated in antique silver metal. \nYou can select whatever character you want. You could get one of each, three Dwarves, etc. A survey will be sent out at the end of the project to make your selection. You do NOT need to choose now.\nHere is an example from our previous project.  The method used on this coin involved printing on metal and covering the image with an epoxy coating.  With the 3D Dice Coins, an epoxy coating is not needed since the image is molded into the coin.\n  Dice have been around forever and they work really well. However, Dice Coins do have some advantages over traditional dice.  \nAppearance, Weight, and Uniqueness  \nThe appearance of regular dice are generally limited to color, material, and size choices. A limited amount of artwork can be put on them but this often makes it difficult to see the numbers or symbols. Dice Coins have a large area that allows elaborate artwork to be displayed. Players can choose coins that have artwork that fits the theme of their game or their personal style. When you pick them up, they have substantial weight since they are made of solid brass. \nDice Coins just look and feel cool. They are unique and each design is truly a work of art.  \nAccuracy  \nDice are rolled and land on a number. Imperfections in the design, manufacturing, or composition of dice can result in statistical inaccuracies. Multi face dice are harder to manufacture so they are more prone to this.\nThis is NOT a factor with Dice Coins. A player manually stops the coin from spinning. Any manufacturing imperfections that would manifest themselves if the coins were allowed to stop spinning and come to rest on their own, do not happen since the player stops the coin before this occurs.  \nIn addition, players can't manipulate the coins like some players do with dice. When a Dice Coin is spinning at full speed (which just takes a second), the numbers are totally blurred and you can't anticipate the results of the spin. \nWe were unaware, but one of our backers, Matthew J. Neagley, is a research/writer for Gnome Stew The Gaming Blog. He did an independent analysis of the accuracy of the Dice Coins. The results were very good to exceptional. Click here for the article link.  \nStat Counters, Markers, or a Nice Paperweight \nDice Coins can be used as rotatable stat counters by using the bottom number on the coin. You just rotate the coin until the desired number is at the bottom. We staggered the placement of sequential numbers to eliminate any confusion on what number was being displayed in case a coin is moved slightly. \nDice Coins can also be used as game markers. You can even use them as a nice paperweight that is sure to be an attention grabber.\nSpinning Surface and Amount of Space Needed \nDice Coins spin on everything you would roll a dice on. Tables, play mats, notebooks, etc. Just like dice, you would not use them on carpet. And again--just like dice--they make more noise if spun on a hard surface like glass. A table cloth, piece of paper, etc. eliminates the noise and they spin just fine. They excel on gaming play mats. \nDice can bounce into another player's area or off the table. A VERY bad spin with a Dice Coin can do the same. However, Dice Coins are easier to control than dice, require a little less space to use, and they stay in the same area where they are spun. \nDisadvantages \nDice Coins are more expensive than plastic poly dice. However, Dice Coins are actually cheaper than most specialty dice made of metal. Dice Coins are easier to make. \nYou generally only want to spin one Dice Coin at a time. This is why we are focusing on a d20.  However, you can roll several regular dice at once. This is an advantage that regular dice have over Dice Coins. However, you can rapidly spin a Dice Coin several times in a row and add the results. See the project video. \nDice Coins are not aerodynamic tops.

Others, however, may be delivered in advance, since they do not depend on the completion of the short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + vimeo premiere + original Soundtrack (digital version).\nGracias!\nAgradecimiento en redes + premiere en vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Alebrijes from the backstage", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + vimeo premiere + original soundtrack (digital version) + a shooting day with us (applies only for people who are in Bogot\u00e1,Colombia).\nVive de cerca Alebrijes\nAgradecimiento en redes + premiere en vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora + Vive un d\u00eda de rodaje con nosotros.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Alebrijes t-shirt", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + vimeo premiere + original soundtrack (digital version) + Alebrijes t-shirt\nV\u00edstete de Alebrijes\nAgradecimiento en redes + premiere en vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora + Camiseta de alebrijes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (44 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "Alebrijes Storyboard", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + vimeo premiere + original soundtrack (digital version) + Original Printed Storyboard\nLl\u00e9vate la historia de Alebrijes\nAgradecimiento en redes + premiere en vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora + Storyboard Impreso", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (28 left of 30)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Printed Concept Art", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + Vimeo premiere + Original Soundtrack (digital version) + 2 Original Printed Concept Art Pieces\nConcept Art Impresos\nAgradecimiento en redes + premiere en Vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora + 2 piezas de Concept Art impresas", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3200 or more", "title": "Original puppets", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + Vimeo Premiere + Original soundtrack (digital version) + One of the Original Puppets (PEDRO, MAPACHE, FRIDA, CIERVOLECHUZA)\nLl\u00e9vate uno de los personajes originales\nAgradecimiento en redes + Premiere en Vimeo del cortometraje + Banda Sonora + Uno de los Personajes del cortometraje una vez finalizado.\nPEDRO / MAPACHE / ORUGALLO / FRIDA / CIERVOLECHUZA", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (5 left of 6)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3350 or more", "title": "Be our producer", "descp": "Credit on our film as an Official Producer + special thankful acknowledgment on our social media + Alebrijes short film DVD + Production Dossier + Official Invitation to the Premiere\nS\u00e9 productor oficial de Alebrijes\nPRODUCTOR oficial en cr\u00e9ditos + Agradecimiento en redes + DVD del cortometraje finalizado + Dossier de producci\u00f3n + Invitaci\u00f3n oficial a la Premiere", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Became one of our characters", "descp": "Thankful acknowledgment on our social media + vimeo premiere + original soundtrack (digital version) + one of our mexican characters will be inspired by you + Character Concept Art (digital)\nS\u00e9 uno de nuestros personajes\nAgradecimiento en redes + Premiere en Vimeo del cortometraje + banda sonora + te incluimos como uno de los personajes de Ciudad de M\u00e9xico + Concept Art de Personaje Digital", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "2 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "PRIMERA ENTRGA...", "update_content": " As\u00ed fuimos haciendo Alebrijes.\nHola todos! como lo prometido es deuda en este post queremos mostrar un poco el proceso de realizaci\u00f3n ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "REGRESAMOS !", "update_content": "Ha pasado un tiempo muy largo desde que comenz\u00f3 esta aventura; les pedimos disculpas porque no hemos sido buenos anfitriones actualizando las noticias sobre el proyecto.

THANK YOU!!!!\nThe journey continues... join us on...\nFacebook | Twitter | Press | Say hi!\nCubetto is a coding toy for girls and boys. Powered by a tangible programming language. It's super fun, super intuitive, and we need your help to make it happen!\nThis is how it works...\nAs seen on:\nProgramming without the screen\nChildren help Cubetto find his way home by writing their first programs using a set of colorful coding blocks.\nFor girls and boys ages 3 and up\nChildren can use it even if they can't read yet, so no matter what language they speak, hands-on coding is at their fingertips.\nDoes it work?\nCubetto combines Montessori learning principles with computer programming concepts. We sold, hand-built, and shipped over 800 early prototypes to educators and parents in over 40 countries to test our assumptions.\n\nHere's what some of them had to say...\nWhy?\nCoding is a basic 21st century literacy, and one our children can't afford to miss out on, but if you made it this far, you already know this!\n\nStarting young gives them an edge, and starting with something fun, that they actually enjoy, means they learn faster and better.\nStretch Goals!\nInside the box\nEvery Cubetto Playset comes with all the necessary parts to begin play right out of the box:\n1. Cubetto \n2. Board \n3. 16 Blocks (4x Forward, 4x Right, 4x Left, 4x Function)\n4. 1x1m World Map \n5. Story Book\nCubetto is a wooden robot that wants to be told where to go and how to get there. A smiling companion capable of motoring his way through any adventure.\nThink of the Board as an interface or a command line. Use it with the blocks to send instructions to Cubetto. There's one main sequence (A), a subroutine (B), and a Go button (C) to send instructions to Cubetto.\nOur blocks are a new, procedural programming language. Much like LOGO was back in the 70's, except you can touch it! Each block is a specific and unambiguous instruction, easy to recognise and combine into a meaningful sequence.\nGreen - Forward \nYellow - Left 90\u00ba \nRed - Right 90\u00ba \nBlue - Function\nA floor map drawn on top of a grid helps you plan your next adventure. No destination is too far. Tell a story that means something to you!\nExpansion Pack (Now includes all 4 maps!)\nNew maps, new stories, new adventures. Each one covers an exciting theme and topic, packed with activities and places to visit. Two of each for now, more if we're funded! Each Expansion Pack comes with:\n4 World Maps (Solar System, Water World, Ancient Egypt, Cityscapes) \n4 Story Books\n50 billion+ ways to play\nThe most sophisticated of things are often the simplest. There are more than 50 billion sequences you can make with the blocks! No two adventures ever need be the same.\nLet toys be toys\nWhy should coding toys only be for boys and not for girls? Why can't a STEM toy be for both? It can! And it is! \n\nWe want girls and boys to be equally excited about playing and learning with Cubetto. So we\u2019ve designed it based on two universal symbols that are the same for all genders and cultures. A cube, and a smile :)\nHow is this Montessori?\nIt's non-prescriptive - Cubetto gives children the ability to solve problems within the world they create. This gives them freedom to express their creativity and aptitudes, unconstrained by the challenges of literacy, or the distractions of a screen.\n\nIt's child-centered - All they need to get started is a nudge in understanding that blocks = actions.  After this point, even the discovery of what each block does can be led by the child, leaving adults to observe and only help when needed.\n\nIt's auto-didactic - Solving problems with the blocks is about trial and error. Once a sequence is sent to Cubetto, the result is immediate and non-abstract, giving children concrete grounds on which to self-correct without adult intervention. Just change the blocks and go again.\n\nIt's designed for scaffolding: When a problem is too complex, the right sequence is easily pooled from collective knowledge of children in the play session. Each child can in turn add a block, or a suggestion, layering in their individual competence to the solution in small steps.\nHow is this coding?\nAlgorithms - Algorithms are sets of precise instructions that form a program. Cubetto\u2019s blocks are a physical representation of an unambiguous instruction that children can touch.\nThe Queue: Instructions in programs are executed following a precise order. On the Board instructions are put together following a wavy line that represents a command line.\nDebugging: The instructions are laid on the board, and are immediately executed by Cubetto, so when he doesn't arrive where he should, fixing mistakes is as easy as swapping a block.\nRecursions: Create a subroutine by \"packing\" a sequence in the function line, and call it in the queue with a blue block when you need it. Make long sequences shorted and more elegant, like in the real world.\nInfinite Loops: Insert a function block in the function line and watch Cubetto go loopy. Want to stop an infinite loop? hmmm... tried turning it off and on again? :)\nCurriculum mapped\nWe created an online resource centre, packed with curriculum mapped activities and games, to help you get started with Cubetto right away.\nWe're currently in private Beta, but you can take a look at our teacher's guide. \nWho's using Cubetto?\nThese are some of the settings where Cubetto is being used to introduce computational thinking, and these are some of the case studies we've collected so far.\nMontessori Kindergartens \nEarly learning centers \nElementary schools \nHomeschooling \nSpecial needs classrooms and inclusion programs \nAfterschool programs \nTechnology clubs \nSTEM curriculum \nGifted programs \nPublic Libraries and Community Centers \nMaker Spaces \nTutoring \nTechnology camps\nWhy should 3 year olds learn this?\nMuch like playing with Cubetto, computational thinking is about breaking down tasks into a logical sequence of steps to reach an objective. In fact, computational thinking is something we do every day to solve all kinds of problems, big and small.\nThinking about the world around us the same way we think in the world of Cubetto is empowering. It gives us the confidence to try things out, break the rules, and shape our environment. Which is pretty amazing!\nPlaytime with Cubetto is collaborative, because you learn that complicated tasks are best tackled by more than one person. It encourages creativity by showing you there is no right or wrong way to reach your objectives and make the impossible possible.\nA game changer for non-sighted children\nCubetto works with shapes, movement and sound. Turning code into something you can touch is changing the way non-sighted, partially sighted and sighted children can now learn the basics of computational thinking in the same setting.\nHere\u2019s what leading computer scientist and Code Club chair, Chris Mairs, had to say\u2026\nRobots don't change the world, people do!\nWe're a growing community of over 800 educators, parents and teachers. From Kobe, Japan to Cape Town, South Africa. There's hundreds of us, help us become thousands!\nBig things have small beginnings\nWe came to solve a problem; making coding accessible, tangible and fun for young learners all over the world. It was a shared passion for design, and impending fatherhood that kicked it all off. Here's our story from bean to cup.\nMarch 2013 - In a maker-space far far away... there's a dream\nNovember 2013 - 651 people come together to make it happen!\nJan 2014 - Development begins... lots of it!\n2014 to 2015 - Testing... when in doubt ask the experts\nApril 2015 - The big build! We begin to pack ship and deliver\nMay 2015 - A Cubetto 2.0 prototype smiles at us through the MoMA Store window\nJune 2015 - Cubetto 2.0 is complete. Better, smarter, stronger\nFeb 2016 - 75 units roll of the factory line for testing. We're ready!\nMarch 8th 2016 - We launch! If successful, it's project timeline\nProject timeline\nWe build with experienced supply chain powerhouse PCH International. PCH were behind the successful delivered of educational products like Kano, Little-Bits along with countless Fortune 500 products all over the world. We're in safe hands, and we're confident of a timely deliver. We've built in sensible buffers to account for any surprises, and all the development is complete.\nTech specs\n(A) LEDs, (B) Sequence Line, (C) Function Line, (D) Go Button, (E) Big Screw, (F) Direction Arrow, (G) Battery Housing, (H) On/Off, (I) Shell, (J) Wheels, (K) Castor, (L) On/Off, (M) Battery Housing\nPack Size 27(w) x 26(h) x 15(d)cm, \nWeight (approx.) 1.5kg  \nMaterials Linden Plywood (varnished), ABS Plastic (matte finish) \nBattery AA x6\nLife 4-6hrs (continous play)\nBluetooth BT4.0\nRange \u226410m \nCerts FCC IC\nProudly Arduino\nThe robot is built around the Atmel SAM D21 microcontroller used in the Arduino Zero.

For all intents and purposes, Cubetto's brain is \"just\" a regular Arduino.\n\nYou can update Cubetto from the Arduino IDE. If you want to make your Cubetto do something special, there are thousands of Arduino resources online to help you out. \nNot your cup of tea? Don't worry. You don't need to know anything about electronics to use Cubetto. Just take it out of the box, and begin your adventure right away!\n Why Kickstarter again?\nSince November 2013, all our energies and finances have gone into developing a certified, expandable, and durable unit, fit to ship anywhere in the world. Kickstarter allowed us to build and ship a product directly to those who wanted it, building an amazing community in the process, so launching this new version on Kickstarter feels like coming home.\nWe still need your help!\nWe're supported by great angels and partners, but there is still a huge part of this equation missing. You! Your backing will allow us to amass enough orders to begin a rolling production. Our first campaign got us this far. Imagine where we could go next?\nOn the shoulders of turtle\nPrimo Toys is the effort of many who supported and believed in the project throughout the years. From the MAInD master, where the initial idea for a hands-on coding language was conceived, to the maker spaces, schools and customers who passionately contribute on continuous development.\nWe're lucky to have built on top of Arduino, an incredible invention, tool, and community that has opened the world of computing education in amazing, groundbreaking ways.\nWe're also here because of the pioneering work of educators and technologists like Seymour Papert and Jean Piaget (fathers of the Logo programming language) and Maria Montessori, who gave us an amazing framework for development, and some very broad shoulders to stand on indeed.\nUltimately we feel like we're only a small part of a bigger mission, and we hope you will join us on this journey, so that like us, you can become part of something bigger too.\nThank you from all of us at Primo Toys\nFilippo Yacob - Founder & CEO\nMatteo Loglio - Founder & Interaction Designer\nValeria Leonardi - Number 3 & COO\nBen Callicott - Head of Product\nHugo Mathers - Marketing Assistant\nFollow us!\nTwitter \nFacebook\nInstagram\nWriting about us?\npress@primotoys.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware is hard!

Most belts that attempt to add utility to this equation end up sacrificing style. I have never worn a multi-tool belt before because I take pride in my fashion. I don't want a bulky belt that looks like it belongs on Batman, nor do I want a more fashionable multi-tool belt that I need to take off my waist to actually use. That diminishes the convenience.\nWhat I want is simple. A belt that doesn't try too hard; that I can wear to work; that I can use when I need it and forget about when I don't.\nWe designed our belt based on a few key principles: \nWith these principles, we were able to design a sleek and timeless belt that will seem nothing different than a normal belt until you need it. The price is set at $59 and includes a lifetime guarantee. If anything happens to the buckle, the strap, or the tools, we'll replace them. You shouldn't have to deal with the inconvenience of broken product. That is why we use quality tools, including the Spyderco\u2122 HoneyBee SS knife.\nThe two portions of the MBelt buckle are held together by two magnets - one of the belt side of the buckle, and one on the tool side (I point out the magnets in the video). The magnets hold it together very firmly, so you won't have to worry about it coming apart by accident.\nPLAY\n\nCalvin Klein is widely considered fashionable and forward in their belt design, and their belts were used as inspiration in the MBelt's design. Compare the MBelt to the Calvin Klein belt above. Both are fashionable. Both will work with your outfit. But one is decidedly more convenient.\nThe MBelt is less than 8mm thick\nWhen people think of a real life utility belt, they usually think of an embarrassingly ugly contraption that a person can \"technically\" wear in public, but no one that values their appearance would ever be caught wearing one. This is not that. The MBelt is less than 8mm thick and is designed to mimic a standard, timeless belt. \nBuckle + Belt weighs about 250g with the tools included\nThe MBelt weighs only 250 grams - a similar Calvin Klein belt weights just under 200 grams. Comfort is incredibly important and our #1 priority. \nPowerful neodynium magnets hold the belt together\nThe MBelt is held together by neodymium magnets and will not come apart unless you want it to. The tools inside are securely magnetically fastened so that they do not rattle. The construction will be backed by a lifetime warranty - if the belt breaks, send it to us and we'll replace it for free. And since the magnets are encased within the metal housing, they will not cause unwanted interference.\nThe tools secure snugly into place, ready for use.\nKnife, bottle opener, and four screwdrivers are included\nThe MBelt is designed to be used without removing or even undoing the belt. With it's patent-pending front-cover design, simply pop off the cover when you need it and pick the tool you need.\nThe included tools:\nSpyderco HoneyBee SS Knife\nBottle Opener\nPhillips PH1\nPhillips PH00\nFlathead Slotted 4mm\nFlathead Slotted 2mm\nThe screwdriver is driven by the cap. Place the desired screwdriver bit in the hex slot to secure it\nNeed to tighten a screw? Need a quick prybar? Your office chair coming loose? Four precision screwdriver bits are fitted inside the belt to tackle any small or medium sized job. It will be tough to find a screwdriver more convenient than this.\nThe cap serves as a bottle opener without removing the tools\nAt a party and need a quick bottle opener? Pop the cap off the belt and open that bottle up. Works fine with all the tools still in place.\nSpyderco\u2122 HoneyBee SS Folding Knife\nTo most, the knife is the most important tool. We understand this and partnered with the Colorado-based knife company Spyderco\u2122. Spyderco\u2122 is a renowned knife innovator and manufacturer known worldwide for the quality of their products. The Spyderco\u2122 HoneyBee SS  was our knife of choice. In most everyday situations this knife will be more than enough.\nThough not the biggest knife in the world, the Spyderco\u2122 HoneyBee SS will be more than enough in most any everyday situation\nPledge $1\nEvery dollar counts!

All parts are bought from external manufacturers, with the knife, screwdriver bits, and belt strap coming off-the-shelf. The only novel part of the design is the buckle casing itself, which can be produced easily using a mold. The only potential hiccup we could face at this point is sub-par quality molds. If this happens, we will have the molds refinished and reworked until we achieve our desired quality.\n\nOur manufacturer has been responsive and on time. The vast majority of our funding will go towards purchasing the molds for mass production. We did our best to front-load DFMEA and PFMEA work to ensure a smooth launch.\n\nFulfillment should run smoothly as mass distribution will be handled by a fulfillment service. Initial smaller-scale distribution will be completed by our team and when we can no longer handle it we will move to a local fulfillment service.\n\nAs the MBelt is managed mostly by Rich Ozdowy, the founder himself, it is possible that the activities become too overwhelming for one dedicated person. At this point additional support will be brought on-board to help make sure this does not become a limitation.\n\nIf there are any delays or unforeseen issues (we hope there are none, but it would be foolish to promise everything will run perfectly), we will post updates on our Kickstarter page promptly and do everything we can to keep you updated.

My finest moments were spent holding an art class enthralled. \nFrom my former student Candice:\n\"Once upon a time, when I was an awkward teen with terrible bangs, a sparkly purse, and a Tool t-shirt, I took a photo class at Maine East. Brandi Martin was my teacher. She was everything all of my other teachers were not: Accessible. Real. Honest. Relatable. She treated us like we were people already. Fast forward to now: thanks to social media we reconnected a few years ago and she is the big sister I never had. \nOne day in class, she was demonstrating how to adjust darkroom enlargers and said \"If you turn the knob this way, it will unscrew and this whole very expensive piece will come crashing down...\" She looked up with a dramatic pause, met each of our eyes to make sure we were looking at her and paying attention. \"...do not turn the knob this way.\" She raised her eyebrows at us and paused again, let it sink in, and it did. Do not turn the goddamn knob this way, people. I would not. Ever. \"Turn it this way instead. You will feel it make these very satisfying little clicks.\"It was a 20 second snippet of my life 13 years ago, and I remember that exchange. The exaggerated way she paused and made sure we were watching, the \"satisfying little clicks\" was the perfect description of what we were supposed to feel for. As a parent, I have employed that strategy many many times. The quiet. The big pause. The opposite of shouting, but so, so much more effective.\nThat's a little piece of Brandi that I carry into the world with me. It's a little piece of my teacher that my kids go into the world having experienced. There are over 9000 of us that spent a semester or an entire 4 years with her. Some of us became artists or photographers, but the vast majority of us did not. Yet we still carry these little pieces of her, of all of our teachers, out in the world with us.\nSo where are the 9,000 now? What are they doing? The pieces of Brandi making art, raising children, making sandwiches, nursing sick people, building roads, building stock portfolios. They are standing in waiting rooms, sitting in church, yelling in traffic, resting in an urn, laying on a beach.\nPlease consider funding this incredible art project, building a portrait of these pieces who have been scattered around the world over the last two decades.\"\nRebecca plays with her 3 year old daughter in their back yard. Rebecca made the tutu for her earlier that day, in anticipation of my visit.\nThere's no standardized test to measure lifelong educational influence. This requires the hard way, locating and visiting 20-30 former students, talking to them about their lives, and what art now means in their daily lives. After taking it all in, I'll make a meaningful portrait about them and their world.  \nKeenan looks for a good shot in the Aurora Illinois train station. He's saving money to move to Colorado.\nI've already begun tracking down former students, talking to them about the project. I tested the waters by creating a Facebook group. It already grew to 213 members! I asked them to make a video stating their name, age, location, major life activity, and what class they took with me, and got more than I bargained for. I spliced some of the results together to create the video above. These aren't even all of the replies; so many asked me visit and document them! I was deeply moved when Nick actually wrote a song about what he remembered from photo class.\nMinha's family is packing up the house to go care for a sick relative in Pakistan. She might go with them to attend med school.\nThe final product will be a gallery show in Brooklyn next summer (location TBA) that speaks to the humanity of these wonderful people, and to the best kind of student/teacher relationships.

Our infamous Uncle Louie, with a \"kings over full house\", was the big winner. One of the participants was a local New Orleans chef of great renown. Being unable to cover his wager, the chef offered the recipe for his famous sauce as his substitute for hard cash. Every year thereafter, Uncle Louie would secretly concoct his brew and distribute it during the holidays to family and very special friends. We now carry on Uncle Louie\u2019s tradition. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do, for never does a pulled pork, grilled chicken, hamburger, steak or rib pass our lips without this delightfully zesty and unique sauce.\nFamily pig roast\n A Sauce that Works with Everything\nUncle Louie Sauce is as versatile as it is tasty. Whether you're basting on grilled chicken or hamburgers, marinating a London broil or shrimp, using it as a finishing sauce on top of pulled pork sandwiches, or even spicing up your Sunday morning Bloody Mary, Uncle Louie Sauce will elevate your flavors with its blend of spices.\nMeet the Family\nUncle Louie was born in Olevano sul Tusciano, Italy (near Napoli) and emigrated to New York City, eventually settling in Delaware. He was the second-oldest of seven children. Dea's grandfather was the youngest of the seven.\nDea  grew up with the Uncle Louie tradition, and introduced John to Uncle Louie Sauce when they started dating. John's response to the experience of a family pig roast: \"If she doesn't marry me, someone at that table will.\"\nThe whole family is involved in bringing Uncle Louie Sauce to market. Dea is the master chef. John is in charge of sales. Michael develops and manages the website UncleLouieFoods.com. Kevin is the graphic designer and marketing manager. And Joe is the social media director. Our hope is to introduce Uncle Louie Sauce to food lovers coast to coast.\nWe Invite You to Join our Family\nLast summer we decided to extend the Louie tradition beyond our immediate family and friends. The response has been terrific, so well in fact that we are having trouble keeping up with demand. We are looking for your assistance in expanding our production capacity.

D6 sets come with two dice in each wood.\nBog Woods\nBog woods are a result of a tree falling and then being quickly buried or submerged in water. If everything goes just right, they can be preserved underground for an incredibly long time. Most of these types of woods are found with an entire buried forest so they have developed unique names and histories. We\u2019re using three different types of bog woods for the Root Dice.\nAncient Kauri\nAncient Kauri represents the oldest workable wood on the planet. About 50,000 years ago in New Zealand a major natural event (probably a tsunami) knocked over and buried a huge forest of these trees that had already been growing from some 2,000 years.\nBog Oak\nOur Bog Oak was born at the end of the last ice age. Huge oak forests throughout Europe flooded, and the trees died standing and fell into the muck. The swampy conditions have not only preserved these trees, but have turned the wood a deep black color. The bog oak we use is 5,000 years old..\nSinker Cypress\nThe Sinker Cypress is a product of the logging companies that used America\u2019s rivers as shipping lanes before the Industrial Revolution. As workers were driving these logs downstream to be milled into lumber, some of them would get stuck and sink into the murky river bottom. Now, over 100 years later, they are reclaimed, still showing the beautiful hues of green that cypress is known for.\nThe System\nWe came up with a way to roll anything from a D4 to a D20 (and maybe even higher) using a set of six, cube-shaped dice. Each set comes in a slim, handmade case that includes a card explaining the system. Here's the dice in the set:     \n2 x D6 in Ancient Kauri\nThese are standard six-sided dice, with the sixth face replaced with a Root Dice logo.   \n1 x Modified Fudge in Bog Oak\nFudge dice usually have 2 plus symbols, 2 minus symbols, and 2 zeros. We have added a plus to one of our zero faces and a minus to the other. This allows the die to be used as a 50/50 coin flip as well, which is needed to accomplish some of our rolls in the full set.\n1 x \"Fours\" in Sinker Cypress\nThis die has the values 1,2,3,4 and two Root Dice logos. It is used in D4 and D8 rolls. \n1 x \"Fives\" in Sinker Cypress\nThis die has faces that are multiples of 5, starting with 0, and two Root Dice logos. Its primary purpose is D20 rolls, but it also pairs nicely with the one of the D6s to make a 20 unit counter. \n 1 x \"Tens\" in Sinker Cypress \nThis dice has multiples of 10, from 10-50, and a Root Dice logo. It is primarily used as a counter to round out the set.\nThe Root Dice come in a slim handmade case. Oiled canvas with leather accent and elastic closure.\nSample Rolls\nWe've already found ways to reproduce the most prominent rolls in gaming using these dice in combination, and we're excited to see what else the gaming community will come up with once we get them in your hands. Here's a few examples of how to roll the basics:  \nD20 Roll: Grab a D6 and the Fives die. Roll them, and re-roll any dice that show a Root Dice logo. Add them together.   \nSimple process right? Here's the math. When you re-roll any logos, you reduce the possible outcomes for the D6 to 1 through 5 and the Fives die to either 0,5,10, or 15. So you have a 1/5 probability and a 1/4 probability for each outcome. Multiply those and you get 1/20, so there are exactly 20 possible outcomes. You end up with same probabilities as rolling a 20 sided die.  \nD8 Roll: We'll start by rolling the Modified Fudge and the Fours dice. Once again, re-roll any logos. If the fudge has a + sign showing, add 4 to the Fours die. If not, just use the face value. \nThere\u2019s only 4 outcomes on the Fours die, and 2 outcomes on the modified fudge. So the probabilities are 1/2 and 1/4. Multiply those, and you have a 1/8 chance for each number. \nRefer to the FAQ for info on other rolls such as D4, D5, and D12.\nWe are a Chicago based team of two former game developers turned artisans. We want to create objects that bring back the memories we've made playing the games we love, while also connecting with our adult design aesthetic. \nWe still cherish the memory of finding out that Samus was a girl, our first purple item in Azeroth, or the clutch roll that saved our favorite rogue. But we've had a hard time finding quality art that represented not only our deep seated fandom, but also reflected our age and design sense. We want to create objects that you can be proud to display in your home or office and use every day. To us, that means capturing the heart and soul of these games and inserting that into our work, while remaining true to our personal tastes. We\u2019re here to provide you with one-of-a-kind, handmade goods that you don\u2019t have to spend 500 rupees on.\nWe're getting started with the Root Dice, but eventually we want to make products that fit with all of gaming culture. We hope you'll join us in that mission by supporting this project and coming along for the ride.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a strong plan in place to produce dice well beyond what it will take to fulfill rewards for our project goal. While procuring bog wood can sometimes be a challenge, we have located suppliers with huge stocks, and a set of dice doesn't require too much wood.\n\nOur biggest challenges will be consistency as we scale up to produce these larger quantities. Our current tools aren't really up to the job of producing hundreds of sets, but the tools we need to nail it are built into our goal. \n\nIf something unforeseen comes up, you can count on us to communicate clearly and often about what happened and how it is impacting the project.

If there's water, you can bet I'll be in a canoe. And I always try and get some fishing in, no matter where or when. But when you're hiking, camping, canoeing, or any combination of the above, adding tackle and poles can be a difficult prospect. The equipment takes up room, adds weight to your gear, and is cumbersome to use \"on the go.\" You have to unpack everything, assemble it, get some fishing in, then disassemble and repack it all when you're done.\n\nI've always been a fan of fishing without a traditional pole and gear, utilizing other methods such as film-canister survival kits, wrapping line around a water bottle, or simply using a line and a hook. I wouldn't have to worry about the logistics of packing and transporting everything, and I avoided spending tons of money on exotic lightweight materials. But what I really wanted was an ultralight kit that I could carry in my pocket. It had to be easy to deploy, fun and easy to use, reliable, and above all it had to be self-contained with both line and tackle. After some research, development, and testing, the \"Pocket Reel\" was born. \nEarly test models of the pocket reel. These test kits are made from thin walled plastic tubes. The final product uses a different tube, which is roughly the same size but twice as thick as the test model and virtually indestructible.\nFinal product in the new tube. The original nylon thread from the test models and video has been replaced with a plastic spool holding an additional 45ft of 12lb big game fishing line. endcaps have been changed to blue. Lure color will vary.\nThe Final kit will contain;\n45' 12lb fishing line on the kit\n4x #8 fishing hooks\n4x 3/0 removable sinkers\n10x synthetic maggots \n1x 3/4\" bobber\n2x spinner lures\n1x 45' spool of 12lb big game fishing line\nKnot guide with directions\n**UPGRADE 1x Crappie/Panfish jig (see update 4 for pics)\nPLAY\n\n\nHow I got the idea\nI already had experience with a film canister fishing kit in the past. While I liked the concept, in actuality the kit was flawed in just about every way. The canister was too small, so holding onto it while casting proved to be difficult. The canister was too flimsy, so if I landed a fish (even a small one) the canister was almost sure to buckle while pulling it to shore. Lastly, the canister would get knocked around in my pack and open up, and removing hooks from various items got old quick. But it was a starting point.  \n\nI went for something similar in shape but a little bigger, and found an old prescription pill container. I figured the childproof cap could stay on inside my pack, and the tube was pretty strong, so I didn't have to worry about it buckling when I had a fish on the line. But it was still too small and difficult to hold onto, so I started looking for something better.    \n\nI searched my garage, the internet, and various hardware stores in my attempts to find anything tubular that could possibly meet my criteria, and soon ended up with a large stash of containers of varying shapes, sizes, and materials. After testing, one container stood out from the rest, completely surpassing both the film canister and prescription bottle in every aspect. It was large enough to grip comfortably, but small enough to fit into my pocket. It was virtually indestructible, I could probably run over it with a truck and not break it. And lastly, perhaps best of all, the screw cap meant no more fishing hooks everywhere.\nProduction\nNow that I had my container, I moved on to the next problem. The polymer construction of the tube, while strong, meant it had nothing to allow the line to gain traction. Without traction, there'd be no way to reel in a fish. I solved this problem by adding a section of rubber to the end of the tube, providing the line with traction and allowing the user to reel in their catch. With that settled, I stuffed the inside with some hooks, sinkers, synthetic maggots, a 3/4\" bobber, a couple spinner lures, and a bobbin of 12lb monofilament fishing line. Finally, for casting, I drilled a hole in the cap and added a lanyard and bead. The kit was ready for trials.\n\n  early concept tackle and kit contents. Note: Since testing, the spool of thread here has been replaced by a spool of additional fishing line\nThe bead at the top of the kit is used to tighten the lanyard. This prevents the lanyard from slipping off of your wrist.\nYou will have your choice between either a \"Skull\" or \"Smooth\" bead. SKULL beads will be available in either WHITE or PINK. SMOOTH beads will be available in; WHITE, RED, BLACK, or PINK.\nTesting the Pocket Reel\nI tested it on a fishing trip with four friends. They all had poles and large tackle boxes; I had my fishing kit in the cargo pocket of my pants. When I took it out and showed it around, I was immediately laughed at (good friends, right?). They said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to catch anything with that.\u201d \nI started off with a baited hook. I set up my line and cast her off, reeled her back in, recast, saw the tell-tale ripples around the bobber, saw it dip underneath the water, got excited and started to reel in the line. The bait was gone. I forgot to set the hook! I recast my line with fresh bait, saw ripples and the bobber went under. I pulled up on the line, set the hook, and reeled in my first catch of the day. \nIt was a tiny bluegill\u2014hardly a meal\u2014but more importantly, the kit worked and I was the first one with a fish on. \nI got the nod of approval from my friends and one of them suggested I try a spinner lure. I reset my line with a spinner. The idea with this type of lure is to cast, reel in, and recast to the same area. The line needs to be reeled in with some speed in order to get the spinner to flash underwater. Seemed kind of hard to do without a reel. Boy, was I wrong. Holding the line and moving the kit in a circle with your other hand, the same motion you make when you operate a fishing reel, brought the line in as fast as any rod setup I\u2019ve ever used. With a few practice casts I was able to hit the same spot with my spinner lure. \nReeling end of the test model.\nOn the fifth cast, I starting feeling the tell-tale nibble on the lure as it was coming in. The next cast, I landed a small bass, much larger than the bluegill from before. The kit worked wonderfully and it was a lot of fun to use. \nFirst bass!\nI was impressed. My friends were, too. So much so that one of them offered to buy my second spare kit on the spot. It was my first sale. The \"Pocket Reel\" weighs in at a 3.25oz. fully loaded so it\u2019s very comfortable to carry. I added a knot guide and simple use directions with the kit so anyone can pick it up and fish anytime and anywhere.  \nKnot guide and directions that are included in the Pocket Reel\nDirections for Use \nYou simply pull out your favorite tackle from the kit, remove the elastic band covering the line, and tie on your lure. Slip your hand into the lanyard at the end, put your thumb on the line, and motion your arm like you are skipping a stone across a lake. When your hand is extended, release your thumb and the line will cast. You can do short casts by releasing your thumb and when the line is out as far as you like, point the kit upwards and the line will stop. \n Website \nSome of the funds raised through kickstarter will help to fund the building of a website and store to sell the Pocket Reel and Accessories. \nAccessories \nSome accessories that will be made available through the website will be.\nSpare spools of fishing line\nExtra hooks and sinkers\nAdditional bags of bait.\n Future Ideas for Accessories/Stretch Goals\nHook and Sinker containers that will fit inside the storage compartment of the pocket reel.\n  An assortment of lures and tackle to upgrade your kit", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge will be working with new suppliers to obtain the materials needed to build the kits.\n\nSuppliers have already been lined up but we always face the risk of an item being out of stock or backordered.

I started playing guitar and writing music in college and enjoyed the occasional open mic night. Over the past year, playing music has really taken off for me. I began playing last summer every Saturday morning at a local Farmer's Market. This gave me a fairly wide swath of exposure, and I have been playing gigs almost every weekend since.\nI have also written more songs in the past year than in the previous 5 years combined. The next logical step is to record an album.\nThe Album\nMy plan is to release an album that has 10-12 tracks. I hope to include mainly songs that were written in the past two years. As I get deeper into the recording process, I will certainly have a better idea of what songs to include. The following songs were written in 2013 and 2014 and may appear on the album (click on the highlighted songs to listen to a rough cut):\nInside My Head\nI Will Survive\nLucky Man\nPinpoints of Light\nAleksander\nMidwinter\nVia Champlain\nMakes You Tremble\nThe Legion of Doom\nThe NSA Will Never Hear This Song  \nWhere The Money Will Go\nMy garage is large enough to fit 4 cars in it. So in one corner of my garage I will build a finished 13x13 room for use as a functional recording studio. This room will be carpeted, insulated and heated. It will be treated with sound dampening foam (not cheap). I will also need to purchase a few pieces of furniture for the studio.\nI already have most of the equipment I need, but will need to buy:\nprofessional studio monitors\nmonitor stands\nhigh quality studio headphones\nnew microphones\na used drum set\nFor making the actual album, I will need funds for mastering and pressing the CD. Funds will go to artist Craig Griffin and RoofTopHowl Studio for designing the album, posters and t-shirts and for materials. Shipping costs are also included in the funding goal.\n\"Why not go record in a professional studio?\"  Most of my songs I would not consider \"studio ready,\" meaning that I still need to work out intros, outros, solo parts, instrumentation, etc.  These are things you don't want to do when you're paying a studio by the hour.  Having my own space will allow me to spend time with each song and make creative decisions without being under the pressure of a clock.\nA Studio for the Community\nAfter the studio is built and ready to go, I will be able to offer affordable recording sessions to local musicians and community members.  Profits from these sessions would go mainly toward increasing the quality of the studio.\nKickstarter Updates\nPart of the Kickstarter model is that contributors receive periodic updates as the project progresses. I will keep you up to speed as the studio gets built and the album gets recorded. Your contribution basically gets you behind the scenes for this process.\nConclusion\nThe end product of this Kickstarter project will be a high quality studio album with fresh new songs that I have written from 2013-present. Clearly, however, your investment in this project is an investment in the future of my musical career AND an investment for the community.  Your support is greatly appreciated!\nSpread The Word\nKickstarter projects operate on an \"all or nothing\" model.  This means that if I don't meet my funding goal in 30 days, there will be no studio and no album.  So I am relying on you to spread the word.  Tell your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, bank tellers and mail carriers.  E-mail the link.  Post it on your social media accounts.  Sing it from the rooftops.  Anything you can do to get more folks interested will go a long way in helping me out.  Thanks!\nRoofTopHowl Studio\nRoofTopHowl Studio is the brainchild of my friend and colleague, Craig Griffin.  Here are some examples of his work:\n The Suspense\nI had a lot of fun promoting this project and thought I would include some of the pics and videos I used to do so:\nPLAY\n\nThanks for checking out my project.

There is somewhat of a demand at present for full color e-books because there is a limited amount of those available for people who have color readers.\n\n\"Madman in the Gate\" has a broader appeal than most poetry books because it included such a great collection of works by artists and photographers from all over the world. Naturally, we will try to reach that audience in our marketing. The overall key to sales is being able to find your target audience. The challenge, as always in publishing, is getting the word out to people. I have done this before. My book \"The Platinum Rainbow\" was self published and sold 250,000 copies.

And if you're on-the-go all the time, then you know that yanking that cable out of your bag is a hassle. It gets caught on stuff in your bag. It pulls other crap out of there too--keys, pens, other cables, you name it!\nSay hello to Torso.\nTorso is incredibly short, so it's ultra-portable. It's a little bit over 4 inches (100+ mm) long, so it's the perfect phone cable for anyone who is on-the-go. But Torso's size isn't the only thing it has going for it. We have designed Torso with a bendable wire \"skeleton\" and three \"legs\". These bendable legs are what make Torso so amazing.\nBend it.\nThe wire skeleton inside Torso isn't a limp noodle like those old bendable toys. Torso is strong. Bend a leg, and it stays bent. Bend all three legs, and make a tripod. Bend Torso and plug it into your AC adapter to make an instant wall charger dock. And when you want to hit the road, just bend Torso back into ultra-portable mode and chuck it in your bag. It's like no other cable, and it's awesome.\nWhat can you do with Torso and your phone?\n- Ultra-portable mode: Sync and charge on the go.\n- Wall charger mode: Charge your phone right on the outlet.\n- Tripod mode: Snap fun tripod photos on the go.\n- Tripod mode: Pose for perfect self-timer (or Pebble assisted) photos.\n- Tripod mode: FaceTime with friends: on the go and hands-free!\n- Cord Wrap mode: Save space with the best earbud cord wrap.\n- Widescreen mode: Watch a movie or the game in widescreen mode.\nTripod mode: hands-free FaceTime\nWall charger mode: keep your phone off the floor\nUltra-portable mode: charge and sync on the go\nCord Wrap mode: ultra-portable convenience\nWidescreen mode: watch the Timbers match\nPLAY\n\n Tripod mode: self-timer (or Pebble assisted) remote photos\nBe sure to select your reward so that it matches your phone! And note that the Micro-USB version will work with just about *any* phone that has the Micro-USB connector centered on the bottom!\nUltra-portable mode: with the iPhone 5C and Galaxy S4\nInto production.\nWe launched Twig last year right here on Kickstarter. A lot has changed since then. New connectors. New phones! And we've got a new name for our product, too. Torso will now be Made for iPhone--with the Lightning connector for the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S. Torso is also great for Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, other Android phones, and many more devices and accessories--with the Micro-USB connector! We've already launched two great products with the Kickstarter community, and now we need your help to launch Torso as well.\nPrototyping: our original Twig video and the evolution of Torso\nIf you've backed one of our other projects like Twig or Wide Body, then you know that our crew is big on prototyping. We aren't afraid to rip stuff apart, scratch our heads a bit, and then glue it all back together in almost-unimaginable new ways. In fact, it's just that kind of design and prototyping that led to Torso. You can see this process in action in our Kickstarter videos for Twig and Wide Body. We've already completed most of the prototyping for Torso, and now it's time to build our production tooling for the project.\nAnd that's where your support will help us. Funding for this project will pay for plastic injection molds, wire forming fixtures, elastomer over-mold tooling, and much more. Our supplier already makes cables for the iPhone, so (believe it or not) the electrical wiring and connectors for Torso will be the easy part.\nThank you very much.\nUTENSILE is a product development company in Portland, Oregon. We design and develop consumer electronics products for companies like Apple, Intel, Dell, and Nike--and we have brought dozens of products through mass production for our clients over the years. Our team is really excited about Torso, but launching a product like this on our own is something that just doesn't pencil-out without the right kind of funding up front. In other words, this is the perfect kind of project for Kickstarter. Thank you so much. And please share this project with your friends!

Our Wide Body project ran into some issues with our leather, but we ironed those out in front of our backers with plenty of updates to let them know what was happening. And we delivered only a few weeks late (not months or years!) on both projects.\n\nMade for iPhone (MFi) certification is another challenge as we move into production on Torso. We have already passed many of the tests required for MFi, but there are still a few more to go, and Apple has very strict quality, design, and packaging guidelines for its accessory development partners.

Packaging is great, the device looks and feels pretty solid. It does indeed stay bent pretty much the way you mean for it to. Everything seems to work fine, it even holds up my huge Galaxy Note 3. The only problem I have is that the micro-usb plug is backwards. I tried to plug in my phone just like the little picture on the box and it ends up showing me the back of my phone. That's not really as useful. I ended up having to twist the main center piece of the torso a full 180 and then it works like it should, but I was nervous bending it that much. It didn't really feel like it was meant to be twisted that hard. Perhaps I'm just not familiar, but encouraging all the Galaxy phones to use this and then having the main USB plug backwards from what the imagery implies seems like a major mistake to me. Maybe there are phones out there with the connector on the phone reversed so it will work naturally, but I was a little disappointed to see it turn out this way. By no means does it hurt the MAIN purpose of the device, it's just a niggling issue I have with it. It still feels very weird to put all the weight of my phone on top of a micro-usb connector that bends, but so far it seems to work okay. I'll admit I don't think it will last a long time, but it's mostly a novelty device to me and should come in handy every once in a while.

From the first taste, you know you\u2019re enjoying a real artisan product made with a lot of thought.\u201d\nMarcia Gagliardi of TableHopper, 7x7 Magazine admitted \"It's like unlike any product I\u2019ve ever tasted: it\u2019s balanced, a touch smoky (and garlicky), and simply amazing\" Read Marcia's full review here. \nYou've told us \"You had me at Barrel-Aged\" \"Love your passion and drive with your new kickstarter project. Keep it up!\" \nHi Kickstarter!\nI'm Lisa, the Chief Sauce Maker at Sosu Sauces. It's my passion to make tastier, healthier, and wildly creative versions of everyday sauces. Last year on Kickstarter, we invited you to rediscover ketchup with our first sauce, Srirachup, a perfect marriage of our house-blend sriracha and ketchup. 7x7 Magazine named as one of the Best Local Gems of San Francisco and we were honored as a Good Food Award Finalist for this delicious sauce.\nNow we are on a mission to make improvements upon another sauce\u2014sriracha.\nWe age our sriracha in whiskey barrels!\nWe combined our philosophy of using fresh, locally sourced ingredients with the age-old craft of fermentation. We age our secret pepper mash in whiskey barrels for between 1-3 months. The sriracha takes on complex flavors from the oak barrels and the natural fermentation process. Absolutely no preservatives or additives go into our sriracha. Each bottle is handcrafted and made in small batches to ensure the most intense flavors.\nOur ingredients are simple: chili peppers, brown sugar, garlic, and salt. No potassium sorbate or Sodium Bisulfite.\nWhen we tasted the first batch of our Barrel-Aged Sriracha, we knew we were onto something big. The flavors are spicy, fruity, and had a lingering smokiness from the oak barrels. It is Sriracha, but one that we\u2019ve never tasted quite like this before.\nLimited Edition Barrel-Aged Sriracha, aged for 3 months\nAs with whiskey, the aging time greatly impacts the flavor of our sriracha. We normally age our sriracha for one month in order to preserve the bright, fruity flavor of the peppers. But we are releasing a limited-edition Barrel-Aged Sriracha aged for 3 month exclusively for our Kickstarter supporters. This additional time in the whiskey barrels brings out a sweeter, more robust, and smokier flavors of the oak barrels to create a balance in the spiciness. \nBarrel-Aged Hot Sauce and Sriracha Salt\nBut wait, there's more. Our waste-not, want not philosophy inspired us to create two additional products from the by-products of our sriracha\u2014Barrel-Aged Hot Sauce and Sriracha Salt.\nOysters not included, but a good pairing with the hot sauce!\nBarrel Aged Hot Sauce is our version of a vinegar-based hot sauce. Also aged in whiskey barrels, we soak the leftover pepper skin and seeds from our sriracha to create a spicy, tangy, and fruity and perfectly balanced hot sauce. Full of flavor, it's good stuff. (4oz)\nOur Sriracha Salt will become your favorite go-to seasoning. It\u2019s spicy, nutty, lightly roasted with a hint of oak and goes well on anything (especially pizza!).\nBarrel-Aged Swags - Showing your love for #BarrelAgedSriracha\nStretch Goals and Rewards: \nOur long-term goal has always been to have a dedicated production facility, build a strong team, and launch new products. With your continued support, we can achieve these goals even sooner! We are announcing stretch goals of $60,000 and $100,000 to help us get to those goals. Take a look at what we can accomplish if we are to meet these stretch goals:\nThe Stretch Goal Rewards: \n $60,000 stretch goal reward: Everyone who orders a jar of Barrel-Aged Sriracha will receive a FREE Sriracha Cumin Spice Rub. The inspiration comes from my recent trip to Xi'an, China, where cuimin spicy lamb skewers are a popular Muslim-Chinese street food snack. The rub is made with lightly toasted ground cumin mixed with dried Barrel-Aged Sriracha pepper flakes, perfect for every meat dish (especially lamb)!\n$100,000 stretch goal reward: Everyone who orders a jar of Barrel-Aged Sriracha will receive a FREE 4 oz Whiskey Barrel-Aged Sambal Oelek. Sambal oelek is a staple Southeast Asian chili sauce meaning \u201cground chili sambal\", essentially a thick sriracha with the pepper seeds and skin. Our version combines plenty of garlic, fish sauce, and lime juice with Whiskey-Barrel Aged pepper mash for a rich and umami flavor.

Hand weeding is still the most convenient method of weed control and this tool is designed to help you better extract the root of the weed. Weeds are tricky, and if you don't get the whole root, the weed will grow back. The Ring Weeder allows you to get the whole root which will save you time and effort in the long run. Better weeding, fewer weeds.\nVegetable gardens, flower beds, and every space in between, they all need to be weeded. We want to improve this process so you spend less time weeding and more time enjoying the fruits of your labor.\nEven if you don't weed yourself you know someone that does. So get them one, it makes a great gift.\nHere's how it works:\nResearch and Development\nWhile weeding a flower bed using this screw driver-like tool (pictured below), I came up with the idea of a tool that attaches to my hand to make the weeding quicker and more efficient. I was frustrated while using the screwdriver-like tool since I am right handed and didn't like to use my left hand to pull out the weed which forced me to put the tool down and then pull out the weed with my preferred hand. This made for a slow and boring process.\nThe highlight of my frustration was when one day I misplaced the tool and spent twenty minutes searching for it since I didn't want to run it over with my lawn mower and risk damaging the machine or even worse: potentially hitting someone with it.  \nScrew driver-like weeding tool\nImages of a tool that attached directly to my hand started to bounce around in my head. \nMy original idea and first drawing\nOn the day after Thanksgiving, 2012, I searched for a welder to make my prototype. After being rejected by one welder, and another not returning my call, I decided to stop by Tom Malloy\u2019s Welding Shop in Glen Head, NY. After carefully explaining my idea, Tom went to work quickly on what was dubbed \"The Garden Claw\".\n\"The Claw\" was very awkward to use so I went back to the drawing board to refine the concept.\nI realized that using only the tool on my index finger along with the help of my bare thumb felt more natural and comfortable. My next thought was 'What if I had a long metal finger nail to get under the weed instead?'. This next prototype was dubbed \"The Garden Nail\". After testing, it was clear that rotating the nail tip under the finger greatly improved leverage and comfort. Soon after, the name \"The Ring Weeder\" emerged since you actually slip the device on you finger like a ring.\nMy first workable design. Now I'm on the right track!\n  After getting my patent pending, I reached out to local State Colleges and Universities and this is how I met Mechanical Engineer and future Project Advisor, Dr. Jeff Hung.\nWith his advice, I conducted my own research to find the average size of peoples fingers. The finger width along with the glove is vital in fitting of The Ring Weeder. My research suggested that offering two sizes: A large and a small version would fit most fingers. Dr. Hung then suggested a small slit on the top of the tool to allow for some flexibility to make an improved fit. You can find the best size for your Ring Weeder in the FAQ.\nI used the caliper tool to measure peoples ring size up to the first knuckle\nThe only question left was what material to make the tool out of. ABS plastic was the number one choice for its strength, durability, and lightweight properties. This resilient material is commonly used in the making of protective headgear, small kitchen appliances, and toys like Legos.\n I choose orange as my first production run color because it is bright and easy to locate amongst clutter or if misplaced in the field. \nPrototype Computer Image\nThe Final Prototype!\n With the help of your pledges I will be able to get the tooling needed ( cavity mold) and the first production run of your Ring Weeder. The research and development was done in NY. The final production will be done overseas. We already have a quote from an injection molding company for the molds and the production. The cavity mold will take about 8 weeks to make upon my ordering it. So once i am funded I can place the order. \nSo that\u2019s my story and this is my project. Thank you so much for looking at my project and learning more about it. I hope you will take part in my vision to help me launch this new and innovative tool.  \n SO REMEMBER, EVEN IF YOU DONT WEED YOURSELF, YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT DOES.

I did...and I decided to find out. Over the summer of 2012, while pursuing a degree in economics, I took my education out of the classroom to answer one simple question\u2014how much does a panhandler make?\nThe answers available seemed to be more urban legend than plausible fact. Some say a panhandler earns a below substance-level income. Some say he can earn forty-thousand, sixty-thousand, or even eighty-thousand a year. With nothing really substantial to go on, I decided to, quantitatively, find out the answer for myself.\nThe answer was waiting down at the exit ramp. I grew out my beard, donned some worn clothes, and built my very own cardboard sign. I panhandled for eighty hours over the course of twelve days. While incognito, I secretly recorded as much economic information as possible\u2014the gender of the donor, the time of day I received donations, the approximate age of donors, and more.\nOf course, most important of all, I recorded how much money I earned. Get out your two-week pay stub. By the end of my book, you will find out if you make more or less than that guy you see every day at the exit ramp.\nThis will not be a dry economic textbook. There are human stories to tell. I am writing this book to tell about the woman who gave me a single hundred dollar bill and the teenage boy who gave me four pennies. About the Army vet who threatened to punch me in the face and ended up giving me twenty dollars. About the woman who offered me a job the first day I started panhandling. Do you believe America is a generous society or are we just a collection of banksters? I think I found part of the answer, and it\u2019s worth sharing.\nWhat I am asking from the Kickstarter community is help to get this economic tale of investigative journalism from raw data into written word and out to the public. I have already made substantial progress. Approximately one third of the book is written. I need a small degree of financial backing so that I can complete the manuscript and cover the modest costs of book design, editing, and publication. I can do all this on a shoestring budget\u2014I just need someone to help provide the shoestrings. \n What I am offering in return is a way for interested readers to pre-purchase the finished product. The story of my adventures panhandling is a story worth being told\u2014but don\u2019t take my word for it. Below is the introduction of the manuscript. If you enjoy it and want to read more, please feel free to support my work as your means allow. Thank you for your consideration and any spare change. \nPS. If you find this as fascinating a topic as I did, please share my work with others so they too can explore the profitability of panhandling. Cheers. \n                Manuscript for Exit Ramp\n                        -Introduction-\n\u201cThe practical uses of economic studies should never be out of the mind of the economist, but his special business is to study and interpret facts and to find out what are the effects of different causes acting singly and in combination.\u201d -Alfred Marshall\n            All across the highways and byways of America a common phenomenon occurs. Take any exit into a metropolitan destination and the odds are good you will see a man standing at the street corner with a cardboard sign. The sign will tug at your heartstrings or appeal to your sense of humor; it will ultimately be a plea for charity. The goal of the man and his sign is the exchange of money.  \n            The men\u2014and women\u2014who occupy the street corner go by many different names: beggars, transients, panhandlers, and bums. They don\u2019t fit into the greater American mythology; they are an unsightly blight on our land of opportunity where success is viewed as a ripe fruit just waiting to be plucked by those willing to make the effort. The bum standing at the exit ramp is often an uncomfortable reminder of failure and poverty.  \n            I suspect that I am like the majority of drivers. I try to read the various signs while earnestly endeavoring to avoid that awkward moment of eye contact. I hate that first look where the transient gazes expectantly with sorrowful eyes. My first thought is always, \u201cGet a job!\u201d At the risk of sounding like an uncharitable scrooge, I can\u2019t remember ever having rolled down my window in charity. No, I always seem be the one irritably stuck behind the person with the kinder heart\u2014while the light is green and traffic jams up. \n          Even though panhandlers have thus far been unable to open my wallet, they have always piqued my curiosity. Think about it: have you ever wondered how much a panhandler makes? It\u2019s an interesting question. Basic economics teaches that there must be some incentive for a person to stand on a corner hat in hand. The panhandler must receive some amount of money that makes the effort worthwhile. If he did not receive any handouts, no matter how much he was down on his luck, he would be forced to seek other means of gaining money. Intuitively, we all understand this\u2014no one would panhandle if it did not work. And since panhandling does work, the question that has always nagged me is: how well does it work?\n             As this question really took hold of my economic curiosity, I started asking it in a slightly different manner: what can a transient make per hour? If I could compare panhandling at an exit ramp with earning a wage during the typical forty hour work week, which would be the more profitable?\n            It\u2019s easy to jump to the conclusion that someone without a job is, by default, worse off than someone gainfully employed, but how do we know for sure?  If we were to judge just by sight, then the appearance of the scrungy street souls with their beat up cardboard signs and dirty faces leads us to quick conclusions. Indeed, the question, visually,seems to answer itself. \n           Yet, looks can be deceiving.  If panhandling, despite all appearances, can earn a man minimum wage, then is it not possible the transient at the exit ramp has the same financial opportunities as anyone else? A beggar could have the same financial means as the kid straight out of high school starting his first job.\n            To satisfy my growing curiosity of how much a transient can make per hour (and consequently, to find out if he makes more or less than a wage earner), I found myself needing hard data and a way to compare incomes. The idea for this book took shape as I took steps to collect that data. This case study, which grew out of the simple curiosity of how much a panhandler makes in a day, is my attempt to answer, quantitatively, the question of profitability in relation to panhandling.  \n              With this empirical goal in mind, I decided the best course of action would be to build a little economic engine of my own.  Over the summer break of my senior year at college, while double majoring in political science and economics, I put my education to good use and started collecting data on panhandling. This is my first attempt as an aspiring economist at basic quantitative analysis and social study.    \n            What follows are the adventures I experienced while building a usable data set. The numbers and stories, the spreadsheets and anecdotes\u2014they are all the results of my going undercover as a homeless beggar and collecting the information first hand. This book chronicles my attempt to live up to the inspiring words of Alfred Marshall and never forget the \u201cpractical uses of economic studies\u201d. I invite all those possessed of a healthy dose of curiosity and all those unafraid of spreadsheets to join me...as I go undercover at the exit ramp.\n      Want more?

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.\" --Laurence J. Peter.\n\nThere are risks with every project, and this one is no exception. The good news is that my risks are not catastrophic. They can at best only delay the publication of my study. \n\nThe greatest risk of delay comes from the fact that my two-year-old son was born with biliary atresia (bad plumbing between the liver and intestine for those not up on their medical lingo). He is prone to get liver infections which can mean spending a week or so in the hospital. Knock on wood--he has not had any lately, and I don't expect this to delay the project. On the other hand, if he does have complications, writing and publishing this study will take second fiddle. This complication has a low probability of delaying the release date, but I thought you should be aware of it. \n\nSecond, I have a family of six to provide for. I am coming to the end of my education and the corresponding support of the GI Bill. I may be required to take on a second job if my finances don't hold.

A Chicago company that makes furniture out of garbage may have the answer... ~ CBS\nOUR STORY\n\n\nFounded in 2011 by Chicago Non-Profit Rebuilding Exchange, RX Made evolved out of what was originally a job training program to create skilled workers in the growing field of building deconstruction and materials reuse.\nThe trainees in the program were taught basic carpentry skills, and learned to create furniture from reclaimed building materials salvaged in Chicago. From these beginnings, we have since transformed into a small furniture production shop, hiring both graduates from the training program and talented builders from the furniture making community here in Chicago.\n\nOUR INSPIRATION\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve received such an enthusiastic response to our furniture line that we wanted to explore producing a greater variety of products utilizing reclaimed and locally produced materials. We also wanted to make these products in the same way that we make our furniture; using local sourcing, local design, and local craftspeople. We are made in the USA.\n\nOUR PROCESS\nAs we started to ponder this idea, we realized we had lots of questions. What should we make? Where would we get parts that we can\u2019t make ourselves? What could these products look like? As we looked out into the design community to help us extend our product possibilities, we reached out to Strand Design, a Chicago based firm that for four years has been designing locally manufactured products. Strand Design was a natural choice to help us launch a product line that could blend creative design with reclaimed materials, as well as help us pilot a model that supports local manufacturers and designers.\nStrand has designed and fully prototyped three products specifically for RX Made, taking into account our material resources and the production capabilities of our small shop. \nEvery sourcing and production detail has been considered, and with the help of Strand Design, we were able to domestically source all of the components for this project, (everything from hardware and material finishes to clock movements and laser cut steel) with most pieces coming from Chicago and the Great Lakes Region.\n\nAll we need to get started is the support of you, our backers! We are so excited with the results of this collaboration, and are so excited for everyone to be a part of helping us make this project happen!\nWhen you support RX Made on Kickstarter, you help us:\nReclaim community \"waste\" and turn it into an asset\nCreate jobs for local designers and manufacturers, and:\nStart production of the first edition of designs manufactured by\nRX Made in collaboration with Strand Design\nSTRAND DESIGN FOR RX MADE: THE PRODUCTS\nThe RX Made Bottle Opener is made from reclaimed floor boards salvaged from deconstructed buildings in Chicago and locally fabricated stainless steel. The heat brand on the handle was made by a local manufacturer in Chicago, and all of the hardware is U.S. made.\nThe RX Made Wall Clock was designed with small scraps that accumulate in the wood shop in mind. Each clock is made from locally sourced Ash from Horigan Urban Forest Products, a unique lumber resource. Rather than contributing to deforestation, urban lumber comes from trees that would commonly be turned into mulch, burned, or otherwise destroyed; In the case of the Ash used in this design, it comes from trees that have succumbed to the Emerald Ash Borer blight. The clock is held together with a steel plate manufactured in Chicago, and U.S. made hardware. The quartz movement is manufactured in California, and the hands are manufactured in Rhode Island.\nThe RX Made Modular System is designed to work with reclaimed dimensional lumber, and can be made into a bench or a bookcase. If you happen to have some nice old-growth 2\" x 12\" boards from a recent project lying around, the DIY Kit is for you!\n\nIf you want a great bookcase or bench, we're offering both urban sourced Ash and reclaimed lumber for the shelves and bench top. The bookcase shelves are 4' wide and 11\" deep, and the bench top is 5' and 11\" deep. The laser cut steel components are manufactured and powder coated in Chicago. The shelves are finished with Tung oil manufactured in Iowa.

I went alone, switching locations often every 3 or 4 days, going on insane adventures (and misadventures), doing amazing things and things I should NEVER have done.

A spatula made from a single piece of silicone, heat resistant to 464\u00b0F, with weight and balance that make it easy to whip up a quick batch of pancakes, and fun to stir your grandma's spaghetti sauce for six hours on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing fancy here. No gimmicks. Just the best spatula you've ever used.\nTHANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING CAMPAIGN!\nThis was a lot of fun - thanks for the support. We're wrapping up on Kickstarter, but the GIR Spatula is here to stay! Visit our website at productofgir.com to get your hands on the Spatula and keep track of the latest from GIR.\nTHE STORY BEHIND IT ALL\nIt started with a common spatula\u2026 or more accurately, with a drawer of spatulas. For a tool that's so simple it's nearly two-dimensional, but integral to any cook's toolkit, we felt let down by every model we put in our hands.\nWooden handles burned on the edge of the pan and warped in the dishwasher. Metal handles were hot to the touch. Detachable blades and superfluous nooks and crannies trapped oil and food particles, which made cleaning a chore. Some were floppy, others so inflexible they couldn't scrape a bowl. And anything but a silicone blade had us worried that we'd ruin nonstick pans or be eating plastic out of the skillet if we turned around for more than a few seconds. Out of a collection of over a dozen, not a single one \"got it right.\"\nWe figured it was time for a change. So we designed a spatula that solved every one of those problems. Our small improvements to otherwise run-of-the-mill utensils have added up to an innovative, multi-purpose kitchen tool. And after several months of testing and prototype design, we're ready to rock and happy to introduce the patent-pending GIR Spatula: a single piece of molded silicone, heat resistant to 464\u00b0, easy to clean and easy to hold, flex- vs. structure-optimized.\nCORE DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS & KEY BENEFITS\nSAFE & HEAT RESISTANT\nThe Spatula does not get hot to the touch and it does not melt or burn: its heat resistant silicone withstands temperatures to 464\u00b0F (and you can deep freeze it to -40\u00b0F if you're in the mood).\nAN INCREDIBLY VERSATILE KITCHEN TOOL\nThe heavy-duty silicone rubber and strong but flexible blade make it easy to maneuver food, liquid, dry mixes, wet batters... you name it. Suitable for containers of all sizes: bowls, pots, hot pans, and plates.\nFOR HOME & PROFESSIONAL USE\nWe like to think of the Spatula as the ultimate kitchen tool, friendly and approachable enough for beginners at home, as well as super sanitary and multipurpose enough to serve as the go-to tool for experienced chefs at work. Lightweight but sturdy, non-slippery with a comfortable handle and grip, the Spatula was designed with both the occasional cook and seasoned chef in mind.\nCLEANS THOROUGHLY & EASILY\nThe Spatula\u2019s solid body construction doesn't trap food or oil particulates. It's quick and easy to clean by hand, so you can get right back to cooking. And of course, it's dishwasher safe. We put it through hundreds of cycles to make sure it didn't degrade or wear over time. And it performed just beautifully.\nECO-FRIENDLY & LONG-LASTING\nMade of eco-friendly, non-toxic material, the Spatula is designed to spend a lifetime in your kitchen.\nPATENT PENDING\nThe Spatula's novel design and construction make it a one-of-a-kind kitchen implement. So we can add another cool item to its highlight reel: Patent Pending.\nWITH YOUR SUPPORT\nWe've come a long way. The Spatula graduated from idea to prototype, and now it's ready for the big time. We're gearing up to launch a full-scale manufacturing run, and we can't do it without your help.\nSo where are we now? We've:\n- Finalized the Spatula's design, from handle to blade\n- Tested a range of material combinations\n- Built and tested five generations of silicone prototypes\n- Tested a production run of units in every color\nBy supporting this effort, you'll be the first to get your hands on a game-changing spatula unlike any other.\nWe're on track to deliver the first batch to our Kickstarter backers by early December 2012. We think they belong in every kitchen in the world, starting with yours.\nWHAT WILL YOURS LOOK LIKE?\nWe bet you have a drawer or bucket of subpar (or uninspiring) spatulas just like we did. If we may be so bold: throw them all away, and get the Ultimate Spatula. We wouldn't blame you if your next purchase was a trophy case.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent the better part of a year designing, developing, prototyping, testing, and beating up the GIR Spatula. If we were going to claim it as the \"ultimate,\" it HAD to stand up to the wear and tear of daily use\u2026 as well as some more extreme treatment.\n\nHere were some of the biggest challenges:\n\u2022 Refining the design of the polymer core so that we'd hit the optimal flex level\n\u2022 Selecting the appropriate food-grade silicone to use \n\u2022 Running test batches of silicone in each Pantone color until they looked right\n\u2022 Testing each color's durability with 7+ hours in simmering tomato sauce \n\u2022 Finding a manufacturer willing to work with us to produce smaller prototype orders so that we could get our models in the kitchen and test them (and test them, and test them\u2026) \n\u2022 Destroying almost every other spatula we owned to uncover any weaknesses we'd overlooked (RIP, stainless steel pan with melted plastic spatula all over it)\n\nWhat we came up with was unique enough to merit an application to the USPTO. So our intrepid little spatula is Patent Pending.\n\nWe're really proud of the amount of design, brainpower, and cooking that have gone into this project.

Highest quality ingredients for SUPERIOR COMFORT and DURABILITY\n2. 100% Made in America - SUPPORTS USA ECONOMY\n3. Fairly priced\n... help support by making this your next pair of underwear today.\n\n\nHey Kickstarter,\nThanks for checking out my project.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride, starting with my noticing that all of the underwear currently on sale at major department stores comes from other countries\u2026 and the vast majority is made with poor materials.\n\nBefore I knew it \u2013 and without much prior-knowledge \u2013 I was trying to find a US factory to make the superior product I had in mind. So far, so good. \nI've got the designs, sourced the fabrics and findings, and found a factory that needs this product as much as I need them... I just need $30,000 to get it going. \nPlease support at whatever level you're comfortable with. We'll pay you back with some really fantastic underwear, crafted for comfort with super-high quality materials you\u2019re going to love. If you\u2019ve got the time though, be sure to read the info below as well, it\u2019s wordy but worth it.\nReady for the best bit? Beyond this opening order, for every 1000 pair we sell per month, 1 full-time job is literally added back to the assembly line. Amazing, right?\nThanks for your support. - Jake\nAND NOW, A LAST MINUTE EDITION: We've added shirts to our line.\nYou asked for it, you got it! Flint and Tinder 100% Supima cotton, double soft-washed, Tagless Tees in two great styles: V-Neck and Crew Neck. Comparable shirts retail from $45 to $85, and go up from there. PLEASE NOTE: Shirts only come in white at this time. They're coming in the same S, M, L, XL, and XXL as the undies (even larger sizes to follow soon after our proper launch).\nA few questions you're likely to ask... \nWhat makes this underwear better than the other stuff out there? \nWe started with the highest quality materials for an unbelievable level of comfort, then spared no expense making sure the construction was built to last.\nThe goal is that, from the minute you first put them on through a lifetime of washing, you can feel the difference. That they were made in America should be the icing on the cake.\nPIMA cotton vs SUPIMA cotton; What\u2019s the difference there? \nPIMA cotton is some of the finest cotton on earth. It has extremely long, silky fibers that when properly spun produce a breathable, soft yet durable yarn. But garments labeled PIMA are known to have as little as 5% PIMA, with the remainder of the fibers coming from lesser, easier to produce cotton strains.\nSUPIMA is a trademarked term referring only to American gown PIMA cotton. Using this term requires a license in which the governing body, which closely monitors and licenses every step of the process, certifies that 100% of the cotton used is SUPIMA.\nFlint and Tinder only uses SUPIMA cotton.\nLets talk design... \nYes, lets. We started by incorporating every feature you\u2019d find on the most expensive pairs of underwear. With each prototype, we stripped away a little bit more, until we were left with a perfectly balanced garment; Simple in design, rugged in construction, refined in our selection of top-notch materials.\nWhere does the underwear I\u2019m wearing right now come from? \nHard to say without looking at your tag (even a single brand often manufactures in several different countries). Of the underwear available on shelves in Manhattan, here\u2019s what some of their tags say:\n2(x)Ist \u2014 Thailand\nA/X \u2014 Peru\nAdidas \u2014 Indonesia\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters \u2014 Macao\nBanana Republic \u2014 Indonesia\nBoss Orange \u2014 Egypt\nBrooks Brothers \u2014 Thailand\nBVD \u2014 El Salvador\nCalvin Klein \u2014 Vietnam\nClayborne \u2014 Pakistan\nDavid Beckham/H&M \u2014 Cambodia\nDiesel \u2014 China\nEmporio Armani \u2014 Thailand\nFruit of the Loom \u2014 Vietnam\nGap \u2014 Indonesia\nHanes \u2014 India\nHugo Boss \u2014 China\nIzod \u2014 China\nJ. Crew \u2014 China\nJockey \u2014 India\nJoe Boxer \u2014 China\nKenneth Cole \u2014 Thailand\nOld Navy \u2014 India\nPact \u2014 Turkey\nPolo / Ralph Lauren \u2014 El Salvador\nStafford \u2014 Thailand\nTommy Hilfiger \u2014 Indonesia\nUnder Armor \u2014 Cambodia\nUniqulo \u2014 China\nWrangler \u2014 China\netc. etc. etc. Only one comes from the US\u2013 American Apparel, but it's not hugely comfortable, isn't made of premium materials, and falls apart in the dryer over time.\nWill buying Flint and Tinder create American jobs? \nYou bet your ass it will! And not in some vague way either\u2026\nThe factory I'm working with is family owned and operated. It\u2019s over 100 years old. Just before the recession hit, they moved into a larger facility and invested in some of the capital improvements shown in the video (solar power etc.).\nAt that time they had 300+ employees and were hoping to double or triple in size. When we started this project however, with the economy in free-fall, they were down to just 90.\nThey\u2019ve agreed to learn to make this new, high-end brand of American-made underwear. Here\u2019s the fun part though: For every 1000 pair we sell per month, 1 full-time job has to be added back to the assembly line. Hopefully, with your support, it will help them keep the doors open.\nWait, how can you make a product here in the US (where labor costs are higher), using better materials, and still charge a competitive price?\nGreat question. It\u2019s hard, but not impossible.\n1\u2014Flint and Tinder will sell direct to consumers through our own website. This will avoid the 100% mark-up most stores add to products.\n 2\u2014The next stop is wholesale, but with almost no mark-up on our end, making the final retail price about the same as what we sell them for online. Why would we sell our product in a way that lets stores profit while hardly making anything on the deal ourselves?

We have applied for all of the required certifications, permits, and licenses that are needed.\n\u2022 Labels, packaging, and packaging equipment.\n\u2022 Small inventory of ingredients.\n\u2022 Small Amount of Equipment\nWhat we need:\n\u2022 Equipment!!! We have a limited amount of molds right now and we need a few more polycarbonate molds and silicone molds to make our confections. We currently temper chocolate by hand and could really use a chocolate tempering machine, we could also use more pots and pans to make our caramel and marshmallows, the more we can increase these things the More Confections for everyone and that\u2019s not a Bad thing right!\n\u2022 Retail Packaging\u2026. We have already created and sourced our online order packaging, but still would like to develop & buy our retail packaging. We also have to meet the retailer\u2019s requirements for their prized shelf space\u2026. *sigh*!\nFirst funding goal is $250 this will cover the cost of the polycarbonate and silicone molds we need.\nI am setting a Second funding goal of $1250.00 this will cover the cost of all the molds we need as well as a tempering machine for our chocolate. Reaching this Goal will also give everyone that pledged $20.00 or more an extra chocolate bar or Caramel Bar with up to five toppings, as always your choice on how it\u2019s made.\nOur Third funding goal is $3000.00 this will cover the cost of our dream tempering machine for our chocolate and more pots, pans and a larger cooling rack more of everything. So if we can reach this Goal I will sweeten the deal and give everyone that pledged $20.00 or more something we will only offer to our Kickstarter friends that is not available on our site maybe some English Toffee, Peanut Brittle or a Caramallow (a caramallow is a marshmallow wrapped in caramel) your choice of one of the three. Just remember these can only be given through Kickstarter there will be a few options with these as well so you can customize these to your personal tastes.\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\n\u2022 Help us make this the most Legendary Kickstarter campaign EVER! We understand if you cannot contribute monetarily, but please help us by getting the word out and sharing our project on Facebook and Twitter. We would appreciate your support in any form!\n\u2022 We can all enjoy fresh custom made confections; it all starts here...it all starts with you\u2026.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Chris Kennedy", "content": "The last laugh AHhAHAHHAhhahahaahahah...

And there's something pretty amazing that happens when the cheese texture takes place of a country's topography.\nThe cheeses deserve all the pixels they can get, so I will take high quality photographs of every cheese involved in this project. The maps will be printed on matte coated, medium thick paper.\nThe maps you can see below may just be the beginning of this. With your support, I would love to explore more cheeses. My goal is to create a world map where all countries with a cheese tradition are represented by a cheese they produce. I can't wait to see what this will look like and I really hope to be able to produce it so that I can share it with you as well.\nThank you so much for checking out my project.

As soon as I receive it, I will send the separate rewards out.\nI am sorry that there's been a little bit of a delay with shipping the rewards. The road from having the idea and a picture in my head of what this should look like to getting a hold of the different cheeses, creating the maps and finding the best way to print them, was a little longer than I first expected.
