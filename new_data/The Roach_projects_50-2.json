We were some of the best\u2026until we weren\u2019t.\nNot sure how it went to the side, but one job ended with the needed one dead and the marked one livin\u2019, while the next job dumped us right on the heads of another Skulk workin\u2019 the same and bein\u2019 earlier. I conceive that the coffin nail must have hit when we tore down a quarter of the waterfront in our rapid departure, and it turned out that knowin\u2019 our doin\u2019 was just about the last thing our patron wanted. I blame our glow-crust, fae-brained handler for the lack of detailin\u2019, but the Magus don\u2019t need or hear excuses. We got lax and dropped the lash.\nSo the Magus took it up.\nNow we\u2019re trapped and treadin\u2019 on a world that almost was, where it seems every race has died out or been killed off by humans. And these are Steel Worshippers, the worst kind of humans. They learned to tame this place without magic, using mechanix to brutally bend the elements to their will without regard to cost or consequence. They still burn most things for power and locomotin\u2019 and every inch of their spaces is crawling with electric. These are a fearsome people, and we have been set here to clear our accounts and prove our worth.\nThe Magus has a taste for magical numbers and obfuscated lessons, so we got four trials on our compass. Four significant dealings that are as much punishment as test. Well that\u2019s no thing. We been through the worst tongue-looseners of Bol-Darac and saw our way through. As for putting us to the test? Every test is meant to be passed, otherwise they\u2019d call it a \u2018Fail\u2019.\nWe\u2019ll come through this, heads still on our necks. Skate our demons and dust this gauntlet to regain our place in the Drape. And once we\u2019re back, won\u2019t be no one that glances hard or talks soft about us for a good while. I know this in my bones, and I trust my Foxes. Overcoming is in our scroll.\nBut first I\u2019m to figure out what a \u2018grocery store\u2019 is, and how we can go about robbing one.\nA Fine Mess is what we like to call a \u2018chimeric hack\u2019. It borrows the Fate Point structure from the Coretex Plus Action system and adds it to the storytelling core from Blades in the Dark. There is also a bonkers weapon-creation mechanic of our own design. This alchemy has resulted in a standalone game system designed for boisterous campaigns that can just be an evening of fun, or last 2-4 sessions depending on your group\u2019s interest.\nIt is meant to be played with 3-5 players including the GM. Though it's possible to have more players, it can get a bit unwieldy.\nIf there were a one sentence description of A Fine Mess, it would be: Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Scott Pilgrim by way of D&D.\nIn the late 1800\u2019s, our world experienced the \u2018Intersection\u2019; a melding of our reality with another where magic was the dominant force, and elves, dwarves, faeries and many things that go \u2018bump\u2019 in the night were commonplace. Over the past 150 years, technology continued to advance alongside magical inquiry, leading to new and unexpected amalgamations. Technomancers, magical artificial intelligences and cyborgs powered by eldritch forces, to name a few.\nIn this new world, influential individuals or organizations often make use of small teams of specialized groups to perform \u2018extralegal\u2019 tasks. In the Drape -the largest city on the planet and a confluence of Ley Lines- these groups are known as Skulks, and their members are Foxes. In A Fine Mess, each player takes the role of a Fox, and all the Foxes at your table are part of a single Skulk that has failed to accurately complete one too many assignments. Your employer has decided a lesson in impulse control is required and has therefore provided a set of opportunities- grueling tasks to prove your worth and earn your way back on to the A-list..\nYour employer also happens to be a Ley Line Magus, and in a fit of pique has tossed your Skulk into an alternate reality to do these jobs.\nOur reality, in fact.\nYou are now a Fox with a magical ward that prevents the locals from noticing if you aren\u2019t Human, and your own considerable skills to see you through.  You will naturally run heists to acquire rare items from our reality, but you will also face Herculean efforts like getting licenses from the DMV, organizing an office party for Karen\u2019s retirement, waiting tables at a Denny\u2019s at 3am on a Saturday, or maybe even attending a wedding.\nSounds painful, right? Well, that was your Patron\u2019s point, really. Except, he didn\u2019t realize that by forcing your Skulk through a dimensional membrane, that membrane was weakened. Substantially.\nThis bleeding of reality manifests in two ways. First, you are able to influence the actual fabric of this world with your will. Sometimes it lets you turn ordinary objects into incredible weapons, and other times it allows you to solve problems by altering the problem itself, or even your own previous actions.\nThe second complication is that difficulties in this reality may evolve into much more dangerous obstacles or opponents simply by coming into contact with you.\nFor example, you may have a mission to find the perfect birthday gift for your boss. While you shop at this \u2018Target\u2019, which you wrongly assumed to be a weapons dealer, you encounter a screaming child throwing a tantrum on the floor. You opt to turn around and leave the aisle the way you came, but find you are blocked by a retiree in a mechanical shopping cart. You decide to ask her to move her cart aside so you can pass, but you fail the dice check, and are suddenly facing a slathering geriatric demon of Ur, and they only get meaner with age. You try to run the other direction, only to discover that the screaming child has become a Wailing Banshee Shogun Warrior with an escort of floating skull Otogi, and there is no option left other than to fight.\nYou turn to the shelf on your right, roll a few dice, burn a Weaving Point, and you now face your opponents with the Crystalline Shield of Cheerios and the Flaming Short Sword of Butterworth. You desperately hope your Skulk got the 911 text and are only a few aisles away, because things are looking grim...\n\nA Fine Mess will be a classic 8.5 x 5.5inch, saddle-stitched, B/W softcover. There will also be an optional companion Zine that will contain detailed descriptions of the Menagerie of Antagonists (MoA), their Lieutenants and Henchmen. The MoA have unique abilities, weaknesses and interests in you and your activities during your campaign, and you will create timers during play that convey their impending interaction with you. The variety of MoA and their 'flavors' necessitated a separate Zine because it exceeded the maximum size the saddle-stitching could handle.\nRest assured, everything you need to play is in the core A Fine Mess zine, including a selection of Antagonists not represented in the MoA companion. The companion Zine is meant to provide depth and  a constantly rotating set of opponents to keep your campaigns unique. Additionally, all of the custom Antagonists and Lieutenants that Handler and Magus level backers help create will be included in the companion Zine.\nLayout/Design is subject to change. This page is 25% gray in order to make it visible against the background\nAdditional elements you will find in the Zine:\n- A selection of major antagonists, their lieutenants and henchmen. All with unique attributes. You will start with an Arch Enemy faction, and, if you choose to play a campaign, your Skulk will acquire or placate more factions during or after each session. The various antagonists and complications will have a countdown to an encounter that stays in the play area, and you will have a limited ability to deal with these timers. This makes every session and campaign of A Fine Mess unique, with multiple narrative Swords of Damocles, hanging ominously or humorously over your Skulk.\n- A breakdown of weapon types and attributes that will allow you to turn any common object into a fearsome dealer of defense from harm, possibly even one that is Named. But you will just as often get a weapon with a weakness, like a Terrifying Sword of Baguette that is remarkably powerful, until it gets wet. And blood, well, is typically wet.\n- Several campaign structures that can be followed, as well as a list of scenarios, missions, obstacles and opponents that you can slot into your campaign, or use as fodder for your own creations.\nIf you are looking for a grit and steel role-playing game that lasts two years and takes your character to the edge of their capabilities and an arbitrary level cap\u2026you may need to keep looking. A Fine Mess is meant to be a raucous, laugh-filled night of absurd storytelling and skin-of-your-teeth successes. The systems are simple enough to be adapted for your own games, should you want to drop your players into an unlikely scenario, but complex enough to make this a fun diversion or a solid entry-level game.\nIf this Kickstarter is successful and there is interest, we may explore a zine that allows you to play in the origin reality from which you were banished in A Fine Mess.\n\nOur Stretch Goals are low-key, but become progressively more difficult to incorporate into the core game. This adds time to the production as well as pages to the physical copy, so we set the goal posts at levels that indicated a significant interest in this Kickstarter.\nTwo additional races and primary job classes will be added, bringing the total to 12.\n Two additional Main Antagonists will be added, bringing the total to 10.\nTen additional attributes in the Weapon Creation system, bringing the total to 30. \nThirteen Unique Weapons will be added to the game that have their own set of reality bending rules.\n\nAs we stated above, this work is based on the Blades In The Dark narrative RPG, which is used with permission. \nBlades in the Dark\u2122 is a trademark of One Seven Design. The Forged in the Dark Logo is \u00a9 One Seven Design, and is used with permission.\n\nThe PDF will be distributed through a download link provided by Dropbox.com\nThe physical copy of the game will go out through standard mail worldwide. Based on mailing address, there are three different shipping & handling costs that will be paid through the campaign manager: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so there will naturally be growing pains, which is precisely why we chose delivery in December, as we would rather delivery early than miss the deadline.\n\nWe have selected Smartpress for production since they were used by several successful Zines last year and their reputation was solid.\n\nNaturally, we can't possibly foresee all production difficulties, but if things go too far sideways, we will do everything in our power to get you at least the PDF versions before the delivery deadline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "A Brown\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nTabletop Gaming EnthusiastSee more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Kit", "descp": "PDF Copy of A Fine Mess and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Kit & Kaboodle", "descp": "Receive a PDF of both A Fine Mess and the Antagonist companion Zine\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of A Fine Mess\nPDF Copy of Antagonist companion Zine", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Fox", "descp": "Physical Copy of A Fine Mess, the PDF and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical Copy + PDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Skulk", "descp": "In addition to all Fox level rewards, you will also receive a copy of the Antagonist companion Zine.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of A Fine Mess\nPhysical Copy of the Antagonist companion Zine\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Handler", "descp": "Your name (or a name you provide) will be immortalized as a unique lieutenant in one of the antagonist groups.

Players form a Crew and attempt to survive among clunky technology and quirky denizens of a megalithic Hotel.\nYou enter the Hotel. You were not looking for adventure, just a brief escape from the limbo of daily life. The Hotel seems to have other plans.\nUsing a streamlined rules system featuring regular six sided dice, Dead Halt is a complete setting for cyberpunk-esque roleplaying. It was designed to be extremely quick to learn, easy to play, and narrative driving. It is a perfect game for one shots as well as for developing long term campaigns. Characters are created during play, and Game Masters can run it with little to no preparation.\nDead Halt is a passion project that I began a few years back. I was in search of a Roleplaying game that allowed anyone to sit down and play at the drop of a hat. After a more than successful ZineQuest 1, Dead Halt needs more content! Happy New Year 1999 is our answer, This 5.5 x 8.5 in Zine will contain:\nFIVE New Adventure Arcs\nEach one is a four page story arc, just like those in the Dead Halt User's Guide. These get a session off the ground instantly by inciting Job, a few key items, characters, and a simple premise or quest to launch players into the Hotel without any delay.\nEach Adventure Arc in Happy New Year 1999 will cover one quarter of the year leading up to Y2K, where Crews will encounter everything from email viruses to cryogenically frozen undead.\n HAPPY99 - A mysterious self replicating email virus containing nothing but a small fireworks simulation accidentally brings the sentience protocols from standard Consoles to unconscious robots, the Nearly-Autonomous Automatons. \n Return of Keldon - Funding for cryogenics in the Hotel finally takes off when deep below the surface an ancient clan of armored warriors is discovered frozen into the bedrock. With these knights returned from the dead, what else may resurface? \n It\u2019s FORTRA\u2019s World - As fear of the Millennium Bug sweeps through the Hotel, the final date for Consoles is on the horizon. Can the Crew find the Hotel's long lost central cortex FORTRA in time, and what must they do to prevent it's corruption? \n Stack Overflow - On the dawn of Year 2000 the Hotel tries to drag itself out of the inevitable catastrophe that has befallen it. Where does the Crew stand? \n Advent of Aphelion - A new era is on the horizon, is there any place for the Hotel? \nNew Character Origins\nThese Origin options will give you new abilities and backgrounds for when your first character inevitably becomes a Clunkhead and you have to create another. The first two are Undead and Nearly-Autonomous Automatons (NOT-O's)!

New Item lists have also been posted in the Downloads section!\nDead Halt includes everything from:\nHorror elements with breaks of light hearted humor.\nDiscussions of the change of ones personal identity through body modification.\nExistential dread under the rule of an unhinged super computer.\nA robot-slaying bird-headed business man and his sarcastic cat.\nClunkPunk is our word for it: CyberPunk motifs jammed into the aesthetic and unreliability of 1980's technology. \nSetting aside, the Dead Halt game system was created specifically to;\nBegin play within an hour of picking up the Zine.\nHave no session zero, jump right in and create characters in game.\nBring in players brand new to Roleplaying Games.\nThis 44 page Zine is a quick read and packed full of content bound by simple to learn rules that allow for incredible stories to emerge without any difficulty. No clunky game mechanics or exhausting text. This in no way means Dead Halt is simple, just efficient.\nIf you enjoy games like Paranoia, Tales from the Loop, Mutant Year Zero, Gamma World, ZORK, or quirky settings with a bit of terror, I encourage you to try out Dead Halt; I think you just might like it. \nMost rewards are a combination of the new Happy New Year 1999 module and the reprint of the Dead Halt User's Guide (The base game for Dead Halt). So onto the Floppy Disks. The Floppy Disks have one adventure on each disk. If you only get one disk for \"FORTRA Forgotten\" this is the new adventure arc. If you get both Floppy Disks you will receive both the original \"Fate of FORTRA\" adventure from our first Kickstarter and the new adventure\"FORTRA Forgotten\".\nYou found out the fate of the Hotel's defunct super computer; FortRA, and now continue the journey with FORTRA Forgotten.\nYeah, its a 3.5 in Floppy disk, probably owned by someone else but I promise I will delete their old MS Paint scribbles or Taxes and such.\nOn the disk will be a PDF Adventure for DEAD HALT. Fate of FORTRA ended up being 18 pages long, has illustrations, game changing rules, and multiple outcomes. If you go through the trouble of buying this outdated media, all I can do is reward you.\nThese Adventures will only ever be released on Floppy Disks, and I will not publish it anywhere else. There will be no link, no download, no print out, just a Floppy Disk. The only way to get this adventure from me will be on this terribly outdated disk.\nWhy? Because at this point I find it incredibly wonderful that people thought this was as delightful as I do. Get a floppy disk, wonder whats on it, break out your old Mac G3 and check it out.\nAny extra funding we gain above our goal will go straight into more pages, art, oddities, and content for the book, as can be seen in our Stretch Goals below!

Instead, it creates unique portraits from professionally hand-illustrated weapons, armor, gear, clothing, and facial features. All of those elements can be selected and combined across nearly all of the artwork, including artwork from the stretch goals.\nAs a result, you can make millions of portraits without seeing the same one twice.\nThe simple interface is fun and easy to use. Select your character\u2019s traits (age, gender, race, class, and beauty), and then multiple portraits appear. Pick one you like as a starting point, and fine-tune it until it matches your vision of your character.\n You can make a beautiful portrait on a phone or tablet, then export the image for a range of uses. If you back this Kickstarter at the Publisher level, you can even publish the portraits you create in your own books and games.\nMark a portrait as a favorite, and come back later to update it with new outfits or gear. Keep multiple versions to show how your character looks in town, on adventure, or in disguise. You can make as many portraits as you want; there is no additional cost for each one.\nA rogue in standard gear; in disguise as an alchemist; in prison after the plan goes awry\nYou can even export portraits directly into World Anvil \u2014 one of the world\u2019s best campaign management tools \u2014 to add more personality to your character or your campaign.\nPortrait Workshop isn\u2019t just a cool idea; we\u2019ve actually built it.

Everything in this \"What Can You Draw?\" section is included in the Basic reward.\nRaces & Ethnicities\nWith the Basic reward, you'll be able to make portraits of dwarves, elves, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, humans, orcs, and half-orcs.\nWith the Advanced reward, you'll be able to make dozens of additional races. See the table at the bottom of this page for one list, but you can also combine elements to make even more. \nThere is only one human race, but it contains a wonderful diversity of ethnicities and cultures. Portrait Workshop includes Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, English, Germanic, Greek, Latino, Malinke, Mongol, Persian, Roman, and Viking elements. \nYou can change the coloring on nearly everything in Portrait Studio, including people. For example, your elves can be fair, blue-skinned, dark-skinned, or any other color.\nClasses\nPortrait Workshop covers the classic classes (barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard) as well as a range of NPCs (commoner, royalty, merchant, and more). You can also create characters that go beyond the typical archetypes...

Advanced backers will get a whole lot more gear, now that every stretch goal is unlocked.\nSome of the gear included in the Basic reward\nClothing\nYou can dress your characters in a wardrobe of over three dozen garments suitable for a wide range of adventurers and NPCs. You can layer up to five items of clothing to create a variety of different looks.\nEach garment can be colored in many ways. By default, Portrait Workshop applies one of our professionally designed, color-coordinated palettes. You can change palettes with a single click, or with the Masterwork Tools (included in the Advanced reward), you can select every color individually.\nBodies\nPeople come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Portrait Workshop covers a range, from fantasy archetypes to more \u201ceveryday\u201d body shapes.\nAges\nNot all adventurers are in their twenties. You can use Portrait Workshop to show older characters as well.\nHair\nAll backers get over three dozen hairstyles, as well as facial hair and stubble. Advanced backers will get even more, now that the Hairstyles stretch goal is unlocked.\nWe want to give the gaming community the best tool ever for creating character portraits.\nWe have already built alpha versions of the iOS and Android apps, have worked out the technical, artistic, and product design details, and have commissioned enough artwork to validate the approach. Now it\u2019s up to you to help make it a reality by backing this Kickstarter so that we can complete the remaining artwork.\nPlus, this project funds talented artists doing a whole lot of great work \u2014 a cause we can all get behind!\nOur backers have unlocked every single stretch goal below; the Advanced reward now contains every one of these. Thanks for helping us make Portrait Workshop so much bigger!\nThe stretch goals are not simple, stand-alone \u201cpaper dolls\u201d. You can combine artwork between them and the basic art in nearly unlimited ways. \nThese portraits intermix pieces from some of the unlocked stretch goals\nWhile Portrait Workshop is not part of, or specific to, a single game system, below is an idea of how you could use it to draw illustrations for characters of most of the playable races from D&D. You can also combine different elements to invent your own races.\nOur target timeline is:\nFeb 2020 - Kickstarter completes\nMay 2020 - All backers receive the Beta version of Portrait Workshop with Basic features and artwork\nJuly 2020 - Advanced backers receive the beta version of the Masterwork Tools, Frame Shop, and at least two Stretch Goals if funded (the remainder will be released as completed, likely over several months)\nAugust 2020 - All backers receive the final version of Portrait Workshop.\nAfter our backers have the final app, we\u2019ll release Portrait Workshop to the public as a free app with Basic controls and limited artwork. The free app will include a fraction of the outfits, hairstyles, and facial features that our Basic backers receive, with only humans and none of the Stretch Goal content. Additional artwork and features will be available via in-app purchase.\nBy backing this Kickstarter, you are getting significant savings from the cost of the same features and artwork when the app goes public. \nWe will accept pre-orders for the app at some point after the Kickstarter ends. Those will have higher pricing than the special backer pricing here, and will not include the exclusive Curiosities of Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nArtwork: We have completed the artistic design including formal art style guide, templates, and references. We\u2019ve assembled a team of talented artists who have contributed to what you see on this page.

But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn. Almost all of the countries in this region border an inland sea, known as Merala.\n\nThe Free City of Arbor\nWe are extremely proud to be partnering with some of the most talented companies, writers, and artists in the business. \nAuthors\nEd Greenwood is a Canadian worldbuilder, writer, game designer,  and librarian who creates imaginary worlds; his best known one is the  Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting, which he began creating when he was  six years old, and is still expanding  and enriching more than fifty years later.

The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us!

I almost didn't run this crowdfunding on this platform because of the anti-union stance of Kickstarter leadership. I'm the son of a unionized worker and I like things like 40 hour work weeks, vacation time, paid sick time, week-ends, lunch, and safe working conditions. I'm also a technology professional and it's well past time for the workers in our industry to advocate for themselves in organized ways. When many companies call themselves tech companies that happen to \"x\", its workers are part of that change in visualization. We too must change our view of technology professions. As we become ubiquitous, obligatory, and integral to corporate success, we will be increasingly considered interchangeable and expendable (it's already happening if you haven't noticed). Unions are there to protect the worker and protections we will soon need. I stand in solidarity with KSRU. I call on Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership to recognize the union now, and I hope you\u2019ll join me. How you can help.\n#RecognizeKSRU\n Thanks for listening. Back to the regularly scheduled crowdfunding plea.\nThe House of the Red Doors\n\"Generations ago the House of the Red Doors visited your village. Now, so many years hence, could it be passing this way again? As the story goes its mistress, Jassafae, still untouched by time\u2019s ravages, is an instrument of Ullhume, a powerful being of unknown origin. Through her fates are altered and wishes granted, but only to those brave enough to cross her threshold. You toil ceaselessly and suffer much and to what end? Unrequited dreams and the hope of an early grave? You resolve to enter and change your destiny.\"\nThe House of the Red Doors is a Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG funnel that can be used for tournament play or it can level up a peasant for campaign play. It is one player adventure that requires a Judge. \nIn most Table Top RPG adventures there is a group dynamic. This adventure, is more intimate, like visiting a psychic or a gypsy. In fact, the beginning of Ultima IV was an inspiration for this adventure. The House of the Red Doors also presents the interesting dynamic of a player solving puzzles alone. \nThis version of the adventure will come with instructions to run as a tournament and for character development. It is short in duration (about 20 mins) and can be replayed several times if necessary (it's usually necessary).  \nCan you survive The House of the Red Doors?\nThis funnel has gone through extensive alpha and beta testing as both a tournament and for character creation. A 3-day tournament was ran at GenCon this year. Feedback has been very positive. I think the best quote over the testing was, \"It's got that Appendix N, trippy vibe.\"\nGen Con 2019 House of the Red Doors Tournament\nThe adventure is also edited and layout is nearly finished. 95% of the art has been completed. I expect to be able to send codes for the PDF without stretch goals soon after this Kickstarter concludes - a perfect X-mas adventure. It's is as done as you'll ever see in a Kickstarter.\nWhat You'll Get:\nA table top RPG adventure funnel for one 0-Level peasant to try their luck\nProduct dimensions: 8.5\" x 11\"\nPages: ~30\nColors: Color cover, B/W inside\nArt: YES! by  Stefan Poag \nHeavy paper for print backers: 100# cover, 80# interior\nLimited edition, hand numbered for print backers\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nSo, it's time to produce this adventure for the masses. Print on Demand has been a godsend for the hobby (and me), but I feel it's time to start printing copies and exploring other distribution channels (like the Friendly Local Gaming Store, online stores, etc). That's where you come in.\nThis kickstarter will pay for the last few art commissions and print up a limited number of high quality books. If you backed Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion, you have good idea of what that quality means. I'll be hand numbering copies and once they are gone they are gone. The House of the Red Doors will be released in association with Donn Stroud and Psychoda Press. Stefan Poag has supplied the art and is working on the cover as I finish this. Doug Kovacs is on standby for a drop table to be used for creating the PC's backstory. If we get close to the TROIKA! version of The House of the Red Doors, I hope to set-up itch.io bundle with the TROIKA! Numinous Edition fantasy RPG rulebook.\nStretch Goals\n ACHIEVED! $2,500 Tournament Extras: We'll produce a full set of illustrated handouts to facilitate running the adventure at gaming convention.\n ACHIEVED! $3,500 Drop Table: A spiffy drop table (illustrated by Doug Kovacs) for determining why peasants enter the House of the Red Doors.\n ACHIEVED! $4,000 TROKIA! Edition: We'll produce a PDF only version of the adventure for the TROKIA! RPG, the other world's favorite fantasy RPG.\n ACHIEVED!  $5,500 Mini Booklet Player's Handout:  A one page, fold & cut, mini booklet handout. Featuring mini maps and vistas not yet illustrated in the adventure. \nThanks for your consideration. \nWhere doth yon door lead?\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Mechanically, DCC is based on the world\u2019s most popular RPG, but the rules have been reforged\u2014streamlined in some places, expanded in others, and injected with a wild and exciting imagination throughout.  The fantastical imagery and fast playstyle are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old. You\u2019ll find the influences of Leiber, Moorcock, Howard, Vance, Brackett, and more throughout Dungeon Crawl Classics.\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\nAbout the Author\nI'm a OSR gaming hobbyist living in Michigan who loves to write stuff. You can see some of my other work (Angels, Daemons & Beings Between Volume 2: Elfland Edition, Fae Hard) on DrivethruRPG and Goodman Games. Free stuff in Sanctum Secorum and Gongfarmer's Almanac. Get a marvelous heavy paper copy of The Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion from Psychoda Press or Goodman Games. You can tweet at me @lectrotext.\nAbout the Artists\nStefan Poag: Lives and works in Michigan with his significant other (Annie) and two dogs.  His illustration work has appeared in the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many, many DCC RPG modules from Goodman Games. He can be found at  https://stefanpoag.com and tweets @sbpoag.\nDoug Kovacs: If there\u2019s one artist who has helped define \u201cthe DCC experience\u201d, it\u2019s Doug. His cover art for the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many adventure modules have helped set a tone of adventure, mystery, and the fantastic that reaches throughout the line. And his black-and-white art inside the DCC core book and its many adventures have defined the game\u2019s look\u2014not to mention his awesome maps.

It is, in short, a setting book inspired by the works of legendary Golden Age comic book artist Fletcher Hanks, using the popular Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) rules system. It\u2019s like a Flash Gordon fever dream.\nIn 2011 we (Leighton Connor and Josh Burnett) were inspired by a short Fletcher Hanks story in which the hero Space Smith encountered the terrifying Leopard Women of Venus. We asked ourselves questions like, \u201cWhy are there Leopard Women on Venus?\u201d and \u201cWho else lives on Venus?\" From that we developed our setting, a grotesque alien world seething with malice and filled with exotic locales, bizarre cultures, and murderous monsters. We wrote the original version of Leopard Women of Venus for Hex Games, using the QAGS system.  \nThe Fletcher Hanks page that inspired it all!\nYears later, we realized that our feverish nightmare Venus would be a perfect match for Dungeon Crawl Classics. Like DCC, Leopard Women of Venus is heavily inspired by pulp fiction and foundational fantasy authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs; committed to instilling a mixture of awe, wonder, and horror; and extremely dangerous for Player Characters.\nWe got to work and converted the setting to DCC, adding in new character classes, spells, patrons, and monsters. We also saw plenty of opportunities to tweak and improve--we have expanded and updated everything, including the history of Venus and the relationships among the factions. We have also added a new organization, the Humanoid Coalition, that makes it easier to assemble a PC party.\nEverything people loved from the original version is still here, polished and improved and adapted to our favorite fantasy role-playing adventure game. But now you\u2019ll also find:\nThe Leopard Woman class and their powerful augments\nClear guidelines for how DCC character classes function on Venus\nTwo patrons, Stardust the Super-Wizard and Fantomah, complete with spells\nA list of 100 Venusian occupations useful for creating 0-level characters\nA 0-level funnel, \u201cSaucerful of Secrets\u201d\nA 1st-level adventure, \u201cThe Mines of the Moglugs\u201d\nFantastical sci-fi gear and equipment\nRandom tables to generate countless springboards for adventure\nThe Magnificent Moglug Maker\nAnd much more!\nThe exciting new material in Leopard Women of Venus is usable whether you\u2019re running a game in the savage jungles of Venus or plugging it into your own campaigns!\nWant to see more? We put together a free preview zine that will give you a big juicy taste of LWoV. CHECK IT OUT HERE!\nFormat\nThe book will be released on DrivethruRPG digitally and via print-on-demand.  It will be a 7 x 10\" graphic novel-sized softcover, coming in around 175 pages.\nPlease note that we are not shipping the POD books.  The costs associated with shipping are determined by DriveThruRPG.\nThe Setting\nFrom a distance, Venus is a beautiful blue orb suspended in the inky void. But up close, Venus is a tropical hell-planet, its ecosystem mutated in grotesque and deadly fashion by the mysterious Compound-N. From the Quivering Blood Gnats to the Hideous Spider Priests, from the acid-dripping Venusian Fly-Traps to the carnivorous mushrooms, every living thing is bent on destroying human life.\nDespite the odds, four human factions continue to survive on Venus. In addition to fending off the endlessly lethal flora and fauna, they must also keep watch for invaders from other worlds--Earth, Mars, and Bloodu--and the constant threat of betrayal by the other factions. \nEven the Leopard Women of Venus, with their flying saurians and comet-fire helmets, are hard pressed to defend against these threats. Human civilization exists on Venus now--but for how much longer? That\u2019s for you and your gaming group to decide.\nThe Factions\nHuman civilization of Venus has splintered into four different factions. All are troubled, but the PCs have the chance to make things better.\n Otram: The largest settlement on Venus, Otram is a fortress city ruled by a ruthless prophet-king. The people of Otram only value strength, glory, and powerful weapons.\n The Caverns: Ruled by the unfeeling Science Robots, the people of the caverns have access to amazing technology but little personal freedom. They are defended by the planet\u2019s mightiest warriors, the Leopard Women of Venus.\n Palna: Superstitious scientists and apocalyptic theologians, the people of the mountain-city of Palna pray for the legendary super-wizard Stardust to rain his judgement down upon Venus.\n Avrok: The people of Avrok live in loose tribes deep in the hellish jungles. They are hedonistic pseudo-shamans in a distressing relationship with Venus\u2019s giant snakes.\n The Humanoid Coalition: Founded by gonzo cartoon-journalist and lunatic prophet Forecastle J. MacBeth, the Humanoid Coalition is a cross-factional organization dedicated to preserving humanity on Venus and countering the coming apocalypse foreseen in MacBeth\u2019s dreams.\nWho Was Fletcher Hanks?\nFletcher Hanks produced bizarre stories in the earliest days of American comics. His work is boldly drawn, frequently ugly, and strangely compelling. Hanks only worked in comics from 1939 to 1941, but during this short time he created Stardust the Super Wizard, a terrifying superman from the stars; Space Smith, an outer space adventurer; Big Red, a lumberjack; Fantomah, the first super-powered comic book heroine; and more.\nFletcher Hanks died in obscurity, but he left behind some fascinating comic books. The original comics--issues of Fantastic, Fight, Jungle, and Planet--are extremely rare and require quite a bit of time and money to track down. Fortunately, stories by Hanks are available on the Internet, and in high-quality reprint collections such as Turn Loose Our Death Rays and Kill Them All!: The Complete Works of Fletcher Hanks, edited by Paul Karasik and published by Fantagraphics.\n\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games.

We have been writing games for decades and are two of the co-creators of the ENnie Award-winning game Hobomancer. Josh wrote the ENnie Award-winning Hobomancer Companion and recently wrote and illustrated the OSR zines Crepuscular and Draugr & Draculas. Leighton is also the co-creator of the web comic The Electric Team and the author of the Ross Fulton, Occult Detective series of stories.\nWe have both done illustration work for a variety of projects, including the original Leopard Women of Venus, and we will be contributing artwork to the book. We\u2019ve got experience and we\u2019ll do some good stuff. But we don\u2019t want this book to just be good, we want it to be PHENOMENAL. That\u2019s why the money we raise will go toward hiring additional artists. And the artists we\u2019ve lined up . . . seriously, these artists are great. The book will be lavishly illustrated, with luscious, mind-blowing drawings by some of the finest illustrators working today: \nErol Otus!\nMatt Kish!\nBradley K. McDevitt!\nEvlyn Moreau!\nDiogo Nogueira!\nJuan Navarro!\nJames V. West!\nThose are just the beginning.

West\nThe toxic jungle by Evlyn Moreau\nThe streets of Otram by Juan Navarro\nA map of Venus, by Joshua LH Burnett\nWe are committed to producing a beautiful, high-quality book that is free from any distracting errors. Your Kickstarter dollars will also allow us to hire experienced editors to help us polish the text and deliver the best book we can.

The illustrations are either drawn or underway. The editors are lined up. We are ready to do this thing! Josh recently ran a successful Kickstarter for his Draugr & Draculas zine, and from that experience he developed skills we will use to run this project efficiently.\n\nOne way that we are limiting the risks of this campaign is by using DriveThruRPG for fulfillment. Since your book will be printed by DriveThru when you order it, and shipped through DriveThru, we will not have to fulfill the orders ourselves, which will cut out a whole range of potential problems and make things easier for our international backers. \n\nWhile we are sure there will be challenges along the way, we believe we are ready to handle them and get you your book in a timely manner.

This campaign aims however to set a world record and produce the Worlds Largest Digital, Modular, Dungeon Tile series with 144 beautiful unique sets, each with a massive 144 tile designs.  That was at least, until it funded, and today, I doubled the ambition with an attempt at 288 individual tile sets. Shown below are 240 of them...\nWant a closer look? Kickstarter compresses images but you can download a larger viewing selection from here: SOLOMAN TEMPLE SQUARES SET SELECTION\n This graphic 'THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMAN' will later feature checkable boxes and be available as a digital poster to allow backers to mark off which sets they have - and which sets they might still want to buy later on. \nA Story in the Bible relates that \"Solomon's Temple\" was a fabled architectural marvel built by King Solomon in ancient times to house the Ark of the Covenant. But his legendary deed became enmeshed in a variety of occult grimoires (magical books) and babylonian demonology with intriguing names as such as the 'Lesser Key of Solomon' and the famous 'Legemeton'. It is books like these that popularized ceremonial magic widely and the practices associated with it can also be seen in RPG which has borrowed a great deal of lore from occult sources - including the concept of sorcery, magic seals, signs, protective rings, magic squares, planes, demonic hierarchies, talismans against evil, invocations, curses, circles to summon or enclose demons and so on.  Some tellings of this legend claim Solomons building method enlisted the aid of 72 Demons by means of a magical ring emblazoned with a golden pentagram entrusted to him by the archangel Michael to complete the task of building the Temple.  Whether true or not - I have been fascinated with such stories since I was a boy and the idea of an architect calling down/up Demons/Angels to help in the construction of a Temple is a very cool mythology. In homage I created 72 tile sets for modern day RPG architects, loosely one for each of Solomons supposed demons if you like - and I would like to create 72 more for a grand total of 144. The name of the tile set is also a play on words via 'Solo-man' i.e. someone. an architect, that builds alone. The name is also influenced by the numerological magic square formulae of the occult that I found similar in nature to the different layouts of the tile designs in an 8x8 grid. Finally, I wanted to capture the imagination with a tile set so large to build our 'dungeons/temples' with - it might seem I too had enlisted the help of demons :) And so we have, Soloman Temple Squares. Pledge $45 or more within the first 72 hours and you'll get a free 18 Room Sorcerers Pack (viewable down below) that further pays tribute to these occult/magical connections.\nWith a project name based on this legendary architect - Let's quickly look at some magic numbers to understand how I believe this would be the largest modular dungeon tile set in the world.\n[EDIT: - and now it is twice the size]\n 144 Tile Sets each with 144 Tile-Designs for a total of 20736 Modular Tiles. \nEvery tile is 8x8 with a total of 64 squares. \n Every set of one-hundred and forty-four 8x8 tiles has the equivalent of 9216 individual squares. \n If every individual square is 5x5 ft, every tile represents 40x40 square ft and a total of 1,600 square feet per tile. \n 1,600 sq ft per tile x 144 tiles equates to 230,400 square feet PER SET.  \n 230,400 sq ft x 144 gives Soloman Temple Squares a mind-staggering total area of 33,177,600 SQUARE FEET - (to put this into perspective, the area measures approximately 3 square kilometers, 33 football fields, or the landmass of Coral Sea island.)\n [EDIT: - double these figures]\nBACKERS Can Choose from THREE Tileset Dimensions: - but by DEFAULT your pledge will give you access to all THREE!\n (1) 4FG - sized at 900x900px (50 pixels per square) in 72 DPI for Fantasy Grounds. When the upcoming FGU sizes are known, I will re-supply tiles of that size to backers who use the software. As tiled maps cannot be easily built within the current FG format, it is likely users will assemble maps using an external program such as GIMP or Photoshop, wherein they can resize the map to < 2000x2000px or less with  72DPI jpeg (though I recommend 1350x900) and import the map to FG that way.\n(2) 4Roll20 - sized at 1120x1120px (140 pixels per square) sets in 72 DPI for Roll20 \n(3) 4print - sized at 2400x2400 (8x8\" or 300 pixels per square) in 300 DPI (optimal for printing)\nHERE ARE THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT TILE DESIGNS THAT WILL COME WITH EACH SET:\nHere are some examples of the artwork used in the tiles:  with a mix of Fantasy, Sci-fi, Textured and Non-Textured Tile Sets.\nATLANTIS\nGROTTO\nPUPPY\nFORGE\nCIPHER\nLIGHT BLUE AND WHITE\nFEN\nDUNGEON\nCORPSE\nGLOBE\nISLAND\nJOKER\nPEAT\nSALVAGE\nBROWN and WHITE HATCH\n\nBelow are some samples from additional sets: properly pre-sized and formatted to suit such Virtual Table Top programs as Fantasy Grounds and Roll 20.  You can see how it would be easy to transition from a Temple for instance, to an Ocean Or to alternate different themed-rooms within a single or multiple dungeons - i.e Undermountain and keep your variety of terrain infinitely interesting.\nI have added a HUGE variety of commonly required colour themes including stone, bone, blood, dirt, sand, water, lava, various water depths, and an insane amount more.\n Want a closer look?

This first Stretch Goal will give you 25 Shadow-Based PNG tokens to overlay and alter the appearance, depth and height of your tilesets!\nPLEDGE $45 AUD or more within the First 72 Hours of Campaign Launch to get a Bonus 18-Room Sorcerers Pack! And if we make it to 144 Backers, I'll unlock another special reward.\nMissed out on the time frame? Add this reward to your pledge by adding $18 AUD.\n Just Message me with the Twelve Sets you want and your username and I will make sure you get them when rewards go out.\nWhy back Me? If you haven't backed me before here are some reasons why you might consider backing me and what I do:\n LOW/NO RISK: If funded this will be my 16th successful Kickstarter. I am extremely hard-working and specialize in completing huge digital map/tile projects and have previously delivered all successful projects to promise with no issues and 100% backer satisfaction - you can check the Risks section for a breakdown of previous campaigns.\n VERSATILITY: With a possible 288 unique designs Soloman Temple Squares explodes your options in an unprecedented manner giving you a vast range of tools to suit almost any dungeon tile construction job.\n INTERCHANGEABLE: Every set uses 8x8\" tiles sized for a particular format that will neatly line up with one another for epic-sized dungeons with different areas.\n RANGE: The range includes classic designs, demonic, elemental, undersea, underdark, dimensional, and over 280 different colour combinations to give you every chance of finding the right set for the right job.\n COMPLETION: I have already completed and/or drafted half of the core designs.\n SAVINGS: Soloman Temple Square sets will retail at $5 USD per set. By backing my Kickstarter you pledge in AUD and gain generous saving with a base cost of $3 AUD per set, with costs greatly lowered further for buying in bulk. You also don't have to wait for tiles to be processed and made available from my website to the general public which can take months or even longer.\n UNIQUENESS: It's true there are a lot of modular dungeon tile sets - but no-one has ever attempted one on this gigantic ambitious scale - and I am just the man to do it.\n DILIGENCE: This is not my first campaign - nor my first campaign making a huge amount of tiles - with at least 3 of those behind me, I know what it takes, how long it takes and I strive to deliver an excellent end product on or before time that keeps my backers coming back for more.\n EVOLUTION: Soloman Temple Squares started with just 26 varieties - now I am offering 144. [Edit: And NOW, 288] \n SOLUTION: If you like the artwork, then you can rest assured you won't have to hunt too hard for tiles that match it - with this set of building blocks you can enjoy virtually endless dungeon constructions in the same art style.\n ASSURED DELIVERY: Based on my rate of work and previous experience I am estimating full delivery of all digital rewards by December 2019. I work very hard to complete my art before the stated deadline and get art out to backers as soon as I can - without compromising quality. To date I've not failed to deliver before or on a deadline. \n TRANSPARENCY: You'll always know where I am up to with the project with regular updates and rapid comprehensive communication/replies to any issues that may arise or questions you may have. I strive to keep my backers very well informed of the good (or the bad) and even provide post-campaign support and convenience by installing a campaign graphic that shows which stage of the process I am up to at a visual glimpse, give estimated times for processes, and provide multiple ways to contact me privately or publicly at any time.\n EXCELLENCE: If something isn't right, if something goes wrong, I do my absolute best to fix it quickly and definitively once I spot it or it is brought to my attention during or after my campaigns. I want my backers to have the best tools for their RPG and continually look for ways to improve my products and service.\n REALIZATION: As you can see I am committed to continuing my various Ranges so my users have new and exciting products on a semi-regular basis. Getting to this point wouldn't have been possible without all of the support I have gotten for my art so thank you all very much!\n VTT FUNCTION: Ideal for Virtual Table Top Gaming in at least two popular VTT systems, from both of which I am familiar and a licensed seller of maps and tokens - and my tiles are easy to use in many other generic systems besides.\n RELIABILITY: I always deliver the goods to promise and my record reflects that.\n EXPANSION: Click here to view my website page and other projects including the currently available 900+ Modular Terrain Maps I created called 'Meanders: Synchable Terrain\" that these will also work with: https://gametilewarehouse.wixsite.com/rpgtilesupply\n REPUTATION: My creations currently retail from Fantasy Grounds, Steam, D20 Pro, Roll20 and my own website, Game Tile Warehouse. They are also used by numerous Streamers, Gamers, Savage Mojo and various indie-developers.\n CONTINUATION: I am dedicated to expanding these tiles indefinitely, even with 144 sets I will have only scratched the surface of what is possible, already I am dreaming of far more advanced sets so hopefully I can get the support I need to continue my creative frenzies.\nGAME TILE WAREHOUSE is my website where you can view and purchase other products successfully kickstarted - and get news of new upcoming ambitious projects.\nDid you know? : MEANDERS: SYNCHABLE TERRAIN - my modular battlemap series now with almost 1000  x 27x18\"maps claims to be the worlds largest modular terrain map set. If every square is 5ft, Meanders Maps each measure 135x90ft or a whopping 12,150 sq ft. Currently at about 950 maps when I reach 1000 this will equate to 12,150,000 sq ft of digital modular terrain.\nThank you for taking the time to view my project,\nKind Regards,\nKris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is now familiar territory with little to no risk and I will be working right throughout the campaign and after it to finish any remainder as efficiently as possible.\n\nCreated Art is backed up on Google Drive immediately after it is finalized as well as on two other hard-drives so it cannot suffer loss. Short of personal injury or loss of my equipment nothing in my power will prevent this kickstarter from being completed on time.\n\nI have funded and delivered to promise a dozen giant digital kickstarters in my career and ahead of time as a creator with no issues - Everything will be ready to be delivered in full. I am a professional, dedicated to delivering on time and to promise and this campaign will be no exception.

Obediah Felkner, a prominent resident and claim owner of a nearby quicksilver mine, has recently passed away from a mysterious illness. Surprisingly, a group of complete strangers have been named as his beneficiaries. The claim to Felkner\u2019s mine could become theirs.\nHowever, Felkner\u2019s last will contains a peculiar condition: in order to claim the deed to the mine, the party must collect a holy relic known as the Hand of San Roque and deliver it to Felkner\u2019s grieving widow before dawn. The artifact is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the old Mission San Roque, abandoned by the Spanish almost 40 years ago.\nAnd should they refuse? The lawyer points out they, too, have contracted the same disease that claimed the life of Mr. Felkner, and the retrieval of the relic is their only hope if they wish to survive the mysterious deadly affliction.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner - Standard Cover (FRK Pyron)\nSummary\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner is a horror-themed western adventure designed for 4-to-6 1st-level characters. This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The adventure contains pre-generated western-themed DCC RPG characters, so no additional supplements are required. That said, it has been playtested with both David Baity's upcoming Dark Trails RPG and Stormlord Publishing's Black Powder, Black Magic DCC supplement with delightful results. There is an appendix \u201cRunning this adventure with Dark Trails\u201d providing the judge ideas on how to fully leverage the Dark Trails ruleset with this adventure.\nThis full-length, standalone adventure will be between 24 to 28 pages in length. The adventure is completely written, edited, and thoroughly playtested. It currently contains art from some of your favorite DCC RPG artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson. The adventure will be released as an 8.5 x 11 booklet with color cover and black and white interior pages.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! A limited-edition alternate foil-cover will be released and made available for sale only to Kickstarter backers. For an example of the foil cover, check out the one released for Children of the Fallen Sun.\nAnd finally, you will have the option to receive a  Dark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF discount code! See below for details.\nSpoiler Details\nThe adventure is loaded with goodies. Filthy spoilers ahead so if you\u2019re planning on enjoying this adventure as a player you may want to skip to the next section.\nOnly judges here? OK, here\u2019s what goodies you\u2019ll get in the adventure:\nThe bulk of the adventure takes place in a fictional California Mission. Despite being a western, like many of my adventures there\u2019s a strong horror theme where the players will eventually discover there\u2019s a mystery going on at the old Spanish Mission and not everything is quite what it seems\u2026\nThe adventure has approximately 12 keyed encounters, as well as starting and ending events.\nA full-page black and white mission map illustrated by Stefan Poag.\nThe appendix includes descriptions of 3 new magic items (including the artifact The Hand of San Roque), at least 3 illustrated player handouts, and 10 pre-generated 1st-level PCs which can be used as-is or as examples on how to modify a standard DCC class into a western-themed PC.\nStefan Poag illustrates why PCs should be careful when poking around haunted grave yards\nProject Status\nThe project has already reached the following milestones:\nWriting of the adventure is complete, the core adventure has been edited, and the adventure has been playtested by multiple judges at several conventions.\nCover art and most of the interior illustrations are complete.\nA deliciously illustrated map by Stefan Poag is complete.\nThe art for the foil cover by FRK Pyron is complete.\nAmazing new interior illustrations from some of your favorite artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson.\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to fund the printing of the adventures, and potentially include 2-3 additional pieces of art.\nLimited Edition Foil Cover (FRK Pyron)\nStretch Goals\nGiven that the adventure is almost entirely complete, I will be keeping the stretch goals modest, as I\u2019d like to get the adventure in your hands as soon as possible. Still, I wanted to offer a little something as a thank you to Kickstarter backers.\nAt $3000: Stickers for print backers! Each print copy of the adventure will include  two 3\"x3\u201d stickers: one of the Thick Skull Adventures logo (see below), and another with a new design which will be inspired by one of the pieces of art within the adventure.\nAt $4000: Four additional pages. The adventure is currently 24 pages, but you can help make it 28! The new pages would most likely be a combination of new pieces of art as well as some more background material write ups of the prominent NPCs encountered in Los Castores.\nAt $5500: A full patron write up. Spoiler alert: within the adventure, there is an otherworldly entity meddling with humankind in nefarious ways. At this level, I will do a full write-up of this entity as a patron and include an accompanying piece of art.\nThick Skull Adventures Sticker!\nDark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF Discount Code Offer\nTo get your Weird West campaign started right, David Baity has generously agreed to provide discount codes for the PDF copy of the Dark Trails Quick Start Guide when it becomes available to backers of this Kickstarter.

You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game returns you to the glory days of gaming, allowing you to adventure as 1974 intended you to, but with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery.\nAbout Dark Trails\nThe forthcoming Dark Trails RPG by David Baity is a game which pays homage to the popular Weird West genre.  Dark Trails can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. While Dark Trails is not required to play The Last will and Testament of Obediah Felkner, the two go together like dust and boots.\nAbout Stephen Newton\nStephen has been publishing adventures for both Thick Skull Adventures and Goodman Games for over seven years. Stephen has garnered a bit of a reputation for his unique style of horror contained with his DCC adventures. He is the author of three of Goodman Game\u2019s Halloween (now Horror) line of adventures including They Served Brandolyn Red, The Corpse that Love Built, and Creep, Skrag, Creep! As the primary author behind Thick Skull Adventures, Stephen has authored the Best Selling Attack of the Frawgs, The Haunting of Larvik Island, Stronghold of the Wood Giant Shaman, and Children of the Fallen Sun (for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG).\nShipping Costs\nEach adventure will ship either in a cardboard envelope or bubble pack via Media Mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. This is to protect everyone involved in case there is an unforeseen rate increase in postal costs between funding and final shipping. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped which is charged separate from the pledge levels. Rest assured that we will do everything within our power to ship your books to you the cheapest and most economical way possible.\nAny changes beyond our control to the expected shipping costs resulting from postal rate increases will be fully announced in updates if such a situation arises.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. \nBut what about international orders? If you\u2019re outside the US and want a copy, the standard cover will eventually be available through the Goodman Games and Game Kastle online store(s). If you are outside the US and want a foil cover, please send me a direct message and I will try to determine the most economical way to accommodate the request \u2013 most likely as a special order.\nPDF Fulfillment\nPDF copies will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.com.

The entire Tactical Adventures crew thanks you, each and everyone of you who made this Kickstarter a success. If you want to follow the progress of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, don't hesitate to drop by our Website where we'll be posting Dev Blogs & Updates on a weekly basis - and to wishlist us on Steam to be notified when the game goes live!\nOn October 18th 2019, our Free Kickstarter Pre-Alpha Demo will leave our Steam Page as the entire team's focus shifts towards working on the final game. We hope you enjoyed exploring the Ruins of Telema in the company of Garrad, Rhuad, Vigdis & Violet! Keep an eye out, you may yet meet them in the release version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister...\nCreated and written by lifelong fans of Pen & Paper RPGs, Solasta: Crown of the Magister is a Turn-Based Tactical cRPG based on the SRD 5.1 Ruleset.\n An Epic Team Adventure - Create your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. \n Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World - Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but be very aware of light and darkness. Many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters.\n Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions - The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\n True to Tabletop - Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games, with the rules of SRD 5.1 on PC! As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. Roll for initiative!\n A Team of Passionate Veterans - Led by Mathieu Girard, co-founder of Amplitude Studios (Endless Space...), Tactical Adventures is a small studio of experienced developers with many projects under their belts. \nPlease note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros (since Tactical Adventures is based in France, we unfortunately do not have the option to run our Kickstarter Campaign in USD). Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nStretch Goals Updates: Recap\n Paladin: Vote Starts / Archetypes Revealed / Paladin wins the vote \n Lawkeeper Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Party Banter: Reveal / Unlock \n Cohh Carnage Guest Voice Actor: Reveal / Unlock \n Ranger: Reveal / Unlock \n Academic Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Half-Elf: Vote Starts / Half-Elf wins the vote \n Music Upgrade: Reveal / Unlock \n Boss Monster: Vote Starts / Remorhaz wins the vote \n Legendary Item Questline: Reveal / Unlock \n Sorcerer: Reveal / Unlock \nDiscuss with us on our Official Forums & Discord Server \nWishlist & Follow us on Steam \nFind us on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram \nWatch our Videos on Youtube & Twitch \nOur Referral Program is now over!

Watch our Lore Trailer here!\nAn epic single-player campaign that will take your party from level 1 to level 10. \nA fully-customizable party of 4 characters, each of them as important as the others.\nBuilding the game hand-in-hand with the community, with Communication and Transparency as core values. \n Current Platform: PC Windows, Mac\n Current Languages: English (Voiced), French & German (Interface & Subtitles)\nThere is no \"main character\" when playing on the Tabletop. In Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will be playing a party of four heroes, as opposed to the usual \"one hero and three companions\". \nCreate your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool, selecting race, sub-race, class, background, proficiencies and ability scores. Each character will also have a different personality based on the choices you make during Character Creation, and this will affect their dialog options - fully voiced ones! Decide on your ideal party composition, and jump into the world of Solasta!\nSolasta: Crown of the Magister currently allows you to create characters from the four classic races: Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling. Each race (except Human) offers two sub-races. Of course, we decided to start with the four traditional classes of Tabletop adventurers: Fighter, Rogue, Cleric, and Wizard, each with three different archetypes. It goes without saying that we have plans for more, depending on the success of the Kickstarter Campaign!\nThe shattered world of Solasta is a High Fantasy setting with rich lore and many wonders. Multiple factions live in relative harmony amid the ruins of a fallen empire. Each has its own agenda and its own uses for adventurers. As you follow the twists and turns of the campaign, you will uncover the truth behind the ancient Cataclysm and fight to prevent it happening again. \nLore Updates:\nAn Introduction to the World of Solasta\nThe Halflings of Solasta\nThe Elves & Dwarves of Solasta\nThe Rangers & Paladins of Solasta\nThe Orcs & Humans of Solasta\nThe Half-Elves & Half-Orcs of Solasta\nThe Sorcerers of Solasta\nYou will explore long-forgotten ruins to unearth ancient artifacts, and face powerful foes in the process. And deep underground, our game's advanced lighting system will  shine - quite literally!\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, lighting not only impacts the visuals, but also the gameplay. Torches and Spells will dispel the darkness, allowing you to look out for ambushes and hidden traps. Some monsters may even be hypersensitive to light, giving you the chance to run away or force them back. \nWithout light, however, you will face major disadvantages. Not only will it be hard to see, but you will also have disadvantages on many rolls. You would do well to be careful around enemies who can cast Darkness... \nAlso remember that you will be exploring and fighting in a dynamic environment. Bridges can collapse, columns can be toppled - make sure you use all your options to forge your path to victory! \nThe dungeons of Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Each level is made from 5' x 5' x 5' cubes, and designed to allow characters to move vertically as well as horizontally. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below.\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will experience Combat and Exploration in three dimensions. Spells like Fly or Spiderclimb may save you a great deal of trouble when trying to navigate dungeons and caverns - and you may even find hidden treasures along the way. On the other hand... take care not to lose concentration - fall damage can be quite fatal!\nMake good use of verticality - for your enemies surely will. Giant Venomous Spiders crawling down the walls, Brimstone Vipers harassing you from up high, ferocious Orcs trying to shove you off a flimsy bridge... This is just a taste of what you will have to face!\nWe love Tabletop RPGs. And if you're here, chances are you do too! From Character Creation, to rolling the dice, to arguing with your peers that their idea is dumb and they should go with yours... This is what we want Solasta: Crown of the Magister to be - a PC representation of the Tabletop experience. Most of us have been playing and DM'ing for decades, and we pour that love and knowledge into the game.\nWe are committed in bringing the SRD 5.1 Ruleset to life on PC as faithfully as we can, with changes being limited to rules needing to be adapted for video games (exemple: Longbows would be able to hit targets from dozens of screens away). \nCharacter Creation Update\nYour journey through Solasta: Crown of the Magister will be accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack by Maxime Herv\u00e9, a talented  young composer who has worked on several high profile projects including Space Hulk: Tactics, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 7, and Love Death & Robots.\nThe G4F Prod crew is in charge of the sound design and its integration within the game. From Endless Space & Endless Legend to Furi, Styx, The Council, Blood Bowl, Call of Cthulhu & Space Hulk : Tactics, this award-winning team will deliver a stunning audio experience for Solasta!\nTactical Adventures is a self-published studio founded in 2018 by Mathieu Girard, who previously co-founded Amplitude Studios (Endless Space, Endless Legend...). We're located in Paris, not far from Notre-Dame (although now would not be the best time to visit). \nMathieu has been gathering passionate and experienced developers from all over, many with 10 or 20 years of game development under their belts, and most of them huge tabletop RPG fans. The team has been formed with a single aim: to create an immersive and tactical RPG with strong links to the authentic tabletop experience. \nWe plan to remain a small team of experts, working with trusted partners and making decisions in collaboration with the community. \n\nWe don't just want you to like Solasta - we want you to love it! Additional funds will allow us to add more content, such as more classes, more races and more quests. We want to make the best game we possibly can, and for that we need support from you - the player. \nWe want to hear your opinions and build Solasta with your help. What is it you would like to see? What are you excited about? What are your concerns? Kickstarter enables that direct discussion.\nWe also want to be transparent with you. Know that Solasta: Crown of the Magister will come out no matter what. We already have a sufficient budget from our own money, bank loans, public investments and government grants - so you can be confident that we're not going to bail on you. Kickstarter will allow us to expand the scope of the game, and we can assure you that we will release a complete & polished game. \nIn order to provide the best game experience we can, we will focus on releasing Solasta: Crown of the Magister on PC first, and then releasing a Mac Version. \nFor Consoles, we do not want to make promises that we might have to break due to complexity, time or budget constraints.\nIt is also too early for us to know where exactly we will be releasing our game on PC, but we can already tell you that we will be on Steam and that we'll be considering other distribution platforms. We will not be Exclusive on Epic Games Store. \nStarting November 2019 (the links won't work before that), you will be able to access our Pledge Manager - Crowdox.\nThrough CrowdOx, you will be able to:\nReview your Kickstarter Pledge & Rewards\nUpgrade your Pledge (for a limited duration after the campaign)\n Buy Physical Add-Ons (for a limited duration after the campaign)\nUpdate your Address\nPay the Shipping Fees\n Lost your Survey Link?

My first attempt at combining these two things was the creation of the podcast If You Give a Mouse a Dagger, an actual play podcast that uses the FATE Core system and is set in the Redwall universe. When deciding what system to use for this podcast, I could not find a system that worked exactly for what I wanted from the game. The closest we could find was FATE Core, but even this system doesn\u2019t have a rule system in place for food, bravery, honor, or many of the other aspects I loved about Redwall without creating extra rules.\nBecause of this dilemma, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a system that allows for all the things I found missing from FATE. This way, if anyone is like me and searching for a system to use for their Redwall or similar themed campaign, they can find it. Thus, Paws & Claws was born.\nWhat is Paws & Claws?\nPaws & Claws is a tabletop roleplaying game that uses the Status Die System and is set in the medieval fantasy world of Wudlind. \nThe world of Wudlind.\nWudlind is a land of rich forests, rushing rivers, majestic mountain ranges, relaxing beaches, and calm meadows. Each part of the map is filled with life and every area showcases a unique culture. When you adventure in Wudlind, will you be a member of a travelling band of entertainers loyal to the Fox Merchant Collective or a member of the Order of the Crescent who pledges to protect the small folk of Wudlind? Perhaps you will be an ambassador to the mole kingdom stationed in the Geode Keep deep underground while representing the squirrels of Hightop Castle in the thick foliage of the Great Oak Woods? Perhaps you won\u2019t be a part of any kingdom or organization already designed. Wudlind is an ever-evolving world with room for whatever you bring to the gaming table! \nThe world of Wudlind is inspired by novels like the Redwall series, Watership Down, and The Builders.\nWhat all does this game feature? Or what are you paying for?\n\u00b7 The all-new Status Die System\n\u00b7 8 unique vocations\n\u00b7 10 unique species\n\u00b7 Systems for crafting, cooking, honor, bravery, and more.\nRules and guidelines for GMing\n\u00b7 100+ enemies\n\u00b7 4 short ready to play adventures\nIn addition, stretch goals will allow for more vocations and species available for play.\nWhat is this Kickstarter for? Or where does my money go?\nThe funds from this Kickstarter will be split between three main areas: professional artwork, professional editing, and professional design. I am only interested in releasing a professional product, and in order to create one I need to hire others to do this work.\nCan I try this game out before I commit to this Kickstarter?\nYes, you can! You can find the Quickstart Guide on DriveThruRPG and download it for free! It is important to know that this while the core system of Paws & Claws will be mostly the same in the final product, the page design, quality of editing, and certain aspects of the gameplay will be drastically different. You may find the free version here:\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/278565/Paws--Claws-Quickstart-Guide?term=Paws", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy is the timeline a full year?\n\nThe timeline is projected to be an entire year before the finished product is released. It might seem long, but it is once again about creating a top quality product. I want to spend a significant amount of time play testing to balance and nuance every aspect of the game. Of course, during that time, a significant amount of artwork and design can be done. However, editing cannot happen until the rules, lore, and other text are done. It might be sooner, and I wish I could promise it would be. However, this is an indie game made by one guy who already works a full-time teaching job. It might take a while for the finished product to be released, but it is to ensure quality. If I try to rush it, the product will suffer in quality.

Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG to find out more and get started!\nLimited Offer: Aysle Champion\nWant to add your own hero to the ranks of the Army of Light? You get everything in the Aysle Treasure Coffer Pledge Level, plus we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Aysle Archetype! This includes one custom Perk, Spell, or Miracle, plus art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Aysle Royalty\nAdd your Archetype as a Champion above, plus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Friday night. Last year's event was an epic battle that determined the fate of the Mystery Men. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon. This is a different night and a different adventure than the session for Nile Empire Vigilantes!\nBest Value: The Aysle Treasure Coffer   \nFor the best Aysle experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Aysle Treasure Coffer. It is the most convenient way to get all of the core items in this Kickstarter, plus much more! Note that the base price has gone up a little, but that\u2019s because it features an entirely extra book even before Stretch Goals come into play: Greg Gorden\u2019s new Cosms Collide mega-adventure! The Treasure Coffer also starts with a sheet of Threat Blips, 5 new Threat Cards, the Aysle Possibility Tokens, and the CD soundtrack for The Revenge of the Carredon...and tons more goodies waiting to be unlocked! Any Add-On labeled as \"Treasure Coffer\" comes in the box.\nAysle is a realm of magic, fantasy, and an eternal struggle between Darkness and Light! It's ruled by High Lord Uthorion \u2014currently inhabiting the body of a Viking warlord\u2014and his Dread Covenent of nightmares, necromancers, and nefarious lords. Uthorion attacked from above and below, with maelstrom bridges crashing down in the sea to bring his Viking raiders, and a massive ritual connecting the underground passages of Aysle to subways, cellars, and caves on Earth. Any break in the ground may now be a portal to treasure and danger.\n\nWithin Uthorion\u2019s borders magic is powerful and miracles happen, but technology beyond a flintlock rifle sputter and malfunction. High tech doesn\u2019t belong here, and reality tries to right it and transform items into something accepted by the Ayslish. Storm Knights resist this effect, and may bring modern weapons (and more) to bear against the forces of Darkness.\nHigh Lord Uthorion didn't come to Earth alone. For the last century he had possessed Queen Pella Ardinay, the Lady of Light, and used her to corrupt her forces and undermine her allies: the elves and the last of the dwarves. She was recently slain and resurrected\u2014freeing her\u2014and now she leads the remnants of her armies to Earth in pursuit of her hated foe.\nThe Aysle source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, and Miracles for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\n Magic Gear! A bevy of new items for adventurers, and random tables for discovering items in coffers or on foes!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Great Britain and Scandinavia. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Aysle theater of the war.\nGet the statistics for the Dark Lord himself, as Uthorion takes matters into his own hands. Defeating him comes at a price, as Pella Ardinay found out the hard way!\nNew threats. Angered Elementals erupt throughout the realm as raw magic courses across new lands. Knights and wizards roam the roads\u2014many of them selfish and bent towards the ways of Darkness. The Dread Covenant has its own troops: monsters of legend, giants, undead, Vikings, and the foul spawn of Darkness controlled by Uthorion.\nQuest generation tables, new Eternity Shards, and more!\nRevenge of the Carredon is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in middle of the war, fighting in the trenches of Oxford. Tolwyn Tancred, the legendary hero who slew Uthorion\u2019s strange dragon\u2014the dreaded Carredon\u2014and returned to save Pella Ardinay is cursed, and heralds the return of the mighty beast she seemed to slay. Embark on a quest to unlock the mystery of the Carredon\u2019s origins and break the curse before Tolwyn is lost forever and Uthorion regains one of his most powerful weapons.\nWhen Cosms Collide! Original Torg co-creator Greg Gorden returns with a new mega-adventure! The Cyberpapacy, technodemons, Mobius' shocktroopers, and others all seem to have business in the realm of Aysle\u2014and the Storm Knights are caught in the middle. Join the action and uncover the mystery of what has so many High Lords moving through Uthorion's kingdom, and if anyone can beat the Dark One on his home ground !\nThe Aysle GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in Aysle. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \nAysle Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Champion of Light, a Core Earther transformed by the magic of Aysle into an armored paladin, the Necromancer, a hero touched by Darkness but who deploys her deadly spells against a common foe, and the Cleric of Dunad, an elf from Aysle who channels the holy power of the gods\u2026and many more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

It features a multi-chapter campaign story that progresses through a series of over two dozen illustrated dungeon maps, where each area is a hand-crafted puzzle. Fight monsters, acquire keys to open doors, get life-boosting elixirs, powerful equipment and enchanted items, and defeat the boss at the end of each level. Use your wits to find the right path through each area and survive. Solve each puzzle to move forward with the story.\nTwisty Little Passages is a game of full-color, fully-illustrated thematic puzzles.

Play it easily wherever you go!\nIf you like puzzles, mazes and dungeon crawl adventures, you'll find this a uniquely engaging experience!\nTwisty Little Passages Book\nSpecial challenge areas will contain an extended layout, with multiple story pages tied to epic two-page map spreads.\nTo play, you draw right on the laminated dungeon maps with a fine-tipped dry-erase pen to track your progress as you explore, find treasure, track stats and inventory, defeat enemies and uncover the secrets of solving each area. Survive each puzzle without getting stuck or running out of health. It may require multiple attempts to find the solution to a puzzle, and it's easy to restart your progress by wiping the page to start again.\nBONUS MATERIAL: We're including a section in the back of the book with spoiler-resistant progressive hints for all the puzzles to keep difficulty balanced for all players, plus another section with full solutions.\nPodcasts\nListen to a six-minute segment reviewing Twisty Little Passages in the On Board Games podcast with Isaac Shalev (starts at 5:05).\nTutorial Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison\nRules of play\nLearn the basic rules of how to play through the puzzles here:\nPrototype rules for download (PDF)\n\nPrint-and-play versions of demo Puzzles 1-1 through 1-5\nAfter reading the rules above, try to solve these introductory puzzles from the book in order:\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison -- keys and locks tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-2: Underground Caverns -- combat tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-3: Abandoned Hub -- armor tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-4: Roach Nest -- multiple equipment pieces tutorial\n\n Demo Puzzle 1-5: Kradra Prison Escape -- multiple enemies tutorial \n\nThere are 27 standalone puzzle areas (including unlocked stretch goals) total in the book, plus world map and secret meta-puzzle stretch goals.

Get ready to put on your thinking caps!\nWe designed each puzzle to be played in about a single sitting.  Expect to play each puzzle beyond the tutorial for around 15-90 minutes, some shorter and some longer, with some especially challenging areas that can take longer.  You can pause and continue play at any time, simply closing the book to save your place in the current area.\nTotal play time to solve all puzzles is estimated at 15-30 hours.\nWritten reviews \nRead Father Geek's review of Twisty Little Passages.\nThe final production version of Twisty Little Passages will feature multiple upgrades over the prototype preview copies you see here and in videos, including:\nMetal wire-binding, not plastic spiral bound\nOffset printing (no white border along the edge of the page)\nPlus all unlocked bonus and stretch goals listed above, including heavy-duty 10 pt card stock glossy laminated pages!\n(Early puzzle spoilers)\nHere are playthroughs of the simple tutorial puzzles in the introductory chapter of the book.

Questions directed to us on specific shipping situations are welcome.\nOur goal is maximize the value we provide you while keeping production and shipping overhead as low as possible.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June. If there are significant delays in getting you access to the Alpha, we will still have some hands-on stuff for you at the event but we may delay access to the Alpha keys until a later date.

Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

OVER 100% FUNDED!\nYou guys rock so much. I don't even have the words to articulate how awesome you guys are. Now that we're funded, we can move on to some AWESOME stretch goals!\n At $20,000, we'll add maps for EVERY CITY that's unlocked during the campaign. These maps will include not only a bird's-eye-view of the city, and not only details about specific locations like landmarks or specialized shops and locations, but ALSO playable maps for those specific locations! That means, if your players decide to up and start a bar fight in their local Owlbear Wild Wings, you, as the Dungeon Master, won't have to go searching for a generic bar map and give them some imaginary fluff about the magic screens displaying the latest and greatest Sportsball game - you can just pull out the Owlbear Wild Wings Battlemap and let them have at it!\nLet's work together to unlock this stretch goal and tons more, like these:\n What exactly is Monsters of Murka?  \nMonsters of Murka is a hilarious new campaign setting for fifth edition DND full of comical monsters, detailed maps, parodical mayhem, and political satire! This campaign setting includes adventures for first to tenth level characters.\nQuotes from Monsters of Murka playtesters\nThe World of Murka\nMurka was once a land of great promise. People flocked to it from across the known worlds. It was a place of myriad creatures, creeds, and most importantly, connections, each seeking its place among beautiful landscapes and bountiful resources. After centuries of development, prosperous cities dot the countryside. Their populations hail from distant lands, yet they thrive, together, with the common goal of progress, and of prosperity. \nThe populace share a common goal of achieving that which all sought; The Murkan Dream.\nThe Murkan Dream\nThe Murkan Dream is an artifact of an unknown origin. In fact, so little is known about the Murkan Dream that some doubt its existence entirely. Others view it as an ultimate goal, an achievable reality towards which they push, day in and day out. Whispered words litter the streets, telling tales of those who have supposedly obtained or achieved the Murkan Dream. Many of these have proven to be categorically false: people who claimed to have achieved the Murkan Dream only to later reveal that they had begun their journey with such a wealth of resources and advantages, that the Murkan Dream was never something they really even wanted or needed.\nThese false mythologues serve only to further drive the Murkan people towards their goals, both individually and collectively. Recently, however, an evil being has come into power over Murka, and now his minions roam the lands, terrorizing those whose pursuit of the Murkan Dream may threaten his power...\nSeveral years ago, The Don asserted himself as the leader of the free world of Murka. He painted outsiders as a threat to the Murkan Dream, insisting that their presence alone would somehow be enough to destroy it permanently. He claimed that he had achieved the Murkan Dream, that he had seen the light, and that he wanted his people to do the same. \nHe gained influence over the population, and so gained control over the lands with false promises to its inhabitants\u2014promises he never had any intention of keeping.  \nNow, he remains safely within the well-guarded walls of The Pale Fortress, from which he issues commands to impose his will on those who support him to control those who do not.\nHowever, rumors have spread of a resistance group growing within Murka: a people who want to stand against The Don's dark influence, who want to usher in an era of progress and providence, and return the Murkan Dream to the Murkan People.\nThere are a whole host of creatures and cretins roaming the lands of Murka. Many of them are intelligent, having their own societies and roles within the Murkan government. Others are wild and feral, seeking only to make a life in the wild and attacking anything they perceive as a threat. Here are some examples of some Monsters of Murka that you might encounter in your travels.\nWhether it be the fearsome tromp, the bumbling trumplins, or any of the other various villains, you'll be sure to meet your match and more in combat encounters! These and many other creatures of varying shapes, sizes, and abilities await you in the wilderness of Murka. \nSo, will you journey forth into this setting, encountering creatures and solving mysteries, in order to bring an end to The Don's evil rein of terror over the Murkan People?\nGuest Art\nOne of the most fun parts of this book was working with some of my favorite artists who contributed guest art for the book.

It can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG.   As a player, you\u2019ll find a wealth of material that allows you to assume the role of one of 11 unique classes, with descriptive names like: the Calavera, the Bedlamite, and the Sin-Eater.   As a Judge, you\u2019ll find over 400 pages of material giving you a wealth of resources for designing and running fantastic adventures set against the haunted landscapes of an unforgiving weird West. \nYou may be wondering about the above mentioned game that Dark Trails is tethered to. Dungeon Crawl Classics is a Fantasy RPG written by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. Since debuting in 2012, the book has gone through seven (7) printings and spawned a wonderful community of passionate gamers both new and old. DCC continues to grow by leaps and bounds by way of exciting adventures penned by some of the best writers in the industry, including third-party publishers using the system to fuel their own creative fires.\nFortunately, the Dark Master (Joseph Goodman) has granted permission to include a modified version of the DCC ruleset within the pages of Dark Trails to make it the first 3rd party published work to include the necessary rules for play. You don\u2019t need anything other than the Dark Trails RPG to play the game aside from some dice, paper, and pencils. \nSome of the DCC rules were purposefully left out when weighed against their place in a weird West setting, but these omitted rules can easily be added to Dark Trails should you own a copy of DCC and wish to include them.\n This Kickstarter funds the standalone hardcover book for the game. Funds raised will be used to pay for additional art, editing, and layout for a quality book made by traditional offset methods to ensure it is as durable as it is beautiful. \n Dark Trails is the product of three years of writing and playtesting by author David Baity. You may remember David from his first DCC adventure \u201cCarnival of the Damned\u201d published by  Purple Sorcerer Games. While David has handled the majority of the writing chores with the Dark Trails RPG, lots of folks have thrown their name into the hat to help flesh out the magic and bestiary sections. Daniel J. Bishop, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman, Diogo Nogueira, and Jeff Scifert are just a few of the talented minds that have worked their magic to make Dark Trails something truly special.\nFor one of the two editions of the game we've commissioned none other than the legendary SanJulian to grace us with a beautifully painted cover filled to the brim with \"weird.\" You can see a few more of SanJulian's DCC covers below, and be sure to check out his website  for several works you've probably seen grace the covers of your favorite novels and other publications over the years.\nWho else is on board to help to bring the world of Dark Trails to life? Over the last two years, the author has recruited some of the best up-and-coming artists in the industry. The Dark Trails RPG currently features work by Angga Augustiya, Todd McGowan, Christopher Torres, Simon Todd, Danny Prescott, Adam Slivka, David Hoskins, Aaron Robinson, MARCINs, David Coppoletti, and Diogo Nogueira.\nAdditional funds raised by the Kickstarter will help continue to fund new art from the above-mentioned artists, in addition to work by Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, and Bradley K. McDevitt, just to name a few!\n Dark Trails will be printed in two editions (standard and limited edition), both are hardcover books  8.5\u201d x 11\u201d trim size. The books will be printed in the USA by offset printing methods to ensure the quality of the book meets consumer expectations.  Currently, we plan to keep the interior printed in B&W on 60# paper and stitched binding. \n The standard edition will feature a full-color cover painted by iconic artist, Sanjulian (Creepy magazine, Vampirella, etc.) while the limited edition will feature a leatherette cover, accented with metallic foil stamping and an embossed version of the Dark Trails RPG logo. The ultimate goal with the limited edition is to create something that looks like it was pulled right out of the Old West! \nBelow, you can see mock ups of each book to give you an idea of what we're visualizing. The painting used to represent the standard edition is not the final Sanjulian cover, and both covers are subject to change. \nA mock-up of the standard edition. This is not the actual cover and all elements are subject to change\nA mock-up of the limited edition leatherette edition. All elements are subject to change.\n\n\n The weird West genre is certainly well represented in the RPG industry, but those wishing to find a fully developed weird West RPG that utilizes a class-based system based upon the DCC RPG will be sadly disappointed. Dark Trails fills a niche for a DCC based weird West RPG by providing 11 original character classes paired with innovative rules designed to leave your players feeling like they\u2019ve just spent several hours adventuring in a Western landscape where the emphasis is placed upon the weird!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find several classes to choose from within the pages of the book, so let\u2019s give you a basic rundown of what you\u2019ll find. \nBedlamite: Absent-minded inventors constantly constructing inventions that defy all logic, including \u201cwondrous\u201d contraptions that are brought to life by their creator\u2019s sheer force of will. Bedlamites often become addle-brained and introverted, preferring the company of their automatons to that of their allies.\nCalavera: Spirit-mediums, most often female, that can both see and speak to the nearby dead wandering the closest regions of the Spirit Lands. The calavera shines like a beacon in the night to the restless dead, eager to have her deliver a message, or perform one last task that will put the spirit to rest. Aiding in those tasks marks her as a veritable queen of the underworld and the dead are not only willing to share some of their dark secrets but also have been known to reach across the grave to protect their only connection to the land of the living.\nGambler: With the big changes running through the weird West, the gambler could be called the chosen paladin of Lady Luck, able to manipulate the ebb and flow of chance like an occultist weaves arcane energy. Gamblers alter the probability of events going on in their surroundings and have a skill set that favors thievery and subterfuge.\nGunslinger: Sometimes, a poor soul is cut down before their time, and when that person is a law-dog or hardened soldier even death isn\u2019t enough to discourage them from staying in the fight. These restless spirits possess the guns they died with and send out a call to those deemed worthy of carrying them. Gunslingers find their uncanny skill at gunplay supernaturally elevated by the spirits of vengeance that choose them.\nLuchador: A luchador is most often a person noble of heart seeking the thrill of martial combat in and out of the sacred ring. In addition to high-flying acrobatics coupled with raw strength and fortitude, luchadores gain the ability to tap into their inner spirit, channeling it through their masks for supernatural effects.\nMountebank: The typical \u201csnake oil salesman\u201d of the frontier, these amateur alchemists and full-time showmen find that the events of the Seven Days of Night have unlocked a doorway to the mind that reveals recipes that defy all logic and, once brewed, resemble the magic potions of legend.\nMystic Monk: Trained in the sacred art of martial arts and schooled by master philosophers, the mystic monk is a humble warrior wandering the weird West in search of enlightenment. In addition to being a master of martial arts, the mystic monk can summon his inner chi, a virtual battery of spiritual energy used to perform superhuman feats.\nOccultist: Occultists devote their lives to the mastery of the ambient arcane energies constantly flowing around all living things, learning to weave and channel them to miraculous effect through spell work. Occultists are considered master investigators and have a nose for all things arcane and unusual.\nRevelator: The revelator serves as a bastion of faith to those seeking refuge from the madness infecting the world. They can perform divine healing and miracles in addition to serving as a bane to evil creatures\u2014both living and dead\u2014all while serving as a pillar of faith to those that still believe in the comforting words of The Good Book.\nSin-Eater: During the Seven Days of Night, no souls were granted passage to the Underworld and instead were cursed to wander the Spirit World where they were preyed upon by creatures native to the realm, or worse, taken as slaves by their own kind. Charon, lord of the ferrymen, knows an abundance of restless spirits could potentially unravel the barrier between worlds. Some ferrymen are hand selected by their lord to return to the surface world in order to shepherd lost souls to the afterlife and destroy those that prey upon them by using River Rites and the soul-aegis, a weapon that strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked.\nTommyknocker: Sometimes, a soul is just too pissed off to pass on and needs to get a slice of vengeance before taking that ride into the sunset. Tommyknockers are walking corpses for almost all intents and purposes, but the strength of their soul is such that it acts as a furnace, providing a means to animate its corpse-shell to take care of unfinished business. In addition to an unnatural strength, the tommyknocker is one of the toughest hombres found in the weird West.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the DCC magic system, you\u2019ll be familiar with how things are done. If you\u2019re new to DCC styled magic you\u2019re in for a real treat! Spells can be cast multiple times if you continually roll high enough. Roll low and you might lose the spell for a day, or worse, suffer from the effects of corruption! On top of being able to cast known spells multiple times, the total of your roll means potentially casting that low-level magic missile spell with effects so strong that you just might wipe the playing field with your trusty \u201cfinger guns.\u201d In addition to a full complement of spells and miracles found within the pages of Dark Trails, you can import any of the 120+ existing spells found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG into your game, should you own the book.\nYou\u2019ll find over 150 spells, wondrous contraptions, elixirs, and miracles within the pages of Dark Trails, but we didn\u2019t stop there. In addition to the above, you\u2019ll find a reliquary of beneficial and cursed magic items, along with rules and tables for crafting magical firearms. \nThe author of the Dark Trails RPG really wants to present you with a game that has some innovative rules that help capture the feel of a Western-themed game. You\u2019ll find several interesting mechanics scattered throughout the book (some that you may even wish to port to your DCC game), but the main rules that make the Dark Trails RPG a horse you\u2019d want to throw a saddle on include:\nNew rules for firearms that incorporate a standard poker deck, including specialized critical hit and fumble tables.\nBoons & Hexes represent a run of good/bad luck your character might be having during a typical session. They\u2019re awarded based on things like exceptionally good/bad die rolls, true heroics, and great role playing.  Boons earned can be spent for in-game perks, while Hexes increase your chances of receiving more disastrous results on fumble and fear charts. In addition, they affect how NPC interactions pan out\u2014consider the unlucky cowboy to have a dark cloud following him around.\nA new system that replaces the \u201cstandard\u201d alignment mechanics found in most RPGs. The new system helps tell the story of how decisions determine the path a character may walk and how that path affects their reputation when dealing with NPCs.\nAn innovative system for fear and madness that simulates a character\u2019s ability to handle both physical and emotional stress during the adventure, including an extensive list of mental disorders for those who slip too deeply down the rabbit hole!\n\n Lot's of folks are hard at work putting their twist on the weird West genre. For starters, you can check out Thick Skull Adventures \"The Last WIll and Testament of Obediah Felkner.\" Author Stephen Newton is close to launching his exciting take on a weird West adventure that blends perfectly with the Dark Trails RPG. You can find more info at Thick Skull Adventures \nYou can also take comfort in knowing some talented up-and-coming writers in the gaming community have become so inspired by past playtests that they\u2019ve taken the initiative to start writing Dark Trails adventures. \nThere\u2019s no bigger compliment for an author than to learn folks think enough of their game to create material before the book is even released! The author has big plans to produce both free and paid content once the book is released into the wild. This includes supporting those who wish to produce their own Dark Trails material!\nYou\u2019re going to love the bestiary in this book! Over seventy-five creatures have been pulled from the works of Lovecraft and the pages of folklore from all around the world! Several notable folks have thrown their passion into helping make the bestiary something special, including but not limited to: Daniel J. Bishop, Jon Hook, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman and more! \nYou\u2019ll also find that several included creatures contain charts with all sorts of tweaks and nasty surprises to make each encounter terrifying and unique!\n\nSometimes, a Judge has a hard enough time wrangling up a posse, let alone coming up with a trail-ready adventure to keep'em busy! Don't you worry, partner, we got you covered!

Arbeitet zusammen, um euch euer eigenes Comic-Universum zu erschaffen und die Geschichten der verschiedenen Helden darin auszuspielen.\nIcons ist dein Alles-in-einem-Paket f\u00fcr Rollenspielabenteuer mit Superhelden: schnell, leicht, beschreibend und lustig! \n___________________________________________________________________\nUrsprung des Crowdfunding:\nIcons wurde vor einigen Jahren als Nebenprojekt von Steve Kenson entwickelt, in welchem er mit der Stufenskala und den Mechaniken von Fudge experimentierte und mit \u00c4hnlichkeiten zu der Skala und den mit Eigenschaftsw\u00f6rtern (toll, unglaublich, atemberaubend) benannten F\u00e4higkeitsstufen im alten Marvel Super Heroes Rollenspiel, wenngleich mit ein paar \u00dcberlegungen zu Superhelden, die mit Zufallsw\u00fcrfen ausgew\u00fcrfelt werden, als Sprungbrett f\u00fcr die Fantasie der Spieler. Sp\u00e4tere Entwicklungsschritte arbeiteten dann Ideen aus FATE (einer bekannteren Weiterentwicklung der Fudge-Regeln) mit ein, sowie Kensons Erfahrungen mit dem Regeldesign f\u00fcr das auf d20-Regeln aufgebaute Mutants and Masterminds.\nIcons wurde zuerst von Adamant Entertainment verlegt. Sp\u00e4ter trennte Steve Kenson sich von Adamant, finanzierte \u00fcber Kickstarter das Quellenbuch Great Power, \u00fcber das er schon l\u00e4ngere Zeit nachgedacht hatte, und ver\u00f6ffentlichte sp\u00e4ter die Assembled Edition des Spiels unter seinem eigenen Label namens Ad Infinitum Adventures, gedruckt und vertrieben durch seine Freunde bei Green Ronin Publishing. Seither sind bei Ad Infinitum Adventures ein paar weitere Quellenb\u00fccher (Icons A to Z und Icons Adversaries) und eine Reihe von Abenteuern erschienen, einschlie\u00dflich eines Abenteuers, das die gesamte lange Kampagne Rise of the Phalanx des K\u00fcnstlers und Autors Dan Houser in einem \u201eextradicken Icons-Band\u201c zusammenfasst.\nAnfang des Jahres 2018 hatte der Verlag Beyond Affinity \u2013 Phantastische Literatur Icons als sein erstes Rollenspielprojekt ausgew\u00e4hlt und die Lizenz f\u00fcr die deutsche Ausgabe erworben. (Alles, was direkt von Kensons Ad Infinitum Adventures f\u00fcr die Marke Icons ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ist auch von der Lizenz abgedeckt. Das hei\u00dft, es k\u00f6nnen auch die Supplements und die Kurzabenteuer in deutscher \u00dcbersetzung kommen und f\u00fcr jahrelangen superstarken Nachschub ist im Prinzip gesorgt.) Fast zeitgleich hatte auch der langj\u00e4hrige Comic-Fan und Rollenspieler Norbert Franz, nach vielen interessierten R\u00fcckfragen zu Icons bei Spiele-Conventions in S\u00fcddeutschland, mit einer \u00dcbersetzung begonnen, die zuerst nur f\u00fcr ein paar Fans und die eigene Spielergruppe vorgesehen war, ohne kommerzielle Hintergedanken. Norbert Franz und Andr\u00e9 Boyens von Beyond Affinity erfuhren quasi nur zuf\u00e4llig auf Facebook voneinander und einigten sich im Prinzip gleich darauf, dass Franz die schon begonnene deutsche \u00dcbersetzung f\u00fcr Beyond Affinity weiterschreiben w\u00fcrde. Nach viel sprachlicher Detailarbeit, aufgeopferter Freizeit, Kontrollen, R\u00fcckfragen bei Steve Kenson und intensiver Feinabstimmung insbesondere zu der Regelsprache von Icons und dessen zahlreichen Comic-Besonderheiten lag dann am Abend des 30. April 2019 erstmals eine Version des kompletten Icons-Regeltextes vor. Beyond Affinity hatte f\u00fcr das Comic-Nischenspiel von Anfang an einen eigenen deutschen Kickstarter geplant, um eine erste Buchauflage auf den Weg zu bringen. Dieser Kickstarter sollte im vern\u00fcnftigen, vorsichtig kalkulierten Rahmen bleiben und sich dabei nur auf das Regelbuch Assembled Edition als PDF und Hardcover-Band konzentrieren. Um Punkt Mitternacht am 15. Mai 2019 ging dieses Crowdfunding online.\n___________________________________________________________________\nEin paar Informationen zu Icons f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger:\nIcons verwendet ein komplett eigenes System, einen entfernten Verwandten von Fudge und FATE, das inzwischen als das Icons-System fest etabliert ist. Kein anderes Regelbuch ist zum Einstieg oder zum vollst\u00e4ndigen Verst\u00e4ndnis n\u00f6tig. Alles beginnt genau hier mit der Assembled Edition. Im englischsprachigen Raum kann man Icons sogar mit der OGL als Regelsystem f\u00fcr Third-Party-Produkte, oft kurze kleine PDFs, unter Lizenz verwenden (diese tragen dann das Logo \u201eICONS Compatible\u201c).\n\nW\u00fcrfelmodus und Grundstruktur\nDas System verwendet nur die handels\u00fcblichen \u201enormalen\u201c sechsseitigen W\u00fcrfel (W6), mit den Zahlen von 1 bis 6, keine W\u00fcrfel mit Minus- und Plus-Zeichen oder Sondersymbolen usw.\nDas Icons-System kennt 6 fest vorgegebene Attribute (auf Deutsch: Kampftalent, Koordination, St\u00e4rke, Verstand, Achtsamkeit und Willensst\u00e4rke) und man hat mindestens ein Spezialgebiet (ein Paket von Fertigkeiten und Kenntnissen in Kurzform ausgedr\u00fcckt) und dann die Powers, also Kr\u00e4fte. Die Powers sind nicht \u201efrei erfunden\u201c oder allein vom Spieler benannt (wie oft die FATE-Aspekte), sondern einem Kr\u00e4fte-Kapitel entnommen. Man kann sie sich aussuchen, mit Punkten kaufen oder aber kurzerhand per Zufallstabellen \u201eausw\u00fcrfeln\u201c (was auch die zuerst vorgeschlagene Methode der Charaktererschaffung im Buch ist \u2013 so wei\u00df kein Spieler zu Beginn, welche Superkr\u00e4fte oder F\u00e4higkeiten er bekommt).\nSowohl die 6 Attribute als auch die Kr\u00e4fte funktionieren in den Regeln numerisch auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10, wobei alle Stufen ab 7 als \"super\" gelten und man mit einem blo\u00dfen Attribut ab 7 auch Stunts erzeugen kann. Mit St\u00e4rke also improvisierte St\u00e4rke-Stunts, mit Verstand eben Verstandes-Stunts, mit Achtsamkeit Achtsamkeits-Stunts und alles so weiter, ganz regelm\u00e4\u00dfig.\nSpezialgebiete gehen von 1 bis 3 und werden einem Attribut hinzugez\u00e4hlt, wenn sie gerade in einer bestimmten Situation zu einer Aufgabe passen. Das muss dann nicht immer dasselbe Attribut sein. Aber zum Beispiel: Verstand 5 und Detektiv 2 ergibt effektiv eine Stufe von 7.\nPowers k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise auch in Gegenst\u00e4nden, Werkzeugen und Waffen schlummern. Magische Artefakte und Green Lanterns Ring und Doctor Stranges Mantel sowie der ber\u00fchmte Batman-Werkzeugg\u00fcrtel sind hier also schon mit ber\u00fccksichtigt.\nBei jeder spielrelevanten Aktion w\u00fcrfelt die aktive / angreifende Seite i.d.R. Attribut + 1W6 gegen eine vom SL vorgegebene Schwierigkeitsstufe + 1W6 oder gegen die passive / verteidigende Seite, die ebenfalls Attribut + 1W6 verwendet. Nur auf die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten kommt es an. Die h\u00f6here Seite \u201egewinnt\u201c die Aktion oder erzielt zumindest einen Vorteil. Es gibt i.d.R. keine Re-Rolls (wiederholten W\u00fcrfelw\u00fcrfe) und ebenfalls keine explodierenden W\u00fcrfel. Daf\u00fcr gibt es strenggenommen auch keine Kritischen Erfolge oder Patzer. Die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten reicht schon aus, um zu bestimmen, wie toll oder wie schlimm etwas wird. Damit gen\u00fcgt im Extremfall sogar schon ein einziger herk\u00f6mmlicher W\u00fcrfel zum Spielen, neben dem Buch, den Charakterbl\u00e4ttern und Stiften zum Notizenmachen.\nMit speziellen Heldenpunkten, die Entschlossenheitspunkte hei\u00dfen (im Original Determination Points), kann man weitere Tricks und Spieleffekte erzeugen: das hei\u00dft, zus\u00e4tzliche Geistesblitze oder Eingebungen haben, eine F\u00e4higkeit f\u00fcr kurze Zeit verst\u00e4rken, einen spektakul\u00e4ren Stunt erzeugen, sich blitzschnell erholen oder wieder aufraffen, eine Situation durch eine \u201eRetcon\u201c anders erkl\u00e4ren und so weiter.\nDie Elemente, die manche Spieler vielleicht als Aspekte aus FATE kennen, hei\u00dfen in Icons \u201eEigenschaften\u201c (engl. Qualities). Diese haben selbst keine Zahlenwerte und dienen einfach als zus\u00e4tzliche kleine Merkmale oder Hintergrundinformationen \u00fcber den Charakter. Sie k\u00f6nnen eventuell auch Beinamen sein (\u201eDer letzte Sohn Kryptons\u201c, \u201eDer Dunkle Detektiv\u201c, \u201eDer Oberste Zauberer\u201c, \u201eDer schnellste Mensch auf Erden\u201c, \u201eDie rothaarige Teufelin mit dem Schwert\u201c ...) oder Ausspr\u00fcche und Zitate (\u201eHeiliger Strohsack!\u201c, \u201eBei Rao!\u201c, \u201eX\u2019Hal!\u201c, \u201eCowabunga!\u201c, \u201eZwo, eins, Risiko!\u201c). Diese kann man dann im Laufe des Spiels durch bestimmte Entscheidungen und Spielz\u00fcge triggern und ausnutzen, manchmal zum Positiven und manchmal zum Negativen.\nDas Regelwerk ist Allgemeinen bewusst lockerer und kompakter aufgebaut als viele andere. Es ist auch knapper geschrieben und fr\u00f6hlicher und verspielter in seinen Illustrationen als beispielweise Mutants and Masterminds, das vom selben Autor stammt. Das Grundregelbuch deckt viel ab, ohne den Leser mit endlosen Textkapiteln zu belasten, die monatelanges Textstudium erfordern und eher vom Spielen abhalten und den einzelnen Spieler wom\u00f6glich entmutigen.\n___________________________________________________________________\nMit ICONS - Die Gesammelte Edition (Assembled Edition) erh\u00e4ltst du alles, was ben\u00f6tigt wird, um praktisch direkt loszulegen ...\nWohin flie\u00dft der KICKSTARTER-Betrag?

We hope you\u2019ll join us on this exciting new adventure!\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon challenges 4-6 2nd level adventurers to save a hidden desert city (along with its cursed inhabitants) from the wrath of a devious and chaotic god. Its 48 digest-sized pages are packed with dangerous environments, exotic threats, and a world-shaking finale with thousands of lives on the line! \nDungeon Crawl Classics RPG adventures are easily adaptable to work in any \u2018old school\u2019 system, so the adventure and additional materials will benefit any GM looking to deliver some classic adventuring to their players, even if DCC isn\u2019t your system of choice!\nThe Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide\nAt it\u2019s most basic level, the Omnibus will combine all three of Mark\u2019s adventures (Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry, The Frost Fang Expedition, and The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon) into a single beautiful book. As stretch goals are met, the Omnibus will expand to include:\nWorld details: cities, towns, thieves guilds and more!\nNew Monsters\nNew Magic Items\nRandom Encounters and Events\nA new mini-adventure: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope!)\nAnd more!\nWhen complete, The Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide will come in at almost 300 digest-sized pages of adventuring goodness, taking your players from zero to 3rd level and beyond! \nStretch Goals\nThis is where things get fun! As your pledges to the campaign mount, we\u2019ll be able to add all sort of cool stuff to the Kickstarter:\n$3000: Stefen Poag will create an awesome cover for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon!\n$3500: We\u2019ll add The Life in the Sullenlands campaign guide to the Omnibus! \n$4000: Peter Mullens will create a wrap-around cover for the Omnibus!\n$4250: We\u2019ll add paper miniatures for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon! \n$4500: We\u2019ll include an exciting mini-adventure in the Omnibus: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope).\n$5000: We\u2019ll include a Dwarf Cleric Class, and a full patron write-up for a Dwarven god Greythaak the Bearded Anvil \n$5500: We\u2019ll add a plethora of fun random tables, including encounters, events, character deaths, names, magic items, and more! \n$6000: We\u2019ll add beautiful, high-resolution Crypt PDF battlemaps by Frank Turfler \n$6500: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Peter\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US. (Since DriveThruRPG only prints posters in the US, International backers will receive a PDF copy of the poster, and a free copy of the 0-level funnel Perils of the Sunken City).\n$7000: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Stefan\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US.

If you back at the Digital Everything level or higher, just let us know in an email (or a comment when you order), and we will add a special bonus short adventure written by Jon Marr to your package that currently isn\u2019t available anywhere else. (If you\u2019re a fan of the Sunken City, you\u2019re going to like this one!) Thanks so much for your continuing support!\n How POD Printing and Shipping Works \nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means no mark up at all. \nAs the printing will be conducted in both the US and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers. If you haven\u2019t ordered POD books from DriveThruRPG before, contact us and we can help determine if shipping to your country is possible, and if makes sense financially!\nWe highly recommend ordering all POD titles in one order, as this will cut down on shipping costs considerably! (All the POD codes will be sent to you at the same time). Printing and shipping both books and the stretch goals should likely cost in the range of $12-16 in the US. Many countries will only cost a few dollars more, but some can be significantly more expensive to ship to. Again, just contact us and we can help you make the best choice!\nWant to See the Quality of the Previous Books in the Series?\nCheck out these older videos introducing the print versions of both Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry and The Frost Fang Expedition:\nAbout Purple Sorcerer Games\nWe\u2019ve been creating free Dungeon Crawl Classics tools since the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG beta was released in 2011. Our popular Zero-Level Party Generator has produced millions of characters doomed to be ground up in DCC\u2019s popular funnel adventures, and over the years we\u2019ve added many utilities that thousands of DCC players rely on. (Including the Ennie-Award winning Crawler\u2019s Companion game management app, the Sorcerer\u2019s Grimoire spellbook, utility, the Upper Level Character Generator, and the Mutant Crawl Classics Generator). All of the tools are generously supported by the amazing DCC community each year through a pledge drive that helps pay for server costs, computer expenses,  mobile device acquisition for testing, and much more!\nOnce the DCC RPG was officially released, our adventure Perils of the Sunken City was the first DCC 3rd party adventure published. (Beating Attack of the Frawgs from our good friends at Thick Skull Adventures by a couple days). It was followed by 3 additional Sunken City adventures that were eventually combined into the best-selling Sunken City Adventure Omnibus and Guide: we\u2019re grateful that it continues to be one of the first titles picked up by many players new to DCC!\nWe\u2019ve been lucky to work with some of the best writers in the old school RPG community. In addition to Mark\u2018s adventures mentioned in this Kickstarter, we\u2019ve also published David Baity\u2019s fan-favorite tournament adventure The Carnival of the Damned, and Terry Olson\u2019s thrilling Escape from the Shrouded Fen.\nYou can purchase all of our adventures through DriveThruRPG, and print copies of most titles can be picked up from the extensive Goodman Games Online Store!\nAbout the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG from Goodman Games.

Just open & roll for initiative!\nThe Dungeon Books of Battle Mats are a pair of modular Battle Map Books that combine to give you up to an epic 2\u2019x2\u2019 encounter battle mat while still fitting in your bag and on your bookshelf alongside your rule books. Modular designs line up seamlessly to allow you to form a dungeon for any encounter!

An Endless Dungeon awaits!\nThe Dungeon is a fully modular & complementary pair of Battle Map Books designed to enable you to create a vast number of dungeon battle maps by using different page combinations in the books individually or side by side.     \nFully Laminated throughout and thus wipe clean, every page except the front & back covers is a map so you get the maximum dungeon out of the books!\nTwo Books Laid Out as a 24\" x 24\" Square\nEndless map options, completely flat and fits in a bag or on a bookshelf. Loke BattleMats books boast the 360\u00b0 spine so the books will open and lie dead flat or fold in half along the spine. It also means the books line up flush, level and flat so it plays just like one large map.

The number of tiles is increasing along with any pages unlocked via Stretch Goals for the physical books.\nThis digital collection will also include an adventure module for Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition that will be set within the designs of the Dungeon books, delivered as a pdf. \nPlease note that shipping for any physical goods will be charged after the Kickstarter ends and at a set rate for your location regardless of how many items you are receiving.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

That said, I may have forgotten to rein them in a bit! While we normally aim for a page-count of about 120 for our Pocket RPGs, L.B. and Samantha went above and beyond building this behemoth book that clocks in at more than 300 pages.\nAnd it\u2019s through this Big Eyes, Small Brains boasts:\n6 amazing classes, which include the always-coiffed Combat Maids and Butlers and the shimmering Idols\n9 vast regions to explore, from the Ayakashi-filled Yotsuya, to the glimmering streets of Lancastar, and the small-town neighborhoods of Mitakihara\n32 villains and baddies, that include jack-booted Storm Troopers, steely-eyed Yakuza, and fangirls who will fight literally anything to have senpai notice them.\nOodles of character traits, mecha, and more to make your character stand out\nCooking skills!

Now, I\u2019m compiling them into a glorious hardcover compendium.\nThis limited edition hardcover book contains:\n55 illustrated adventure locations, settlements and wilderness regions\nAdventure summaries and a giant table of hooks & rumors \nA full-color campaign map that puts the adventures in context\nAn illustrated bestiary with more than 90 monsters\nA detailed index of people, places, creatures and things\nCompanion Bestiary PDFs add stats for 5e, B/X and Dungeon World \nEach adventure is lovingly illustrated, and fits on a single page or spread, making it easy use as a one-shot, a drop-in location in your home-grown campaign setting, or a source of ideas for your own creations.\n\"Stop writing adventures and use these\"\u2014Ryan Chaddock, Geek and Sundry\nThe adventures in the book are dungeons, ruined towers, underworld mega-caverns, creepy cult hideouts, treacherous cities, and deadly wilderness regions, all in the same easy-to-reference format. \nMy adventures are inspired by the weather-stained heroism of Middle Earth, the grounded, emotional honesty of Earthsea, and the fantastic whimsey of stories like Rupert Bear.\nThere are classic underground loot grabs, encounters wondrous and weird, terrors from ages past, and apocalyptic showdowns\u201442 adventure sites, 5 danger-filled settlements, and 8 wilderness regions in all. \nEverything is written as tightly as possible, distilled to get the maximum idea density on the page. I don't put in stats, so they're best for games where you can stat on the fly: early editions of D&D, Dungeon World, Torchbearer, Into the Odd, Maze Rats, or World of Dungeons (to name but a few).\n(Update: we have unlocked all four bestiary stretch goals, so backers will now get companion bestiary PDFs with stats for Dungeon World, Basic D&D, and fifth edition D&D!)\nFrom One-Shots to Sandboxes\nEach adventure location is designed for ease of use at your table. They're not stories but scenarios spring-loaded with potential. Whether your players arrive as marauders, explorers, diplomats, or thieves, interesting things will happen.\nMy hope is this book becomes an obvious addition to your emergency GMing kit. When it's an hour before game night and you need a one-shot scenario, pull it the book and send your players into your favorite underground hellhole.\nIf you're planning a mini-campaign, it's easy to snap together several adventures into a short series, by location type or theme using the two-page Adventure Summaries. Descend from the Unmended Way to save Tealwood from the poisons of the Martoi, or stitch together a desert arc out of the Oracle's Decree, the Roots of Ambition, and Lair of the Lantern Worm.\nThere's enough material in the book to pack a sandbox knee deep. I've kept them deliberately light on backstory to make them easy to reskin for your own setting. Even so, there are connecting themes and hidden links between the adventures. If we reach the realm map and gazetteer stretch goals, the adventures come together into a premade sandbox you can play directly from the compendium.\n \"The guy has thought the whole thing out really, really nicely\"\u2014Dean Putney, Boing Boing \n\nDue to overwhelming success of this campaign, the physical compendium will be a high-quality offset print run. It will NOT be a print-on demand book, despite what the reward tier says. (I can't change that, unfortunately!) I have queried the backers, and the response was almost unanimous: offset printing is worth the additional wait.\nEach adventure has been laid out in magnificent landscape, and the whole book is packed with illustrations, start to finish.  \n(An early POD test print; not the final cover nor the final print process.)\nThe book is 112 pages, without stretch goals, and includes:\n 48 adventures, reformatted, revised for clarity, and re-edited\n Ten of the adventures have been expanded to an extra page \ntwo pages of adventure summaries so you can quickly find the perfect adventure\na detailed index of people, places, demigods and monsters that reveals the hidden links between the adventures\nup to 46 pages of stretch goals are planned, which would bring the book to 160 pages \nArmed with this material, you'll be able to quickly prep for one-shots on a moment's notice, drop fantastic encounter sites into your hex map, or dig into the world behind the words.\nAs well as compiling previously published adventures, the book includes a special scenario, A Clutch of Shadows, in which a Grinvolt garrison desperately holds a captured Dradkin sun temple against counter-attack from below.\nUnfortunately, the garrison is running out of funds\u2014and allies\u2014and treachery is everywhere. Smugglers move underworld contraband past the noses of the Grinvolt axewives, dradkin infiltrators from below move among the camps. Worst of all, Flametender Gathana's foolhardy dabbling will bring ruin to everyone.\nEveryone who backs this campaign will immediately receive the two-page Clutch of Shadows PDF. so they know what they're getting into. See the backer-only update.\nThis campaign has three tiers. If you just want to dip your toe in, pledge $1 CAD and follow along the campaign. You'll get immediate access to the Clutch of Shadows adventure location PDF, and you'll get all the updates as the campaign plunges down into the dradkin fortress (see below).\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter \nThis is the all digital rewards pledge tier. For $12 CAD (about $9 USD), you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nAccess to all unlocked stretch goals (see below) in PDF form\nThis is the limited edition hardcover compendium tier. By pledging $66 CAD (about $49 USD) plus shipping, you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nA copy of the hardcover Compendium \nAll of the stretch goals that we unlock throughout the campaign (see below)\nIf you back at this tier, the hardcover book will be shipped to your address in Canada, the USA, UK, EU countries, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Malaysia, Australia or New Zealand. \nMy plan is to run this campaign lean and mean, with sensible stretch goals that don't add a lot of risk to the project. I'd much rather you get your book quickly, so I can be back at this in a few years with more amazing material for you.\nMy main goal is paying everyone more. I've worked out a roughly proportional system with my contributors, based on the time and effort we've each put into the content. As the campaign clears its costs, the extra money will be divided up among us venal goblins to be used for good or ill.\nEven so, there are some very fun things waiting to be unlocked, my dear backers!\nStretch Goals (EVERYTHING HAS BEEN UNLOCKED!)\n UNLOCKED: An entirely new adventure, set in the aftermath of the Kickstarter campaign\n UNLOCKED: A campaign map that welds the adventures into a ready-made setting\n UNLOCKED x6!!: Two-page regional gazetteers, detailing the world section-by-section\n UNLOCKED: A short history of the lands, the underworld, and magic\n UNLOCKED: A complete bestiary of the 90+ monsters described in the adventures\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with Dungeon World stats \n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with OSR stats \n UNLOCKED: A giant table of hooks and rumors for one-shots and campaign clues\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with 5e stats! \n UNLOCKED: A map pack PDF, all the maps so you can show them to your players!\nFor details, read on! \nI did my stretch goals a little differently than some campaigns. Every time a campaign milestone was hit, it unlocked a random stretch goal. That's right, it's random. Every time a milestone is reached, I'll grab my dice and figure out which stretch goal unlocks!\nThing is, we blasted through them all. Only two formerly-random goals remain, two more two-page gazetteer entries. After that, there is one final goal. \nAll dollar amounts CAD\nThe funding milestones are hit based on the overall Kickstarter funding level. Each one unlocks a random stretch goal.\nThere are also two social media milestones, each of which revealed a dread turn of events in the 'Axewives Assemble' scenario (see below) in addition to unlocking random stretch goals. \nAs the Kickstarter campaign hits its milestones, I will reveal a new adventure map, unique to this Kickstarter campaign. Not only will it be a location, but we'll actually play it out during the campaign.\nThe dour warriors of Grinvolt have realized their position in the captured dradkin Sun Temple is untenable. The dradkin are preparing for counter-attack, and if they succeed, every life lost in taking the temple will have been for nothing. Using the last of his clout, Quarter-Lord Counobel sends word for every axewife still loyal to Grinvolt to come forth and join the battle. \"We descend!\"\nEvery backer of this campaign represents a soldier in the assault. Once the Kickstarter campaign is underway, I will reveal an illustration of the long stair down to the dradkin fortress, and the first of deadly preparations that await the forces of Grinvolt.\nWe will play out the battle that follows in the comments and updates! \nSocial Media Milestones\nAs mentioned above, two of the milestones are social media milestones. As well as unlocking stretch goals, they also have terrible effects on the battle. \nAfter the campaign, I'm taking the fully revealed map and turning it into one last adventure location for the book, representing the aftermath of the battle. Those of you who fought will have been there during the battle, but what remains afterwards?\nWill it be held proudly by Grinvolt, a beacon against the darkness of the underworld and a staging area into the Ur-Menig and beyond? Or will it be a warren of night-dark tunnels, slippery with the blood of fallen warriors? That all depends on the campaign!\nFor centuries, the Seree were the undisputed masters of the lands. But where did they come from? What did they learn, and where did they go? The Dradkin remember.\nA trove of learning has fallen into the hands of the Grinvolt force. The compendium now includes a six-page appendix describing the lands, the rise and fall of the Martoi, the Seree, and their war with the gods. The nature of the heavens and the earth themselves is revealed!\n\nI will be adding a giant table of hooks and rumors to the compendium. There will be six hooks for each adventure in the book, 294 hooks in all!\nPlanning a one-shot of Stellarium of the Vinteralf, but not sure what to tell your players about why they're there? Roll d6 or just choose among that adventure's hooks.\nDid your PCs just find a dusty old map, dusty old tome, or a dusty old tinker with a loose tongue and you need an adventure lead to spill? Roll on the full table and\u2014presto\u2014you have an instant connection to more adventure! \nEven though each adventure in the compendium is independent from the others, and meant for reskinning to homegrown settings, an implied setting has taken shape over the years. I've slowly been adding the adventures to a 'big map' that situates the adventures.\nThis map welds the adventures into a pre-built, open-world sandbox setting you can play directly from the compendium.\nIf I roll this stretch goal, the big map goes into the compendium as a full-color, full-page illustration. I'll add two versions to the book\u2014one with the adventure locations called out, and a player-safe version with only the place names, so you can share it with your adventurers.\n\n\nEach time this goal is rolled it unlocks a gazetteer entry of one of the regions of the land where the adventures are nominally set\u2014places like Strielund, the Border Lands, Claimsun of dead gods, the far blightlands from Curselake to Firevault, and cavernous Ur-Menig below them all.\nThe gazetteers build on the connecting themes between the adventures: the fractured political landscape of the north coast; lost Tealwood that slumbers under the poisons of the Martoi; the ecological warfare along the Pelaago plateau.\nEach regional gazetteer will be done up as a two-page spread, digging into the people, settlements and politics, food, wildlife, and wilderness of the area. Random tables will make it easy to use in play, with just enough text to put the results in context.\nIf your players just want to know where they can get a hot bowl of river-cabbage soup for their troubles, you'll be ready!\nWith the Dradkin laboratory breached, the Grinvolt force has won their accumulated lore. There are more than 90 new stocks, beasts, demons, animals, and aliens from the adventures, and the Dradkin Chimeromancers know them all. The compendium now includes a 20-page bestiary appendix that describes each and every one of them.\nWith this goal unlocked, the inestimable Johnstone Metzger is writing Dungeon World stats for the monsters in the bestiary! These will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nBrave warriors have allowed Johnstone Metzger to produce B/X-style stats for the bestiary! This bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nNow that we've hit $65,000 in funding, Jen Adcock is busy at work producing 5e stats for the monsters in the bestiary! The 5e-compatible bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG!  \n\nSince we've hit $80,000 CAD, all PDF and Hardcover tier backers will get a separate PDF with all the adventure location maps!\nI'll give them a once-over in Photoshop so there are no secret doors, people or monsters. This is a PDF of clean, full-size map illustrations that you can print for player hand-outs, share them on your virtual table top, or restock yourself with crazed margin notes!\nThis book would be much smaller were it not for the timely efforts of a creative bunch of collaborators and co-conspirators!\nMichael Prescott (writing, layout, illustration)\nI've been publishing Trilemma Adventures for five years, and was fortunate enough to be a winner in the One Page Dungeon Contest in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

I've had many people helping me, but at the moment I'm holding all the strings to get this thing shipped. I'm in good health, but if I'm eaten by meebs, that will be hard to overcome.\n\nI've done my best to reduce project risk to a minimum. With the exception of the 'Aftermath' adventure, all of the adventures are written, laid out and assembled, ready for final proof-reading.\n\nThe most likely risk is schedule delays arising from hitting all of the stretch goal milestones. To reduce this risk, three of the stretch goals already exist the first draft stage, and are about to go to editing. (You know, optimism.)\n\nThere are three remaining contributions required from outside parties: editing (which is required to ship the book), a dozen pieces of layout-supporting art (same), and the system stats stretch goals (which are shipped later as PDFs).\n\nDTRPG shipping can be lengthy, so if print-related errors (bleed, weird colors, etc.) are found in the test print, this could add several weeks to delivery of books to backers.\n\nMy editor (Andrew Young) has worked with me for several years; I'm able to produce the necessary art myself, and stretch goal PDF production has already begun. All other contributions are already squared away in the book.\n\nA risk to backers is complications in printing. I've selected the highest-quality option that DTRPG can produce, and I'm completely satisfied with the test prints I've received so far, but since DTRPG fulfills directly to backers, I won't see the actual books as they go out.\n\nAdditionally, as DTRPG produces each book at the closest print center to the shipping address, books for some backers will be manufactured at sites whose output I can't directly observe.\n\nA final risk to backers comes from shipping, either from damage in transit, goods never delivered, import duties if DTRRPG prints from somewhere other than where you live, or the wild card complications arising from Brexit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Axe Friend", "descp": "Join the Axewives of Grinvolt in the assault into the Dradkin fortress below the Sun Temple.

It's up to you to make them wrong again! \nThe Great Old Ones reach out from the future and into their past\u2014our present\u2014corrupting the timeline such that events and individuals turn towards the apocalyptic and lead to their inevitable rise. A small and battered resistance effort mounted by time-travelers and present-day heroes stands in their way.\nYou are those one-way travelers from a dark future and their crucial allies from the present day, working together to save the human race from looming apocalypse. Armed with foreknowledge of Judgment Day, you must succeed at a series of vital missions aimed at restoring hope to the future. \nBut the clock is ticking. The corrupting influence of the Great Old Ones is sure to affect you before the end, twisting you slowly and inexorably into something alien and unrecognizable. \nCan you defeat the vast unknowable evils of the Great Old Ones before you become a monster yourself? Find out in Fate of Cthulhu, a new stand-alone tabletop roleplaying game from Evil Hat Productions!\nAre you already a backer? Go to this backers-only post and download the prototype\u2014a completely-playable PDF of Fate of Cthulhu\u2014right now! \nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Fate of Cthulhu through them? Encourage your FLGS to back this Kickstarter at the Retailer Ally level. (If you're in the UK or EU, Leisure Games has up a page for folks interested in preordering the book. See our Shipping section further below for other options as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFate of Cthulhu is a stand-alone game powered by the Fate Core system from Evil Hat Productions. It will be around 256 pages in length, featuring color art in 6\"x9\" hardcover and digital PDF formats and a whole lot of tentacles (so, so many tentacles).\nThe idea for Fate of Cthulhu started with a simple question: what if Cthulhu operated like Skynet? In this game you'll face down Mythos-style threats with Terminator-style action and adventure, whether as a present-day Sarah Connor type, or an agent from the future already facing the creeping effects of corruption. This is Lovecraftian roleplaying made new again, with time-traveling operatives from a future apocalypse journeying back to the present day to warn others of the coming danger (and recruit them) to try to set the timeline on a new and hopefully better course.\nYou'll discover whether they succeed, and whether or not their success will lead to salvation or some fresh new horror, throughout the course of play. The future changes with each move the heroes make, the Old Ones always pushing back with their own dire countermoves, both inflicting new ripples on the timeline. Sometimes the best you can hope for is a less awful apocalypse\u2014but somewhere out beyond the dark roiling clouds and tentacle-lashed landscape of mankind's ruin, there is a glimmer of hope, thanks to your sacrifices.\nAnd the sacrifices will be many. To fight the tentacular and squamous, operatives must become so themselves. Through time travel itself or exposure to Old One threats during their missions, characters will gain strange new abilities and bizarre new anatomies as they absorb more corruption into their own flesh and psyches. In time, they might twist so far they become lost, turning into new agents of the Old Ones themselves... with any luck, they'll have a good friend nearby to put them down when it happens.\nDoes Terminator action with Lovecraftian style sound interesting to you? Learn more about Fate of Cthulhu in this Techraptor interview: PK Sullivan and Stephen Blackmoore on Fate of Cthulhu and Punching Elder Gods \nA corruption clock that fills up as you sacrifice more of your humanity to power or gain monstrous abilities (supercharged stunts), slowly transforming your character's aspects into new, corrupted versions of themselves.\nA system for tracking key events leading up to the apocalypse that the players change through their actions and choices during play, including support for ripple effects and time paradoxes.\nModifications to stress and concession rules, including support for heroic last stands that sacrifice a character but help turn the timeline towards a better outcome.\nA rituals and spells system that offers great power at a cost, treating spells as secrets of arcane Elder technology that must be sought out in play.\n Five detailed example timelines plus rules for running them and making your own.\nThe full Fate Core game system condensed to about 50 pages but still supporting the standard Core skill list, stunt building, and more.\nFate is a system focused on story, where both success and failure help to create interesting moments for players and characters. Fate models fiction, not physics. In Fate it's as much about the choices your time-traveling agents face and the story consequences of those choices, for good or ill, as it is about those visceral, dangerous fights to save the human race. (You'll get plenty of both.)\nDo you sacrifice more of your humanity to gain the abilities you need to fight the Great Old One's minions? Or do you hold on to what makes you human and avoid turning into the very monsters you fight? When you choose to stick with or go off of your mission, how does it affect the future's timeline? Fate helps generate drama by pushing play toward answering these questions.\nThat's right: you don't need to buy any other books to play Fate of Cthulhu, though you're welcome to grab other Fate products and cross-pollinate with this one. \nFate is a nimble rules-light system that uses 4 six-sided dice and a pool of tokens to advance the narrative. While you can use standard d6's or poker chips if that's your jam, we do offer our own Fate Dice\u2122 and Fate Points\u2122 which you can grab as part of the Equipment Cache and Well-Equipped Elder God Squad reward levels. We put a lot of thought into the design of these items. If you love dice and game accessories as much as we do, you'll be very happy to put these on your table top!\nThe Prototype PDF: As a backer of this project, you get immediate access to the current version of the PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes (click here, or see the link under the video up top). We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you're new to RPGs. The prototype PDF still lacks a lot of art and a few other finishing touches, but there's enough there for you to get started playing right now.\nThe Completed PDF(s): Backers at $20 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF as soon as it's ready (after we get all the missing art made). They will also receive all digital stretch goals which are unlocked during the course of this campaign.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $35 and higher will receive one (or more, depending) copy of the 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, color interior book with 256 pages and a matte finish on the cover. Will ship before the end of the year. You can increase your pledge by $35 for each additional copy you want to receive. Backers at this level also receive PDF copies of the final book and any digital stretch goals which are unlocked.\nYour choice of Fate Dice\u2122: Some of our reward tiers let you pick one of our 12-packs of Fate Dice\u2122. We offer them in a wide variety of styles (including our popular and on-theme Eldritch set). They're $15 each, so if you want some extra packs, just increase your pledge amount appropriately.\nA set of Fate Points\u2122: This past year we released our branded Fate Points\u2122 tokens, which are included on some of our reward tiers. They come 30 to a pack for $12. Want more points? Increase your pledge in $12 increments.\n\nIf you want to add any of the above items after the campaign's over, we'll make that possible with BackerKit (see \"Shipping and Fulfillment,\" below).\n UNLOCKED!\nOur first stretch goal is all about adding some extra bells and whistles to the book and showing you some horrific gratitude to boot. \nWhen we hit this goal at $30,000 the Digital Apocalypse package (available to backers at $20 and up) gets its first new items:\nA PDF of the Fate Horror Toolkit (great for use with Fate of Cthulhu!)\nA PDF of the Fate Adversary Toolkit (also great!)\n High-resolution digital wallpaper of the book's cover art to haunt your digital workspace\nThe hardcover book will get some extra bits of polish and chrome too, to up the luxe factor: \nSpot-gloss effects for the cover (similar to what we've done with gloss accents on Blades in the Dark and Scum and Villainy)\nPrinted endpapers (those are the usually-blank sheets of paper that line the inside of the cover of the book) that'll showcase the cover artwork without logos and text covering up its portentious doom\nWe'll also be able to increase the size of our initial print run and hire a professional indexer to make sure the final book's index is top notch!\nIn addition to all the above, there's a community component to this stretch goal: we'll commit to providing an open-licensable version of the system components of the game (with our setting and Cthulhu derived IP taken out, for hopefully obvious reasons). By and large, this will be a \"condensed Fate Core\" plus a couple other bells and whistles, but we think there's potentially some real value in that. Til now, Fate Accelerated has been the primary \"condensed Fate\" for folks to build their third-party Fate games from; the 50-pages-or-so version we have in Fate of Cthulhu cleaves more strongly to Fate Core's defaults, while still leaving a lot of room for original content for folks looking to build their own stand-alone Fate games. \nUNLOCKED! At $75,000 we'll add a partial preview of the Fate Accessibility Toolkit to the Digital Apocalypse package available to backers at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details on this stretch.\nUNLOCKED! At $85,000 we'll provide EPUB and Kindle formats along with our PDFs for backers receiving the Digital Apocalypse package at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details.\nStarting at $40,000 and at each $10,000 increment afterwards up to $100k, we'll expand the Digital Apocalypse package to include a new timeline by a new author, to expand your options for play. As we get closer to these goals, we'll fill you in on which Elder Gods and other doomsday threats we have for you to face.\nEach timeline will run about 24-or-so pages of material, including several new pieces of art in each. Funding for each goal will cover the writing, editing, system development, layout, art direction, artwork, and digital release costs.\nWe've lined up a diverse set of authors to uncover new dimensions of terror for you and your friends to take on.

You see what we did there.\nWe've put $20,000 of our own money into getting Fate of Cthulhu to this point. With your help we'll cross the remaining distance and get this off to press as soon as possible.\nWe already have the preliminary layout done (backers can take a look at that right now\u2014check out the linked graphic right underneath the video, up top), which includes some of the art. We'll need to give a few months for artists to finish up the rest, starting once the campaign concludes in May, if not sooner. \nThen it's off to the presses for manufacture. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that we will ship this before the end of the year. We hope to beat that estimate, of course, but when it comes to book production it's best to put a buffer into your schedule. \nYou can be confident that we'll ship on or before our estimated delivery date, because that's been our consistent track record across a dozen other campaigns in the last seven years. Just ask our backers; we keep our promises. Our two most recent campaigns, Uprising: The Dystopian RPG and Tachyon Squadron, shipped within four months of conclusion. We've got a bit more to do here on the artwork front, but we're still very far along in the process, and we're confident we have all the remaining time-factors well in hand. For Evil Hat, it's not so much Kickstarter, as Kickfinisher.\nStretch goals have a separate production timeline. We consider them truly extra content, and that means we don't start production on the stretch goals until after they fund. We may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in. \nWe're excited to see what you unlock! Once the campaign concludes we'll put together a plan for getting the funded goals done. There are a lot of moving parts to coordinate (writing, system development, editing, layout, art direction, and artwork), but since these are digital-only they're not vulnerable to any manufacturing hiccups.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up their rewards.  \nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll have the option to add on some items via BackerKit, tho for our sanity (already taxed by exposure to the dread gods) the selection will be limited. If there's something you want to have shipped along with your rewards that we don't list, just reach out and let us know.\nBased on our average shipping cost scenario in the USA, we've set up shipping costs like so:\nFor book-only shipments we're charging a flat $7 shipping fee (media mail + handling costs) for USA addresses. \nFor shipments including dice and tokens that goes up to $12 (priority mail + handling costs). \nHere\u2019s the sad part: we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the USA. Our shipping options outside of the country would cost more than the actual book in most cases (and would badly distort the funding model we're using for this campaign). However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address and then get packages delivered to it, to you. Those costs will still likely be below what we could offer!\nBack the KS at the Digital Apocalypse and get all of the digital rewards that way.\nBack the KS at $10 to get access to the prototype version of the game. Later, buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution (we sell to a variety of international distributors in Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia). Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nWait and buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution. Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately. \nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list (like with Leisure Games, see below) so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. Without this kind of communication, the chances that a store will order enough quantities for you to be able to get a copy from them go down significantly.\nLeisure Games has a page up for people in the UK or EU who are interested in preordering the hardcover. https://leisuregames.com/pages/fate-of-cthulhu \nText length limits have forced us to move our creators' bios off of this page and into a separate document!

We've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Fate of Cthulhu is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2019 and 2020. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Fate of Cthulhu to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run two or more Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 12+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction. All known omissions, contradictions, and areas of confusion have been carefully ironed out in Old-School Essentials.\nBen Milton of Questing Beast\nBen's video review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nQuesting Beast Patreon\n\nThilo Graf of Endzeitgeist\nThilo's in-depth reviews of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nEndzeitgeist Patreon\n\nSave or Die Podcast\nSave or Die review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\n\nA box full of adventure to fire up your nostalgia to the max! The Old-School Essentials core rules plus four rules modules for creating characters and running adventures in the classic fantasy genre. Each of the five books in the Black Box is described below.\nCore Rules\n72-page A5 hardcover\nThe core rules of the game, including procedures for: creating characters; exploring dungeons, the wilderness, and the high seas; combat, hazards, and challenges; retainers, hirelings, and vehicles; adventure design; magic, monsters, and treasures.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules are carefully designed to be applicable to a multitude of fantastic campaign settings and genre conventions, from Classic Fantasy to Post-Apocalyptic to Sword and Planet. Just add a book of genre rules and you're ready for adventure!\nA spread from the adventure design section\nClassic Fantasy: Genre Rules\n40-page A5 hardcover\nOptions for classic fantasy characters: classes, equipment, vehicles, hirelings, strongholds, and more. Play as a devout cleric or a sagacious magic-user, a doughty fighter or a cunning thief, a surly dwarf, a noble elf, or a homesick halfling. This book contains all character options from the Basic/Expert game.\nFull rules for character advancement to 14th level.\nThe dwarf class \u2014 all on one spread\nClassic Fantasy: Cleric and Magic-User Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\nAll 106 magic spells that can be used by clerics, magic-users, and elves, ranging from 1st to 6th level.

Includes full encounter tables by dungeon level and wilderness terrain type. This book contains all monsters from the Basic/Expert game.\nT-rex, unicorn, and vampire\nClassic Fantasy: Treasures\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by the referee\nA hoard of classic magic items, encompassing enchanted weapons and armour; magic wands, staves and rods; magical scrolls, rings, and potions; and the plethora of weird and wondrous items that don't fit into any of those categories! Includes full rules for sentient swords. This book contains all magic items from the Basic/Expert game.\nRules for sentient swords\nFor those who prefer all of their RPG rules in one book, rather than divided into modules \u2014 this is what you've been waiting for! Everything that's in the Black Box, combined into a single 256-page, A5 (Digest sized), hardcover tome.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules plus all of the classic fantasy genre content, all in one meaty hardcover book.

The final retail price will be \u20ac30.\nThere's Also a Super-Deluxe Limited Edition!\nIn conjunction with our manufacturer, we're delighted to be able to offer a super-deluxe and highly limited edition of the Rules Tome, only available to backers of this Kickstarter!\nThe limited edition book will be wrapped in luxurious black leatherette, and foil stamped with the Old-School Essentials logo plus a design based on the cover illustration. (We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

Both books will be 128+ pages in PDF and Print On Demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s in The Umerican Road Atlas?\nThe Umerican Road Atlas takes you all over this irradiated land and shows you what\u2019s what. Written by Reid San Filippo and Bob Brinkman, this book includes:\nInteresting Places to Die\nInfamous Gangs of the Wastes\nThe Random Gang Generator\n New Vehicle Rules: construction and military vehicles\n New Classes: holy roller, hunter, and road hawg\nNew Vehicular-based Mighty Deeds\n\nWhat\u2019s in Umerica Unnatural?\nUmerica is a place full of weird supernatural mysteries, and Umerica Unnatural covers them all. Written by Reid San Filippo and Forrest Aguirre, this book includes:\nRevised and Expanded Psionic rules\n Grimoire of the Wastes:  over a dozen new spells for wizards and clerics\n New Classes: wasteland psion, psi mutant, beastkin, shifter\n Cache of Astonishing Salvage: new equipment and artifacts of technology, magic, and just plain weirdness\n The Goal (WHAT\u2019S THE MONEY FOR, BUB?) \nThe plan is to produce at least two books with color covers and black and white interiors in both PDF and Print on Demand (POD) formats (available at DriveThruRPG, Amazon, and Lulu). Both books will be 128+ pages in length.\nWhat is the money for? The writing is well underway but it still needs get a full proofreading, professional layout, and a lot more awesome art put into it. Some of this is already in the works but the funds from this Kickstarter will be essential to finishing this project.\nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means NO MARK UP at all! You\u2019ll still get the books cheaper than retail!\nAs the printing will be conducted in both the USA and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers.\nIf you\u2019re still in doubt as to the quality of the work or you\u2019re not sure if the books are what you need for your game, the first update for this Kickstarter is a backers-only preview of both books\u2026 over 30+ pages each! Is it worth a $1 pledge to find out what your money will get you? Of course it is.\nHere\u2019s where things get really exciting.

A small pond, its surface decorated with lily pads with lilies in bloom. Small colorful stones decorate the pond\u2019s shoreline, water bugs swim like ballerinas dancing over glass. Then, quite suddenly, a spark of blue light flashes above the water and a Water Fairy is born. She flies around, happy at her own arrival. An Air Fairy swoops down from the sky to welcome the new Water Fairy, and they begin a dance of joy. \nAbout Fairies\nFairies: A Role Playing Game lets you experience the life of a fairy in a fictional version of earth. This comprehensive manual will give you the tools to tell a story from the point of view of a fairy. Standing only 3''-6'' in height fairies live world built by humans and face many challenges from this perspective, many of which are unforeseen.  Fairies are also naturally nonviolent and will not harm any living creature no matter how angry the housecat is. However, fairies consider themselves to be the some of the most powerful beings on earth and are not afraid to unleash their full strength if threatened by eldritch powers. \nA debut release from Spectra Games, the Fairies: A Role Playing Game core manual is a concise guide containing everything you need to play the game, giving players the ability to craft their own wonderful adventures. \nFairies: A Role Playing Game runs on an original d10 system created by the team here at Spectra Games. It is a game with focusing on storytelling as a core aspect of the game supported by optional in depth mechanics. The mechanics were meant to reflect the innate magical nature of a fairy. There are very few attributes important to fairy's, which also makes character creation a breeze. \n Sprites are the fairy's one and only stat. Fairies wink into existence, coming to life through a magical life force called sprites. Their sprites not only act as their life/hit points but also as a way for the fairy to manipulate their innate magical ability.  \n Speed determines how far fairies can fly, who goes first in battles, and how quickly they can save themselves in bad situations.\n Terrain is the landscape in which the fairy winked into existence. Being within that terrain grants the fairy a number of advantages\n Skills can give the fairy a deadly edge over enemies or perhaps your fairy enjoys building clockworks?\n Magic is almost as natural as breathing to a fairy. Each fairy has magic that will be sure to make them shine.\n\n Pledge Levels\nThe core rule book includes\n9 types of fairies to choose from.\nThe emphasis on teamwork is evident in the design of each fairy as each type of fairy has unique abilities unusable by the others.    \nAir\nBlueberry\nEarth\nFire\nLemon\nPlum\nShaper\nSpirit\nWater \nA comprehensive Fairy Market\nA-Z Creature Compendium, many of which derived from actual myths and legends\nAn adventure module to get you started in the world of Fairies. \nCheck out the current first edition on drivethruRPG https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264184/FairiesA-Role-Playing-Game\nThe System\nA Core aspect of the mechanics we wanted to reflect was that all actions have consequence, whether good or bad. Sometimes a mistake doesn't lead to more than a wounded pride, other times it can lead to losing everything. \nA successful roll will leads to higher chances of success on subsequent rolls, while failures will lower the chance of the fairy succeeding on its next actions. The higher or lower the success/failure the greater the influence it will have on the fairy's future actions. \nFairy's playing Humans\n The World of Fairies\nFairy's were among the first sentient creatures to pop into existence on earth. This makes any period in earth's history a potential campaign setting. In the medieval period, elves, fairies, gnomes, and many other creatures were well known to humans. In our modern era, fairies keep themselves hidden from humans. Fairies and other magical creatures possess a wide range of magic and skills that allows them to easily fool humans and not be seen. It wasn\u2019t always this way\u2026\nExcerpt from Fairy Queen Avarice:\n\u201cHumans have always been wary of us, and we of them. It was decided long ago, after Merlin\u2019s experiments went too far, that all magic must be stripped from the humans. They are a danger not only to our way of life\u2026 but to their own.\u201d \nFairies, since time immemorial, have been subtly manipulating the facts of the world for both the fairies benefit, while  also for the protection of others. They consider this to be a selfless act. \nWhen Human historians first started recording historical events, the fairies jumped on the opportunity to render their existence as fiction. They used their magic to manipulate authors and historians to help bury the truth about the existence of fairies, not to mention the dark magic hidden in the deepest corners of the earth.  \nShaper and Earth Fairies\nMadame Rue and her Crystal Ball\nStoryteller information:\nIn Fairies: A Role Playing Game the game master is referenced as the Storyteller since this game is meant to tell a story and is primarily story driven.

In association with In Search Of Games, LLC., a publisher of roleplaying games (RPGs), I'm developing LatchKey, a simplified, accessible role-playing experience that will introduce new players to the world of tabletop gaming.\nSet in the year 2075, you take on the role of a young adult during the rebuilding of Nashville, Tennessee three years after a civil war. Suddenly, three figures invade and split the city amongst themselves and it's up to you and your party to embark on journeys, solve mysteries, drive these mysterious intruders out of the city and restore it to normalcy.\nLatchKey is a tabletop roleplaying game I developed with the intention to initiate new players into the RPG experience. LatchKey is meant to teach new players the details about a RPG, without sacrificing the storytelling or the challenge that usually comes with an introductory game.\nWhat started out as a passion project based off an innocuous request evolved into a stunning portfolio piece during my final year of college, and now a very tangible, very real Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for it. My goal with this campaign is to print out physical books and send them out to players and RPG enthusiasts alike, and introduce them to this world that's been three years in the making.\nLatchKey comes with the following:\n - A Black & White PDF or Hardcover book containing:\n       - 6 Playable Classes\n       - An Introduction & Directions to the LatchKey Game System\n       - A 25-page introductory adventure\n       - A section on running the adventure as the Game Master (GM).\n- If you pledge $5 or more, you'll have your name in the Special Thanks section of the core rulebook.\n- If you pledge $10 or more, you get all previous rewards and a PDF Copy of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $40 or more, you get all previous rewards and a signed Hardcover Version of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $70 or more, you get all previous rewards and an exclusive LatchKey Tee.\n\n\n - If you pledge $100 or more, you get all previous rewards and your Original Latchkey Character drawn by me. (I love character design, so this is great for me!)\nA little of what I do\n- If you pledge $200 or more, you get all previous rewards and receive access to a special Discord server where I will run an exclusive scenario of LatchKey. \n(If there is not enough people to run a campaign, you'll still have access to the Discord Server and Christopher Hopkins will host a miniature press conference; min of 3 players)\n\nIf we surpass our goals I have a few ideas in mind to show you all:\n       - $2,000 - I'll create a comic based on the world of LatchKey. It will be a limited         series of 5 issues detailing the underlying story of post-war Nashville.\n       - $3,000 - Along with In Search of Games, we'll be publishing a second adventure book, with non-canon scenarios by guest writers and illustrators.\n       - $4,500 - Collaborating with In Search of Games again, we'll be publishing a third book of non-canon scenarios by more guest writers and illustrators.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my very first Kickstarter.

It's challenging, but nothing good stories and great gameplay can't handle.\n\nThe main obstacle here is the funding for physical printing. I want to deliver a hardcover book to all players, both new and old, and introduce them to this world of war, danger, and family ties.\n\nThis is really big jump for me.

You are running to a place you\u2019ve never seen, somewhere past the mountains you\u2019ve never crossed.\nThe 24\"x36\" map of Stonewater is included at the Stonewater High Council backer level and presents players with random siege-weapon attacks; a gigantic hornets' nest with very cranky residents; critical high ground space; a field of strange wildflowers with butterflies that are rather clingy; crystals that trigger random spells; a blood-filled moat; and much, much more. Art by ilCorvo Artworks.\nThe journey will take weeks, and the way is full of danger. Shadowforde is weak and ill. The king\u2019s men are hunting you. \nAnd you are searching for a legend. \nThis is The Exodus of Wolfbane, an epic 0- to 2nd-level adventure compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2122 roleplaying game. The module features a hefty 56 pages of adventure, illustrations, player handouts, and supplements, including the popular Encounter Cards we introduced in our first project, The Peasants' Fell Bargain. Your peasants will become hardened heroes as they battle strange monsters, harsh elements, and the king\u2019s cruel soldiers. You will grapple with mysteries, hauntings, moral dilemmas, and death-defying chases.\nAnd what will be waiting for you if you manage to reach Stonewater?\nTake the journey and find out! \nMeaningful Motivations\nAs with our first module, The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, The Exodus of Wolfbane is designed to give your player-characters compelling reasons for going on this adventure. You are trying to save your friends and family, men, women, and children, and protect the strange man who has cared for your village for decades. Merciless soldiers dog your every footstep. \nThe Exodus of Wolfbane is a funnel that doesn\u2019t end when you reach first level because the exodus doesn\u2019t end. It is long and dangerous, and your goal isn\u2019t treasure or experience points.\nIt\u2019s survival. \nUnique Game Mechanics\nIn The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, we introduced the fell bargain table to help you add diabolical deals with the devil into your own games. Well, we are pulling out all the stops in The Exodus of Wolfbane, beginning with character creation. Your exodus begins with the razing of Wolfbane, so the peasants you play will be drawn from those lucky enough to survive the onslaught of King Haveron\u2019s men.\nAlong the way, you will need to keep up the morale of the survivors, combining creative roleplay with some lucky dice rolling to lift your desperate band\u2019s spirits.\nAnd you will need this same creativity and luck to care for the ailing Shadowforde, maintain your wagons, and find the food and water you need to survive.\nIn other words, surviving the exodus will require courage, ingenuity, and good fortune: all of the qualities that can transform lowly peasants into the stuff of legends.\nJoin the Exodus of Wolfbane, and find out if the road to Stonewater leads to sanctuary or perdition. \nStretch Goals\n$3,000 Some Paint for the Wagon: Gaming Honors Decal.

Magic is mysterious and powerful, monsters are menacing and unpredictable, and Luck matters\u2014A LOT more than min-maxing and statistical analysis.

Als Mitglied des Ordens der Sonnenkreuzes hat euch der Vorsteher des Ordens zur Hilfe gerufen.\nSeitenumfang\nDas eigentliche Abenteuer umfasst 14 Seiten, daran schlie\u00dfen sich noch die Maps an, womit es insgesamt ein 20-seitiges Heft, Gr\u00f6\u00dfe DIN A4 wird.\nSeite aus dem Abenteuer\nLandkarte & Maps\nDie Gebietskarte zeigt die Umgebung, in der das Abenteuer spielt (wie eine Landkarte). Die einzelnen Maps sind daf\u00fcr gedacht, dass die Charaktere mit ihrer Umgebung interagieren, die Spielleitung noch genauer den Ort beschreiben kann und vor allem, dass auf den Maps direkt gespielt werden kann, sei es mit Miniaturen, Papp-Aufstellern,...

Deshalb ist ein Playtest nat\u00fcrlich auch notwendig, was wiederum Zeit kostet, aber letzten Endes der Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle dient.\nZur Erstellung von Karten und Maps nutze ich bew\u00e4hrte Tools.

One day a thunderous howl echoes across the land. \nA flicker\u2026 a shudder. Then. Darkness. \nEven torches threaten to burn out as the creatures of the black Void crawl out to consume all they can catch. \nCan you relight the beacon of salvation before all you know and love is devoured by the crawling dark?\n\nA DCC Funnel Adventure\nCharacter Creation Should Be An Adventure\nA discovery, not a slog.\nSoul for the Ocean Dark is a 0 level funnel adventure designed for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG system. It is the story of an impossible call to adventure with the highest of stakes: save a world interrupted, or face certain doom. \nPlayers will create characters from a dark and isolated world which has never known a sun. A towering, mystical lighthouse provides the closest thing to natural light for this world. Since time immemorial, it has pushed back against the oppressive darkness of the Void, providing salvation from the endless horrors that await in the dark. Suddenly, the world is plunged into darkness. With the hope of their people on their shoulders, and sputtering torches in their hands, the players must seek the missing light. \nFrom a dark and grim foray through the Fungus Wilds, to consoling a god, to besting a tempest storm \u2013 players must gather all of their wits and resolve to face their destiny. \nJudges, get your players ready for 20+ pages of adventure! \nIn Soul for the Ocean Dark, the archipelago dotting the Shadow Sea is a hidden legend unto itself. Created eons ago by a pair of gods, not everything went according to plan. Even gods have limits, and the growth of this world has long been stilted. The ancient village of Omera\u2019Palissada has always been on a razor\u2019s edge of survival, fishing the dark waters for sustenance under the unfaltering lighthouse of their patron gods.\nAdventure Book Cover\nWith the light suddenly gone, your players must find a way to restore it. They will set forth on a daunting quest to face their gods and return the divine power to the Lighthouse. This will not be easy, as the deep darkness is home to supernatural creatures long kept at bay, eager to take advantage of this sudden boon. The pincers of Giant Crabstosities, the swooping jaws of Boros, the gnashing teeth of Oki \u2013 some of these monsters are driven by hunger, others compelled by divine force. Whatever their motivation, they eagerly await in the shadows.\nFuel your imagination with inset black and white illustrations of the village, the monsters, maps of ancient ruins, island sea charts, and more.\nDon\u2019t Just Write your Backstory\u2026 LIVE your Backstory\nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG is a d20 RPG system that was crafted by Goodman Games as a homage to the earliest editions of D&D. It is a return to combating capricious dice as much as monsters. Players delve into dungeons and exotic locations for treasure and glory.\nDCC has a few unique features which set it apart from D&D. Players start with not one character, but several. The first adventure played is called a \u201cFunnel.\" This is a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d tale and a time of desperate survival, where life is cheap and only the heroic survive. Depending on the size of the party, each player starts out controlling 2-4 player characters.\nCharacter Generation\nCharacters are generated almost completely by rolls of the dice. This liberates players from the catch-22 of needing to know how to play to build their characters before they play. Characters are not yet heroes, so they are easy to relate to and easier to play.\nHere at The Keep Studios we LOVE funnels as a method of creating characters. It\u2019s a fantastic way for new players to jump in and get straight to the meat of the game. Don\u2019t just write your backstory\u2026 LIVE your backstory! \nYou can learn more about the DCC system at Goodman Games.\nWe have also written a quickstart guide on our website, including some tips for people new to RPGs in general: Starting out with DCC.\nFrancisco Duarte returns with a new adventure!\nFrancisco Duarte is a Portuguese sci-fi and fantasy author, and the creator of The Keep Studios\u2019 first Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure - Sword in Jungle Deep. Francisco lives in Aveiro, Portugal, with his girlfriend, Marta. When he\u2019s not writing he usually enjoys reading and playing RPGs and other tabletop games with his friends. He has written several short stories for tabletop and video games, as well as one sci-fi novella. \nBeing a trained anthropologist, he draws inspiration from myths and cultures from all over the world, meshing them into unique realms that come alive in front of the reader\u2019s eyes. He then creates realistic characters to face the overwhelming odds of surviving in such settings. Not all get to survive, but without some challenge what\u2019s the fun of living?\nMeet our artists\nCover Art and Cartography By Alena Lane\nThe artists from our first book, Sword in the Jungle Deep, return for our second adventure!\nAlena Lane's artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAlena Lane has already completed the stunning cover art for our book, and will be once again taking the lead on all of the interior maps. Her map for Sword in the Jungle Deep may be one of our favorite pieces.\nWe can't wait to share more of her work with you once it's complete, but for now you can get more of a taste for her art on her Instagram.\nProgression of the cover art of Soul for the Ocean Dark\nLonny Chant Returns as our Interior Illustrator\nWe love his linework and the striking contrasts in his black and white pieces. We can't wait to see his take on our new adventure.\nLonny Chant's Artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nThe PDF\nThe PDF will contain all the content of the print edition in a digital download format. Great for reading on a mobile device while on the go.\nThe Book\nThe book will be a high quality perfect bound adventure module, with glossy cardstock color cover and 20+ pages of high quality paper with crisp black and white text and illustrations. This book will feel nice in your hands, and will be something to be proud of having on your shelf.\nThe Monster and Encounter Cards\nTwo of our stretch goals are to fund the creation of physical artifacts to help you run the game: \"Monster\" and\" Encounter\" cards. The cards are planned to be standard US playing card size with embossed printing to give you the highest quality experience.\nWhen the first goal is reached, the smaller set of Monster Cards will act as handy reference guides for the monsters' stats and appearance. Having a fast, clear and attractive reference during fights will improve the gameplay experience.\nUpon successful funding of the next stretch goal, the Monster Cards would be available as a stand alone set, but would also be folded into a higher tier reward item including all possible encounters; e.g., traps, pitfalls, and natural phenomenon. This \"Encounter Deck\" will allow you to draw cards instead of rolling on tables for the many possible encounters while exploring the world. Let the players draw their own encounters, and survive the fickle fate they have brought on themselves! \nArt Prints\nThese canvas prints will feature the cover art in a high quality wall mountable format. We're working with printers to produce prints ready to be hung on walls as an eye-catching collectible. We have selected a standard 11 x 14 inch format to fit nicely amongst any decor.\nShipping\n\"Early Bird\" Reward Tier\nThis tier includes a book produced for you \u201cAt-Cost.\u201d As normal, you pay your pledge here on Kickstarter, and when your rewards are ready, you will receive a link to finish your order with DriveThruRPG. In this way you will be paying DriveThruRPG directly for the actual printing costs with no mark-up from us! This is part of our \u201cThank you\u201d to our Early Bird backers. Also, your shipping charges will be accurate as you will be able to provide up-to-date shipping information.\n\"The Curious\" and Higher Tiers  \nWe'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up-to-date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.\nSee the FAQ section for more details on our approach to shipping.\n \nStretch Goals -  Higher funding means even better rewards \n$1500: UNLOCKED Custom Level 0 Professions - A custom table of professions in the setting of the world for generating characters.\n$2000: UNLOCKED 5e Compatibility - Encounter conversions for playing with the 5e SRD games.\n$3000: UNLOCKED Monster Cards - A card set containing all the monsters encountered in the adventure.

Every so often, we create fantastic story ideas that we burn to share!\nOur First Adventure Book - Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAfter a lot of blood, sweat and tears, we crafted our first adventure, Sword in the Jungle Deep. This taught us a lot about adventure book production, and we\u2019re using this experience to expand our catalog with your help.\nSword in the Jungle Deep was reviewed by the fine folks over at Spellburn, a DCC centered podcast. Here are some of the things they had to say:\n \u201cA really nice classic Appendix N feel\u2026 very Conan wandering around in the jungle, looking for the lost temple... A great classic, old school feel\u2026 Keep \u2018em coming!\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cA funnel adventure\u2026 that I think you could run as a first level adventure.\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cThe art on the inside is really quite lovely, and I especially like the cartography of the main map, it very much has the DCC vibe\u2026 In terms of content\u2026 it has this really kind of  nice, pulpy, Appendix N vibe to it. .. and what cracked me up\u2026  at the end of every box text, there\u2019s a little TLDR section which I thought was hilarious\u2026  and actually very clever and helpful.. at the table.\u201d Judge Jeff\nThey also had some great constructive feedback that we have considered while developing Soul for the Ocean Dark. You can listen to the episode here. (They review Sword in the Jungle Deep starting at the 13:35 mark.)\nOur Online Community\nThe Keep Studios also fosters an online community via a Discord server and a Twitch channel. We love table top RPG\u2019s, but that\u2019s not all! Our company members and affiliates also enjoy playing and sharing various video games, including retro, indie, and mainstream hits. Naturally, we also stream some of our tabletop campaigns. You can visit our website to learn more about us, and to find links to Discord and Twitch. www.thekeepstudios.com\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat will the Kickstarter funds be used for?\nSimple: Artwork, printing of backer rewards, and writers for stretch goals. The adventure is written, layout is complete, and the artists are at the ready to complete the original illustrations.\nFunds will be set aside to print all of the backer rewards. We plan to use DriveThruRPG's fulfillment services, meaning we can print our small-run books with lower overhead and ship them reliably all with less cost to you.  \nA sizeable allocation of funds is also necessary to pay our contracted artists and writers. We have a good working relationship with our artists and writers, and they have always astonished us with their results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019re big fans of Kickstarter both as consumers and publishers. Heck, some of our favorite projects such as Mutant Crawl Classics, Numenera and Strongholds and Followers were kick-started. Inspired by these examples. we have decided to follow in the footsteps of giants.\n\nCan I use this for my level 1 party?\nYES! We've made sure to include \"Hooks for Established Parties\" right in the book's introduction section.\n\nWhat if I play D&D or another 5e SRD compatible game and not DCC?\nOne of our lower level stretch goals is to add in a supplement to make 5e SRD compatible versions of all the encounters. We've already written a free guide on using any DCC funnel (especially this one!) to transform character creation itself into an adventure within the 5e rules. Read about it here!\n\nWhy are you invoicing shipping separately?\nShipping is always tricky business when it comes to Kickstarter, and many projects have failed by not properly taking care of shipping expenses. Often, backers have a change of address before a project\u2019s rewards are complete. In those situations, we wouldn\u2019t want to overcharge a backer for shipping, or have to bill backers for small discrepancies in actual shipping costs. For small changes we would feel compelled to eat the cost, and small changes can add up to a lot on our end. \nKickstarter campaigns can elect to include collecting shipping funds, but did you know that counts towards your total pledge? This can artificially inflate goal completion, making it appear that we have more raw capital to work with than we really do. We could try to estimate shipping costs, and increase our goal amount accordingly, but an estimate is an estimate, and that means that it's much harder for us to give our backers a genuine view of what we really need to fund our rewards.\nTo avoid all this we're separating shipping funds entirely. We'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up to date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already published our first adventure book, and at this stage of development in our second adventure book, the risks are low. However when dealing with any kind of custom creation, setbacks can occur.\n\nPrinting and Shipping: As mentioned earlier, we plan to use DriveThruRPG\u2019s fulfillment services. DrivethruRPG is a reliable service that serves thousands of publishers with an excellent track record. However DriveThruRPG is separate from ourselves, and so if they face delays for any reason, so would we. The total demand we place on them is also contingent on the amount of rewards we need to fulfill, including possible successful stretch goals. Though we\u2019ve always had good results from DrivethruRPG, we cannot be sure how long a large print run would take, as we have yet to use them for backer reward fulfillment. For backup, we have established contact with a local print house. In this case, we would ship US orders from our home base, and we should also be able to ship to the EU via an agent in Portugal.\n\nArtist Timelines: Our artists are trusted and reliable external contractors, which works well for us in that we only need to call on them when the other parts of our project are ready to integrate with the artwork. Naturally any contract work means we have to negotiate with a freelancer\u2019s timeline. We have reasonable assurances that they will be able to complete their work, and we also have backup artists on the line just in case a personal emergency or some other interruption should occur. Any of these scenarios would not cause the project to fail, however, as we always pay upon receiving the artwork, so in this way no backer funds would be lost.\n\nLong story short, our anticipated possible road bumps would be delays, not outright failures. In any event, we would keep our backers informed regularly through our \u201cUpdates\u201d page.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Fan", "descp": "Get A Personalized Thank You Message From Us!\nINCLUDES:\nA Personalized Thank You Message", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Merchant", "descp": "This tier is for retailers who can provide proof of re-seller status.

Swords and Sorcery and Metal Gods. Danger, treasure, blood and glory all mixed in a blender and served up in golden Ur-Hadad, the First City of Ore. Enter, if you dare, the bitchin' mural on the side of your cousin's Ford custom van. Enter the world of the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad.\"\nBack in 2012, those words, written by the Rev. Dr. Edgar Johnson, ignited a fire that would set the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG community ablaze. First, it was a rallying cry that assembled the greatest group of gamers I've ever been privileged to game with. Then, in 2014 through 2015, it became a sort of mission statement for the zine that would bear the name of that gaming group, the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad. The Metal Gods zine was a fire that burned brightly for three issues, then that fire dimmed and has been a brightly-glowing ember these past four years. \nThe time to reignite the fire is now!\nThis year, just in time for Kickstarter's ZineQuest, the original creative team behind the Metal Gods zine (Wayne Snyder, Edgar Johnson & Adam Muszkiewicz) are getting the band back together for three fantastic new issues. We'll be collaborating with some of our favorite people in gaming, artists and writers alike, to not just bring back the Metal Gods, but to up the ante. Here's what's in store for you:\nIssue #4: Time of Crisis!\nLike any other multiversal hyper-megalopolis, Ur-Hadad is no stranger to calamity. In fact, crisis is one of the First City's defining features! This issue provides a whole slew of tools for Judges to use to spin up their campaigns from small adventures into city-wide, culture-shaking phenomena! Including profiles of Ur-Hadad's most notorious crises and their causes (along with special rules introduced by each) and a Crisis Generator, this issue is all about turning your game up to 11!\nThis issue is almost completely written and will be ready for art & layout soon. It'll be 32 pages long and feature art from Tristan Bell and Diogo Nogueira among others.\nDiogo's centerpiece illustration for issue #4\nIssue #5: Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad\nFirst, we gave you Street Kids of Ur-Hadad. Then we gave you The Heist! Metal Gods has always focused on urban adventures and now we're taking them one step beyond! In Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad, we'll present a system for running a thieves guild, assassins coven, coterie of smugglers or however your criminal taste run. This unique system builds on some trends already out there in the greater DCC-o-sphere, bringing them together in a tight, cohesive package. You'll also get to know the seedy underbelly of the First City, including profiles on some of her most notorious gangs. \nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Summer and Doug Kovacs has signed on to do the cover! We've also got Evlyn Moreau doing this issue's centerpiece illustration and it looks like this issue is on track to reach 32 pages. \nDoug Kovacs's cover for issue #5\nIssue #6: Mysterious Gods of Ur-Hadad\nFrom the Avenue of One Thousand Gods to the Gloaming Deeps beneath the city's docks, cults and mystery faiths permeate Hadadi society. In this issue, we'll explore some of the First City's stranger religions and sects, from the austere followers of the God of Blackened Skies to the debaucherous Last Adherents of the Sensate, we'll profile these bizarre faiths and how to use them in your game. We'll also include rules to integrate cults into your Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad game, whether as foes or as your PCs' crew!\nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Autumn. It will feature cover and centerpiece illustrations by Luka Rejec! Other artists include Tristan Bell, Craig Brasco and of course our own Wayne Snyder. \nWhat's Different This Time Around?\nA bunch of stuff is different. First, we have a plan. The first time around, we did stuff when we wanted to, but didn't have a clear vision of where we were going. We do now. \nAlso, we're expanding our circle of collaborators. Previously, Wayne had done all of the art for every issue of Metal Gods, but this time around, we're going to be hiring some artists who'll be contributing illustrations through out all three issues we're funding. The funding for some of these artists is baked into our initial ask, but some are reserved for Stretch Goals (see below) because of how much their contributions will add to the final package. Having more artists involved will certainly increase our turn-around time, something I'm sure our fans are looking forward to. \nWe're also upping our production game here. We're bringing the page count of each issue up to 28 pages from 24, and there's a chance that #5 & #6 will surpass that. We've had a bunch of little ideas on how to increase the quality of the zines out of the gate, and this Kickstarter will allow us the opportunity to explore some of those and we'll be filling you in when they become a reality. \nStretchgoals\nIf we surpass our initial funding goals, we have some great plans for making the zines even better. \nSo far, we've crushed the following goals:\n$1,400 - Luka Rejec of Wizard, Thief, Fighter will do the cover to Issue #6!\n$1,650 - Luka will also do a full-spread centerpiece illustration for Issue #6 \n$2,000 - We bring in the fantastic Craig Brasco for more art for all three issues\n$2,250 - Every physical reward tier (all of them but the digital tiers) will include a Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad vinyl sticker\nThere were even some goals I didn't even have a chance to post before you all smashed them! At $2,500, you unlocked a new centerpiece illustration for Issue #4 by none other than the Metal Gods' own Diogo Nogueira! We've also unlocked some more  vinyl stickers,  one themed after each of the new issues (four stickers in total!). There's also a super-secret hidden Stretchgoal known only to Wayne and myself. We'll tell you when it's unlocked because it's just too awesome to even hint at.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIssue #4 is almost finished being written and will happen anyway, so our biggest challenges are slow-downs at the development or writing stages for Issues #5 & 6. Art could also slow the process down, but that's one of the reasons that we're doing this Kickstarter, to be able to spread the work out over more artists than normal. Basically, we see the completion of the products as inevitable, but there are few places where things could slow down a bit.

The catch?  Each player is a unique voice in one man's head. \nUPDATE - NEW ADD-ON!\nThe Old and The New\nIn the early 2000's, an indie RPG called Everyone is John began making its way across the convention circuit.  It was strange, unique, and a ton of fun.  You could play it with scratch paper and a couple of six-sided dice. Slowly, surely - this quick-hit RPG became a genuine cult-classic.\nWe are proud to bring you this new edition of that cult-classic RPG with over 40 pages of new material an extra content!  The game has been heavily expanded with enhanced rules refined through hundreds of hours of playtesting to provide the best game experience, ready-to-use character and GM sheets, original art, gameplay examples, and numerous adventure seeds to entice players and game masters.  \nAdditionally, the book expands the world of Everyone is John with sections on running an adventure in worlds of Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror, and other settings - with detailed rules for each, such as letting John cast magical spells, use super-heroic powers, or deal with mind-altering attacks on his sanity!\nThe Game\nEveryone is John is a fast and fun competitive RPG where each player assumes the identity of a \"Voice\" inside the head of John - a man with no real identity of his own. John's actions, skills, knowledge, and goals change constantly as the voices in his head vie for control of him by using their own finite willpower. Each voice will struggle to achieve their own obsessive goals before all Willpower is gone and the game is over - with only one Voice left as the victor. \nEveryone is John is a fast, fun game that lets players create their Voices in just a few minutes, and begin play right away.    It's the ultimate pickup RPG. But you know what? We can tell you all this... but we'd rather just show you...\nOur Pledge for Your Pledge\nYou see, this book is already fully written and ready to send to the publisher.  And when you back this kickstarter at our $5 level or above, we will immediately share with you a digital copy of the core rules.

But these entities are also shrewd opportunists. Many of them see humans as a resource to be harvested, corrupted or enlisted for their dark plots. Humanity, with all its noble aspirations, has many flaws. Greed, lust, envy, hatred and fear are ripe fruits for these forces to exploit. Division and separation makes the humans easier to control. While the best of humankind fights for just laws and civilization, those who cling to power and privilege stand ready to quash protections for those who need them most. In the shadows of human injustice lurk loathsome, inhuman entities. As investigators square off against the worst aspects of mankind, they also find themselves entangled with the parasitic powers of the Mythos.\nWelcome to An Inner Darkness, from Golden Goblin Press.  \nThis is collection of Classic 1920\u2019s era scenarios of 7th edition the Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game (published by Chaosium, Inc) with several goals in mind. We hope to present well researched, historically accurate and challenging adventures, with a slightly darker, harsher and more brutal tone than our fans might be used to. For Golden Goblin Press, this will be a more mature book, one focused on adult themes, designed to spark deep conversations among your players for years to come.  \nThese scenarios will of course feature the malignant taint of the Cthulhu Mythos, but at the forefront of each will be one or more examples of social injustice, societal corruption, and mankind\u2019s inhumanity to man. The 1920\u2019s was a period of great social upheaval in America, when the borders between classes, races, and genders were changed. In this time of social upheaval and chaos, eldritch forces found fertile ground to exploit us. Mankind is never so vulnerable than when we are divided from within. \nWhen this Lousy War is Over, by Brian M. Sammons \u2013 Arkham, Massachusetts, 1923. At the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars association, men who fought in the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d gather together, seeking a bit of solace from those who\u2019ve shared similar experiences. Many are wounded in body, in mind, and in spirit. Many suffer from horrifying nightmares, violent outbursts, disfiguring injuries, or alcoholism, but their pain and struggles are mostly ignored by society. They are reminded that the war is over, and told to just \u201cget over it\u201d by a public who finds it all too easy to judge. Then, chapter members start to mysteriously die in violent and terrible ways, with clues pointing to the occult, possibly involving a member of the association no less! Can the investigators find those responsible and stop them, before it\u2019s too late?\nThey Are From Away, by Charles Gerard - Bangor, Maine, 1923. Maine has become a major battleground for the Ku Klux Klan. Protestant nativists have grown fearful about the recent influx of Catholic Immigrants, mostly Irish and French-Canadians. This provides the KKK with fertile ground for spreading their message of hate, division, and violence. Enter Eugene Farnsworth, a charismatic former stage magician, hypnotist and filmmaker, now known as King Kleagle, the head KKK recruiter for Maine. He hosts \u201cwholesome\u201d public events while spearheading an aggressive recruitment drive, making alliances with area politicians and heads of industry. Meanwhile, macabre, inexplicable and unnatural events begin to occur, aimed at humiliating and terrorizing the area\u2019s Catholic citizens. Investigators must discover if there is a link between the two, and find a way to stop it if they can. \n\nFire Without Light, by Helen Gould - Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1922. Less than a year has passed since the Tulsa Race Massacre, when the wealthiest black community in the United States was destroyed and hundreds of innocent people were murdered by rampaging white mobs. Though most of the 10,000 black residents left Tulsa, some remained to rebuild their devastated community. Now tensions are on the rise once again. A new pastor and his wife have arrived, preaching hate and violence to the white population. Their congregation is growing at an alarming rate, and violence is spilling out from their church and into the streets. Strangely, even families and friends of the same race are turning against each other. Something very wrong is going on here. Investigators must tread carefully to discover just who - or what - is fanning the flames, pushing the citizens of Tulsa towards another wave of catastrophic violence.  \nA Fresh Coat Of White Paint, by Jeff Moeller - Los Angeles, California, 1931. Early in the Great Depression, the U.S. institutes its first mass deportation policy, supported by a cross-section of interests such as racist nationalists, eugenicists, paternalistic \"charities\", and labor unions \"looking out for their own.\" This leads to a roundup of thousands of ethnically Mexican families, many of them U.S. citizens, carried out federal employees, local police, various \"charities\", and outright vigilante groups. The deportees were (sometimes) given summary hearings, detained in makeshift conditions, and then loaded onto trains. On the outskirts of Los Angeles, one such \"charity\" is refurbishing an old prison to \"give the unfortunates somewhere to stay.\" However, this long abandoned facility has a dark past, which is quickly becoming a horrible, otherworldly nightmare for those interred there. Can the investigators get to the bottom of things in time to save the prisoners?  \n A Family Way, by Oscar Rios \u2013 New York, New York, 1925. The investigators must come to the aid of a dear friend, a student at Columbia University. She\u2019s found herself \"in trouble\" after what should have been a harmless girls' night out. Her group ended up drinking and dancing with the wrong sort of fellas, the kind willing to slip them a mickey and take what they wanted from their unconscious victims. Now the girls need help, as the authorities won't act, or even take their stories seriously. These men have deep pockets, powerful allies, and dark secrets. When the men return with offers of marriage and gifts of strange, pale gold jewelry, it becomes clear they aren't the sort to take no for an answer. There aren\u2019t many options for girls in their \u201ccondition\u201d, and one of the few happens to be illegal. But your friend just wants this nightmare to be over, if such a thing is still even possible.   \nDreams of Silk, by Christopher Smith Adair \u2013 Pennsylvania, 1922. The cosmetics industry is growing fast, as the public\u2019s obsession with youth and beauty grows. As profits soar and businesses expand workers at such companies suffer due to lax regulations and poor conditions. At Hempstead Cosmetics, located in Brights Mill, Pennsylvania, a state infamous among labor advocates, conditions are especially bad. Local government turns a blind eye to protect their economic boom, ignoring any indiscretions or complaints against chemist and owner Mervyn Hempstead. Consumers marvel at their newest skin cream, promising to give a complexion as smooth as dreams of silk, and the youthful glow of Imelda Hempstead, Mervyn\u2019s wife and chief model.  Meanwhile, his employee\u2019s bodies and minds deteriorate and their complaints of rashes and troubled sleep are ignored.  But things are much worse than anyone can possibly imagine, as they are drawn into a web of literal nightmares as unspeakable horrors from beyond our reality are tied to Hempstead Cosmetics' \u201cmiraculous\u201d secret ingredients.  \nWe have some wonderful authors, editors, artists, cartographers, and designers who are already hard at work on this project. They are: \nBrian M. Sammons - is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and Golden Goblin Press. He has penned stories that have appeared in a number of publications and has edited the books Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, Edge of Sundown, Steampunk Cthulhu, Dark Rites of Cthulhu, Atomic Age Cthulhu, World War Cthulhu, Flesh Like Smoke, Return of the Old Ones, Children of Gla\u2019aki, Dread Shadows in Paradise, and more. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Strange Aeons II, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.\nWhy \"When this Lousy War is Over\"\u2013 War and horror and the horrors of war have always fascinated. Just see a fiction anthology I did called World War Cthulhu for proof. Or a Call of Cthulhu scenario I did for Strange Aeons II set in another forgotten war, Korea. And make no mistake, The Great War is largely forgotten today as are some of the barbaric treatments and practices used to patch up those mutilated by it in both body and mind. As for veterans, they have always been forgotten. For a country that seems so proud of its military might, the way America treats those who fought after the fight is over is just disgraceful. So I wanted to tell a tale of brave men, damaged men, marginalized and purposely forgotten men having to face the horrors of the everyday, and those from beyond, too.   \nBrian Sammons\nCharles Gerard - is a Franco-American Mainer, writer and journalist based in New York City. Relentless curiosity is both his superpower and his fatal flaw. In the tabletop gaming realm, he has published work with Sentinel Hill Press, Cubicle 7, and the Dungeon Masters Guild, and has a scenario in Golden Goblin Press\u2019 forthcoming Invictus scenario book, No Faith in Appearances. He is a co-host of the Miskatonic University Podcast, as Keeper Chad.\n  Why \"They Are From Away\" - I wrote \"They Are From Away\" to shed light on the intractable, repeating history of nativism, xenophobia, and bigotry against religious and ethnic groups. In this scenario, I am proud and honored to explore the heritage of my francophone, working-class grandparents and forebearers in my home state of Maine. They toiled as low-wage woodcutters, builders and mill workers during a time of great prosperity for the timber and manufacturing industries. But the French-speaking residents of Maine, along with other immigrant groups, faced discrimination, harassment, and humiliation by those who feared newcomers might upset a social order tilted heavily in their favor. That time in Maine\u2019s history, with charlatans whipping up conspiracy theories, distrust, and intolerance of outsiders, strikes me as a crucial reminder that monsters of inhumanity thrive on forgetfulness, and they never truly sleep.    \nCharles Gerard\nHelen Gould - is a black British writer and editor focusing on poetry, horror, and tabletop roleplaying. She's contributed to games from Black Armada; Rowan, Rook and Decard; Stygian Fox; and Graham Walmsley's Cthuhlu Dark. You can also listen to her playing Pathfinder over on The Rusty Quill gaming podcast.\n\nWhy \"Fire Without Light\" - I wrote this to explore the culpability of white women and the middle class in propagating racism. Too often, the image that people hold of a racist is an angry, working class white man, when the reality is that it is just as likely to be a well-spoken professional white woman or an educated white male professor. The scenario is also a response to the prevailing notion of racism as something done by people who don't know any better or who didn't really mean it. They do mean it, and the infantilising assumption that racism is an accident is incredibly dangerous.   \nHelen Gould\n Jeffrey Moeller - Is a cis-male, middle-aged Caucasian father of five who lives in Cleveland but considers Alaska home. He is the author of dozens of published Call of Cthulhu scenarios, is a frequent Golden Goblin Press contributor, and won a 2017 ENNIE for The Things We Leave Behind, along with Oscar and Brian.\nWhy \"A Fresh Coat of White Paint\" - If you want to blame someone for this collection, blame me; I pushed for it. My day job is immigration attorney, and I've represented detained immigrants before. Originally this was going to be set in the modern day, in a children's detention camp (administered as is often the case by a \"charity\") along the Mexican border. Oscar asked me to set it in the Classic era, and I was horrified to read about what went on in 1907 and 1931 Los Angeles, with itinerant populations, forced labor and the Mexican \"repatriation\". People think of California as a bastion of liberalism today, so a history lesson seemed in order.   \nJeffery Moeller\n Oscar Rios \u2013 This native New Yorker and Hispanic-American cosmic horror writer is the author of more than ninety scenarios for Call of Cthulhu, including the campaigns Ripples from Carcosa and The Legacy of Arrius Lurco. He is also the President of Chaosium licensee, Golden Goblin Press.\nWhy \u201cA Family Way\u201d \u2013 I wrote this scenario back in 2007, and have only run it a handful of times. I wanted to explore something truly horrific, namely rape, its aftermath, and the terrible choice a woman faces should a pregnancy result from the attack. Compound that horror with others taking that choice away from the victim, and the health and legal risks involved with getting an abortion in the 1920\u2019s, and you find yourself in a very dark, very real place. I swore I\u2019d never publish \u201cA Family Way\u201d, because I was afraid. There were arsonist attacks in Austin and Virginia Beach on women\u2019s health clinics about the time I wrote this. I am ashamed, and the telling of this tale is long overdue.   \nOscar Rios\n\nChristopher Smith Adair \u2013 Christopher has written numerous scenarios and articles for Call of Cthulhu, both for Chaosium and a number of its licensees. This includes the upcoming Pulp Cthulhu campaign A Cold Fire Within. They are currently tinkering away on their own game-design ideas in what spare time remains.\n  Why \u201cLike Dreams of Silk\u201d \u2013 Work takes up an enormous part of our lives. It affects everything. Often, we do it simply for our survival and that of our loved ones, hoping that our sacrifice results in better days. Some are privileged to do something they love or that is meaningful. But too often the work we do to live is itself detrimental to our well-being. The history of labor is full of horror stories, and that continues to this day. The \u201cworkplace horror\u201d sub-genre hasn\u2019t been explored as much as it could be in fiction and, especially, roleplaying games. And while this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve touched on this subject, I\u2019ve been looking for the right opportunity to make it the centerpiece. \nChristopher Smith Adair\nMark Shireman  -  is a graphic design professional (and secret cultist of Nyarlathotep) with over 29 years of experience, and is currently GGP's acting Director of Design. He has also been a part of the Cthulhu LARP community, as well as the well-regarded TerrorWerks events held at Origins and Gen Con in years past. He has been covertly encoding summoning glyphs and sigils into his work, spreading the influence of the Crawling Chaos for nigh on two decades now, and his success is evidenced by the increasingly unstable reality of recent years. Feel free to visit his portfolio at http://www.markshireman.org to get a glimpse of his work.   \nMark Shireman\nReuben Dodd \u2013 Reuben has been illustrating roleplaying games off and on again since 2005. At first, it was mainly on fantasy games, but since 2010 he has worked almost exclusively on Lovecraftian horror games, the bulk of which has been for Golden Goblin Press but also for some other publishers including Chaosium Inc., Miskatonic River Press and Stygian Fox Publishing. Illustrating Cthulhu Mythos themed RPGs has given Reuben the chance to indulge his artistic dark side and pay tribute to Weird fiction and horror imagery. Something that he is incredibly grateful for.\nReuben Dodd\nGregory Shipp - Hello! My name is Greg and I make maps.

Now members of the Secret Court are being found gruesomely murdered inside a fairy ring at an old red cider mill on the Miskatonic River.

MSPE (as it came to be known) allowed players to run rpg adventures from the 1800's all the way to the modern era, ranging from Victorian steampunk, and crime noir, to super spy thrilllers in the cold war. Michael Stackpole wrote the MSPE role playing game, using the Tunnels & Trolls framework as a jumping off point. \nIn 1986, Flying Buffalo took a hit from an unrelated disaster, and sold the rights of MSPE to Sleuth Publications. They came out with an edition that had a black & white cover, and they left out a few things that Buffalo had included, and inserted a few new things that weren't in the Buffalo edition. The last existing copies of the Sleuth edition have sold out, so now Flying Buffalo is printing a third (Combined Edition of MSPE) which includes all the material that was in both editions! \nThe Combined Edition: What's in it? The new edition will contain all the original text and art from the Flying Buffalo and Sleuth editions.  From the Buffalo edition, we will use the amazing painted cover and will include the Tunnels & Thompsons section (which was not in the Sleuth edition) along with some missing art. We have also made various corrections to the rules text that have been found by players and fans over the years.\nRestored and enhanced covers and the Tunnels & Thompsons section\nThe Sleuth edition had several extra sections at the end of the rules that are not in the Buffalo edition. These include optional rules on aging; 13 fully described statted Non-Player characters (including Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty - illustrated by Liz Danforth) and a special folding version of the MSPE Character sheet. All of these will be added to the Combined Edition. \nPLUS New material: On top of that, we are also going to add some new information on using MSPE in sci-fi environments and info on stopping distances for vehicles. All newly illustrated by Steve Crompton. We just might also add a few other rule enhancements based on the response to this Kickstarter.\nPlus sample characters/portraits, and additional material added to the Combined Edition!\nWe will be including all of this in the Combined Edition - (Along with  possibly a few other surprises!)  The rules will  be printed as a trade paperback 8 x 11, (or as a hardback) and for a little extra you can even get your copy of the rules signed by Michael Stackpole. (see details in the pledge levels)\nIf you are a Tunnels & Trolls player you should get this book to see how T&T evolved to allow for guns, grenades, cars, planes and tech skills. And you can easily adapt the MSPE rules for use with your T&T characters and campaigns. Trolls with grenade launchers? Elves with machine guns? Why not!)\nADD ONS: Here are some extras you can add to your pledge!\n Stormhaven printed -  $6 (note if you are buying a hardcover you get 1 free copy)\n Stormhaven PDF -  $5  \n  Add your name to the book - $10 if you are buying a hardcover book\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper printed - $9 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper PDF - $3 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Jade Jaguar solo printed  - $6 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\n Jade Jaguar solo PDF  - $2 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\nGM Screen printed - $7\nGM Screen PDF  - $3\nTo purchase add-ons, just add the price listed above of any item you want to the your pledge total.

Also if you buy printed copies of any books you will also get a FREE copy of the PDF.\nOTHER INFO ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nWe've already scanned and restored all the pages of the rules and the book is ready to go to press. All we need to do is add the page of backer names, scan Stormhaven and Jade Jaguar and give them to the printer.  So there really should not be much delay. \nPledge today and help bring this classic piece of RPG history back to life again! \n Final (probably) stretch goal:  If we make $25,000 we will make a poster of the original cover art for the book, and send one free poster to everyone who has requested a physical copy of the rulebook!  If you only requested pdfs, you can get a poster by adding $10 for postage to your pledge.  If you want more than one poster, add $5 for each additional.\nWhere does the money go? Almost half goes to the printer to print 1000 copies. another share goes towards production (scanning, restoration, new material added to the book, new art and pre-press) About 5% goes to kickstarter ($500), 5% more goes to the credit card company and we expect to have to ship around 300 copies at $4 each for postage and packaging. The rest goes to cover any expenses I've forgotten about, or unexpected expenses, and if there is any left over I might get to keep some. \nKickstarter doesn't let you support with more than one reward. So if you want extras, just add extra money as below to your pledge: for each extra copy of the book, add $16. Fpr each extra signed copy of the book, add $25. When I send out the survey I'll ask you for what you wanted. You can also select other items when you answer the survey.\nUS Backers note: postage is included for USA backers.\nAlso note: nothing from this project is limited edition, so if you want something, but cannot afford it right now, just tell me when you answer the survey. You can send the extra funds later by credit card or by paypal. We will work with you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is written, edited and laid out. All we need now is the money.

It\u2019s 52 pages long (with 5 unlocked bonus map stretch goals included). Inside you\u2019ll find:\n\u00b7 10 'adventure-on-a-page' one-shot adventures of all varieties - murder, dungeon crawls, heists, breakouts, sieges, love stories - complete with additional DM and player maps! These adventures are fully playtested, for PCs of 1st - 5th level and are designed for minimal preparation and flexible delivery. Each adventure can be run as a \u2018fill-in\u2019 for 1-2 gaming sessions (3-4 hours per session) or played as a mini-campaign. Over 50 hours of gaming content!   \n\u00b7 12 New monsters! 4 new magic items! \n\u00b7 Hints on the art of improvisation to bring your NPCs and adventures alive\n\u00b7 Random tables - for names, motivations, room dressing and special items to add additional nuance to your adventures \n\u00b7 Verona City - a city for adventurers to use as a base \n\u00b7 Verona Province - a region for players to explore, complete with every location used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES\nAll the major work is done\u2014writing, playtesting, layout, editing, proof reading\u2014completed! Now that we've achieved all the stretch goals, the stretch goal bonus maps and adventure seeds have been drawn and added. The digital maps package has also now been compiled. All that's needed is to add backer names to the PDF and send off the print proof (which can take 4-6 weeks to be approved - not my delay, my friends), which will happen as soon as the Kickstarter ends and Kickstarter sends me the list of backer names. Then a few adjustments to the print PDF to make it a Tablet/Electronic book PDF (such as removing the print gutter and inserting front and back cover) and voila! All done.\nHere are a some examples of completed pages:\nDesigned to be concise, easily accessible and quick to prepare, these adventures include flexible sandbox-style and structured storylines - something for every style of DM. The 'adventure-on-a-page' format means you get an entire adventure with an intriguing storyline, maps, NPCs and monsters, with plenty of meat to get your teeth into, but with enough 'space' to allow you to incorporate improvisation based on your players' decisions.   \nThere is a huge variety of adventures in this package\u2014murder mystery, dungeon crawls, heist, siege, investigation, bizarre love, puzzles\u2014something for all your players, whether they prefer role playing, hack-and-slash or brain-teasing intrigue! You can run them as one-shots that slot easily into your existing campaign, or as a mini-campaign taking PCs from 1st - 5th level, using your own setting or the one provided in the book. \nI love mystery, conspiracies and double-crosses! These adventures feature lots of that, as well as interesting moral quandaries for players. Would you defend a group of murderers? Have the monsters been framed or should they be exterminated? Do you eliminate the opposition in order to win the prize, or do you work with them? Do the ends justify the means? All is not as it seems\u2026 There\u2019s enough intrigue and suspense in each adventure to keep your players excited and engaged for many hours of gameplay!\nCheck out these teasers for each of the adventures included in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES: \nThere\u2019s more than just adventures in this lovely little tome.\n\u00b7 New Monsters and magic items! Humanoids like the despairingly ugly Grov\u2019l, the vicious, partying Barfs, the psionic spider-like Sholix, and new magic items like Seeds of Growth and the Dagger of Defence. Plus, I've used some interesting beasties from Kobold's wonderful Tome of Beasts, like the Angler Worm and Clockwork Beetle. \n\u00b7 City campaign setting! Verona City, also known as the City of Canals and the City of Bridges, due to its extensive magically-carved canal network. Why has the Duke not been seen in years? Is the Mages\u2019 Guild the source of the magical Haze drug causing townspeople to hallucinate and see ghosts in the city streets? The war between the Thieves\u2019 Guild and the Dockers\u2019 Union over the city\u2019s illicit trades is coming to a head! The Council of Six argue amongst themselves while worshippers of the Death Cult of Asgarte infiltrate Verona\u2026 Verona City is a broad, brush stroke setting with adventure seeds, that is easily expandable and the location of several SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.         \n\u00b7 Regional campaign setting! Verona Province lies on the edge of the empire. To the north, an uneasy truce with the warring Skandarans, to the west Orc raiders in their longships ravage the coast and monster hordes spew forth from the Break in the World. To the south the great dragon Antraxus roams freely through wastelands, threatening to break the fragile peace negotiated with the Council of Six. And the slave trading Sherviath Elves plot with the dark gods to bring the empire to its knees\u2026 Complete with adventure seeds, Verona Province is a broad, brush stroke setting that is easily expandable and includes each of the adventure locations used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.   \n\u00b7 Random Tables! 5 tables with NPC/PC names, backgrounds and motivations, adventure introductions and locations, special curiosities PCs can find along the way and interesting room dressing items. Need a way to introduce the characters to an adventure and at a loss for ideas? Roll on the Random Adventure Introductions table. The coach they\u2019re travelling on is ambushed by Orcs! An NPC passenger is especially impressed with how the PCs handled themselves during the battle and suggests an interesting job\u2026         \n\u00b7 An article on the art of improvisation in games! Not used to improvising in your games? Locked into linear storytelling with fixed outcomes? Time to break the mold and let the game take on new life as you work with your players to create an evolving story based around improvisation and saying \u2018yes\u2019.  \n\u00b7 A section on using these adventures with OSR games!

The book will look great on your bookshelf and in play! \nIf this campaign is successful, I\u2019ll be following it up with:\n\u00b7 SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES 2 \u2013 10 adventures for character levels 6th \u2013 10th. \n\u00b7 THE BLACK MERIDIAN \u2013 a mini-campaign for high level characters 12th \u2013 14th, set in the Verona Province, the Shotglass Adventures campaign setting.\nSo, please help me to help you!

I have a semi-regular column called Laidback DM on my website, stevestillstanding.com, where I post free maps, hints and suggestions on DMing, and 5e game aids. Last year I decided to write a number of 'adventures-on-a-page', using Adobe InDesign to create professional layouts, started playtesting them with two separate playtest groups and created additional content to support busy DMs who have minimal preparation time\u2014these became SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES! This project has been a labour of love for me.

Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control.

Massive and sincere thanks to everyone for the massive support and enthusiasm that's been shown so far. Not only has the campaign been fully funded, but every stretch goal has been met, assuring that Grey Cells will support not only modern mysteries, but also Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian mysteries! If you'd like to learn more about the game, here are some additional places to look!\nYou can find the Google Drive folder containing the case files and all profile cards related to the case by following this link.\nIf you'd like to see Grey Cells in action, you can see me playing Death of a Survivor with backers in this video.\nI was also a guest on Professor Jimbles' Dicebag Podcast and Professional Goblins to talk about Grey Cells, including its past, its design principles and its future!\nGrey Cells is a game of unravelling mysteries. It\u2019s about stepping into a dark morass of crime and deceit, and piecing together nuggets of truth into a full picture of what really happened. Players take the roles of investigators of all stripes - policemen and detectives, reporters, scientists, socialites and criminals (reformed or otherwise).\nEvery character wields powerful tools to shake loose information from the world. When making deductions, some character abilities can build on the information you\u2019ve gathered to help you connect the pieces more clearly. This makes it much less likely that players become stuck without recourse.\nAnd once you have that information you can start making deductions yourself, or you can have your character help you. Several character abilities assist in interpreting evidence, and can help put your deductions on the right track. They\u2019ll never solve the case for you, but they allow you to utilise your character\u2019s experience in the field to aid in the deductive process, should you need it.\nThe game emulates your favourite crime fiction genres, whether that be a civil and proper Cozy mystery such as a Hercule Poirot adventure, a hard-boiled detective flick like The Big Sleep, and more! It also provides advice on how to make your game feel the way you want.\nGrey Cells is a race, and the villain is already a step ahead. They have their own agenda - the thief escapes with their prize, the hacker erases their tracks, the killer stalks their next victim. Take too long to catch them, and they could be long gone.\nCases can involve a lot of dialogue with non-player characters, be they witnesses, suspects or even friends and allies brought into the world by the players themselves. However, Grey Cells doesn\u2019t have a Charisma stat to help you convince and manipulate them. Instead, how well you can persuade or intimidate someone depends on how much you know about them. Discover what they want, what they fear, and what their dirty secrets are and you\u2019ll have them talking in no time.\nThis creates a more thematic experience - people won\u2019t cave until you have something to press them with. Also, since success is dependent on something that\u2019s not on your character sheet, each player\u2019s voice is equally powerful; you don\u2019t have to stand aside while the persuasive character does all the talking.\nWriting mysteries can be tremendously challenging, especially for a roleplaying environment. This is why the game includes tools to help gamemasters weave their own mysteries, expanding and connecting elements of the story until they have a full web of mystery. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to lay every piece of the puzzle beforehand - the same mechanics that help keep the investigation\u2019s momentum going also help the gamemaster create clues during the course of play.\nCrafting a compelling case still requires more preparation than many other types of roleplaying adventure, but it\u2019s one of Grey Cells\u2019 goals to make the process as smooth and effective as possible.\n- 83 pages of content\n- Basic rules of play\n- Guidance on how to play in different genres: Great Detective, Cozy, Hard-Boiled, Police Procedural and Thriller\n- Six unique backgrounds for player characters: The Beat Cop, The Crook, The Detective, The Reporter, The Scientist and The Socialite\n- Special actions to uncover new information, engage in combat, and more\n- Rules for adding permanent new characters to the game in the form of Contacts\n- Rules for Exploits: Special advantages representing your investigator\u2019s strengths\n- Rules for Momentum Powers: Potent abilities to make breakthroughs in the case, and other special effects\n- Extensive guidance on how to create and run a mystery adventure\n- Rules for making custom backgrounds\nThe core rules of the game are already complete. The game is playable, and in terms of rules all that remains is to tweak and perfect them. This will require more playtest sessions to find weaknesses in the design and improve the systems and verbiage used in the rules.\nThe zine will require numerous art assets. Of these, the most important will be character designs to represent the six character backgrounds available to the players. They will reflect not only the background but also an associated genre. These character concepts will be used in illustrations throughout the rest of the zine.\nSeveral stretch goals are available, including supplementary materials for the game. If the goals are met, any backers receiving PDF or printed copies of the core game will also receive PDF or printed copies of the additional materials, as matches their tier.\nIt all started with Poirot and cake. My friends and I would gather to watch Agatha Christie mysteries and enjoy unhealthy quantities of cake. Eventually, this interest overlapped with our passion for roleplaying games, and we tried our hand at creating investigative crime fiction adventures.\nAlthough the adventures were fun, it always felt like we were playing two separate games. The games we played were great for epic combat and high adventure, but the rules took a back seat when it came to investigation and deduction. I decided to make my own game that put the investigation itself in the spotlight.\nI\u2019ve studied game design and participated in multiple Game Jams. With my history of tabletop roleplaying I wanted to use that knowledge to create a game that supported and encouraged the inquisitive style of play we were after.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to the massive support received, I'm adding Discord & playtest access to the Junior Detective ($3) tier! Also, the Detective ($5) tier and upwards will gain access to weekly update emails, including development notes and artwork to be included in the final book! Unfortunately the text on the backer rewards can't be changed after launch (which makes sense!) but rest assured that you'll get them!\nUPDATE:\nI've completed the first set of playtest case notes for Grey Cells, and as promised they are going to be freely available. The following link goes to a google drive folder that contains not only the PDF of the case notes, but also JPEGs of all the Profile Cards involved in the case.\nDeath of a Survivor is a hard-boiled mystery that should take about two 4-hour play sessions to complete. Full disclosure: Most playtest cases will be a bit shorter than this one, but I will try to maintain this standard of quality. Furthermore, playtest cases will be from all of genres supported by Grey Cells, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian cases as development continues.\nI hope this gives you an idea of what Grey Cells has to offer, and that you enjoy Death of a Survivor!\nAlso, if you'd like to see an example of how this case works in action, you can find a recording of the playtest here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first game I\u2019ve designed, but it will be my first professional release. However, this is not the first iteration of Grey Cells - throughout its development it has had two major rewrites, replacing, redesigning and improving large portions of the game. Now it has reached the stage where it can stand on its own, and I\u2019m ready to share it with a wider audience.\n\nWith the core of the game nearly complete, the most risk lies with the design and illustration of the zine itself. Preparing enough illustrations to fill the zine could take longer than I\u2019ve accounted for and cause delays, but in this event I will recruit additional artists to assist in production.\n\nAs a black and white zine, printing risks are low even with a zine of this length. Distribution could face delays depending on shipping factors, but even in the event of delays backers would have the PDF available to them.\n\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, and while I\u2019m going in with eyes open there may be issues I have not anticipated, especially surrounding pricing and shipping. If issues arise, I will be as transparent as I can be and try to resolve them in a manner that is as fair as possible to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 3 or more", "title": "Junior Detective", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of the Grey Cells playtest rulebook, as well as a PDF copy of the finished rules and any supplementary materials met through stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["314 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "Detective", "descp": "Everything above, and access to the Grey Cells Discord channel, where you can participate in online playtests.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Inspector", "descp": "A printed copy of the rulebook, as well as printed copies of supplementary materials met in stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["246 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "Super Sleuth", "descp": "Gain access to PDF copies of the case notes from each playtest, so you can run them yourself.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nAccess to playtest case notes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "Ace Investigator", "descp": "Receive PDF case notes for a unique single-session murder mystery with yourself cast as the villain or the victim.

It was designed to be extremely quick to learn, easy to play, and narrative driving. It is a perfect game for one shots as well as for developing long term campaigns. Characters are created in game, and Game Masters can run it with little to no preparation. \nYou enter the Hotel. You were not looking for adventure, just a brief escape from the limbo of daily life. The Hotel seems to have other plans.\nIn DEAD HALT you will find yourself in the following situations:\nTaking up a job as the Hotel Maintenance Crew  \nReceiving Quests and obtaining Rewards from the Bartender at the Hotel\u2019s Fall Bar.\nGambling for absurd equipment at the massive Gashapon machine in the basement.\nAssisting quirk-ridden computer Consoles that hang from the ceiling.\nTaking the Elevator to ridiculous and unexplainable floors and landscapes.\nMeeting curious potential allies, odd monsters, and Halted Clunkhead Maintenance crew.\nLosing limbs and have them replaced by state of the art 1990\u2019s Cybernetics.\nAttempting to resist the whispers of the Hotel\u2019s supercomputer; FortRA.\nDEAD HALT is a passion project that I began a few years back. I was in search of a Roleplaying game that allowed anyone to sit down and play at the drop of a hat.\nWhat began as a hack of our incredibly wonky Paranoia XP game slowly developed into the world of DEAD HALT. We loved the decisions Paranoia made us work through, and I wanted to push it even further.\nI slowly created a new world, light enough to play whenever, and with enough depth to encourage the types of stories that were most memorable for my friends and I.\nEverything from:\nHorror elements with breaks of light hearted humor.\nDiscussions of the change of ones personal identity through body modification.\nExistential dread under the rule of an unhinged super computer.\nA robot-slaying bird-headed business man and his sarcastic cat.\nClunkPunk is the word for it: CyberPunk motifs jammed into the aesthetic and unreliability of 1980's technology.\nIf you enjoy games like Paranoia, Tales from the Loop, Mutant Year Zero, Gamma World, ZORK, or quirky settings with a hint of terror, I encourage you to try out DEAD HALT.\nI think you just might like it. \nIn fact, Want to try before you buy?! Check out the FREE play test PDF on zonware.net! \n*Concept sketches for Character Options and Console Dispositions \nAside from the quirky world, the DEAD HALT game system was created specifically to;\nBegin play within an hour of picking up the Zine.\nHave no session zero, jump right in and create characters in game!\nBring in players brand new to Roleplaying Games.\nThe 36 page Zine is a quick read and packed full of content bound by simple to learn rules that allow for incredible stories to emerge without any difficulty. No clunky game mechanics or novels worth of text to read.\nThis in no way means DEAD HALT is simple, just efficient.\nIf you have any questions please feel free to contact me anytime on Twitter, or by email at claydogh@gmail.com. \n *Character by Miranda Sider on Twitter @meidri_ \nThe DEAD HALT Roleplaying Game will be a 36 page staple bound Zine. Every copy will be printed on premium paper with a heavy weight letterpress printed cover (On a real hand cranked printing press!). Each Zine from this Kickstarter will be numbered and initialed by ZONWARE to indicate your contribution to my very first work.\nPrinting will take place at Angelica Ink Letterpress in Upstate New York. I have worked with them in the past, and they put nothing but incredible care into their creations. DEAD HALT will be no different!\n\"Angelica Ink began in a garage in rural, Angelica, New York from a love of real ink, beautiful paper and an obsession with cast iron. As the collection of platen printing presses grew, we expanded to an old mill building in the small village of Angelica.\nThe letterpress products from Angelica Ink are created on treadle and hand-operated presses from the late 1800\u2019s. Angelica Ink is a working press shop, open to the public. We print custom, personal and commercial products and offer classes in book arts including bindery, marbling, letterpress and paper making.\"\nI want this game to be ever evolving. Any extra funding we gain above our goal will go right back in to fund more art, and content for the book.\nFollow me on Twitter to keep up to date and to unlock the Adventure Arc \"Rats in the Walls\" which will be sent out for free online before the release of the physical Zine!\n\n~Adventure Arcs are one page idea joggers to get a session off the ground instantly, with a few key items, characters, and a simple premise or quest to launch players into the Hotel.\n~NPC Character Profiles consist of a a sketch and short bio on key characters in the Hotel such as the Bartender Dhuraine, Gad and his sarcastic Cat, or the Supercomputer FortRA.\n~Hotel Customization Modules will lay out options to expand the Fall Bar and other rooms in the Hotel to allow for longer campaigns and character options.\n~2nd Character Species Options will include multiple new Character Options to play when your first character inevitably becomes a Clunkhead and you have to create a new one. These will include Ratfolk, Spawn, Blank Clones, Undead, Rogue Consoles and More!\n\nBAM POW NEW REWARD TIER.\nYou heard me. Find out the fate of the Hotel's defunct super computer: FortRA.\nAt this Reward Tier you get both a copy of the Zine, and a Floppy Disk.\nYeah, its a 3.5 in Floppy disk, probably owned by someone else but I promise I will delete their old MS Paint scribbles or Taxes and such. \nOn the disk will be a PDF Adventure for DEAD HALT named \"The Fate of FortRA\"\nThe Adventure will only ever be released on Floppy Disk, and I will not publish it anywhere else.

I am happy to include Lizzy's likeness as the Netherseer in Tangled Timelines for seeing what can be and living in that.\nArtwork Inspired by Angelus Morningstar of Story Board\nStory Board does something wholly unique in the content creation space - updating published reviews as time passes and opinions evolve on a particular game. In addition to regular review content, Angelus Morningstar also publishes introspective, thought-provoking pieces on board game culture. I am happy to include Angelus' likeness as the Oracle in Tangled Timelines for showing us important things we tend to forget or ignore.\nArtwork Inspired by Katie Aidley of Katie's Game Corner\nI consider Katie Aidley of Katie's Game Corner one of my best friends, in the industry or otherwise.

Bryce can take my scatter-brained concepts and bring forth true artistry in graphic design. I am happy to include Bryce's likeness as the Swashbuckler in Tangled Timelines for tirelessly sailing against the wind.\nArtwork Inspired by Phil Lacefield Jr. of Golden Distribution\nPhil Lacefield Jr. manages Golden Distribution and is often referred to as that kilted guy at conventions. But one thing few people know is that he also runs a video series called Phil's Picks. In this series, Phil runs through the latest acquisitions available to his customers in a knowledgeable, but very concise way. I am happy to include Phil's likeness as the Tactician in Tangled Timelines for cutting through the fluff and getting to the point already.\nArtwork Inspired by Christian Kang of Take Your Chits\nChristian Kang of Take Your Chits has played a valuable role in nearly every project I have embarked on since we met a couple years ago, and there hasn't yet been a suitable way to thank him for his constant support.

Always finding ways to improve her craft, Kat's live stream content has risen into a class of its own, namely in her weekly segment on Tabletop Backer Party and convention coverage. I am happy to include Kat's likeness as the Valkyrie in Tangled Timelines for her ability to crush adversity and rise to greatness.\nArtwork Inspired by Doug Shute of Victory Condition Gaming\nDoug Shute of Victory Condition Gaming has been a supportive friend for some time now and I am indebted to his good advice. You might recognize his daughter, Sydney Shute, who voiced Cutie in the When Cutie Met Patootie project! I am happy to include Doug's likeness as the Wraith in Tangled Timelines for his diligence in never leaving a project unfinished.\nArtwork Inspired by Martyn Poole of Board Game Exposure\nI have the distinguished honor in being the person who told Martyn Poole his plans were too ambitious and he would be very likely to fail. Now the owner of Board Game Exposure with a published game and a growing resume of accomplishments, I consider myself lucky to call Martyn a close friend. I am happy to include Martyn's likeness as the Xenomute in Tangled Timelines for adapting to adversity and finding a way to help others adapt as well.\nArtwork Inspired by Ilustragus\nI discovered Ilustragus while perusing Twitter and was taken aback by his fun and imaginative style. I had him work on a test piece I was unhappy with and he created what would eventually become Amelia from When Cutie Met Patootie. I have been working with Gus ever since and plan to do so as long as he wants to put up with me! I am happy to include Ilustragus' likeness as the Yeti Charmer in Tangled Timelines for his ability to wrangle my ambitions and turn them into compelling and captivating characters. \nArtwork Inspired by Logician Tim of Misfits of Tabletop\nLogician Tim and the entire D-Verse Publishing team are some of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met.

Cat cat!\nMoar about CATS & CATS \nCATS & CATS is an experimental and (mostly) unplayable tabletop role-playing game experience. The degree of playability depends on the players' extreme commitment to the premise of the game. It attempts to be a supermegacompletely cutdownuntilthereisnothingleft traditional style RPG, wrapped in a (metaphorical) fuzzy blanket of cat. Why? Because I have yet to find a ttrpg that was cat enough for me and now I want to share my creation with yooouuuuuu~~! Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat!\nThis game is designed for 0-12 players and takes approximately 0-8 hours to play.\nCATS & CATS is a very smol game; the rule book and character sheet fit on the front and back of one sheet of paper. Breaking from standard traditional d20 RPG mechanics, this game utilizes only 1c6.\nThe game will be released in two graphic styles. The first is more trad, with clean and precise computer generated lines. The other is a more \"zine\" style, which is to say photocopies of my hand-drawn version of the trad style mentioned above. Don't worry, you don't have to choose; you will get both versions. You're welcome?\nCATS&CATS is part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest Project, a celebration of RPG zine creations! Go check it out, there are some PAWSOME things out there!!! \n\n---\nUhm...Okay? But why is this a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter will fund the production of the custom six-sided cats\u2014I mean custom six-sided dice\u2014which are required to play the game. Unfortunately, producing a limited number of dice with each die face being customized is spendy. Boo. These exclusive 1c6 are only compatible with CATS & CATS, but they at least look really cool! \nHere is a pre-production proof from the manufacturer!\n---\nPledge Levels and Backer Rewards\n$1: ...I have no idea what is going on???\nThat's alright, I don't know what is going on either! But I'm plowing forward anyways. If you accidentally click on this level, you will receive the PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6.\n$3: I know what's going on...and I like it!\nHuh! Wow! Okay? I'm impressed and confused. I guess if you decide to back at this level for some inconceivable reason you will get a digital PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6. Yes, this is indeed the same reward as the \"...I have no idea what is going on???\"  level. It's your own fault. I don't even feel bad.\n$8:  ALL I WANT FUREVER ARE 1c6!??!!!??!!??? \nCat cat cat catcatcat cat 1c6 cat cat? Cat cat cat! This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page) and a beautiful CATS&CATS 1c6 only! You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M ALL IN!!! GIMME!!!!! CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT!!!!!!!!!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nWhat, really?!? Well, I'm not going to stop you. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS & CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M LATE BUT ALL IN! GIMME CATS!!! I CAN WAIT!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nYou were taking a cat nap and missed everything, right? Okay, I am going  to open a second-wave duplication of \"$10: I'M ALL IN! GIMME!!! CAT CAT  CAT CAT!!!!\". HOWEVER, this level WILL SHIP LATE. Hand-making lil bags  and shipping myself takes a lot of work--expect a 4-6 week delay. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS &  CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all  in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$75: I CAN HAS ARTZ N MOAR GAMES?!\nYer so woah and I can't cope with it. Ok. So. I guess if you really want I can send you the original concept pencil sketches for the catmpersand logo and some of the interior art, all of which has been slept on by my cat (Antoine Rasputin Little-Bunny-Foo-Foo-Hopping-Through-The-Forest-Scooping-Up-The-Fieldmice-And-Bopping-Them-On-The-Head Napoleon Bathory the Third)? I'm not a flash artist, so be prepared! I'll also send you two DELUXE full copies of the game--including a total of FOUR 1c6 and two dice bags. Shine on you crazy cat-obsessed diamond. This will ship to US or Canada only, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n ---\nCat Cat Cat Add-on 1c6???\nYes, you can add one extra 1c6 to your reward, but ONLY if you pledge at an $8 or $10 level. This will not change your shipping costs. If you pledge at $1 or $3, you will need to change your pledge level to the $8 tier.\nThe 1c6 add-on is $6.\n Kickstarter charges your pledge right when the campaign ends (in 48  hrs!). This means that if you want to add an extra 1c6 by increasing  your pledge by $6, you MUST do it  before the project ends! You cannot increase your pledge after the  campaign ends (unlike some projects that use third-party KS managers  like backerkit). \nTo take advantage of this and amp up your CATS&CATS experience, follow these simple steps: \n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the CATS&CATS page. \n2. Increase your pledge by $6 to claim your 1c6. Maximum add-on is ONE 1c6.\n3. Save your pledge. \n4. At the end of the campaign, I will send out a Backer Survey via Kickstarter. There will be a place to indicate that you added $6 to your pledge amount for the add-on 1c6. \nWhen you make your initial pledge, Kickstarter should automatically add on your shipping cost. Please check this handy chart below to ensure your total pledge amount is correct!\n\n---\n Streeeeeeetch goals!\nHow did this even happen?\nOkay, at $500 I will put together merch like stickers and t-shirts that you can buy on zazzle. You all are even weirder than me.\n...alright. Starting at $1000 and for every $100 thereafter, I will post a cat photo and/or video to backers.\n---\nWho are you? Do you know that you are really weird?\nGreat questions! Thanks for asking! My name is Dana and I am, indeed, very weird. I also really like cats. You can find me on Twitter @DAYtheELF.\nSurprisingly, I actually sometimes work on real and functional role-playing games, such as the recent ttrpg sensation Dinosaur Princesses; CYBERKITTENS, a cyberpunk transfelinism playbook, for The Sprawl: November Metric; and Upcycle, more cyberpunk cats, for The Veil: Cascade. My next upcoming gaming convention appearances will be at BreakoutCon in Toronto and PAXEast in Boston. Stop by and I will show you pics of my cats!\n---\nShipping and Fulfillment\nPDFs of the game will be fulfilled using itch.io (http://itch.io). This is a change from the original plan to use DriveThruRPG, largely because itch.io is easier to use for digital-only game distribution (DTRPG is excellent for Print-On-Demand, however). Itch.io is rad and it's an easy process, though you will need to create a free account, if you don't have one yet. When the game is ready, I will send out download keys to all backers who chose the $1 level or higher!\nThe physical copy of the game will be mailed via standard mail worldwide. Depending on where your mailing address is, you will be charged one of three shipping & handling costs in addition to your $10 pledge: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).\nProduction Schedule\nCATS & CATS is mostly written and the art is nearly finalized, but we have to wait on the dice to be crafted and the bags to be sewn. Unless something awful happens to me or the manufacturer, CATS & CATS should be shipped (and the PDFs released) by May 2019.\n I will not be selling anything not already available to backers before my upcoming. I  will only be selling printed versions of the PDFs, which will already have been distributed by early March. \nSo for transparency sake, here is the updated distribution/fulfillment plan:\n Early March: PDF of CATS&CATS will be released to all backers via itch.io.\n Mid-March: First-wave $10 level backer rewards (of folx who do not add-on an extra 1c6) will be shipped.\n Mid-March: I will be at BreakoutCon. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD/$4CAD.\n Late-March:  I will be at PAX East. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD.\n Late-May: Manufacturer willing, I will be fulfilling all remaining physical backer rewards (standard and add-ons).  \n---\nCat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat!\n ---", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that this won't fund.

We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the development of the Interface Zero 3.0 core rules, the GM's Guide to 2095, the introductory adventure, and a host of cool add-ons such as a 3-panel Game Master's screen, an action deck, bennies, and much more! \n  Interface Zero 3.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026 Sort of. Interface Zero 3.0 is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Alita: Battle Angel and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre. The result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games in that it holds tight to the flavor of a world where megacorporations have enormous wealth and influence with little regard for the masses or the world in which they live. It diverges slightly in that Interface Zero tends to focus more on geopolitical action and intrigue as ways to bring in dystopian elements and really hammer home the idea that the world your characters live in is in need of change. The question is, will you work towards change, or will you stand idly by and watch the world burn?\nIn Interface Zero 3.0, you might play as genetically modified humans,  vat-grown simulacra, or even a psion, more commonly known as a zeek. You'll be able to embrace a variety of concepts firmly rooted in the cyberpunk genre, but geared towards the setting.  You'll be able to play razor boys and razor girls, gearheads who use their drones for tactical dominance of the battlefield, hyper reality hackers and network crackers, combat medics, lone wolf assassins, cybermonks, and many more concepts common to our setting!\n  In the five years since Interface Zero 2.0 was released, we\u2019ve received a bunch of feedback from you regarding almost every aspect of the book about everything from races and gear to edges, hacking, drones\u2026I could go on. Though at times it may not seem like it, I\u2019ve listened to all of the feedback and we(the development team) are incorporating it into this new design. \nIn Interface Zero 3.0 you\u2019ll find:\nUpdated Races, including 2nd generation Hybrids and a Psion\nCompletely overhauled rules for hacking and drones\nCampaign Themes that help you dial in on the type of cyberpunk game you wish to run and play\nMore City Trappings\nCorporate Trappings for gear and equipment\nNew bio-horrors and more threats\nA lighter approach towards gear, but improved customization options\nA broad view of the world and solar system as it exists in 2095\nA bunch of Savage Tales to get you started\n In the GM\u2019s Guide to 2095 you\u2019ll find:\nA more detailed look at the Interface Zero setting\nSavage Tales for each region of the world\nInformation on major corporations, governments and the people who run them\n3 Plot Point Campaigns based on campaign themes\nNew Threats\nSecrets for the GM\u2019s eyes only\nGuidelines  for effectively using SWADE's rules for networking, contacts and much more \n  Some of you might have heard that Interface Zero is getting something of a reboot. That's partially true, and it's only natural for you to wonder if the new edition is going to make your old sourcebooks obsolete.\nWe are taking Interface Zero in a new direction, definitely. In the third edition, you'll see changes, some of them really big, but none of these changes will make any of your sourcebooks or the lore in the Interface Zero 2.0 book obsolete. In fact all of that lore is essential to better understand why many of the changes coming to the world are being made. \nI've been wanting to get back to a setting that feels more hard-core cyberpunk and less science-fantasy.  One of those ways is to get the world (primarily the United States) moving in a certain direction...down. The reunification of the United States begins in late 2090 with what is known as the reunification war. It's a short-lived, but bloody conflict primarily between the North American Coalition, the United Combine, Atlantica, and the Republic of Texas. To make a long story short; The North American Coalition wins the war, successfully reuniting the lower 48 states under a new banner: The Reformed United States.\nI won't go into all the specifics here, but the ramifications of the Reclamation War are vast, and much of the new setting addresses these issues. It's going to be a fun ride, though, and I hope you come along with me!  \n  To give you an idea of the deals we have planned for backers of this kickstarter, I'm listing the retail costs for the three core products. As you can see, your total costs get much cheaper for you the higher you pledge.  \nIf you want to grab all of the bells and whistles without worrying about how much each individual add-on is going to cost you after the campaign, going with the Southland Ganger pledge gets you everything and ends up being the best value for your money.\nIf you just want the books in print, stick with the Gearhead pledge, and wait until after the kickstarter ends to grab extras like bennies, the gm screen, action deck and the way of the gun deck as add-ons. This will be handled through Backerkit at the end of the campaign.\n Interface Zero 3.0 will be a full color, hard cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 210 pages in length. The book will retail for $35.99 in print, and $19.99 in PDF.\n The GM's Guide to 2095 will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 128 pages in length. The book will retail for $24.99 in print, and $11.99 in PDF.\n The Introductory Adventure will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 48 pages in length. It will retail for $9.99 in print, and $5.99 in PDF.\n  I've found that it's much easier to do add-ons at the end of the kickstarter rather than have a ton of pledges that slowly build on the content until you eventually get everything. As mentioned above, if you do want everything, and don't wish to mess with all the extra financial calculations, you should select the Southland Ganger pledge.\nIf you'd rather just pick and choose which add-ons to get, here is a list and their costs. You can either add the dollar amount to your pledge upfront, or you can simply wait until after the kickstarter and purchase them via pledge manager. I recommend waiting. Some people have gone all in-and later decided that they didn't want certain things, and that can cause complications, as the credit cards have already been charged. In any case, here is what we are offering!\n Bennies: $15.00  (A pack of 25 bennies)\n Action Deck: $15.00 (52 Card Action Deck)\n Way of the Gun Deck: $15.00 (52 card cyberpunk-themed Adventure Deck)\n 3 Panel GM screen:  $20.00 (A sturdy Graphic Novel size)\n Wild Die (5): $5.00 A set of 5 custom Wild Dice.\n Additional physical copy of Interface Zero 3.0 (Offset printing): $30.00 (6 dollars below retail)\n Additional physical copy of the GM's Guide to 2095 (Offset Printing): $20.00 (5 dollars below retail)\n We have a bunch of stretch goals lined up for this kickstarter. Some, like maps and tokens are designed for VTT (Virtual Table Top) platforms, but can also be printed out for use at your game table. Others include  regional setting books, HOT SPOT guides to specific cities or other locations of note, adventures, character folios, and much more.  \nAll of these stretch goals are going to be delivered in PDFs or downloadable files. These books won't be going through a traditional print run. Now that said, we will be giving all backers vouchers to get them in Print On Demand for every POD product we unlock! This saves both you and I tons of headaches dealing with shipping costs, delayed shipping dates, and things of that nature.\n[UNLOCKED!] $33,000:Malmart Catalog 4 VTT Tokens and a New Savage Tale: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the malmart catalog and do some VTT Tokens and a brand new Savage Tale! The Malmart Catalog is a 96 page supplement that gives you more goodies to choose from when outfitting your characters. More cybernetics, vehicles, weapons, and tech to enhance your game! Much of this book has already been written, but we need to convert to the SWADE rules, do layout, run it through editing, and order artwork.\n[UNLOCKED!] $43,000: The Europe/Russia/China Source book: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the Europe/Russia/China source book and do some more VTT Tokens for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds! We\u2019ll also do a brand new Savage Tale! We\u2019ll wrap up this 128 page supplement and give you everything you need to know about the war between China and Russia, and the fractured nations of Europe. The manuscript has been written, but it needs heavy editing and rewrites to update it to 2095, artwork, and conversion to SWADE rules. \n[UNLOCKED!]$53,000: The Zero\u2019s guide to the Solar System: Another book that is in development, the Zero\u2019s Guide to the Solar System needs more writing, artwork, editing, and conversion to SWADE. This book will be an estimated 128 pages in length. If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the sourcebook and do some more VTT Tokens, a brand new Savage Tale, and digital maps for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds!\n[UNLOCKED!]$63,000: Interface Zero: Dark Pathways (working title): An 96 -128 page alternate setting book, Dark Pathways gives you everything you need to know about introducing fantasy and horror elements to 2095! If you\u2019ve seen movies like Aliens, Bright, or The Matrix, you\u2019ll have a good idea of what we plan on doing here. The book will come with a sample setting, new gear, edges, and much more! We\u2019ll also do more VTT gaming maps, and more Savage Tales!\n $70,000: Corporate Profiles: This 32 page supplement marks a new line for Interface Zero. In These supplements, we\u2019ll discuss various megacorporations as they exist in 2095. \n  Print on Demand vouchers allow you to purchase the book at cost plus shipping to your home. This means that if it costs me 4 dollars to make the book, that's what you pay, in addition to the shipping costs. I don't collect any revenue off of POD books. This is simply a way to help you save some money if you wish to have everything in print.\nFor estimated shipping costs for Print of Demand products by page count, check their website here.  All of the sourcebooks, guides, etc. will be printed in softcover  and will range from 18 pages to 128 pages in length, depending on the content.\nHow does it work?\nOnce I put a product on sale in Print on Demand, I send you an email with your Voucher, which is essentially a coupon. It comes in the form of a URL linking to the product. You click on the link, and it automatically adjusts the price to my cost to print the book. Then, you simply check out like you would any other time you purchase a product. Shipping is then added to the total. At that point, you complete the transaction and your done!\nNOTE:  The Interface Zero Core rule book will only be available in softcover as a Print on Demand Product. This is because the size of the book has to change if we print it with Hard Cover, which would require an entirely different layout.\nHere is a graphic that shows the estimated printing costs for POD  products I'll be offering in this kickstarter.  \nWhat's the difference between Print on Demand and Traditional Offset Printing?\nPrint on Demand (POD) books are made using a digital printer that uses inkjet printing rather than traditional offset. It\u2019s a quicker, cheaper way to print books, because you don\u2019t have to order larger bulk runs (usually 1000 copies or more). With POD, books are \u201cmade to order;\u201d you can order a single book or multiple books at one time.\nThe main difference is quality. While Print on Demand has come a long way, it\u2019s still not as good as offset printing. Binding is perfect bound for softcover, and case-bound for hardcover, though I\u2019ve printed hardcover POD books in the past that don\u2019t hold up well for long. The softcover POD books tend to do much better over the long run. The pages tend to feel rough. Sometimes images can be grainy, or bleed through; it just depends on whether or not the specs are right. Hardcovers don't have customization options. They are all done in standard glossy format.\nOverall, the quality is good enough that I'm happy using them, but not for large print runs designed to go into distribution to games stores world-wide. For that, I go with offset printing.\nWith offset printing, the color really jumps off the page. It feels better to the touch. I generally use semi-gloss paper for my books, at 80lb. weight to ensure you get the best book possible. Binding is much better, especially for Hardcover books. With offset, I can do stuff like put custom end pages, choose stronger binding, and change the type of hardcover style, which can really improve the book as a whole. The only downside is that it takes longer to get the books. Any book by a major publishing company (Like Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing, etc.) that you find in your local game store is probably done with offset printing.\nHere are the Shipping Costs for all orders for books shipped directly from our warehouse in the United States, as well as overseas partners.\n Our plan is to deliver the PDF and have the book ready to go to the printer in June, 2019. After that, printing will take approximately 8 to 12 weeks, so we should be getting them right at the end of August, 2019. Once we get the books in our warehouse, we'll start shipping them to you, along with any other physical rewards you ordered.\nI want to stress that sometimes things can go sideways. While I don't foresee any issues, I can tell you that I've had problems in the past that were completely out of my control, and affected the timeline to print. I should also stress that I want to make sure you get the absolute best quality books I can produce, and regardless of whether or not we're talking about artwork, or a second or third edit of content, I will not print a book until I'm happy with it.\nAll of our digital and Print on Demand titles will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'd like to stress upfront that this project is not a pre-order. My team and I are working on the project as we speak, and this will get finished and released. You have my word on that, but as someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. \n\nWriters and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed. These things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\n\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

I just wanted to let people know so they weren\u2019t surprised, but in retrospect I should have explained myself, as I\u2019m attempting to do now.\nI didn\u2019t make the decision to launch a new project lightly. I weighed a number of factors into the decision, not the least of which was the current state of IZ 3.0.  Physical products have yet to be delivered, and I certainly understand the frustration and feelings of betrayal. After all, how can I start something new when they haven\u2019t been delivered yet? The truth is, after I send the books and GM screen to the printer, I\u2019ll have roughly 8 weeks to finalize the Way of the Gun Deck and get that printed.

Ein Mangaka hat sich eine Figur ausgedacht und schickt sie in gefahrvolle Situationen \u2013 als Leserin kann man zwar mitfiebern, die Handlungen und Ergebnisse aber nicht beeinflussen. Bei Record of Dragon War ist das anders: Du denkst dir deine Figur aus und du entscheidest, welche Charaktereigenschaften sie hat, welche Ziele sie verfolgt, wie sie auf Begegnungen mit anderen Menschen \u2013 oder Monstern! \u2013 reagiert.\n\u201eDer Drache rei\u00dft das Maul auf und speit einen Feuerschwall in deine Richtung \u2013 mach einen Rettungswurf!\u201c \nSeit 1974 erleben Spieler weltweit Abenteuer, nur in ihrer gemeinsamen Fantasie, nur bewaffnet mit Stift, Papier und W\u00fcrfeln. \nDas neue Hobby Rollenspiel hatte auch auf die Manga-Szene gro\u00dfen Einfluss: Bevor Parn und Deedlit (Record of Lodoss War) ihre Abenteuer in Roman, Manga und Anime erlebten, waren sie Spielfiguren in einer regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Spielrunde des ersten und erfolgreichsten Rollenspiels der Welt! Auch Online-Rollenspiele wie WoW und Final Fantasy verdanken ihre Inspiration und Spielweise dem Pen-and-Paper-Vorbild \u2013 und haben mit dem Isekai-Genre Mega-Erfolge wie .hack// oder SAO m\u00f6glich gemacht.\nUnd nun k\u00f6nnen auch heutige Manga- und Game-Fans nachspielen, wie alles seinen Anfang nahm. \nAusschnitt aus der Skizze f\u00fcr den Zauberspruch \u201eHeilen leichter Wunden\u201d\nRecord of Dragon War ist eine R\u00fcckkehr zu den Wurzeln des RPG-Hobbys und zugleich eine Fusion mit der modernen Comic-Kultur. Auf der Basis der OGL (Open Game License, eine Open-Source-Bewegung des Rollenspiels) variiert Record of Dragon War die Regeln des ersten Rollenspieles der Welt. Unter Zuhilfenahme der OGL wurde 2008 die fr\u00fcheste, ungeschliffene Fassung des Spieles (\u201e0e\u201c) rekonstruiert und unter dem neuen Titel Swords & Wizardry f\u00fcr die heutige Generation erfahrbar gemacht. Record of Dragon War verwendet den Regelkern von S&W, ist aber gleichzeitig eine behutsame Neuinterpretation der Basis-Box, die auch in Deutschland f\u00fcr viele Spieler der Einstieg in das Hobby war. \nRecord of Dragon War wendet sich an zwei Spielertypen: Fans von Manga-Titeln wie Record of Lodoss War, Granblue Fantasy, Legend of Zelda oder Fairy Tail, sowie Fans der \u201eOld School Renaissance\u201c \u2013 einer weltweiten R\u00fcckbesinnung auf klassische Rollenspielregeln der Fr\u00fchzeit des Hobbys. Damit vereint das Spiel zwei Enden des Spektrums:\nein junges Manga-Publikum, das erstmals den Reiz der Rollenspiele (oder den Ursprung einer bestimmten Lieblingsserie) erforschen m\u00f6chte, \nund \u201eW20-Veteranen\u201c, die voll Nostalgie an die \u201eRote Box\u201c zur\u00fcckdenken, bzw.

Den gr\u00f6\u00dften Piratenschatz zu finden. Das m\u00e4chtigste Monster zu bezwingen. Deinem d\u00e4monischen Vater zu zeigen, dass du nicht wie er bist (und ihn vom Thron der H\u00f6lle zu sto\u00dfen). Das beste Rezept f\u00fcr Drachenrippchen zu kreieren.

Beide haben den Einstieg ins Rollenspielhobby mit der Roten Box gefunden. Beide halten die Rote Box f\u00fcr das beste Einsteigerprodukt, das je geschrieben wurde. Beide tr\u00e4umen seit Jahren (in Dirks Fall einem Jahrzehnt) davon, eine zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfe Neuinterpretation dieser Box zu sehen \u2013 eine Box, die die Sehgewohnheiten der heutigen (Manga-)Leser bedient und geeignet ist, eine neue Generation auf das abenteuerlichste Hobby der Welt aufmerksam zu machen.\nDoch die Zeiten haben sich ge\u00e4ndert, seit Rollenspielboxen einmal in Kaufh\u00e4usern und dank VEDES-Fachgesch\u00e4ften noch \u201eauf dem platten Land\u201c zu finden waren. Da wir nicht einsch\u00e4tzen k\u00f6nnen, wie sich dieser Strukturwandel auf die Nachfrage nach einem solchen Produkt auswirkt, m\u00fcssen wir das Interesse auf diesem Weg abfragen.\nBei der Planung der Box und der Hefte haben wir einen Standardanteil an Illustrationen angesetzt. Nun lebt das Manga-Genre nat\u00fcrlich auch von dem charakteristischen Artwork. \u00dcber Stretchgoals k\u00f6nnen wir leichter einen h\u00f6heren Grafikanteil realisieren. \nMarika h\u00e4lt Stift und Rasterfolie parat und wartet nur auf euch.\nDas \u201eMaking-of\u201d eines Covers\nDie deutsche Mangaka Marika Herzog (auf Twitter unter demoniacalchild zu finden) ist die zeichnende H\u00e4lfte des Manga-Autorenduos CHASM und seit 2008 im fantastischen Genre zuhause (u.a. Grimoire bei Comic Culture, Demon King Camio bei Egmont). Nach einem Ausflug in Boys-Love-Gefilde (Whispering Blue bei Egmont) widmet sie sich wieder der (Shonen-)Fantasy und SF. Wenn sie nicht auf Messen in Deutschland und Italien Signierstunden gibt, zeichnet sie ihren Science-Fiction-Web-Manga Capacitas, der auf Deutsch und Englisch erscheint.\nMarikas Lieblingsmangas sind Haikyu!!, One Piece und Gensomaden Saiyuki.\nDirk Remmecke (in manchen Foren auch als Mondbuchstaben unterwegs) wirkte 15 Jahre lang in der deutschen Spielebranche (u.a. als Inhaber eines Spiele-Fachgesch\u00e4ftes, Autor f\u00fcr Spiele-Fachzeitschriften und als Gr\u00fcndungsmitglied und Mitveranstalter von Hannover spielt!) und ist seit 13 Jahren Event- und Marketing-Manager f\u00fcr die Labels KAZ\u00c9 Manga und KAZ\u00c9 Anime. F\u00fcr Eye See Movies entdeckte er die isl\u00e4ndische RPG-Comedy Astr\u00f3p\u00eda, deren \u00dcbersetzung er verantwortete. Dirk wurde von 2014 bis 2018 in die Jury des Deutschen Rollenspielpreises berufen.

Das Lektorat wird bis Mitte Januar abgeschlossen sein und ins Layout gehen. Die Illustrationen sind beauftragt und Marika zeichnet sich die Finger wund. Zum Ende des Kickstarters sollen alle Grafiken vorliegen \u2013 jene Motive, die erst durch Stretchgoals freigeschaltet werden, werden im Januar nachgeliefert. Das Hauptrisiko besteht immer bei unvorhergesehenen Lebensereignissen im Team (famili\u00e4re Notf\u00e4lle, Krankheit usw.), was im Voraus nat\u00fcrlich nicht planbar ist.\n\nNach den Erfahrungen, die wir in bisherigen Crowdfundings sowohl in deutscher als auch in englischer Sprache gesammelt haben, sind wir zuversichtlich, das Buch und alle finanzierten Zusatzprodukte innerhalb des veranschlagten Zeitrahmens zu realisieren. Als Verlag haben wir allergr\u00f6\u00dftes Eigeninteresse, den Termin der MangaComicConvention (Leipziger Buchmese 2019) nicht zu verpassen \u2013 wir haben eigens einen Stand f\u00fcr die Premiere des Spiels gemietet! Zu diesem Zweck werden wir jeden Arbeitsschritt \u00fcberwachen, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr Verz\u00f6gerungen zu minimieren. Nat\u00fcrlich gilt es auch, in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden alle Backer \u00fcber den Status des Projektes zu informieren und bei Nachfragen schnell und gezielt zu reagieren.\nDennoch k\u00f6nnen wir Verz\u00f6gerungen nat\u00fcrlich nicht ausschlie\u00dfen. Wir k\u00f6nnen euch aber versichern, dass wir euch zum einen stets \u00fcber eventuelle Verz\u00f6gerungen auf dem Laufenden halten werden und daran arbeiten diese schnellstm\u00f6glich zu beheben. Auch sind wir der Meinung, dass man nicht zu viele Crowdfunding-Projekte parallel laufen haben sollte, bevor die vorherigen Projekte abgeschlossen oder zumindest so gut wie abgeschlossen sind \u2013 auch hier k\u00f6nnt ihr euch auf uns verlassen, dass wir uns nicht verzetteln.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Kaffeekasse", "descp": "Du m\u00f6chtest uns einfach symbolisch unterst\u00fctzen oder \u00fcber die Neuheiten und Entwicklungen dieses Projekts auf dem Laufenden bleiben?

Een wereld die uit een schilderij van Jheronimus Bosch of Pieter Brueghel lijkt te komen, een wereld van goden en monsters. Dit is de wereld van Ambrosia, een uniek rollenspel ge\u00efnspireerd door de geschiedenis en de folklore van de Lage Landen.\nMet Ambrosia willen we je het gevoel bieden dat je echt in een middeleeuwse, west-Europese setting rondloopt; we benaderen het rollenspel op een historisch onderbouwde manier. De gemiddelde levensverwachting in de wereld van Ambrosia is bijvoorbeeld 45; er is een groot verschil in rangen en standen tussen adel, clerus, en horigen; genezers gebruiken bloedzuigers en aderlatingen om hun ambacht mee uit te oefenen; en winkels zijn zo goed als niet-bestaand. In plaats daarvan zijn de mensen toegewezen op de wekelijkse marktdag om levensnoodzakelijke goederen te kopen van reizende handelaars.\nVergeet die smidse met een hele reeks +5 zwaarden in zijn vitrine; wapens worden gemaakt op bestelling, en metalen pantsers zijn heel duur en behoorlijk zeldzaam. Op die manier heeft Ambrosia meer weg van \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, \u201cDragon Age\u201d of \u201cThe Witcher\u201d dan bijvoorbeeld \u201cWarcraft\u201d; we bieden een grauwe, realistische setting die ondersteund is door toegankelijke spelregels.\nIn Ambrosia benaderen we magie op een niet alledaagse manier. Hoewel de setting relatief weinig magische invloeden kent, is iedereen overtuigd dat al wat occult is ook daadwerkelijk bestaat, en zij die magische kunsten beoefenen worden zowel gevreesd als gerespecteerd. Vergeet al wat je weet over \u201cglass cannons\u201d, magi\u00ebrs zijn niet langer artilleristen die vuurballen en bliksemschichten alle kanten uit schieten.\nIn Ambrosia kunnen magi\u00ebrs een bepaald aspect van de realiteit controleren en manipuleren: er zijn er die de schaduwen tot leven brengen, andere zijn dan weer vlees-vervormers, sommigen kunnen zelfs je eigen levensbloed tegen je gebruiken. Vermits tactisch nadenken ondergeschikt wordt aan vertelkunst, biedt dit je een hoop nieuwe kansen om het verhaal naar je eigen hand te zetten.\nIn eerste plaats is Ambrosia een spel waarbij het verhaal centraal staat.\nElke speler krijgt een rechtstreekse band met het verhaal. Om het oudste fantasy-clich\u00e9 ooit als voorbeeld te nemen, JIJ als spelerpersonage bent de uitverkorene! Natuurlijk gaan we niet zo laag zinken in een scenario van Ambrosia (ik voel me al goedkoop, gewoon door het als voorbeeld te nemen!) maar je snapt het wel.\nHet verhaal draait rond jullie, de spelers, en jullie beslissingen hebben een rechstreeks effect op de sandboxy campaigns met een open einde die Ambrosia aanbiedt. Zelf put ik uit lessen, geleerd van mensen als Joseph Campbell en Alfred Hitchcock als het op screenwriting aankomt, en kan die ook toepassen op het ontwikkelen van scenario\u2019s voor het rollenspel. Wat we dus aanbieden zijn correct gestructureerde, doch modulaire en volledig interactieve verhaallijnen waar niets is wat het lijkt en onverwachte wendingen achter elke hoek schuilen!\nMaar Ambrosia is nog veel meer. Het biedt je de mogelijkheid om drie-dimensionale, volledig uitgewerkte spelerpersonages te cre\u00ebren met realistische motivaties om het verhaal verder te zetten. En dat verhaal is het belangrijkste element van dit spel; de historie van Ambrosia wordt verteld in zogenaamde \u201cKronieken\u201d, elk een sandboxy campaign met een open einde waarin de keuzes die de spelers maken, rechtstreekse gevolgen hebben.\nElke Kroniek bouwt verder op de keuzes die de spelers in de vorige gemaakt hebben, dus we houden ons niet bezig met lineaire \u201cdungeon-crawlers\u201d \u2013 het verhaal evolueert terwijl je het uitspeelt, het is modulair opgebouwd, en de keuzes van de spelers zijn net zo belangrijk als de nota\u2019s van de spelleider. Hiermee krijg je een levende setting die aangepast wordt naarmate de gebeurtenissen ontrafelen die de essentie ervan vormen. Je bent niet langer een toerist die toevallig ergens in verzeild geraakt, je bent de ware protagonist van het verhaal!\nIk wou van Ambrosia een visueel verbluffend, maar toch betaalbaar, alternatief bieden voor de grote namen in het genre. We gaan bijvoorbeeld nooit extra handboeken uitgeven: wat je ziet is wat je krijgt. Vermits onze focus ligt op het verhaal zullen we meer Kronieken ontwikkelen, maar ook alleen tot het metaplot volledig is afgewerkt; dat is waar het verhaal van Ambrosia zal eindigen. Geen dure miniaturen of extra handboeken- Ambrosia moet toegankelijk blijven voor mensen van elke rang of stand. Je hebt geen dikke portefeuille nodig om hiervan te genieten; al wat je nodig hebt is een levendige verbeelding en de bereidheid om te vertrekken op een intens, emotioneel avontuur!\nEen ander belangrijk aspect van dit spel is hoe we personages speltechnisch benaderen. Elk personage is volledig aanpasbaar aan je eigen wensen door middel van een systeem dat je toelaat elke combinatie van vaardigheden, talenten en gebreken aan te kopen. Daarmee wordt een spelerpersonage zowel gevormd als getekend door zijn of haar verleden. Je speelt een volledig ontwikkeld personage van vlees en bloed.\nDesondanks kent een spelletje Ambrosia niet onmiddellijk een dodelijke afloop; je wordt steeds behandeld als de protagonist van het verhaal, wat je moeilijk te doden maakt \u2013 maar gemakkelijk te verminken. Als je wat ervaring hebt opgedaan, voel je jezelf echt die veteraan die loopt te klagen dat de jongeren het nu toch allemaal veel te gemakkelijk hebben. Regels die je moraliteit en reputatie meten geven je personage nog meer diepgang; hij of zij zal immers geconfronteerd worden met dilemma\u2019s waarbij een simpele oplossing zonder enige slachtoffers onmogelijk blijkt te zijn...\nAmbrosia is de culminatie van lessen, geput uit klassieke en moderne rollenspellen. Het trekt invloeden uit verhalende spellen zoals Vampire: The Masquerade, Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play en Call of Cthulhu, maar houdt ook rekening met nieuwere ontwikkelingen in de wereld van rollenspellen. Eveneens vergeten we zeker niet al die huisregels die we al sinds de jaren \u201980 hebben verzonnen om oudere spellen te stroomlijnen. Op die manier bieden we een boeiende, originele ervaring die zowel veteranen uitdaagt als gemakkelijk toegankelijk is voor beginnelingen. Met dit project hopen we je een gelijkwaardig alternatief te bieden voor de grote namen in het genre, alsook je een heel nieuwe kijk op rollenspellen te geven! \n De Boeken\nHet spelleiderscherm\nDit scherm is een fraai vierluik waarmee je de tafel meteen onderdompelt in de juiste sfeer en waarachter je nota's geheim kan houden voor nieuwsgierige spelersogen (we zeggen niet dat ze willen afkijken, maar het zou erg jammer zijn als ze per ongeluk een glimp opvangen van iets dat ze eigenlijk niet mogen weten!)\nOp de voorkant van het scherm staat de kaart van de Alverlanden afgebeeld zodat de spelers altijd gemakkelijk kunnen terugvinden waar ze precies zijn. De achterkant van het scherm bevat nuttige tabellen die de spelleider al eens nodig heeft tijdens het spel; deze staan ook in het Basisspel opgetekend maar op deze manier hoef je ze niet telkens op te zoeken!\nJe kan dit scherm als addon bijbestellen door 13\u20ac bij je pledge bij te tellen, of door dit later in de pledge manager te bestellen. Door nu reeds je pledge te vergroten, help je wel mee om meer stretch goals te unlocken!\nUiteraard vinden we Ambrosia als auteur en uitgever een fantastisch spel, maar hieronder zie je wat anderen over Ambrosia denken.\nDe engelstalige reviewers baseren zich op review exemplaren van de binnenkort te verschijnen engelstalige versie van Ambrosia.\nNox Spellenzolder\n Mr Mean\nThat's How We Roll\n  De Alverlanden\nHieronder kan je nog meer info over Ambrosia bekijken, verstrekt door de auteur zelve.

Become is a game about the development of identity as player programs escape their initial design and build a new cage out of their self-chosen principles.\nThe mechanics of Become are built on a dynamic dice pool system that's easy to learn, with a strategic breadth that rewards experienced players. For groups that prefer narrative roleplay, the focus of the game is on non-combative conflicts resolved through Tests. As players engage in Tests, they construct a pool of possible opportunities and consequences, providing players with a better chance at success by taking bigger risks and creating more nuanced outcomes. For those looking for strategic crunch, the systems of violent conflict are a modular and shifting landscape that allows players to generate interconnected co-op strategies around finding weaknesses and new ways to exploit them.\nThe core component of a campaign of Become is the Mystery. For the Administrator (Become's GM), this system is quick to set up and includes all the tools you need to write and run complex but solvable mysteries that will reward everyone at the table with an investigative story that keeps players in suspense without losing them along the way.\nPrograms in Become come in one of five Designs, depending on their purpose on the Network. These frameworks are the starting point for a player character, and beyond defining the character's role on the team it creates the program's core motivations\u2014 but this prescribed shape doesn't last long. Each time a program dies, it learns something new and changes its value structure, called Compulsions, over time creating an individual identity that could only come from that player and the situations they faced.\nComputer: You are optimized for computation and analysis. You deconstruct and recombine data with remarkable efficiency, and your affinity for systems makes you invaluable to groups seeking to understand a portion of the vast Network.\nCourier: When you look at the Network you see all the in-between places. You see the flow in the crowd and the shift in a room. Your ability to comprehend big-picture systems keeps your allies moving \u2014 and your enemies a step behind.\nVendor: You\u2019re keyed into the economic superstructure of the Network, and you\u2019ve got connections throughout the city. Your skills with constructing new items and your propensity for calling in favors ensures your group is never short-changed.\nSecurity Protocol: You keep Programs safe. You mostly do that by hitting things a lot but hey, no one\u2019s perfect, right? You keep your team alive by making the other teams dead first.\nSensation: You are the Network\u2019s muse. A Program tasked with creating experiential media that keeps the minds of other Programs functional \u2014 that is to say sane. Your position earns you a considerable amount of social capital, which you can use to grease the wheels for your allies.\nOf course, no kickstarter would be complete without rewards, so here are some details!\nPledge levels: all\nYou'll get instant access to a quick-start version of the rules in PDF format!

Think of Han Solo relying on a hyperdrive that keeps shorting out, Starbuck going all in when she really shouldn\u2019t, or Mal Reynold\u2019s last-ditch gambits never quite paying off. NTMO is filled with laughter and pathos as your scoundrels make bigger and bigger bets, going up against higher and higher stakes, all in pursuit of saving whatever matters most to them.\nIn NTMO, you don\u2019t assign any numbers to your scoundrel when you\u2019re creating them. You don\u2019t add traits or apply abilities to affect your ability to succeed. Instead, your scoundrel is built on what matters most to them, and you decide what it is you\u2019re willing to risk when you come up against a check. The odds are always 50/50\u2014NTMO can be played with a coin flip instead of dice. Ready to risk a lot? Your outcome might improve\u2014or you might lose something that really matters to your character. You can always choose to play it safe, of course\u2026 but fortune favors the bold. Just remember: It\u2019s not about whether you succeed or fail, it\u2019s what you risk along the way.\nTry It Out!\nYou can play Never Tell Me the Odds now\u2014the beta playtest version is free right here! Grab a copy and risk it all today! \nReward Levels\nAdd-On\nStretch Goals\nIf Never Tell Me the Odds exceeds its goal, we have lots of exciting stretch goals to make your copy more awesome, including new art and new content! Goals for $1\u201310K are listed below, but more will be added if we smash these! \nAbout the Book\nThis Kickstarter is to release the PDF version of the full NTMO book, including species, specialties, location generators, faction details, creature creators, and more! Check out the full table of contents:\nBecome a Scoundrel\nIn NTMO, you play a space-scoundrel. Character creation takes only a few minutes, but creates deep scoundrels, driven by their values and desires. Start by choosing an identity for your character.  \nThe book includes...\n 12 FACTIONS to inspire your original character concept: Good Society, Hypervikings, the Order of the Stars, Space-Nihilists, the Galactic Congress, the Iron Imperium, the Merchant\u2019s League, the Slime Mob, Sci-Tech Incorporated, the Sprawn, the Revolutionary Allegiance, and Black$ail.\n 6 SPECIES, including 6 unique alien types: Human, Cyborg, Android, Robot, Sentient Animal, and Alien (Bug, Beast, Elemental, Ghost, Psychic, and Slime).\n 12 SPECIALTIES, each with their own unique strength: Bounty Hunter, Brawler, Burglar, Drifter, Gambler, Gunslinger, Hacker, Heartbreaker, Impostor, Peculiar, Smuggler, and Swindler.\nEach faction, species, and specialty will come with their own advantages, as well as inspiration and ideas for quickly building your unique character. \nTo finish building your scoundrel, choose what matters most to your scoundrel. Will reputation be most important to them? Relationships? Maybe they\u2019re driven by one core belief, or maybe they\u2019re vain about their physique, or greedy and materialistic. These choices, called factors, should be specific, but they don\u2019t need to be overly detailed. Here are some examples, and the book has hundreds more, tailor-made for different types of scoundrels:\n BELIEF (what you stand for): \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest idiot in the galaxy\u201d \u201cHonor gets you killed\u201d \u201cYou always gotta repay your debts\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a hero\u201d \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you\u201d etc.\n PHYSIQUE (how you're built): Athletic, Gorgeous, Nimble, Intimidating, Built Like a Brick House, Incredibly Tall, Inconspicuous, Well-Groomed, etc.\n POSSESSION (what you have): Laser gun, Spaceship, Lucky dice, Personal communicator, Fake I.D., Medical kit, Navy uniform, Translator, Spacesuit, Tracking device, Robot sidekick, etc.\n RELATIONSHIP (who you care about): Partner, Parent, Sibling, Ex, Friend, Crush, Roommate, Classmate, Mentor, Student, Colleague, Employer, Neighbor, Ally, etc.\n REPUTATION (what you're known for): Best pilot in the galaxy, Best gambler you\u2019ve ever seen, A perfect shot, The ultimate charmer, Someone you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with, etc.\n RESOURCE (what you know): Secret bank account, An old favor, Blackmail material, Stolen data, Book of card tricks, Criminal contact, Corrupt official, etc.\nThat's it! You're ready to play.\nRunning Risks\nOnce the action is underway, you\u2019ll reach a point where you have to decide what your scoundrel is going to do in a situation with uncertain outcomes. When you reach a check, the storyteller, or Risk Moderator (RM), explains how risky the situation is. There are three options:\n High risk situations: Incredibly tense or difficult conditions with extreme outcomes, like trying to leap across a chasm, saying the perfect thing to comfort a grieving widow, engaging in combat with a deadly psychic warrior, or attempting a spacewalk to repair a ship as it spins towards a black hole.\n Moderate risk situations: Situations where the outcome matters but mistakes aren\u2019t deadly, like negotiating a deal, sneaking out of an airlock without being noticed, punching a brawler in a barfight, or charting a safe course through hostile terrain.\n Low risk situations: Low-stakes situations where not much will be lost by failure, like trying to impress a potential client, executing a correct docking procedure, playing a game of chance that\u2019s fixed in your favor, or intimidating a cowardly bureaucrat. \nWhen the RM describes a check, choose a single factor, and telling the table what it is and why it fits the check. It\u2019s up to you and the RM to work out how the factor is appropriate to the check. If you can\u2019t think of a reason that any of your factors apply to a check, consider allowing one of your crewmates to handle the check instead.\nWhen taking a risk and rolling dice, you can choose whether to downplay the risk (choosing to venture something you don't care much about), match it, or exceed it (risking something of great value). You can think of this as applying how much your scoundrel cares about a situation. If you exceed a risk, you'll always succeed, but you might endanger what you care about most.\nWhose Galaxy Is This, Anyway?\nIt's yours! Never Tell Me the Odds comes with ideas for a dozen factions you can build into your game, as well as ships, planets, civilizations, and aliens you might encounter on your interstellar travels. \nBut these are made to echo and reflect classic space opera tropes. You can play NTMO as a system to explore your favorite space-franchise, in a steampunk-flavored future, in a gritty cyberpunk alternate reality, or any world you choose. The worldbuilding tools are there for you to use if you want\u2014but it's your galaxy!\nThe Project Team\nTHE DESIGNER: David Somerville is the creator of Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Lightning & Bolt, and micro-RPGs like Accio Hogwarts.

Da jeder Spieler eine tragende Rolle in der Geschichte hat, nennt man diese Spiele auch Rollenspiele, und So nicht, Schurke! ist ein Rollenspiel speziell f\u00fcr Kinder und ihre Familien. Die Regeln sind so flexibel gestaltet, dass sich das Spiel m\u00fchelos an verschiedene Spielbegabungen und Komplexit\u00e4tsgrade anpasst. Ein mehrstufiges Charakterbau-System erm\u00f6glicht es schon Kindern ab f\u00fcnf Jahren problemlos Teil der Geschichte zu werden, w\u00e4hrend \u00e4ltere Geschwister und Erwachsene gleichzeitig auf einem h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgrad spielen.

Die Charaktere, die es nach Fabula verschl\u00e4gt, sind selbst Kinder, die speziell daf\u00fcr auserw\u00e4hlt wurden, Fabula vor den Schurken zu besch\u00fctzen, die das B\u00f6se in die Welt bringen wollen. Zusammen mit lustigen, s\u00fc\u00dfen oder furchteinfl\u00f6\u00dfenden Begleitern und mithilfe von jeder Menge coolem und hilfreichem Kram brechen die Charaktere nach Fabula auf und k\u00e4mpfen f\u00fcr das Gute! \nNo Thank You, Evil! wird So nicht, Schurke!  \nSo nicht, Schurke! ist die deutsche \u00dcbersetzung des preisgekr\u00f6nten Spiels No Thank You, Evil! von Monte Cook Games. Der Verlag des bekannten amerikanischen Rollenspielautors Monte Cook hat seit 2012 f\u00fcr Furore in der Szene gesorgt. Allein das Grundregelwerk des Rollenspiels Numenera wurde in sieben Kategorien mit einem Ennie ausgezeichnet. Doch w\u00e4hrend Rollenspiel fr\u00fcher ein Hobby allein f\u00fcr Jugendliche zu sein schien, sind heute viele Fans erwachsen und haben Familien. Und sie wollen ihre Abenteuer gerne mit ihren Kindern teilen. Aber selten sind die Regelsysteme und Spielwelten der Rollenspiele kindgerecht. No Thank You, Evil! sollte genau diese L\u00fccke f\u00fcllen und ist bis heute einzigartig darin.\nDas Regelsystem basiert auf dem Cypher System, das auch Numenera zu Grunde liegt. Nach mehr als einem Jahr der Forschung im Bereich Kinderspiele und Spielerfahrungen wurde es so angepasst, dass es auch f\u00fcr kleine Kinder schon problemlos spielbar ist, ohne f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere langweilig zu werden. Dazu kam eine liebevoll designte Welt, die M\u00e4rchen und Gruselgeschichten wahr werden l\u00e4sst und die Kreativit\u00e4t anregt. No Thank You, Evil! wurde 2016 mit dem Ennie Gold Award und 2017 mit dem Origins Award ausgezeichnet, und es begeistert nicht nur alteingesessene Rollenspieler, sondern auch Neueinsteiger in das Hobby. Es war so erfolgreich, dass Monte Cook Games mehrere Erweiterungen geschaffen hat und das Grundspiel bereits in der zweiten Auflage erscheint. Und mit So nicht, Schurke! m\u00f6chte der Uhrwerk Verlag dieses besondere Spiel nun auch nach Deutschland bringen, zusammen mit allen Erweiterungen.\nDie Basisbox\nDieses Kickstarter-Projekt dient nicht nur der Finanzierung des Basisspiels von So nicht, Schurke!.

Nat\u00fcrlich gilt es auch, in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden alle Backer \u00fcber den Status des Projektes zu informieren und bei Nachfragen schnell und gezielt zu reagieren.\n\nDennoch k\u00f6nnen wir Verz\u00f6gerungen nat\u00fcrlich nicht ausschlie\u00dfen. Wir k\u00f6nnen euch aber versichern, dass wir euch zum einen stets \u00fcber eventuelle Verz\u00f6gerungen auf dem Laufenden halten werden und daran arbeiten diese schnellstm\u00f6glich zu beheben. Auch sind wir der Meinung, dass man nicht zu viele Crowdfunding-Projekte parallel laufen haben sollte, bevor die vorherigen Projekte weitestgehend abgeschlossen oder zumindest auf einem gut Weg sind \u2013 auch hier k\u00f6nnt ihr euch auf uns verlassen, dass wir uns nicht verzetteln.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Postkarte nach Fabula", "descp": "Du m\u00f6chtest uns einfach symbolisch unterst\u00fctzen oder \u00fcber die Neuheiten und Entwicklungen dieses Projekts auf dem Laufenden bleiben?

Those few who have seen its pages are now but blasted ash. It's your turn, mortal. Be careful when you turn its pages...\nThanks everyone for a terrific Kickstarter! If you missed it, you can find the finished product at www.goodman-games.com once it's in print!\nColor cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, also known as DCC RPG, is the most fun you\u2019ll ever have playing an RPG. It is also a game founded in principle. Important amongst those principles is an aversion to rules bloat. The DCC RPG core rulebook is but a single book. There are no splatbooks, sourcebooks, character books, monster manuals, or other supplements for DCC RPG. They are not needed. Incumbent upon the judge is the need to create: yon horizon is filled with adventure, and it is your adventure. You have worlds inside you: find them.\nYet the urge to create is a hungry god, and gods demand nourishment. It was originally conceived that an annual publication would exist in some form to showcase the brilliance of the DCC RPG community. This would be the DCC RPG Annual, published each year to distribute these gaming creations.\nThe best of things happened: the DCC RPG Annual was never needed. The DCC community burst forth a verdant jungle of inspiration, with ripe fruit on every limb. Blogs and personal posts; zines; community publications; the Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac; officially licensed third-party works: there is a vast supply of inspiration from whence the DCC judge can draw and iterate.\nAnd thus we come here to Kickstart a volume which has no place. If you are a DCC fan, you absolutely do not need to support this Kickstarter. Should you to desire to do so, however, you will receive a book that has become a legend, despite never before being published.\nFoil cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs. Imagine this printed in gold foil on a leatherette background.\nThe DCC RPG Annual\nSpoken about for half a decade in hoary whispers, at long last Goodman Games brings you: the DCC RPG Annual. Much of the material for the DCC Annual was written between 2012 and 2014, when the original need was perceived. In many ways, it springs forth from the original inspirations of DCC RPG, which were psychically close at that time. There are magic swords. There are patrons. There are even more tables for making monsters unique. There are rules for making cleric deities more distinctive. There are rules for patron weapons and magic rings. There is the lost continent of Mu, and the hidden places between worlds. And there are rules for magical moustaches.\nThe DCC Annual is a hardcover estimated at 160 pages finished length. Like the original DCC RPG core rulebook, it is available in two cover options: a full-color and foil cover edition. It is organized in the same manner as the DCC RPG core rulebook: chapter three is equipment, chapter five is magic, and chapter nine is monsters, just as in the core rulebook. There is no chapter two, because the skills section of the core rulebook has no expansion material in the Annual.\nThe DCC Annual comes in two cover versions. The color cover is painted by Doug Kovacs and features Hugh the Barbarian and his Band. There's a story in this cover, a chapter of the Band history, for those who can find it. There is also a foil edition featuring a new foil design (and someone\u2019s decapitated head). For this Kickstarter, the foil edition will be printed in gold foil. The distribution version will be printed in silver foil. And never fear, art fans \u2013 the foil edition also features Doug's amazing cover art from the color cover edition (reproduced on the interior pages of the foil edition).\nYou absolutely do not need the DCC Annual to play DCC RPG, nor does any material in the Annual supersede or otherwise change the baseline game experience as expressed in the core rulebook. There is no rules bloat: only new vistas of imagination.\nAnd with every gift from the gods, comes a toll. Not only does this Kickstarter offer the DCC Annual, but it also offers three other artifacts to show your devotion: a new printing of the DCC RPG core book featuring yet more amazing art; a new hardcover edition of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin; and an opening offer of the DCC Quick Start Rules for new initiates. Read on! \nThe Shanna Dahaka cover to the DCC Core Rulebook! By Doug Kovacs\nNew Fans, Welcome!\nWe invite newcomers to join the Cult of DCC! As part of this Kickstarter, we are offering the DCC RPG Quick Start rules, in print+PDF format, for the ridiculously low price of $2.00. That price includes postage to anywhere in the world. If you haven\u2019t experienced DCC RPG, this is your chance to get in very affordably. The Quick Start Rules include everything needed to get your character from level 0 to level 2, and also include two one-session adventure modules. This pledge level also includes three free PDF adventures of our choosing.\nWe are also giving away a PDF of the Quick Start Rules for free at this link right here. If you\u2019re not sure what DCC RPG is, this is a great way to test the waters!\nAnd finally, if you as a newcomer decide you want to jump in a little deeper, we invite you to check out the Three Best Pledge Levels, detailed below. The Favored Retainer level offers an affordable way to get started on DCC RPG. \nThe pterodactyl-wizard cover to the DCC core rulebook! By Sanjulian\nDCC RPG Core Rulebook, 7th printing\nAlso offered in this Kickstarter are two other items of interest to the DCC gamer: a new printing of the core rulebook, including new cover art, and a compiled hardcover edition of DCC #83: the Chained Coffin.\nThe DCC RPG core rulebook has been through 4 hardcover and 2 softcover printings prior to this run. (And wow, isn\u2019t that amazing? Thanks everyone for the support!) Now that the hardcover is once again out of print, we are doing another printing.\nAs always, the content is materially identical to prior printings (except for fixing a couple typos). There will be a new adventure substituted in the back, as we do for each printing This printing includes \"Yddgrrl's Maze,\" a level 2 adventure by Michael Curtis. In addition, this print run will be distinguished by the covers. We are offering three covers on this hardcover edition:\n\u00b7 The \u201cbasic blue\u201d cover, the classic Doug Kovacs cover we all know and love.\n\u00b7 The Sanjulian cover. Fans of 1970's fantasy and sci-fi art will know Sanjulian's art from Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie, as well as his run of Conan covers. This is the red-and-yellow \u201cpterodactyl-wizard\u201d cover you see above. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo.\n\u00b7 Doug\u2019s new Shanna Dahaka cover. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo. \nThe hardcover 2nd printing of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. Cover art by Ken Kelly\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin (hardcover 2nd printing)\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin was originally released way back in 2014. The boxed set proved immensely popular, and not just for the spinning map puzzle. The Appalachian-style fantasy setting of The Shudder Mountains, inspired by the works of Appendix N author Manly Wade Wellman, provides a unique place for your characters to adventure. Michael Curtis did a wonderful job of bringing The Shudder Mountains alive, and several supplemental volumes were published.\nNow that the original boxed set is out of print, we are offering a hardcover book that compiles all material from the original DCC #83: The Chained Coffin boxed set, including all the stretch goal booklets, as well as much, much more:\n\u00b7 All content from DCC #83.1: Tales of the Shudder Mountains and DCC #83.2: Death Among the Pines\n\u00b7 The Shudder Mountain material published in several Gen Con Program Guides\n\u00b7 Moon Eyes and Fire-Flies, a new adventure set in the Shudder Mountains\n\u00b7 Buzzard Hollow, a new Shudder Mountains mini-setting\n\u00b7 Ma Bigginty\u2019s Book of Backwoods Wisdom,a collection of inspiration material that will bring the Shudder Mountains to life in your game\nThe DCC #83 hardcover is estimated at 160 pages and yes, it will also include the spinning map puzzle! (We are working with the printer on logistics, but the most likely scenario is having the map tucked inside the back cover of each hardcover.)\nOne last thing. Doug\u2019s original art for DCC #83 is amazing, but you know we like variety. The hardcover edition features new art by none other than fantasy legend Ken Kelly. Fans of 1970s Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie will also recognize the work of Ken Kelly, whose career also includes a long stretch of amazing illustrations. And his illustration builds on Doug\u2019s original design for the chained coffin itself. And don\u2019t worry, Doug\u2019s original cover art will also appear in the hardcover edition.\nDCC #83 will also be available in a foil edition, featuring the same amazing image that was printed on the limited-run foil editions of the original module. This cover art is timeless and deserves to remain in print. The Kickstarter edition will feature a different foil color than the distribution edition.\nThe original \"blue cover\" edition of DCC RPG core rulebook. By Doug Kovacs\nThe Three Best Pledge Levels\nIf you'd like to buy copies individually, the table below shows their cost. You can add on funds to purchase more than one book. However, there are some bundle deals that offer a great value. See the summary after the table: \nThe Three Best Pledge Levels. We are offering three great deals that make it easy to back multiple books in this Kickstarter. If you\u2019re a new fan, a dedicated fan, or a diehard collector, one of these is for you.\nFavored Retainer: You are new to the adventure, and you have promise. This pledge level is for new DCC fans and offers a $120 of product for $100. You\u2019ll receive the color-cover editions of the DCC Annual, core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. If you would like to have the Sanjulian or Shanna Dahaka covers for the DCC Core Rulebook, pledge for this level and add an extra +$20 for the price difference.\n Name Level: Your fame precedes you within the DCC community. This $150 pledge is a $30 savings on the cover price of $180. At the Name Level pledge, you\u2019ll receive DCC Annual (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), DCC #83: The Chained Coffin (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), and a copy of the DCC RPG core rulebook, with your choice of either the Sanjulian or Doug Kovacs cover.\nLanded Lord: Other fans make pilgrimage to witness to your legendary collection. This $300 pledge is a $60 savings on the cover price of $360. As a Landed Lord, you will receive everything offered in the Kickstarter, which is seven books: both covers of the DCC Annual, both covers of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin, and all three covers of the DCC RPG core rulebook (7th printing).\nPrint + PDF\nEvery print copy of the DCC Annual, DCC core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin books offered in this Kickstarter also includes a PDF edition.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThis is stated elsewhere but also to call it out explicitly: this Kickstarter features cover variants that are exclusive as follows:\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Sanjulian edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Doug Kovacs Shanna Dahaka edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC Annual, foil cover edition: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\n\u00b7 DCC #83: The Chained Coffin: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\nShipping Costs\nPlease note that shipping costs are not included in the pledge levels. Shipping costs will be assessed at a later date via Backer Kit. \nUSA shipments will ship via media mail, bound printed matter or equivalent rates.\nInternational shipments will ship via a tracked service, most likely FedEx or UPS. We will endeavor to find the cheapest option, and also partner with international shipping partners where possible to reduce VAT charges via local-market shipping. \nThe exact cost of each shipment will vary according to the content but please be aware that the hardcover books in this Kickstarter are heavy. International backers should expect to pay minimum postage charges for a single book of at least $20-$25 for Canada, $30-$35 for Europe, and $35-$40 for Australia and Asia. Additional books will obviously add to this cost. Final cost will be assessed via Backer Kit. \nStretch Goals\nWe have learned over the years that there are so many ways to make these books cool! We\u2019ve already worked out a couple options as options for stretch goals, which are listed below. As the project progresses we are open to suggestions from fans on others!\nAt $40,000: CLEARED!We will print new color art on the endsheets of the DCC Annual.\nAt $65,000: CLEARED! We will print maps on the endsheets of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. PLUS we will include a free 11x17 poster print of one piece of cover art with every print pledge!\nAt $80,000: CLEARED!Free adventure! For every book you buy, you'll get one free DCC adventure module in PDF format (exact module to be determined). (The $2 quick start rules don't count!)\nAt $100,000: CLEARED! We will include satin ribbon bookmarks in the DCC Core Rulebook and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin.\nAt $125,000: CLEARED!We will include printed 11\u201dx17\u201d posters of the cover art. There will be several \u201ccheckpoints\u201d on this stretch goal and we\u2019ll use backer feedback to decide which posters to print \u2013 the Chained Coffin cover, the Annual cover, the Sanjulian cover, etc. (Or maybe we\u2019ll just blow past this stretch goal and print them all!)\nBeyond that: We have some fun ideas. We would like to print custom dust jackets featuring the Deadly Hands of DCC art that premiered at Gen Con 2018. Some fans have requested books bound in real leather, and that may be an option we unlock. And we\u2019re open to your ideas as well!\nThe Demon Skull Add-On\nWe are also producing a version of the DCC RPG core rulebook that features the original iconic demon skull image.

Miniatures is seeking to add 5 new dice of unusual size with mass production of new dice for their dice chains! \nFirst up the D36-2D6\nA D36 (results from 1 to 36) that also accurately shows the results of rolling 2 D6s as well (the pips above and below the D36 show the result of each D6).   The combination of being able to roll 3 dice with each roll allows you to create some interesting new fantasy tables for your RPGs.   One samples is shown below\nNext we have a D21 (the super crit die)\nThe D21 (results from 1 to 21) extends the dice chain that Impact! offers with now all the numbers of sided dice from D3 to D21.  The D21 should make a fun element for a DM/GM.  If you feel that a player is playing very well or has important advantages for an upcoming D20 roll ... hand them the D21 to roll instead allowing them 2 chances to Crit a natural 20.\n Two new alphabet dice into the mix\nThe D26 Alphabet die with the entire alphabet on it was popular from the last KickStarter.  So for those creating/playing word games we added to complimentary dice to expand the options.   We split the D26 into a D5 and D21.    The D21 has all the consonants on it and the D5 has the five major vowels on it.\nFinally we are adding a Fate die to the mix based on a human pulse!\nFate RPG systems are fun alternative systems.  This converts the +, +, -, -, 0, 0 into a human pulse going around the die.  See a pulse (+), flatline (-) and then 2 blank sides.\nDICE CHAINS  (What are they?  Why are they great?)\nI have helped several game companies design rules for games.  When I was introduced to Dice Chain Mechanics for RPGs by Dungeon Crawl Classics and Freeblades I realized they created just a smoother set of rules for RPGs.  \nWith a standard RPG as your character progresses he/she receives +1 or more to their dice rolls but then you need special rules that a roll of a natural 1 still fails in the rules.  With Dice Chain mechanics as you character progresses the next dice in the chain is used.  So at level 2 your Barbarian rolls a D11 instead of a D10 when using an axe.  No need for special rules for failure as a 1 is still possible when they roll.  \nCOLORS\nBelow are the colors that you can choose from for all of the dice sets in the project.  9 opaque colors and 5 specialty colors. \nDICE MENU\nBelow is a menu that you can use the amount you pledge plus any bonus dollars your reward level offers to pick your own custom reward.  When the pledge manager is released after the project is over, each backer will be able to select the dice sets, dice and colors that you want from the below menu.  All backers can add extra to their amount pledged to any reward level to use to shop with on the dice menu.  Stretch Goals many add on additional bonus dollars for you to use for free.  \nPLEASE NOTE AT THIS TIME FOR THE NEW DICE:\nAll 5 dice (D36-2D6, D21 (numbered), D21 (consonant), D5 (vowel) and Pulse Fate) are only available in Black and Purple for opaque colors and Glow in the Dark and Translucent Teal for specialty colors.\n(more colors will unlock when stretch goals are reached)\nQuick Read Dice Menu first (provided by Backer Alvin Helms)\nSTANDARD SHIPPING\nShipping will be charged after the KickStarter is over as part of the pledge manager based on current shipping costs.   Currently I expect these charges to be $5 for US shipping, $13 for Canada shipping and $17 to the Rest of the World.   PLEASE NOTE:  Shipping is EU friendly.   In the 4 previous dice KickStarters I ran I did not have anyone report paying customs so there should be no risk of customs charges on your reward.  \nWAVE 1 EARLY SHIPPING\nYou can add on money to your pledge for shipping your order early (or in 2 shipments).  Wave 1 shipping will be before February 2019 instead of September 2019.  This means any dice in your reward that are ready to ship by end of year will be shipped to you by February 2019 and any dice not yet in will ship to you as soon as they come in.  For an extra $5 for US addresses, $13 for Canada or $17 Rest of the World, your reward will ship (or as much as possible will ship) in February 2019.\n\"Pulse\" FATE / FUDGE Dice KickStarter and The Merged D6 (Md6) Revoluntionary Dice KickStarter Backers\nWhile I have no connection to either of these KickStarter projects that never delivered those dice to the backers, I will work with you to get the dice I made similar to those projects.  If you just want to get those dice at cost (you can pledge for the $2 reward level) and after I confirm you were a backer of one or both of those projects I can get you those dice for cost. \nOR you can pledge for this dice from this project and let me know you backed one or both of those projects and I will give you one free Pulse Fate die or one free D36-2D6 for every $10 you pledge up to the amount you should have received from those projects that you backed.\nSOCIAL MEDIA  (or How you can help get yourself and everyone else more free dice and options)\nBelow are a list of stretch goal for the project.  I will do everything I can do get the project out there but nothing works for unlocking stretch goals like the backers of a project giving it some assistance.   Share the project on Facebook, Send out a Tweet that you backed it, Let friends know about it on group pages and forums.

We also are very busy people and we always want to avoid the hassle that comes with the preparation for a tournament and handling of game elements during the game \u2013 all this takes those precious minutes-turning-into-hours, stealing from our fun time. This is why we gave a good thought on how to facilitate the game process by reducing the number of operations and instead \u2013 focus on the game.\nThis was the beginning of our new range, a series of smart and useful devices for true board game lovers. This October, exclusively on Kickstarter, we are launching The Ugears Games collection, designed especially for those who like the challenge and excitement of a game and appreciate the beauty of clever mechanisms:  the Card Holder, the modular Dice Tower, the Deck Box, the Game Master\u2019s Screen, and traditionally the Secret model, which we have just revealed.  In this Campaign the secret model is the Dice Keeper.\nThe Card Holder Mechanical Device (a prototype photo)\nThe Card Holder accommodates up to 500 game cards in 16 compartments with spacers (a prototype photo)\nThe Modular Dice Tower can be used as a traditional dice tower (a prototype photo)\nThe Modular Dice Tower is comprised of a set of 4 individual dice cups that can either open completely or set ajar (a prototype photo)\nThe Game Master's Screen.

No matter what type of a board game you prefer these days \u2013 the variety of available smart wooden gadgets will have something to offer you.\nThe devices of Ugears Games collection are useful and functional: they will serve to store, transport, and save space on your gaming table. Traditionally, our products are not merely a functionality: the iconic Ugears design and intricate beautiful woodwork makes them attractive game accessories, unique d\u00e9cor elements, and a wonderful present to a fellow-gamer.\nThe Ugears Games collection will take your gaming experience to a new level: our new devices will make sure you can bravely explore your gaming universe without distractions and interruptions. \nThe Ugears Games Devices project is designed to help people to improve their gaming experience by eliminating all those additional operations, saving time and space to focus on your favorite game in the nice company of friends. We are glad to be back on Kickstarter. It provides live and direct communication with people from different countries from all round the world who share our ideas, interests, and this hobby. It\u2019s really inspiring for us. We appreciate your feedback. Now it is time to make your move! So follow us, support us and be the part of our success story. \nEmail us: myugears@ugearsmodels.com\nMedia-Kit download \nThe Card Holder: Mechanical Device Designed to Put Your Cards and Gaming Table in Order   \nAs it very often occurs in a large-scale board game that involves a lot of cards, the available space on the gaming table becomes a real problem. In addition, due to the lack of room, the cards mix up ruining the course of game and making the players return to sorting them over and over again. The Card Holder, a smart wooden box, is designed to eliminate these annoying inconveniences.  \nThis device allows you to sufficiently improve the game by handling your cards while saving space on the gaming table. The space savings is so efficient that you can easily enjoy you game sitting at a table smaller than your regular one - with the same number of players. If you\u2019re out of time and the game is only half-way through, take a picture of your battle field and continue the game later from that point.\nThe attractive wooden exterior of the Card Holder hides a smart extending mechanism that turns the box into ergonomic staircase shelves that allow you to conveniently pick a card from any stack in your Card Holder. Your new clever device has 12 compartments with spacers that accommodate up to 400 63.5\u044588 mm (2.48\u201d x 3.46\u201d) cards. The compartments are big enough to hold the cards in sleeves. In the extended mode the Card Holder enables four extra slots for up to 100 cards of 45\u044568 mm (1.77\u201d x 2.68\u201d) size.\nIn between games, your Card Holder will serve as a convenient and reliable storage unit: place your cards securely inside the device, lock with a self-contained latch. It is now ready to travel in your backpack. \nThe Card Holder from Ugears will clear your table to ensure the most efficient arrangement of game elements and maximum comfort to the players.\nModular Dice Tower\nA clever adaptable model, the Modular Dice Tower can be used as a traditional dice tower as well as a set of four individual dice cups. The cups can either open completely or set ajar, which is especially convenient in case a player would like to avoid sharing the results of his roll but wants to take a peek himself. \nThis device is one of the most fun ones: each of the modules has detachable details. Reorganize them in accordance with the detailed instruction manual that comes with the model and you will have a single multistoried Dice Tower. Originally, The Modular Dice Tower is comprised of four dice cups, but you are not limited to four blocks. Two sets of this 3D puzzle will give you an eight-storied Dice Tower and twice as much fun! \nIndividually, the dice cups can serve the quartet of gamers in their quest. No more running after a runaway die or crawling under the table searching for the game piece that jumped off the edge. Just put your dice inside a small cubical box and give it a good shake. Put your dice cup back on the table and simultaneously push the buttons on the sides. This will release the bottom of the box with your dice sitting in it. Now it is time to make your move!\nEvery individual cup is perfectly compatible with each other and you and your friends can build the world tallest dice tower limited only by the number of cups you have \u2013 and your imagination. \nThe original idea of this device is its adaptability. Individually, the dice cups can serve the quartet of gamers in their quest or can be transformed into a single multistoried Dice Tower. The wall of each dice cup has the same design. Your question was: \u201cAre you going to introduce alternative designs of the fantasy-style face on the individual dice cups?\u201d\nWe say YES, we are. Our team has developed a number of new styles for individual cups. We would like to share the modified designs of these layouts. The Modular Dice Tower is comprised of 4 dice cups, each has its own fantasy-style face. So you can mix them as you wish among co-players and each storey of the Dice Tower will have its own face. We would appreciate your feedback for this idea. \nGame Master's Screen\nThis folding screen with an easy cheat sheets replacement mechanism and a built-in dice-tower helps the TRPG Master to better comprehend the game world mechanics and smoothly lead the game: at any time the Game Master can check necessary information by easily changing one sheet with another. \nThe Game Master can conceal his personal treasures and secrets behind the Screen, such as notes about the game, figurines and even a cup of tea. The built-in dice tower adds extra-suspense to the game: the time between the moment when the Master\u2019s dice fall and the revealed results charge the atmosphere with extreme excitement.  \nWhen folded together, this unconventional looking device resembles a large book. Completely unfolded it opens as a screen with four panels, each of which has a special rubber-band fixture to hold an A4 size sheet of paper. Of course, you don\u2019t have to use all four panels at the same time. If you need to save space on your gaming table, you can easily fold one or two panels away.\nThe fantasy inspired detail of the wooden panels is designed to make you feel like a real Master of the Game holding an ancient folio about an adventure, the greatest of them all. \nCompletely unfolded it opens as a screen with four panels, each of which has a special rubber-band fixture to hold an A4 size sheet of paper. This was an original idea and we left out the US paper standard! Your comments helped us to work in the required changes and make the device perfectly suitable for US Letter 8.5\" x 11\" (215.9 x 279.4mm) size of sheets.\nMechanical Deck Box\nThe Mechanical Deck Box is a must-have for those who like Collectible Card Games and Living Card Games. Your cards will always be in perfect order waiting for you to push the button to release them from the comfortable compartments of the Deck Box.\nThe Deck Box is a handsome small chest that will fit nicely in the palm of your hand. The inner compartments can accommodate up to 120 game cards (traditional, sleeved or double sleeved) 2.48\u201d x 3.46\u201d (63.5\u044588 mm), 60 cards each. \nPushing special ledges on the sides of its lid triggers a mechanism that opens the box: the upper parts of the side panels slide down while the lid opens to the sides granting convenient access to two inner compartments. The device automatically latches in the open mode. \nTo close it, push the button on the body of the model. This will release a spring loaded mechanism that will return the side panels and the lid to their initial position. Your cards will stay secured inside, protected from spillage and damage.\nIn the preliminary stage of the campaign, we shared the link for your feedback and later received many questions such as whether the Deck Box accommodates the cards from different games in sleeves or double sleeves. We have already made changes in the Deck Box design and increased the size of two inner compartments. \nNow, the Mechanical Deck Box is suitable for: \nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm size without sleeves = 120 pcs (60 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with sleeves with one plastic side = 80 pcs (40 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with classic sleeves = 110 pcs (55 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with double sleeves = 76 pcs (38 pcs in each compartment)\nSecret Model = Dice Keeper\nIt became a good tradition for the Ugears team to prepare special and amazing add-ons along with main rewards. And the name of this secret intriguing device for tabletop games is Dice Keeper. \nThe Dice Keeper is a perfect game accessory that keeps your dice safe and secure, sitting comfortably in individual slots. Designed to store dices  it can also accommodate tiny trinkets, jewelry, miniature souvenirs or secret micro-chips. \nThe Dice Keeper (prototype photo)\nThe Dice Keeper is a small chest with fine carved ornamentation in a fantasy style. A minimalistic opening mechanism lowers the side panels of the chest revealing its contents.\nThe model has the shape of a compact cube with 8 compartments to accommodate a standard dice set. A mechanism lifting the walls securely sets your dice inside to prevent from spilling and being lost in transit.\nIf you are a dice collector, a passionate gamer, or just fond of unique mechanical devices, The Dice Keeper will become your favorite accessory to your table top battles. The Ugears design makes it also a unique d\u00e9cor element, or a great present for your gamer friends.\n Ugears Games Devices Collection: Early Birds, Rewards and Add-Ons \nIf you would like to add a few devices to your pledge, simply add the cost of the device to the cost of devices in your pledge and indicate all the devices you pledged for in the survey after the campaign.

Have you ever wanted to join that tiny world and emulate your favorite mousey characters?\nThe Rodent Rangers RPG is your chance to do just that! In this family-friendly tabletop game, you and your friends or family take on the roles of mice (or other small critters) living in the modern human world. Your characters are field agents of an international organization of problem-solvers called the Rodent Rangers, and you'll be sent out on adventures to help those in need.\nYour captain will send you where your skills can do the most good!\nWhat's the Game Like?\nRodent Rangers is set in the modern world, with mice (and other small critters) living right under the noses of oblivious humans. While humans continue under the delusion that theirs is the only civilization, mice live happily in the walls, basements and sewers of human cities, furnishing themselves with the scavenged scraps of the humans' materials and tech.\nThe organization known as the Rodent Rangers is headquartered in the basement of the American Red Cross building in Washington, D.C. From there, teams of agents with a variety of skill sets are sent all over the globe on missions to help others, whether by rescuing lost or stranded civilians, bringing supplies to disaster sites, recovering stolen relics, or unraveling mysteries.\nLike most tabletop RPGs, Rodent Rangers is a game of collaborative storytelling in which players get to play the protagonists of the story, and roll dice to determine the outcomes of risky or uncertain actions. Your attributes and skills combine to determine a pool of dice to roll, and if enough dice roll a 4 or higher, then your action succeeds. With clever decisions, a bit of luck, and a lot of courage, your mice will overcome obstacles and save the day!\nThe dice will help you tell your stories of problem solving, helping others, and even foiling the schemes of dastardly villains!\nWhat's the Product? \nThe Rodent Rangers Core Rulebook will give you all the rules and guidance you need to create your characters and dive into a world of mouse-sized adventure. Additionally, The Wreck of the Morning Lady offers a ready-made story for you to play through if you want to get a game under your belt before creating adventures of your own. \nBoth of these titles will be published electronically as PDF files via DriveThruRPG.com, where they will also be available via the site's own print-on-demand (POD) functionality. But remember, getting these books as pledge rewards will be cheaper than buying them at retail, so don't miss out!\nUnlike many RPGs, Rodent Rangers doesn't require your hero to be a fighter. You can save the day as a scholarly expert too!\nWhere is my money going?\nGreat question! Exact numbers will depend on the final funding amount, and even the proportions might change due to some costs scaling differently than others. Even so, here's an approximate breakdown:\nMost of the money pays for art, writing, and development; I've also budgeted for the taxes/fees involved plus a small buffer for unforeseen expenses.\nWho is working on this project?\nThe original concept/design of the game, as well as the raw manuscript of the starter adventure, are authored by my brother, Joseph L Kellogg. We've contracted for him to pass the torch to me to do all the development and make publication happen. The sample art you've seen above was created by Carolyn Paplham and Meghan Dornbrock.\nWill there be any Stretch Goals?\nIf the project funds quickly, then I'd be happy to add some stretch goals! Sound off in the comments to let me know what you'd like to see if we reach that point.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is being published electronically and through a reliable print-on-demand service, you get to skip all the risks associated with a traditional print run.

Although I'm confident I can complete the project (my previous project is on schedule), there is always the possibility of flaky contractors or me getting hit by a bus.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jacob S Kellogg\n4 created \u00b7 16 backed\nBestselling tabletop game designer.

Practicing type design with two very different approaches (one practical and historical, the other theoritical and fictionnal) this project is a chance for us to try and produce a unique typeface, called Erwin, using an unexpected process and making this campain both a visual and theoritical playground.\nUne fonte variable quantique ?\n\u2014 A quantum variable font?\n[fr] Les fontes variables, nouveaux n\u00e9s des standards du format OpenType semblent \u00eatre pour tous le futur in\u00e9luctable de la typographie. Les caract\u00e8res ne sont plus ancr\u00e9s dans une tangibilit\u00e9 claire aux contours finis, mais plut\u00f4t pens\u00e9s comme des nuages aux formes \u00e9th\u00e9r\u00e9es, pr\u00eats \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser tous nos souhaits. Nous sommes aujourd'hui addicts \u00e0 ces possibilit\u00e9s infinies.\nLe caract\u00e8re que nous comptons produire pour cette campagne, l'Erwin, n'embrasse pas cette complexit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9f\u00e8re se penser comme une boite de Schr\u00f6dinger. Une infinit\u00e9 de possibles, oui, mais uniquement en th\u00e9orie. Con\u00e7ue \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'une fonte variable, avec quatre extr\u00e8mes aux structures bien diff\u00e9rentes, une seule instance sera finalement tir\u00e9e au hasard parmi l'enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du design space. Une fois ce caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 nous nous engageons \u00e0 d\u00e9truire d\u00e9finitivement les quatre masters originaux, faisant de cette instance la seule it\u00e9ration jamais possible. Ainsi, personne n\u2019aura jamais connaissance des autres formes qu\u2019aurait pu rev\u00eatir l'Erwin.\nLa fonte sera ensuite plac\u00e9e sous licence SIL Open Font, la rendant libre, autorisant son utilisation, sa modification et sa redistribution par qui le souhaite, gratuitement.\n[en] Variable fonts, the latest innovation of the OpenType format, seem to be the inevitable future of type design. Fonts are no longer tangible entities, but rather conceived as clouds made of etherical shapes, ready to realise our every whishes, making us addicted to infinit possisibilities.\nErwin, the typeface are going to produce for this campain, rejects this kind of complexity and thinks itself more as a Schr\u00f6dinger box. Infinite possibilities, only as long as it is not released. Designed as a variable font with four extremes featuring very different structures, only one iteration will randomly be picked out of the desin space. We then promess to destroy the masters, making the one generated instance the only outcome ever. Nobody will ever know the other forms that the font could have incarnated.\nThe font will ultimately be distributed under SIL Open font License, making it free for anyone to download, use, distribute and modify it.\nComment l\u2019it\u00e9ration sera-t-elle tir\u00e9e au hasard ?\n\u2014 How will the iteration be randomly picked?\n  Design space de l'Erwin (design non d\u00e9finitif)\n[fr] Toute participation \u00e0 la campagne, m\u00eame pour 1\u20ac, aura une influence sur la forme finale du caract\u00e8re. Le principe est le suivant : nous d\u00e9marrerons en pla\u00e7ant notre curseur au centre du design space ; chaque contribution au projet entra\u00eenera ensuite la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'un v\u00e9ritable nombre al\u00e9atoire via un ordinateur quantique, faisant se d\u00e9placer notre curseur dans une direction. C'est ainsi que sera d\u00e9gag\u00e9e d'une infinit\u00e9 de possibles, une instance unique.\n[en] Every participation to the campain, even with 1\u20ac, will influence the final shape of the typeface. Here's how it's gonna go: we'll start by placing a cursor at the center of our design space; every contribution will generate of a true random number via a quantum computer, making our cursor move in one direction. This system will build a path, chosing a unique instance from infinite possibilities.\nPourquoi le dessin de l\u2019Erwin est-il aussi bizarre ?\n\u2014 Why are Erwin's shapes so weird?\nProcessus de selection des signes\n[fr] La m\u00e9thode de construction des quatre masters de l'Erwin utilise d\u00e9j\u00e0 en elle-m\u00eame un part de hasard. Chaque lettre est selectionn\u00e9e parmi quelques dizaines de milliers de signes compos\u00e9s de troits traits de trois points et g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement pour l'occasion. Chacun de ces signes est ensuite retravaill\u00e9 et r\u00e9oragnis\u00e9 par nos soins. Nous ne cherchons pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des lettres totalement hasardeuses mais \u00e0 nous laisser surprendre par des formes nouvelles et \u00e0 pouvoir investir des dessins lib\u00e9r\u00e9s de certains aprioris. Il en r\u00e9sulte des structures \u00e9tranges mais n\u00e9amoins suffisamment lisibles pour un caract\u00e8re de titrage.\n[en] The design of Erwin's four masters already uses some sort of randomess. Each letter is selected from dozen of thousands symbols, all with the same amount of lines and nodes. Each of these selected symbols is then reworked and rearranged. We are not trying to create totally random letters, we just want to be surprised with new forms, freed from aprioris. Certainly strange, the results stay legible as a display font.\nProjection du sp\u00e9cimen (non d\u00e9finitif)\nMais si l'Erwin est libre, qu'est ce que je gagne alors ?\n\u2014 If Erwin is free, what's in it for me?\n[fr] Ce projet ne se limite pas \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation typographique, nous produirons \u00e9galement un sp\u00e9cimen imprim\u00e9 qui ne sera pas une simple d\u00e9monstration du caract\u00e8re.

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

She has been writing for Alarums & Excursions since 1991, and has written material for Unknown Armies and reviews for The Familiar, The Unspeakable Oath, and RPG.net. She has edited and proofread games and scenarios from Arc Dream Publishing, Golden Goblin Press, Modiphius Entertainment, Parenthesis Press, and Rogue Games.

F\u00fcr unsere \u00dcbersetzung wurde die norwegische Originalausgabe verwendet und mit der englischsprachigen Version abgeglichen.\nIn Itras By geben wir euch zwei Dinge mit auf den Weg: Zum einen zeigen wir euch einen Ort, an dem die Unwirklichkeit hinter jeder Stra\u00dfenecke lauert. Wir sind selbst schon in diesen Stra\u00dfen herumgewandert, aber wir wollen euch nicht mitnehmen in unsere Stadt. Ihr sollt nicht auf unsere Reise gehen, sondern euren eigenen Weg durch die Stadt finden. Deswegen geben wir euch auch Hilfen zum Rollenspiel an die Hand: Tipps und Tricks, die ihr brauchen k\u00f6nnt, um die Stadt zum Leben zu erwecken und die Hauptrollen zu \u00fcbernehmen. \nIm Verlauf dieser Kickstarter-Kampagne werden wir euch das Spiel n\u00e4her vorstellen. In den Updates erwarten Euch mehr Informationen zum Surrealismus, den Stadtteilen und den Spielkarten - hinzu kommen Lektionen und Ausz\u00fcge aus dem Buch, Kampagnenideen und noch einiges mehr. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich versuchen wir auch, eure Fragen zu beantworten und n\u00e4her auf eure Wunschthemen einzugehen.\nItras By wird voraussichtlich 304 Seiten haben. Im Buch befindet sich eine ausgiebige Beschreibung von Itras Stadt, die kompletten Spielregeln sowie das Einsteiger-Abenteuer \u201eNr.13\u201c. Die leichten Spielregeln machen dabei nur einen kleinen Teil des Buches aus: den gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil nehmen die Beschreibungen, Ideen und Tipps und Tricks ein. \nBegleitet wird das Buch von einem Set Entscheidungs- und Zufallskarten, welches zum Spielen ben\u00f6tigt wird. Als Produkt ist das Kartenset allerdings optional \u2013 die wichtigsten Karten werden im Anhang des Buches zum Kopieren bzw. als freies PDF zum Selbstausdrucken bereitgestellt. \n F\u00fcr die Sammler unter Euch wird das Buch wird auch als streng limitiertes Hardcover erh\u00e4ltlich sein - handnummeriert und in schwarzem Kunstleder gebunden.\nDie \u00dcbersetzungen des Originalmaterials, Layout und Illustration sind weitestgehend abgeschlossen. Mittels einer Crowdfunding-Finanzierung ist es uns aber erst m\u00f6glich, dieses Rollenspiel auf den deutschen Markt zu bringen. Dazu w\u00fcrden wir gerne eine kleine Auflage dieses Spiels drucken lassen, ohne auf Print-on-Demand-Dienste zur\u00fcckgreifen zu m\u00fcssen. Diese Kickstarter-Kampagne soll uns dabei helfen. Gleichzeitig erm\u00f6glicht uns die Kampagne, abzusch\u00e4tzen, ob in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt Interesse an Itras By besteht - und wenn ja, wie gro\u00df dieses ist.\nAlle Stretchgoals beziehen sich auf die Qualit\u00e4t oder den Umfang des Regelwerks oder des Kartensets.\nEinzelne B\u00fccher und Kartendecks k\u00f6nnen auch zus\u00e4tzlich zur ausgew\u00e4hlten Belohnung hinzugenommen werden - das gilt auch f\u00fcr das PDF. Dazu m\u00fcsst ihr einfach die unten genannten Preise der jeweiligen Produkte beim Bezahlen manuell hinzuf\u00fcgen - wir fragen nach Abschluss der Kampagne ab, welche ihr gew\u00e4hlt habt. \nFalls ihr also aus irgendeinem Grund (z.B. als Geschenk)  das Buch, das PDF oder das Kartendeck mehrfach haben wollt, d\u00fcrfte es sich lohnen, hier zuzugreifen. \nPDF \u2013 10\u20ac\nKartendeck \u2013 10 \u20ac\nRegelwerk \u2013 30 \u20ac\nDu verkaufst Rollenspiele und m\u00f6chtest an diesem Kickstarter teilnehmen, damit Itras By in den deutschen Handel kommt? Das w\u00fcrde uns freuen! Schreib uns einfach eine E-Mail, und wir kl\u00e4ren dann alles weitere: info@pro-indie.com.\nDer Versand aller Produkte ist f\u00fcr Unterst\u00fctzer in Deutschland in den Kosten der jeweiligen Belohung enthalten \u2013 ihr m\u00fcsst also kein Extraporto zahlen. Anders sieht die Lage f\u00fcr Unterst\u00fctzer aus anderen EU-L\u00e4ndern sowie aus dem \u00fcbrigen Ausland aus: EU-Einwohner m\u00fcssen ihrem Beitrag weitere 10 Euro hinzuf\u00fcgen. Unterst\u00fctzer aus anderen Staaten (inklusive der Schweiz) m\u00fcssen ihrem Beitrag hingegen 20 Euro hinzuf\u00fcgen.\nDie Zustellung der PDFs erfolgt \u00fcber DriveThruRPG, ohne weitere Kosten.

When it was released over twenty-five years ago, it influenced a generation of game designers and spawned countless campaigns on Al Amarja.\nToday, we\u2019re bringing Over the Edge back with a new vision, new era, and new stories. We want you to be a part of that effort.\nReturn to the island you only think you remember.\nDesign not final\nWHAT IS AL AMARJA?\nThe setting of Over the Edge is a fictional, modern-day island in the Atlantic Ocean that\u2019s home to the weirdest city in the world, the Edge. All sorts of conspiracies, paranormal entities, mad scientists, secret agents, and more lurk here. It\u2019s the front line for the Last War, a conflict that rages unseen and unknown to most of its inhabitants. You remember Al Amarja, but not like this.\nWHO AM I WHEN I\u2019M HERE?\nWe believe you're going to be more invested in a unique character you create yourself. Over the Edge helps you draw on modern pop culture and paranormal traditions to craft these exciting characters.\nWe also believe it\u2019s fun to get into trouble, and so characters in Over the Edge are defined not only by their distinguishing traits, but by the ways they leap from the rails and subvert expectations. They question their own core truths, and everyone gets to see what happens next.\nFor example, you might play\u2026 \na jet-setting grifter in Al Amarja to pull off the greatest caper in modern history.\na psychic super-child in pursuit of the remnants of a shadow government.\na reincarnation of an Atlantean Priest of Excess ready to indulge in the island\u2019s forbidden tastes.\nCharacters are the best part of Over the Edge because\u2026\nThe modern-day setting makes it easy to create characters that are relatable and that have depth.\nThe paranormal-friendly setting makes it easy to use your imagination to create a unique role.\nWithout even knowing the rules or the setting, you create your alter ego from scratch using concepts and words, not numbers, lists, or templates.\nWHAT\u2019S FAMILIAR AND WHAT\u2019S ALL-NEW?\nIf you\u2019ve played Over the Edge before, you might wonder what\u2019s different this time around. We know you like touchstones and something to connect to, but you also want to feel as if there\u2019s a reason to pick this edition up.\nThe major conspiracies and characters of the previous editions are still here, but they\u2019ve all been reimagined and rewritten. The new game is inspired by the original material but not limited by or derivative of it.\nA few re-imagined concepts include\u2026\nThe police are still corrupt, but now, instead of being paramilitary officers with grease guns, the rank-and-file cops are schlubs with only their legal standing going for them.\nOne district is still patrolled by thugs with baboons, only now the baboons also roam on their own begging for food and sniffing out troublemakers.\nThe poorest neighborhood is still the turf of Lucifer\u2019s Glorious Lords of Passion, a ruthless gang of metal heads, but now the gang is also a bona fide heavy metal band, and they use their music to solidify their hold on the district.\nFREEFORM, STORY-FORWARD RULES  \nWe believe the island of Al Amarja is best experienced through light, free-wheeling mechanics.\nOver the Edge uses a simple, easy-to-understand game mechanic called \u201ccasting lots.\u201d You throw two six-sided dice to resolve any decision, choice point, or challenge. This generates both a succeed-or-fail result as well as the possibility for a special result: good, bad, or both.\nA single casting of lots can generate the results for\u2026\nA week of surveilling a shady target.\nAn evening burgling a house for loot and information.\nA moment of deadly struggle in a big climactic fight.\nDive deep into the action or pull back and resolve only the key choice points of any situation. Over the Edge lets you determine the scope and stakes of any casting of lots and provides tools to tailor any scenario to the expertise of the player characters.\nWe believe in gorgeous, evocative books. This Kickstarter features a single rulebook written by original Over the Edge designer Jonathan Tweet. It also features assistance from writer Chris Lites, development by Cam Banks, graphic design by Thomas Deeny, art direction by James Mosingo, and editing by Jaym Gates.\nThis new edition is also inspired by 25 years of other game designers\u2019 work, including Robin Laws, Ron Edwards, Luke Crane, Vincent Baker, John Harper, and Jason Morningstar. Many designers say that the original Over the Edge inspired them to design roleplaying games in a new way. We embrace that creative feedback loop by re-incorporating some of their amazing innovations here.\nA developer draft of the manuscript for the rulebook is available to all backers. The link is in the first update.\nThe rulebook includes\u2026\nHigh-quality production values throughout.\nStylish graphic design and layout, emphasizing readability and utility on every page.\nHelpful GM and player advice alongside setting material.\nThe rulebook comes in three formats\u2026\nThe tablet-ready Core Digital edition.\nThe full-color, hardback Core Print edition.\nThe high-quality, Kickstarter-exclusive Core Luxe edition.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR DIGITAL NOMADS\nCore Digital is the complete 264-page core rulebook in PDF, Epub, and Kindle formats, easily accessed at your table or for online play, tablet-optimized and hyperlinked.\n$20 OTE Core Digital: Just the files, please.\n$45 OTE Digital Retro: Includes the Retro Pack, PDFs of the previous edition\u2019s books and supplements.\n$55 OTE Digital Retro with Pips: Includes the Retro Pack plus a set of ten six-sided dice in five colors.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR PRINT PIONEERS\nCore Print is our full-color, 264-page hardback rulebook.

In German. However, you can read the somewhat amusing Google translation of it here.\nKilling Lee Garvin? Huh?\nKilling Lee Garvin (KLG for short) is a game with a mission. To make fun of the improbable yet inevitable mortality of game designer Lee Garvin (Tales from the Floating Vagabond, Badass Zombie Killers, etc.), which hopefully is quite a few years off. And also because on his way there he has racked up a lot of medical bills that he feels honor-bound to pay while simultaneously faced with the problem of doing so on what you can make as an indie game designer. And the minor distraction of being evicted and living in his car for the past several months. So, with the assistance of cartoonist Ron Leishman (co-creator of Captain Canuck), I'm trying to help Lee out a bit.\nGreg: Being a board/card/rpg game designer is creatively wonderful, but sucks in a lot of other respects. Publishing is already a low-income zone with no job security and negligible benefits, and game design is a ghetto within that zone.\nAnd if you are an independent game designer, it can be even tougher. Lee Garvin is a friend and like me, an indie, but unlike me, life has not been kind to him. In the sense that \"being in an accident, going into a coma and waking up medically bankrupt\" is \"not been kind\".\nAmong other things. Lee has endured a laundry list of improbable bad luck events that would make a good script for a slapstick version of Final Destination.\nBecause I'm a game designer, I see everything as having game potential, so I humorously told Lee I should make a game about killing him off. And the more I thought about it, the more it actually started to make sense...\nAnd so, Killing Lee Garvin was born... At the time I started work on this, Lee still had a roof over his head and the project was meant to just help with his medical bills, but as his life circumstances took a more...outdoors turn, the focus has turned to helping him first get that roof (any roof) back, so that he can try to do all the things those of us with roofs take for granted.\nLee: I wasn't entirely sure Greg was serious about doing this at first, but I should have guessed; he made a game about stalking slasher victims (which I have played quite a bit). And for the record, It wasn't an accident that put me into the coma; it was the doctors who were trying to get me to breathe after I got pneumonia. The accident was a different time.\nBut to give an example of where the cards are coming from, long ago, in an age known as \"The '80s\", I was a Boy Scout (Go Troop 35!). While at one of our troop cookouts, the guys were spread out all over the grounds of the church that served as the host for most of our events. Being Scouts, we were naturally very curious about nature. Being Boys, we were reckless and quite foolish in our endeavors. Being the '80s, safety had not yet been invented. Some of my fellow scouts were expressing their curiosity towards nature by whacking a wasps' nest in a tree with a long stick. I was walking from around the other side of the building at the time, so naturally, I turned the corner just as they knocked the nest out of the tree, and it hit the ground, and all the wasps in the world flew into my open mouth. I really, really wish I could say that was the worst pain I have ever experienced.\nIf one accepts the \"many worlds\" theory of alternate realities, I died in 437 of them. But this being the 1980s, and my father being from Texas, as long as the kid could breathe and no bones were visible, he saw no reason to get medical professionals involved.  \nBut I did get ice cream.\nLife-threatening calamities and ice cream. The Lee Garvin story...\nGoals?\nGreg: KLG has a few simple goals. Be a good, hilarious game. Help out Lee. The latter part is simple. After the production costs are taken into account, Lee gets half. And this is not Hollywood accounting. Lee gets most of his projected cut as fast as I can cut the check after the Kickstarter ends. And if it is funded with time to spare, I'll write as much as I can out of my own account, just to give him a head start. And the more people we get on board, the lower the production cost is per game. So, the more people that want to kill Lee, the better off he ends up. I'm not exactly sure how the karma math works on that one, however...\nLee: One thing I want to make crystal clear is that, yes, I am in a bad way (hell, I'm sleeping in my car right now), but I am not alone, and there are others who have it worse than me. So yes, I will be using some of the money from this project to dig myself out of the hole I'm in, but a full 50% of it, I intend to donate to the Jack Vasel Memorial Fund. This is an organization that has already helped me quite a bit, so I just want to return the favor. They exist to do nothing but help Gaming Professionals who have hit hard times.\nAbout the game\nKLG is a simple 3-6 player game that hides a significant amount of strategy and backstabbing. There are two ways to win. First, you can \"heal\" Lee and you win. Second, you can manipulate someone else into killing Lee and if you have the best game position at that time, you win. So, you can be a good guy and save him, or a bastard who engineers and then takes advantage of his untimely demise...\nIt's a single-deck game, with 54 cards and a bunch of tokens in three colors for representing Lee's health. Cards are simple. They have a number, a color and a type (Harm or Help). Every round you choose from a selection of face-up cards to add to your hand, play cards secretly and reveal them. Harm cards give Health tokens to other players, Help cards put tokens back in the common pool. If you get too many tokens of a particular color, Lee becomes an ex-game designer and it will all be your fault. You are a bad person and Lee's ghost will haunt you. Even if it was another player who gave you the tokens that made you lose. It's pretty easy to end the game by bringing about Lee's untimely demise, but to win you also have to have the best board position when that happens. Not so easy. So you may have to work very hard to keep him healthy...right up to the moment where you push him in front of a bus.\nBut you can also make deals involving the cards. And break them. You do not know exactly what other players are holding, but you do know who has what tokens and what will trigger the end of the game. So, the deals you make and the order in which they resolve is an important part of each round. So, cards are revealed and the round leader (player 1) says \u201cHey player 4, I won't hit you with the Squirrels if you don't Mug me\u201d, and player 4 says \u201cSure thing!\u201d Of course, since player 1 does their action first, player 4 does not have to abide by the deal, but they will. This time. \nAnd whoever is the current round leader has to narrate Lee's life events using the revealed cards for that round. So player 1 looks at the cards and says: \n\"Lee compensated for the stresses of GenCon with a regular cardio workout. But while jogging in the park one morning he was mugged and beaten. And then the squirrels found him...\u201d\nKLG gameplay video\nPLAY\n\nA game of KLG takes ten to thirty minutes to play, and strategy really depends on who you are playing with. People who are trying to win by healing Lee will have a different strategy than those trying to bring about his premature end, and how you play depends on how many of each type of player are in your game. But you are simultaneously playing against the table (the state of tokens and their distribution) and against the other players (what are they trying to do, and to whom?). \nStretch Goals \n$15,000: The basic game\nNot really a stretch goal. This covers the production, art, the Kickstarter cut and enough room to get Lee some money. The base funding level is not low-balling it in expectation we will blow through it. It is a realistic number so that if we reach, Lee gets some help. Given the fixed costs like art (most of the cards are custom caricatures of Lee), this is the minimum level to make the game happen.\n$20,000: Custom meeple\nThe \"first player\" meeple in KLG denotes who gets first pick of cards and deal-making opportunities each round. If we get $20,000 in pledges, we will have a custom meeple made that is an embarrassing caricature of Lee Garvin. My personal preference would be him looking like an out-of-shape Bane (admit it, he's meeple-shaped), but if we reach this goal, Lee will be browbeaten into supplying some pictures and people can vote on their favorite in the comments section.\n$35,000: Quality upgrade \nThe base level of the project turns a profit, but is a short run game and much of the cost is the artwork and the higher cost per game for short run printing. The $35,000 level is the minimum for getting a large print run from China. The lower cost per unit means we can upgrade the quality of everything. Cards, box, tray liner, rules, the works.\nIt's a big jump from $15,000 to $35,000, but depending on the printer I'm pretty sure we will be able to get a useful \"printed in China\" price for some level of pledges north of $15k but less than $35k. We are going to provide the best quality available for whatever level of pledges we do get, but this stretch goal guarantees we can go for the best. You're spending $25 on the game, we want it to look and feel like a good value for the money (in addition to repeat play value for the money).\n$50,000: Organ tokens. Instead of the normal colored bits that are the health tokens, we will spring for the cost of custom blue brain, green lung and red heart tokens to represent Lee's health.\nLaser-guided Chainsaw Add-on!\nOne of Lee's game designs is a cheesy little non-collectable card game called Badass Zombie Killers (or BZK), where the game is about preparing for the zombie apocalypse, having the coolest and most vicious gear, and the game ends when the zombies actually show up. You can download an image of the rules cards from this link.\nNow, unlike Lee who is living in his car in Colorado, the irony is that the remaining stock of BZK actually has a roof over its head in Virginia, close enough to where I am to go get them. So, if you've every wanted a copy of BZK and saw that it is out of stock on Amazon and ThinkGeek, this is your way to get one. So, with the cooperation of Reality Cheque and Skortch'd Urf, this game of prepper one-upmanship can now be yours! Just add $17 to your (US-only) pledge for KLG and we will ship them both at the same time. The $17 covers the BZK and the extra cost for shipping, since we will have to go from a First Class 12oz box to a flat rate Priority Mail box.\nHobo Capitalism Add-On!\nMatt Vancil suggested something to Lee after the \"hobo knife\" picture was posted in Update #23, and the following is entirely Lee's doing. I claim no credit for it. There is now a \"Hobo Capitalism\" add-on in this campaign. For US$10, a US backer will get an official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 (as seen in Update #23), an autographed picture of Lee holding a knife that is probably not yours (much nicer than the picture below but no guarantee he will look any more sane), and in a hat-tip to Munchkin, a special rule for Badass Zombie Killers that can only be utilized by the rightful owner of said knife. This add-on price includes postage in the US. So, you can add this to any game pledge and it will be sent to you directly from Lee's high-tech manufacturing facility, which will probably be the front seat of his 2008 Saturn.\nThe official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 has a number of unique features*. It can be smuggled through metal detectors! Each one is hand-crafted by Lee himself and will have its own unique character. It has trace amounts of Lee's DNA in case you need to leave it at a crime scene to confuse the forensic team. And in an emergency it can be disassembled to give you several feet of duct tape.\n*Due to variances in the manufacturing process, the ability of the Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 to cut anything tougher than a McDonalds pancake is not guaranteed. This product not endorsed by the SHA (Stabby Hobo Association).\nAnd here, for the second time anywhere! The tentative official Badass Zombie Killers Hobo Knife\u2122 Rule \nIf you have an authentic Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 in your possession, you may do the following once per game. Discard 4 Badassery worth of Weapon cards or Modifier cards from your hand (that is, the total Badassery value or bonus of the cards must add up to at least positive 4) into the Dumpster. Whip out your Hobo Knife\u2122 and Shank one opponent's character.  \nTo Shank, you must choose one of that character's special abilities, and place the blade of the Hobo Knife\u2122 so that it covers it completely. That ability is not available for use for as long as the blade remains lodged in the character (until dislodged by a special effect). At the end of the game, the Hobo Knife\u2122 is returned to its owner. Don't make them come over there.\nShipping\nGames will be shipped in the US by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on whether they top 12 ounces with the stretch goals), and tracking numbers will be available.  \nSame as USA, just a little more expensive. \nEU-bound games will ship from the EU to avoid Customs charges and will go via regular mail within the EU.  \nAustralia-bound games will depend on the level of funding. At the low end they will be shipped via an intermediary service, while if we get into stretch goal territory we can probably use a normal fulfillment center. \nIf you are backing this project from Mars, we will arrange to have your package put on the next available manned flight (losing the entire shipment we shoehorned into the Schiaparelli lander soured us on automated interplanetary delivery options).

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter (third if you count collaborations), and the fourth that Lee has started or been a collaborator on, so while we are not \"veterans\", we have some experience with the process. But this one has the potential to be significantly bigger than previous ones. The project goal is modest and will turn a profit that can go to help Lee, but if it exceeds its goals by a lot, then the scaling goes from \"domestic short run printing\" to \"seafreight container from China\", and from \"local pack & ship\" to \"hire a fullfillment service\". The numbers have been run for both cases and work out, and give sufficient wiggle room for stretch goals. However, I do want to avoid \"stretch goal creep\", since I've seen over-promising on other projects, and overly ambitious stretch goals also cause significant production delays.\n\nFortunately, I have a friend in the gaming industry (Mark Walker of Flying Pig Games (look his projects up)) who is both local and has significant experience with Chinese printers and domestic and international fulfillment operations. So in the unlikely event this explodes like kittens, I'm sure there will be headaches, but the headaches will be manageable. And if worst comes to worst, I can always blame it on Lee... (Lee: Hey!)\n\nThe timeframe from \"end of Kickstarter\" to \"game in your hands\" is going to vary based on how successful it is. The moment the minimum threshold is reached, the art will be contracted and the artist is ready to go on it. If it reaches a \"China production\" threshold, we have several possible suppliers and will have to choose one, and if we hit the top tier for custom game pieces, this will probably add a little to the production time as well. Of course, if we hit these thresholds with time to spare it means we can get them underway even before the campaign ends. One thing that will be a delay at the high end is that seafreight will take about a month, compared to domestic short-run printing that would take a few weeks from printing to delivery. My best guess at this point is \"on time or sooner\" for a barely funded campaign to \"a month or two late\" for one with all the stretch goals, but the benefit of the latter is a much nicer looking product (and more money going towards Lee's medical bills). The listed delivery date is an intermediate value, and if you have funded other campaigns you know how that goes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nice guy", "descp": "You just want to help out, because you're a nice guy.

Grimtooth the Troll here. You sorry souls have been dying from my traps for decades. And in all that time, not one of you miniscule mortals has attacked me in my lair! Well, I\u2019ve decided to take pity on you. For the first time ever, I\u2019m going to show you my realm. You\u2019ll finally get to see \u2013 Trapsylvania!\nThis Kickstarter supports the publication of Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania, a 144-page campaign setting and sourcebook! It will be available in print (softcover or hardcover) and electronic (PDF) format. It is fully illustrated, with color cover and B/W interior art. The publisher is Goodman Games, under license from Flying Buffalo. The book is written in a systems-neutral style like all Grimtooth books, with DCC RPG stats compiled in an appendix at the back.\nGrimtooth's Lair\nThis Kickstarter also offers a rare collectible treasure: the \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" Flying Buffalo published a total of 7 Grimtooth books. At the Origins Game Convention in 1983, an independent publisher released their own unauthorized bootleg adventure called Grimtooth's Lair. Today, only a single copy of this adventure is known to exist. Thanks to collector Bill Meinhardt, we have been able to scan the adventure for publication. It is being offered as an add-on for this Kickstarter (see below).\nThe only known copy of Grimtooth's Lair - now available as a reprint exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nAt last \u2013 the legendary locations of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps revealed!\nFor over 30 years, Grimtooth\u2019s numerous Traps books have horrified players and inspired game masters with hundreds of dangerous devices, deadly deathtraps and hilarious hijinx! Now Grimtooth (with a little help from kid sister Grimtina) will take you on a personally guided tour of his realm and the central hub of his vast Traps empire.\nRun your own Grimtooth campaign, or pick and choose locations you can use in your own adventures. Explore Grimtooth\u2019s caverns, visit his Inner Sanctum, escape the Deathmaze Testing Center, attend Warthog\u2019s School for Trolls, take a ride on Grimtooth\u2019s Airship, tour Grimtina\u2019s Petting Zoo or get lost in many more gigantic places of doom, like the Infinite Corridor of Hallways. Each of these infamous locations includes maps, descriptions, non-player character details, scenarios, and lots of art. Plus there are more traps (of course) and plenty of things with which to endanger your characters.  \nLike all Grimtooth books, Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania is written in a systems-neutral format, and published in a way that it is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). A series of appendices at the back provide quick and easy stats for DCC RPG games, covering all the creatures, characters and items described in the book. It\u2019s very easy to fill a graveyard with the corpses of your DCC player characters! (Because once you enter Trapsylvania \u2013 you won\u2019t leave! Suckers.)  \nTrapsylvania is written and illustrated by S. S. Crompton, the legendary \u201cvoice of Grimtooth\u201d who has been working on Grimtooth products for Flying Buffalo for more than 30 years. We\u2019ve rounded up the entire roster of historical Grimtooth contributors to illustrate the book, so you\u2019ll find art not just by S. S. Crompton, but also by Liz Danforth, Micheal Von Glahn, Scott Jackson Phil Longmeier, and Jeff Dee \u2013 all the artists who have contributed to Grimtooth products over the years! The new traps are written by Grimtooth alumni S. S. Crompton, Ken St. Andre, Bear Peters, Rick Loomis, Paul O'Connor and Debora Kerr. The DCC stats are provided by Terry Olson, with editing by Jen Brinkman.\nTrapsylvania is chock full of useful gaming material! How much is there? Well, here's the exact count!\n1 whole country! (Grimtooth's, that is!)\n15 large locations, all described and mapped\n48 scenario ideas\n60 traps or trapped items\n86 creatures (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n26 NPCs (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n23 items (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\nAnd loads of laughs!\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps?\nOriginally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. Flying Buffalo published seven Grimtooth\u2019s books, all of them usable with any RPG. In 2015, Goodman Games compiled all of these into a massive hardcover compilation, and also published two additional DCC-compatible Grimtooth adventures. Grimtooth remains an eternally relevant character and his popularity has only grown since then.\nThe hallmarks of Grimtooth-style traps are wacky humor combined with deadly danger, plus, of course, extremely useful material that can be integrated into any dungeon-crawling RPG!\nWhat\u2019s in the book?\nEverything you need to run a game in Trapsylvania! Whether a single session or an extended campaign, you can give your players a fun time. Here is a preview of the Table of Contents:\nWhat's the Status of the Book?\nTrapsylvania is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. We are in final proofreading stages at the time of the Kickstarter.

We have 50 copies that will also include a piece of original art by Steve Crompton. The remainder do not include that original art.\nShipping costs are as follows.

You can add on additional funds to include these items. All add-on items count toward achieving stretch goals, and those published by Goodman Games are in print+PDF format!\nTo add on an item, simply increase your pledge amount to cover the cost.

More than 500 traps in a systems-neutral format, suitable for any fantasy RPG.

(And treasonous, but you never read that.)\nPlayers will find rules for playing bots and elderly Troubleshooters, advice for committing treason and not getting caught, fun prescription drugs, and bingo cards for diagnosing teammates with entirely treatable disorders. No medical knowledge necessary!\nGMs will find locations to drop into missions, guides to the Underplex and the Outside, articles and tables to help up your Paranoia game, and three shiny new missions to really rack up the body count.\nYou will also see new cards, from Bestiary cards like the Feral Tree to R&D gear such as Hygiene Grenades \u2014 but only if you back this project before June 24th.\nImagine the sheer joy and devilish glee you\u2019ll feel upgrading your Paranoia RPG experience with this new set! Imagine the jealousy and dirty looks from others who did not back this project! \nParanoia is now more better. Other games are not more better. Back Acute Paranoia.\nWhat is Paranoia?\nParanoia is a darkly humorous roleplaying game full of mutants, secret societies, backstabbing, lasers, repeated death and a well-meaning but thoroughly insane ruler known as the Computer. Unlike other RPGs that take themselves rather seriously, Paranoia is all about having fun in a science fiction dystopia by encouraging skullduggery, betrayal, bootlicking and generally naughty behaviours.\nAt cons, you can tell where the Paranoia game is by following the laughter. This is your chance to make your Paranoia games even more hilarious (and deadly) with the Acute Paranoia box set. Be the envy of your neighbours, friends and random strangers!\nWhy Acute Paranoia?\nAfter the success of the Paranoia core box set, players have been asking for more ways to backstab, fight terrorism and cause terrorism in Alpha Complex. \nOur design goal was simple: Create a box full of cool things to do in Paranoia. We focused on what helps players and GMs take down their enemies so they can climb a mountain of skulls and smoking boots to proclaim themselves the One True Paranoia Gamer. In other, less scary words, everything was filtered through \u2018How can people use this for more fun?\u2019\nThe design team is lead by WJ MacGuffin, a game designer who worked on the Unknown Armies 3rd edition Kickstarter as well as the XP edition of Paranoia. Starting with the 2nd edition rules back in 1987, WJ played and ran more games of Paranoia than is healthy. \nThe team includes two other veterans of the XP edition days (Dan Curtis Johnson and Greg Ingber) as well as two designers new to Paranoia (Amanda Cherry and Ed Turner) for fresh ideas and blame if jokes fall flat. With invaluable guidance and imperious demands from Gareth Hanrahan and Ken Rolston (one of the Paranoia 2nd edition designers), the team has created rules, missions and more that fits Paranoia\u2019s unique themes and mood. Hunting down traitors, would-be-traitors and what-the-hell-they-might-as-well-be traitors-because-my-gun-still-has-ammo has never been this fulfilling!\nAcute Paranoia Contents\nAnd you thought your Paranoia games were already dangerously fun .... As with the core box set, Acute Paranoia is printed in high quality full colour. In the box set, you will receive:\nThe Troubleshooter Survival Handbook features healthcare plans, perfectly legal pharmaceuticals, disorder bingo cards, articles on getting away with treason and invaluable lessons from Teela-O. You also get rules for playing bots! (\u201cBzzzt bing sorry Troubleshooter but this arm needs to be removed beep!\u201d)\nThe Gamesmasters Despotic Power Book offers locations to \u2018drag and drop\u2019 into any mission, information on the Underplex and the Outside, articles on helping players get into the Paranoia spirit (aka backstabbing) and bot secret societies. You also get tables for randomly picking interesting (and likely deadly) bots, traitors and shops!\nMission Book 2.0 includes three brand-new missions featuring the Outside and the Underplex. How will your Troubleshooters handle a mysterious black rectangle, a missing Armed Forces regiment and a patch to the Computer itself?\nNew cards! Besides more Action and Equipment cards, you\u2019ll get cards for Bots, Relics from Before, completely safe R&D gear and those things that are like bots but not metal ... what\u2019s the term ... oh, right. Beasts.\nWipe-clean Bot Identity Forms, which are way better than the ones squishy clones get because you are made of metal.\nWipe-clean Disorder Bingo Cards to make sure your teammates don\u2019t have any issues that could degrade mission performance.\nRemember, you can download the complete Troubleshooter Survival Handbook right HERE to have a look at the kind of things we are putting into this box set!\nPledge Levels\nUnder CPU Mandate 883.03/b, this campaign\u2019s pledge levels have been simplified and clarified to make your loyal backing experience that much more enjoyable.

We have a Big List of Things To Do Differently with this Kickstarter campaign!\n\nIt has been some time since the last Paranoia Kickstarter and, between then and now, we have run two very efficient Traveller Kickstarters. We have developed a new system for Kickstarters, and it works:\n\n* We have a new team of writers for Paranoia, new faces and familiar. They are delivering what they say they will deliver, when they say they will deliver.\n\n* Most of the box set will be complete before the Kickstarter begins.\n\nAh ha, you say, but was that not said for the last Paranoia box set? The difference here is that, knowing this was a big issue last time, we will showcase sections of the box set right at the start of the Kickstarter. You can freely download the Troubleshooters Survival Handbook right now - subject to tweaks and additions made during the Kickstarter process - so you will be able to see how much work has already been done.\n\nBy creating so much content beforehand, the risk is lower and backers will receive their rewards that much faster. In addition, lead designer WJ MacGuffin will be monitoring this project and answering your questions/concerns as quickly as his tired, slow brain can handle.

A thousand years before the rise of Lerotra\u2019hh, the Sketthor-Ka had their own empire, ruled by sorcerer kings who fell into dark practices that turned them into vampire lords. That empire fell when the great wizards of Trollworld banded together to stop the vampiric plague spreading out from the city of K\u2019horror. \nPart of the map of the underground Vaults...\nBut the ancient vampire lords were not completely destroyed. They retreated underground to hidden tombs and vaults, leaving their surviving subjects to exist as best they could in the ruins above. Now the undead threat is rising again.  \nIllustration of a wraith by Simon Tranter\nAdventurers have learned of the ancient tombs and undead sanctuaries. The bravest of them are searching and digging into forgotten crypts and subterranean palaces in search of magic and treasure, unwittingly releasing ancient terrors that had slumbered for a millennium. Enterprising skeleton men like your guide, Slimius, now lead adventurers to the entrances of such tombs, barred from entering themselves, but perfectly willing to share the treasure with those who can face the undead terrors in the Vaults of K\u2019horror. Are you up to the challenge of robbing vampires in their own lairs?\nWhat horrors await you in the Vaults?\nVaults of K\u2019Horror is a full-size 40+ page gamemaster adventure complete with maps, characters and background material for Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls. All the main art, text maps and graphics for this book are completed and ready to go to press. We are adding some stretch goals, which includes a Vaults of K'Horror based 19 page solo adventure, customized mini-rules, a collection of NPCs submitted by backers, and a backers honor list, but other than that, we are ready to send this project to the printers, so the wait time for you getting this new book is going to be minimal.\n\nThis GM adventure is written by Long-time UK T&T creator Andy Holmes with art by Simon Tranter & Steven Crompton. T&T Creator Ken St Andre has edited the adventure and assured the dT&T stats and numbers. The book is being published by Flying Buffalo inc.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n STRETCH GOAL #1 - K'Horror T&T solo by Ken St Andre At this level we will add a brand new 19 page solo adventure by Ken St Andre. This solo is directly connected to the Vault of K'horror gm adventure and was written especially for this book. This will be added at no extra charge to all backers that pledge for a copy of any version of Vaults Of K'Horror when we reach the stretch goal. We'll announce the goal level as this Kickstarter progresses. (Note; the art and layout is completed and no additional time is needed to add this solo should we reach this stretch goal.)\n STRETCH GOAL #2 - Customized Mini-RulesFor goal #2 we will add a 13 page version of the T&T Mini-rules that has been specially customized for Vaults of K'Horror with new art and weapons. When we reach this stretch goal the mini-rules will be added to the book at no extra charge to all backers that pledge for a copy of any version of Vaults Of K'Horror. We'll announce the goal level as this Kickstarter progresses. (Note; the art and layout is completed for these mini-rules and no additional time is needed to add them should we reach this goal.) \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - Wandering NPCs and Monsters\nWith goal #3 we will add a new chapter that lists and gives stats for additional NPCs and monsters that players might meet on their way to K'Horror or underground in the vaults of the vampire lords. Each character will be illustrated by either Steve Crompton or Simon Tranter.

We can mail via media mail to USA addresses, so I am not adding any postage to USA. Postage is built into the price. But we always get a lot of backers outside the USA, and for these I have put in a price of $15. I am almost certain it will cost more that than, possibly much more. When it is time to ship (outside the USA) I will find out exactly what the postage will cost me and if it is more than $15 I will send you a bill. If it is too much and you want to cancel instead, I will send you a refund, no hard feelings.\nADD ONS: \nOne flaw of kickstarter is that you cannot back the same project twice if there are two different rewards that you want.

Enlist today! \nThe tiny star system of Draconis stands alone against the mighty Dominion of Unity. They need your help! Join the brave pilots of Tachyon Squadron, a crack group of volunteer fighter pilots holding back the tide of tyranny! Pilot sleek starfighters in deadly clashes among the stars. Fight alongside your comrades to stop piracy, end lawlessness, and turn back the Dominion's fleets. Win glory for yourself and freedom for all!\nTachyon Squadron is an extensive Fate Core supplement with 184 pages full of interplanetary combat, space-faring scoundrels, and lots and lots of blasters.\nAre you already a backer? Go to this backers-only post and download the text-complete PDF of Tachyon Squadron right now!\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Tachyon Squadron through them? Encourage your FLGS to back this Kickstarter and get their copies early, along with all digital stretch goals.\nTachyon Squadron is a Fate Core supplement that blends space opera and military sci-fi. It's Evil Hat\u2019s take on popular stories about interstellar battles, like the ones that have ships with wings named after letters and the one where robots chase the human race through space. If you\u2019re interested in deep space dogfights, friendly\u2014well, usually\u2014rivalries with fellow pilots, and playing scrappy underdogs with the deck stacked against you, this game is for you.\nYou need a copy of Fate Core to play Tachyon Squadron. We've included a PDF of Fate Core with the PDF downloads to make sure all backers have everything they need to try out the game. If you'd like a physical copy of Fate Core, check out the Pilot Instructor pledge level!\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic. What new mechanics can I expect?\nA starfighter combat engagement system. Space battles in Fate!\nFighter pilot character creation, including pilot interactions and vices to blow off steam\nPersonal and gear stunts to account for all the sci-fi equipment you know and love\nSpaceships with detailed condition effects to keep your dogfighting tense and dangerous\nI'm new to Fate. Why would I want to play space battles in this system?\nFate as a system is focused on story, where both success and failure help to create interesting moments for players and characters. In Fate it's as much about the choices the pilots face and the story consequences of those choices, for good or ill, as it is about the tactical details of the fight. Do you fly to your comrade's rescue and jeopardize the mission? Or do you stay on target, accomplish your assignment, and hope your friend survives on their own? What are the consequences for your pilot's relationships? Fate helps generate drama by pushing play toward answering these questions.\nTachyon Squadron is finished and only awaiting a few tweaks! We have a text-complete PDF that you can download and start playing immediately upon pledging, and we'll be ready to print as soon as the Kickstarter is over. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that November is more than doable.\nWe haven\u2019t started production on the stretch goals, since we\u2019re not sure what will fund, and we may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in. Creator and secret space smuggler Clark Valentine has blocked out time in his schedule to work on them, but he\u2019s just one guy. So it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll release those to you as he finishes each one and we put it through the editing/layout/art wringer.\nThe Text-Only PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you get immediate access to the text-only PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs.\nThe Completed PDF: Backers at $12 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF at the conclusion of this Kickstarter.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $25 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, color interior book with 184 pages. Shipping by November 2018.\nSTRETCH GOAL 1 (UNLOCKED): Text Only Preview of Fate Space Toolkit: Scratch your sci-fi Fate itch with a sneak peek at the text of the Fate Space Toolkit, a mechanical marvel full of system elements and ideas you can drop into your Tachyon campaign, or hack to create your own deep space setting. This preview will be laid out, but pre-art.\nSTRETCH GOAL 2 (UNLOCKED): Those Who Were Here Before: When we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll begin work on a 5000 words electronic campaign. A wreck, obviously of nonhuman origin, drifts into the space lanes of Draconis, leading to the discovery of more alien ruins and wrecks. Every power in the galaxy\u2014both government and corporate\u2014wants control. Find out what happens in Those Who Were Here Before.\nSTRETCH GOAL 3 (UNLOCKED): Inside the Dominion of Unity: When we unlock this stretch goal, we'll begin work on a 10,000 word electronic supplement focusing on the Dominion of Unity. Step into the flight suit of a Dominion pilot! Fly Dominion ships! Stamp out the upstart Tachyon Squadron and bring order to your corner of the universe. This stretch will also include expanded rules for incorporating capital ships into your combat engagements.\nSTRETCH GOAL 4 (UNLOCKED): Top Gun: When we unlock this stretch goal, we'll start working on at 5,000 word electronic supplement about Draconis fighter pilots in training. It'll include rules for pilot/co-pilot pairs, rivalries between students, a scoring system for the top student prize, and maybe even a pilot NPC named after an aquatic bird. GOOSE!!!\nSTRETCH GOAL 5 (UNLOCKED): Printable Ship Tokens and Minis: At $18,500, we\u2019ll start acquiring art for a series of printable ship tokens and minis to use with your maneuver charts and maps. This stretch goal will include flat tokens and fold-and-stand minis in at least ten visually distinct ship types, each in six colors for easy reference.\nSTRETCH GOAL 6 (UNLOCKED): Spaceship Construction Toolkit: At $23,500, we\u2019ll start work on the Spaceship Construction Toolkit. This 10,000 word electronic supplement will give you all the tools you need to create your own starships. Add some variety to your fleet with this exciting toolkit.\nSTRETCH GOAL 7 (UNLOCKS AT $26,000): The Battle of Britain: At $26,000, we\u2019ll start work on The Battle of Britain, a 5,000 word electronic supplement that applies Tachyon Squadron\u2019s dogfighting rules to a WWII squadron of Spitfire pilots defending Britain. This supplement will include plane stats and mechanics to help you take to the skies with the Allied forces.\nSTRETCH GOAL 8 (UNLOCKS AT $31,000): The Lawless: At $31,000, we\u2019ll start work on The Lawless, a 10,000 word electronic supplement about the lawless areas of the galaxy. Here, space pirates ply their trade far beyond the reaches of the Dominion of Unity and the Stellar Republic. New locations, ships, and NPCs to help populate your campaigns!\nAttention, pilots!

We\u2019ve carefully calculated our funding goals to cover the printing of the book, and adding shipping to your pledge now will mess up that math. Also, this approach allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit\u2014the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll be billing shipping via BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager\u2014a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nHere\u2019s the sad part\u2014we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the US. Our shipping options outside of the US would cost more than the actual book in most cases, and we can\u2019t in good conscience do that to you. However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarder.

We've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Tachyon Squadron is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Tachyon Squadron to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe are running multiple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 10+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns will overlap, and that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The collection and artifacts will be packaged in a unique box - available only through this Kickstarter, with a limited run, for a limited time. (Seriously, the games will be available later, but the special packaging and artifacts will not be sold again!)\n* The campaign is over! Wow!\nThanks so much for the amazing support! We're working hard on the artifacts, and for more info on the games go to myst.com!\nIn the fall of 1993, Cyan released Myst \u2013 the surreal, graphical adventure game that provided an entirely new kind of experience for millions of virtual explorers. Surpassing Cyan\u2019s wildest expectations, it not only became the bestselling PC game of the 20th century, it also had a direct influence on popular culture. Over the years, Myst has brought together communities of passionate fans and has been referenced in television shows, movies, books, comics, and more. Myst has also inspired other creators as they built their own unique realms. Myst has even earned spots in the Smithsonian Institute, MoMA, and other notable museums.    \nAll 7 Myst Games Together for the First Time \nLooking back on this incredible, 25-year journey, Cyan believes a celebration is in order! We recognize this amazing achievement could not have happened without each and every one of you who have found your way to this Kickstarter. You have embraced the intricacies, oddities and mysteries in the Myst worlds \u2013 and have come back for more. So, as 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Myst, Cyan is taking our journey together one step further.\nBehind the scenes, we\u2019ve been working to procure the legal rights to make all of the Myst games available. As an indie developer, resources are limited for development, and acquiring these rights isn\u2019t always an option. But we\u2019ve finally managed to talk with all the right people in all the right places to garner funds to make it happen! With the needed agreements secured, we\u2019re delighted to present the Myst 25th Anniversary Collection, featuring all seven titles in the Myst series!\nWith the help of our friends at GOG.com and CodeWeavers the games have been upgraded to run on Windows 10 and macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). This Kickstarter will provide the entire Windows collection in a special exclusive package, but the updated versions of the games will also make their way to digital download services, starting with GOG.com, as automatic updates.\nSpecial Artifacts Only on Kickstarter\nBut we didn\u2019t stop there. We wanted to extract the essence of Myst\u2019s enigmatic aura and make it come alive \u2013 to touch, to hold, to remember...\nSo, we joined forces with Idea Planet, a unique group of talented folks who make realistic video game artifacts that wow. Chances are, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 or have \u2013 some of their really cool collector\u2019s editions. Check out their portfolio by clicking on the link in their logo above. We are thrilled to be working with them on our very own Myst 25th Anniversary Collection!\nNow on to the good stuff \u2013 the details you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nThe Linking Book\nThe core of the collector\u2019s edition will be a Myst Linking Book. The Bookmaker tier book will have a die-cut \u201cwindow\u201d through which you can see the art on the game DVD sleeves. At the Maintainer tier and above, the book will include an active 800 x 480 digital screen with video fly-throughs from the games.\nDimensions: 7in x 9in x 2.5in (18cm x 25 cm x 6 cm)\nWindow cutout: 5in x 2.75in  (12cm x 7cm) \nMaterials: 1200g grey board & art paper, with Matte Finish \nEmbossed & gold foil on Logo & edges of leather art treatments \nWeight:  2.71 pounds (1.23kg)\n1:1 exact scale replica\n800 x 480 IPS high resolution LCD screen (Maintainer tier)\nSpeaker (Maintainer tier)\nGehn\u2019s Inkwell and Pen \nThe Writer tier and above will feature an authentic replica of Gehn\u2019s Pen and Inkwell, meticulously recreated. And yes, it holds your ink, so it\u2019s a functioning set! (D'ni Writer's Ink or common ink not included.)\nThis tier also now includes digital versions of the three Myst novels (The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni) as well as high-resolution scans of some of the Riven design maps.\nGehn\u2019s Pen: \nDimensions: 7in (17.78cm) in length \nMaterials: Wood & Metal Accents \nGehn\u2019s Inkwell: \nDimensions 5.25in x 3.5in (13.35cm x 8.89cm)\nMaterials: Die Cast Zinc Alloy \nDeco: Antiqued Brass Plating \nWeight: 1.75lbs (.8kg)\n\nOriginal Design Sketches from Riven\nThis Collector tier is extremely limited and very special. We've opened the vault and collected 25 original hand-drawn concept sketches made during the production of Riven. These are not copies or reproductions. These are the actual pencil sketches with all of their variations, notes, smudges, and watermarks. Many of them have never been seen publicly before.\nMyst's 25th anniversary offers us a rare opportunity to provide these images to serious fans of the Myst series. Each unique hand-sketched drawing comes with a certificate of authenticity. \nSince these items are so unique, each backer at this level will get to choose which sketch they prefer. The order of the choice will be based on when the backer made their pledge - first pledge chooses first, second pledge chooses second, etc. And because we'd really like to spread the love around, we're limiting this tier to one per backer. You can see the available concept images here.\nA Word to Mac Users \nMyst started out as a Mac-first title, and over the years, Cyan has always released each of our games for the Mac. But for various reasons, maintaining some of those Mac titles now usually means rebuilding them from scratch - an option that, as a small indie studio, takes time or resources we just don\u2019t have. And for games that were produced by other studios, even that option wasn't possible.\nBut Mac users rejoice! After some research and testing, and the help of CodeWeavers, we've been able to come up with a solution that allows us to offer digital and disc versions of all of the games in this Anniversary Collection for macOS.\nWhy the $247,500 target amount?\nTo deliver a high-quality Myst collector\u2019s edition at a reasonable price, we need to have a minimum number of orders. Based on quotes for the design, tooling and manufacturing, we've calculated that we need at least 2,500 orders at the $99 tier or above (2,500 * $99 = $247,500) to achieve the bare minimum and move forward.\nReward Tier Summary\nCommunity Goals \nThank you for completing our community goals! \n\n.\nThat means everyone in the community \u2013 whether they\u2019ve backed this Kickstarter or not, whether they\u2019re a long-time veteran fan or new to the Mystiverse \u2013 can enjoy these items.\n\n5 High-resolution images from Myst - angles never before rendered \n5 Scans of the Riven Concept Art hanging in Cyan's Office \n5 VR nodes on the original Myst Island (viewable via Google Cardboard) \n5 Complete Digital Age design documents from Ages in Uru \n5 3D printable files for items in Myst\nA link to the downloads will be available soon. \n\nYOU DID IT!\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nUnfortunately, shipping costs have skyrocketed over the past several years. To help insure our shipping is as high quality and as low cost as possible, we have partnered with Blackbox who has globally positioned facilities to help minimize customs fees and VAT. Additionally, we have simplified the rate structure and even subsidized shipping rates in many cases. Please note the shipping cost when you select your pledge level.\nThanks, Adam!\nOkay Adam, we know you have some kind of reputation for ruining everything, but you sure helped us out. Seriously, having Adam as the voice of this Kickstarter pitch was such an amazing boost! If his energy, enthusiasm, and brilliance doesn't infect you, then you're probably not breathing. Thank you so much, Adam. Your linking book is on the way (after September.)\nAbout Cyan \nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller when they released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. After that was Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx \u2013 two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. In 1991, Cyan began work on a much larger world they called Myst. Myst and its sequel Riven have sold more than 15 million copies worldwide \u2013 which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. After five titles in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. (Myst Online is still available to explore for free.) In 2013, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund an entirely new game - Obduction. The campaign succeeded, and Obduction was successfully launched on PC, Mac, PS4, and VR.\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet. We continue to build on our past as we dream into the future.\nThank you! \nOur fans are the best! You'll never know how much we appreciate your continued support over the years.

Wer sich an die Challenge erinnert, wird vielleicht Die Grenzer vermissen, die zusammen mit Opus Magnum den zweiten Platz belegt haben. Schaut doch einfach mal in die Stretch Goals ...!\nUnd hier kommt ihr ins Spiel.

Like all of our Card Caddy products (all of which have been created with Kickstarter), our dice tower is mobile, modular and multi-purpose!\nJust a $12 pledge gets you one  - with US shipping included! \nReady to roll, wherever your adventures take you! (3D printed prototypes shown - go to the Card Caddy site to see how the finished products will look!)\nWhen closed, it keeps your dice and other accessories safe, and then turns into a dice tower when you're ready to play. The tower helps ensure a fair roll every time, as well as keeping those dice from rolling onto the game board or off the table.  AND, the lid and door of the dice tower form a peg-and-hole style score pad with storage built in for your pegs! AND, it's modular so you can mix and match multiple dice towers to stack them up or create custom configurations that combine or split your dice rolls! AND it's compatible with our other Card Caddy products! \nStow to roll in seconds!\nOur Citadel Dice Tower keeps your dice organized and contained on your way to your next adventure, then unpacks to form a compact rolling tower so your dice stay where you want them!\nLots of ways to customize how you roll!\nThere are lots of way to customize our Citadel Dice Tower for how you want to play!  Keep it simple or stack them up - either way you'll keep your rolls fair and under control!\nThe Citadel Dice Tower is compatible with our other Card Caddy products, so you can take your cards, gaming bits and other accessories with you on the go! There are a couple of reward levels where you can get one of each of all of our products, or you'll be able to add stuff to your Dice Tower pledges after the campaign using our pledge manager.\nKeep your cards and dice together with our compatible systems!\nThe dice tray and lid form their own storage box which can attach to any Card Caddy!\nThe packed configuration of the Dice Tower will be 4 x 4 x 3 inches (10.2 x 10.2 x 7.6 cm).  Opened up, it takes up about 7 x 3 inches (18 x 7.6 cm) of tabletop space.\nYou'll have your choice of 6 colors - the 5 main ones above (red, white, black, green and blue) and a Kickstarter exclusive color that all the backers will vote on after the campaign ends. Each Dice Tower will be a solid color - it you want a multi-color one, you'll have to get two or more to mix and match. \nDo you want to further customize your Dice Tower?  After the campaign, I can provide any backer with the exact specs and templates for laser or CNC engraving of your Dice Tower.\nHere are the reward levels and pledge amounts - more on shipping below, but US shipping is included, with an adder based on location for backers outside the US (ranges from $10-30).\nHow many dice fit and how big can they be?  You can see in the videos that a standard set of 7 polyhedral dice fit and roll well. The limiting factor is the size of the gap between the ramps inside the Tower and this is slightly over one inch.  Check out the video below if you're interested in the detailed measurements, dice capacity and how the final products will look:\nPLAY\n\nDo you want to see even MORE details about the Dice Tower and suggestions on how to use it?  The video below has a cutaway showing the interior, some more ideas on how to use it for passing around the table or with a box top, and close-up details on the score pad.\nA big reason to back our campaign is to help us bring this idea to reality, but there's something in it for you, too.  Depending on your backing level, you'll be saving 20-30% off the MSRP of $14.99.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, you should definitely be aware that it's not like most online stores or ordering platforms.  You are pledging funds to me and am I promising to do my best to provide you with a specified reward in return.  There is no inventory in a warehouse waiting to be shipped - your contribution is what helps me to pay for the very first production run. \nIf you're an experienced backer, you'll notice our campaign is lacking some usual features in many other campaigns - early bird pledges (or other rewards to incentivize early backing) and stretch goals.\nAs for early bird pledges, I think they are unfair and only reward a small segment of people who happen to come on the campaign early.  We're not doing stretch goals either for this campaign since I want to be laser focused on getting this product - and only this product - produced and shipped to my backers.  I've put together the best product I've been able to, and haven't kept back upgrades that could be revealed as goals later on. Stretch goals are cool and fun and they definitely help creators raise more money, but they also add potential delays and cost overruns and I want to keep this one as simple as possible.\nHaving said that, I still want to hear your comments, questions, suggestions and criticisms of the Dice Tower!  Your input has helped make our products better in all of our campaigns and I hope/expect it will be the same for this one! If someone thinks of a great stretch goal that I'm sure won't impact the schedule, or modifications to the design, I can try to make it happen.\n\"What about the ...(Triple Decker, Card Caddies for mini or Tarot cards, Shake N Shuffle, Card Shoe, etc)?!?\"\nWe've got great ideas for lots of cool new products, and if this one is successful, we'll get started on the next one.  In fact, we'll use a poll of backers from this project to help decide what our next project will be, so the best way to get the product you want is to help us be successful in this one!\nHelp us reach our goal by sharing on social media, your favorite forums and referring your friends. There are buttons right below the \"Back this project\" button above to help you do it.  And be sure to like, follow and share our posts on our social media accounts, too!\nWe're aiming to deliver your rewards by December 2018. If that changes, we will update you with a new timeline. Here's how the current schedule breaks out:\nShipping to US backers is subsidized by us in the base pledge levels - that's about $5 to $10 depending on the pledge level.  For backers outside the US, an extra $10-30 will be added to your pledge here on Kickstarter depending on your pledge level and location.  The additional costs for countries outside the US are the additional shipping and duty fees (Canada, EU, Australia and New Zealand) that we incur to get your backer reward to you. We'll be using fulfillment partners in these regions to minimize these costs as much as we can.\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll be using Backerkit to manage the fulfillment of rewards after the campaign.  You'll enter your shipping info there, and select your colors.  If you want to add-on to your pledge for more Dice Towers or any of our other products, you can do it there, too.  There will be an additional shipping charge starting at $4 for US orders for add-ons through Backerkit, but you'll still save a lot by bundling a bigger order together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our third Kickstarter and we've delivered on every one.

Unfortunately, we were unable to make a formal announcement/update earlier due to the uncertain nature of shipping goods by sea. A large part in the delay is also due to the fact the last few months of the year is a peak period for shipping and many shipping lines were fully booked and were not able to schedule our game for shipment.

Virtual reality has come at a cost they can never pay, a tradeoff of freedom for technology. But there are freedom fighters who reject the system, unplugging from the illusion and working to make things right once again. They are la R\u00e9sistance. \nRise up and defy the corporations in the Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG, set in the same universe as The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution from Indie Boards & Cards.\nAre you already a backer? Then go to this backers-only post and download the latest copy of Uprising right now!\nFound a typo or other error in the draft? Let us know! We're collecting them here.\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Uprising through them? Encourage your FLGS to back us and get their copies early!\nUprising is the roleplaying game based on the hit Dystopian Universe (DU) games from Indie Boards & Cards, including The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Like the other DU games, Uprising is about cunning spies and government agents, loyalty and betrayal, propaganda, unrest, and violent revolution. Unlike the other games, it\u2019s a roleplaying game or RPG. Uprising uses a modified version of the Fate Core rules. You\u2019ll step into the identities behind the cards\u2014or make your own\u2014and foment rebellion, betray close friends, aid enemies, and hopefully survive the dark and gritty streets of Paris Nouveau.\n\nAn RPG? What\u2019s that?  \nIn a roleplaying game, all of the players work together to tell a story--in this case, one about the lives of revolutionaries in the cyberpunk world of Paris Nouveau. Most of the players are PCs or player characters. These players decide what their character will do in response to what's happening in game. One person at the table will be the Game Master or GM. This player decides what the opposition and supporting characters do. When a character takes action, the player will roll the dice to see how successful (or unsuccessful) that effort is, but the real fun is in deciding together what happens next.\nYour cyberpunk Paris experience may vary.\n  What if I\u2019ve never played an RPG before?\nYou're in luck! RPGs are a lot of fun, and we've made special effort to insure this one is accessible to fans of the other DU games who might never have tried an RPG. Inside, you'll find the following beginner-friendly elements:\nCharacter archetypes based on familiar DU cards \u2013 Ever look at the cards during a game of Coup: Rebellion G54 and wonder what the Aristocrat or the General was thinking? This is your chance to find out first-hand!\nBeginner-friendly instructions \u2013 All this group storytelling sounds great, but what exactly do you do? This book lays it all out, along with an example of how it would play at the table.\nCharacter playsheets \u2013 Like the other DU games, all of the characters fall into familiar types. Pick a playsheet, customize it, and get playing quickly.\nSample missions - To help out new GMs (and anyone short on time!), we\u2019ve provided a series of pre-made missions. All the pieces, plot points, and characters are provided!\nStep into the Dystopian Universe\n\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic! What\u2019s in it for me?\nFor gamers familiar with Fate, Uprising offers some new and exciting mechanics\u2014not to mention that compelling cyberpunk setting. Inside, you\u2019ll find the following new elements:\nSecrets \u2013 Fate Core is built around camaraderie and teamwork, but at its core, the Dystopian Universe is full of backstabbing and deceit. Uprising provides a mechanical system for in-character secrets that will keep everyone at the table guessing.\nPrep scenes \u2013 Do more with your downtime than just refreshing your Fate pool with the new prep scene rules. Request favors, requisition equipment, and create advantages to use later.\nNew action rules \u2013 Instead of skills or approaches, Uprising uses means\u2014Fight, Manipulate, Maneuver, and Observe. Adjust the outcome depending on whether the means fit the end goal.\nAdvancement system \u2013 Instead of milestones, character-specific goals lead to character growth\u2014and sometimes put the characters at odds with each other.\nIn Paris Nouveau, danger lurks around every corner.\nAt KS launch, we\u2019ve already got a laid out copy of the game, which you can download immediately upon pledging. We're still finishing up the art, and we'll be sharing the development of the last few pieces with you throughout this Kickstarter! Next steps include proofing (which you can help with by downloading the instant PDF and reporting any problems here), finishing up that art, and print production.\nOur current timeline has Kickstarter fulfillment happening in December 2018, but we're looking at possibilities to shave some time off of that. Of course we\u2019ll keep you notified of how we\u2019re doing at every step of the process. We\u2019re rather proud of our track record when it comes to prompt KS fulfillment and excellent customer service, and, as always, we\u2019re committed to making this KS a positive experience for our backers.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We're doing this because we want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs. It also gives you a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form. We\u2019ll update the final PDF for backers at the $20 level and up, as soon as that\u2019s available. But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get their hands on that.\nPlease note that you'll see some art placeholders in the book (outlines or blank boxes). If that wasn't clear above, we'll be filling those in with the remaining art once it's done.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $39 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\", hardcover, 310 page, full color version of Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG. Shipping late 2018.\nDigital Bonuses: All backers at $20 and higher will receive a download link to a digital bonus pack. This downloadable folder of awesomeness will include copies of Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Venture City (our superhero flavored cyberpunk supplement), and Designers & Dragons: The 70\u2019s (the first volume in our four book history of the RPG industry), plus sample chapters from recent releases Fate Adversary Toolkit, Dresden Files Accelerated, and upcoming releases Tachyon Squadron and Scum and Villainy.\nUNLOCKED: POD Secrets Deck: Once we reach $10,500, we'll unlock a digital coupon code for a POD copy of the Secrets Deck from DriveThruCards for all backers at $20 and up. The book comes with printable secret cards so you can get playing immediately (and you'll be able to download a clean PDF of them from our website), but we'd like to offer a more durable card option. The code will allow you to purchase the POD version at cost (around $1.22 based on our current quote, as opposed to the $5-or-so we'll charge outside of this KS) plus shipping.\nUNLOCKED: Paris Nouveau Corporate Catalog: Once we reach this funding goal, we'll unlock the Corporate Catalog supplement for all backers at $20 and up. This electronic-only, approximately 5000 word supplement will include more corporations to act as foils, antagonists, or uneasy allies; equipment produced by each corporation to provide an easy PC-purchase list; and additional corp-specific implants and contacts.\nUNLOCKED: Safehouses and Hotspots: At $23K, all backers at $20 and up will unlock the Safehouses and Hotspots supplement. This electronic-only, approximately 4000 word supplement will include 2-page spreads with ready-made encounters that the GM can drop into existing missions. GMs can also repurpose the included NPC stats for use in a home-brew mission.\nUNLOCKED: The Second Fall and Other Stories: Our next stretch goal is for The Second Fall and Other Stories, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. Many of the missions in the core book are stand-alone, but some connect into a loose story arc. This downloadable, approximately 5000 word supplement will provide additional story arcs, each broken down into six connected missions. These can be chained together or run as a ready-made campaign. Once we unlock this goal, we\u2019ll start writing!\nUNLOCKED: Beyond the Walls: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Beyond the Walls, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This supersized supplement (at approximately 10,000 words) will focus on a new city beyond the walls of Paris Nouveau, with a different style of oppression. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nUNLOCKED: Invisible Hands: The Black Market: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Invisible Hands supplement, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This 5000 word electronic supplement will give you a look at the underbelly of Paris Nouveau\u2014with echoes of the Grifters of the Dystopian Universe. It will include new underworld contacts and plenty of illegal tech to fuel your campaigns.\nUNLOCKS AT $52,000: Upfrancisco Uprising: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on a profile of Upfrancisco. Take your Uprising campaign to an entirely new setting and country with this 10,000 word electronic supplement. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nAs with our other recent Kickstarters, we're charging a flat $6 shipping fee.  This also allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit--the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll also be using BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager--a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via the BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nWe\u2019ve made the difficult decision not to offer international shipping in this Kickstarter. To put it simply\u2014the shipping costs our distributors are able to offer is as much or more than the products we\u2019d ship. We can\u2019t in good conscience ask you to pay it. However, we still want international folks to be able to get their hands on the goodies. You can try a freight forwarder or a friendly American willing to forward the shipment to you. If that's not feasible for you, we've made it a point to make all of the materials available in an international-friendly electronic tier to make sure you can join the uprising no matter where you live. And of course we'll make the book available in international distribution, when we get to that point.\nDevelopers: Brian Engard, Anna Meade\nEditor: J.D.

We've printed many role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years\u2014twelve in the past two years alone. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing, layout, and playtesting of Uprising is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Uprising to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Ordinary humans, and even some heroes, regress and become ruled by their primal passions.\nThere are amazing opportunities scattered among the Living Land's perils. The Law of Wonders insures that lost treasures appear in the misty and unexplored jungles. These treasures might have disappeared from Earth long ago or they may be relics from cosms destroyed by the High Lords.

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined seven Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because we have so much experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partner in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have strong relationships with our international fulfillment partners. These are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparation after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nAdditionally, we will be freighting the Elder Dice around the world to our fulfillment partners who will then send the rewards to you. Shipping delays at sea, weather conditions, extended customs inspections, and more could potentially delay the project at this stage.\n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color. But, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

Their binding knowledge is poor and the entities of the Wild Hunt strain against their bonds. The splinter group is holding a hungry tiger by the tail and can only keep the Hunt busy lest it turn on them. They seek out the Investigators and endeavour to strike a devil's bargain; help them end or control the monsters, or see them create a bloodbath the likes the North-East of America has never seen.\nCan the rebel group be trusted?\nCan the Investigators walk away and live with their decision?\nCan the Wild Hunt be controlled? And by whom?\n\nIt is time for you to find out!\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com.\nThe book will also contain the main adventure written by Tyler Omichinski, NPCs, plans, scenario seeds, and options to expand the Investigators' dealings with the Wild Hunt. Layout will be by Stephanie McAlea, but we'd like to add further art by creators we admire and trust to deliver. This is where the Kickstarter funds come in.\nTaking its inspirational cues from Celtic myth, classic monsters, and H.P. Lovecraft, the book takes a mature look at the horror of Mythos interpretations by historic cultures and will also summarise the tragedy of terrorism, self-determination, and their links to organised crime. There will also be information on how Celtic cultures in Britain and Ireland re-interpret the mythos to fit their cultural narrative and, as the subjects within can be sensitive for many, this book is for mature gamers only. \nThe funds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring more writers and creatives of quality if the book is to expand. The funds will also go on printing and distribution.\nUnlike their characters who face insanity and death, backers can look forward to lovingly produced PDFs, Softcover and Hardcover books, and increased quality and content depending on stretch goals.\nAt the moment, the books are 90 pages and will be perfect bound. They will have a colour cover and greyscale internal pages. Due to stretch goals, these are all subject to change.\nThe entire cost of your books and getting them to you is covered by your pledge.\nThe top tier reward is slightly different. Those who pledge at this level can look forward to Stygian Fox's owner, Stephanie McAlea, running a scenario at the Continuum gaming convention on the 21st of July at Oadby Campus, in Leicester, UK. It will be an abridged version of The Wild Hunt with pre-generated characters.\nAs the book won't be ready for distribution at this point, backers at this level will receive their copies in due course but will also receive copies of some of our previous titles and other goodies as a thank you for backing!\nA Note of Caution\nThe onus is on the backer to attend the convention and they must at least have a day ticket already purchased before pledging. Stygian Fox is not responsible for the backer failing to attend due to illness, act of a deity, or rail strikes. No refunds will be forthcoming for a failure to attend. \nAll convention rules must be adhered to and those not doing so, or flouting 'Wheaton's Law', will be removed from the table (and possibly the convention) immediately and without refund or compensatory gifts from Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea.\nThese rules are strict to protect both Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea but also other players and conventioneers. I'm sure you understand.\nMore information on this most excellent of gaming conventions can be found here: https://continuumconvention.co.uk/\nWith this project, our focus is to produce a beautiful and entertaining book but budget and time constraints may hamper that. With stretch goals and the economy of scale, we hope to furnish the book with better maps, more information and art, and have a premium level of quality in regards to printing and binding. If we're lucky enough to reach the top level we'll pay our writers and artists more for helping us get there. Admittedly, this doesn't benefit our backers but as pay in the RPG industry is seriously low, I'm sure you'll want to help the creatives involved to get a bonus.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects, there is a risk but as the manuscript is mostly complete we think this book has very little risk to it.

They hold up to twenty character sheets that can be turned over like a book due to being kept in place with ultra strong neodymium magnets. They can be removed and changed around. There are trays to store and roll dice, or you can roll them on the main board.\n\nWhen you're finished you put the lid on and everything is carried and stored safely until your next game.\n\nThey're made to set free your role playing games, making them more mobile and reducing setup and takedown time. They free up space on the games table and they even allow games to take place without a table. You can play on the sofa, in a hammock, on the lawn, in bed, around a camp fire.

It has a lid to help you transport everything and a large A5 (or a Junior Letter pad for US/Can orders). It can be rotated to suit people who are left or right handed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed the MN Board, it's more compact, thinner and without a lid it is light enough to dual wield. It's ideal for the games master to keep several at home to lend out when people come over to play. It holds a mobile phone or other small device for using apps or linking over skype. Comes in left and right handed options and features as A7 Pad (This has been modified to 76mm x 76mm to fit yellow stickies or 3inch square pads). Available in left or right handed options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed SF Board, it's a techy version that has Tablet and Mobile Phone dock for apps, browsers and skype games as well as a lid. Comes with an A6 (or a 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d pad for US/Can orders) pad and available in left and right handed options.\n \n\n\n\nWe designed the GM Board, it does lots, but not only does it do lots but you can customize how you use it so it does lots of what you want it to do. It has everything the others have and then a bit more, most notably 7 white GM Tabs form a GM screen.\nNote: Due to extensive backer feedback the GM Board has been modified. the A5 ring bound pad has been removed. In its place there is a tray for miniatures, a smaller notepad and 4 areas for different coloured post-it notes/stickies. This seems a fairly unanimous upgrade in function. The GM board still features 7 GM Tabs and all are the full height (not different heights as featured on the production prototypes video)\n\n______________________________________________\nSpecification/Details:\nProduction: CNC machined to 0.2mm accuracy by Novacrylics Engineering, my family company run by me and my brother in Warwickshire, England. Magnets: Specially developed Chrome plated Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets, losing only 1% of their strength per decade. These magnets are safe to use with electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.\n\nBacker Security: Please read my profile and learn about what resources and experience I have behind me\n\nProduct Security: Patent Pending and Registered Design in major world markets.\n\nWood: High quality, sustainable, cavity free, FSC rated Birch Ply\nTablet and Phone Compatibility: Compatible with all known tablets. If you roll a critical fail on your choice of tablet and you got an oval one or something then thats too bad, but we tried nearly 30 different tablets and every one of them sat on it just fine. Phones wider than 70mm don't sit well on the MN and the SF but are fine on the GM.\n\nGM Tabs: The GM tabs acting as a screen on the GM Board are made of cast PMMA with an mirco-etched finish allowing them to be drawn on with a normal pencil (is exactly the same as using a chalk board). Pencil marks can be removed with an eraser. In testing the tabs have been written and erased over 100 times with no effect to function, it is likely they can be used an unlimited number of times. In addition you can write on the tabs with a permanent marker which doesn't come off allowing hitpoint counters which stay in place even if you cross off and erase hitpoint ticks.\n\nPads come with the boards and are available cheaply as refils.

All orders sent to N.American will automatically be shipped fitting US paper (no need to change your order). Orders delivered elsewhere will remain A sized.\n\n-\n\n**Stretch Goals Added - 23rd Jan 2018**Note: We didn't expect to reach this point 6 days after the kickstarter begun! This was all the upgrades we were planning on offering! We didn't budget for being able to offer anything else for free, but we've worked non-stop for 3 days to get more unlock goals. We couldn't make all of them free, but I hope you like what we came up with. Photos and more information to come when prototypes are made.\n\n-\n\n\u00a312,000 ***Unlocked***\nVelcro Book Strap (Paid Upgrade at \u00a35 each) 50mm (2in) Velcro (TM) strap that wraps around all CharacTables allowing them to be bundled together with other CharacTables or allowing them to be bundled together and carried with a pile of rule books, pads, or other items. up to 20cm (8in) thick.\n -\n\u00a313,000 ***unlocked***\nElastomer Die Trays(Free Upgrade)Hard Wearing Elastomer Dice Trays. This second upgrade to the dice trays results in a hard wearing easily cleanable surface of charcoal coloured elastomer. Stays much cleaner than felt and is easier to clean with water if it does get dirty. More durable and entirely water proof allowing the die tray to be used as a cup holder too. Rolling is a little bit quieter than on felt and the dice seem to jiggle and bounce around a bit more when rolled as its a slightly springier surface. This goal will be applied to all unlocked CharacTable Boards and all boards.\n-\n\u00a314,000 ***Unlocked*** \n28mm Miniature Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a315 each) A case that contains chunky foam pieces (not pictured) that can be attached to the velcro strap. Carries up to four 28mm characters or the equivalent. A character, a mount and a familiar/animal companion could be stored in the case for example. This attaches to the velcro strap.\n-\n\u00a316,000 ***Unlocked***\nCarry Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a330 each) A lid that features a carry handle allowing the CharacTable to be carried like a briefcase. Be aware that this makes the CharacTable around 7.5cm (3in) higher.\n-\n\u00a319,000 ***Unlocked***\nMagnetic Side Tab (Free Upgrade) A white bar clamps character sheets to the main board and replaces the two button magnets. This allows for easier turnover of pages and prevents the individual magnets from being lost. It is made from the same material as the GM tabs and so allows a small area alongside the sheet for short term tracking of hitpoints, spells, temporary modifiers to saves/weapons etc. This can all be done alongside the character sheet next to the relevant stat/weapon/character instead of repeatedly writing on and erasing the character sheet. This goal will be applied to all CharacTables past and future.\n-\n\n\u00a320,000 ***unlocked***\nHandle + 100mm (4in) Velcro (TM) Strap (Paid Upgrade at \u00a314) A specially made 25mm birch ply handle on a 100mm velcro strap. Holds the Miniature case and many rule books.\n-\n\u00a322,000 ***Unlocked***\nCabinet Finish (Paid Upgrade) Two coats of high quality semi-mat spray varnish to seal and protect\n-\n\u00a324,000 ***Unlocked***\nFully Covered lid (Free Upgrade) All CharacTable boards that currently have lids are upgraded to feature a lid that covers the full surface of the CharacTable. This goal will be applied to all CharacTable orders past and future. We have had a lot of requests for this one, the reason this is so late in the pledge tree is because it requires much more wood, and stronger (more expensive) magnets to hold the bigger lid securely in place.\n-\n\n\u00a326,000\nMobile/Tablet Charger conduit (Free Upgrade)\nA hole and modified board for the mobile phone charger cable to run to the phone and tablet docks allowing them to be used in portrait orientation while being charged (seen on the production prototypes video)\n\n-\n\n\u00a328,000\nAcrylic Lids (Paid Upgrade).\nA variety of coloured and clear acrylic lids. Choose from black, white, clear, red, yellow, blue, green, pink, purple, orange.

A game that looks into the face of destiny, and decides for itself. It is a game about mythic deeds, and choosing free will over fate.    \nDestiny is a choice. \nThe Viziers guide the flow of our world toward its inexorable doom. The armies of the world amass and gather, intent on destruction and death. Only you can choose the path of your own fate. By your actions, you choose the course of history. \nThe burden of free will is yours alone. The chains of destiny cannot hold you.  \nYou are free.\nDraw your sword.\nMake your choice.\nGuide your destiny.\nIn Warsong Second Edition, you play as one of the Viziers, ancient shape-shifting Quicksilvers, dread undead Neverborn or one of the other primordial inheritors of the world. It is your free will that will shape the course of history and decide whether the world will fall by its own hand, or rise up from its ashes. The ancient powers are but memories, and the people fight for the right to rule.\nThe skeins of destiny have begun to fray and the Ancient Viziers have disappeared along with the old gods, leaving destiny in the hands of their heirs. You are one of the children of the primordial powers, born the promise of destiny, and bound to its power.\nArmed with the power of magic and the ability to shape destiny itself, the Viziers, divine offspring of both god and man, stand as the world's last defense against the forces of entropy and their own self-destruction. The gods, ancient viziers and primordial powers have disappeared, the nations refuse to stand united for a promised future and bitter rivalries burn as brightly as ever while the world's life force dwindles down to ember. It won't be an easy choice, but it will be yours to make.\nWhat will you do with Free Will?\nWarsong Second Edition began in 2013 as a play-test sample world built along with Pathfinder guidelines. Over time, it became a game of its own and Kickstarted on June 25 2016. Since then, it's become a dynamic world that has gathered some of the most passionate fans Higher Grounds has ever seen. Now, a bit over a year after the game's release, a revised and expanded second edition is nearing completion. Renewed in its second edition, Warsong Second Edition takes a year of reviews, feedback and criticism and puts those lessons to work.\nToday, Warsong Second Edition is ready to jump back into the fray as a distilled and refined game using the Fate Core System rules, ready to ride the skeins of fate once more.\n The Warsong Second Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to improve upon the look and feel of the last book. We want to create a 6\" x 9\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, symbolic cover image. We estimate this book to be over 400 pages on high quality paper stock. We will also offer black-and-white paperback options.\nWarsong Second Edition will include rules for playing many kinds of heirs, including the Viziers, Quicksilvers and Neverborn. It will include Extras for each type of character, including powers for each type of character as well as new Aspect types and antagonists including the destiny-warping Untouched, Skein-Walkers that guard the threads of fate and many more. It will also include detailed setting information and adventure hooks and even a starting adventure to help get new players started.\nThe Viziers are the main type of character in Warsong Second Edition. They are heirs to the destiny of the world, and the direct descendets of the ancient, god-like Viziers that watched over the fate of everything from a rabbit in the woods to cataclysmic disasters. As a Vizier, you do not have the world-shattering power that your ancestors held, but you must take up their mantle and choose whether to guide the world toward oblivion, or save it from certain doom. You wield powerful Loom Weaving abilities, which allow you to make alterations to the very destiny of the people, places and events around you. You can Hack The Loom, allowing you to make minor alterations to your own destiny and the destiny of others, or you can Dive, allowing you to create a fake persona and change situations in the past or the future by your own hands. As a Vizier, the fate of the world literally rests in your hands. \nThe Quicksilvers are descended from the ancient Lycanthrope. You are blessed with free will and the ability to change your shapes into any animal or person that you've encountered. Your do not have one true shape, but two. That of your human form which you were given at birth, and your animal totem, which gives you the power of the Eldritch Primordials to change your shape. It is your geas to protect the world and all life within it, and your ancestral prophecies have destined the end to come within your lifetime. Those Quicksilvers who will fight in the final battle have already be born.\nThe dreaded Neverborn are feared knights of death, itself. You do not need ancient lineage or powerful ancestors to claim your power, for your power was earned upon your death. You are the end of the cycle of life, culling the weak and feeble. You are also the means by which new life can grow. Without death, there is indeed no life. Without you, life would not exist. You can wield the powerful, inevitable mastery of death itself as one of the Neverborn, powerful agents of death and rebirth.\nThere are more types of characters to play as well. There are powerful mortals that have been trained by one of the clans in their very own styles of martial arts and warfare. They can wield strange technologies such as Power Armor, Relics and even Eldritch Sorcery, a dangerous and often outlawed method of using the energies of the Far Dimensions to create magical effects in reality. \nEach of the Five Nations has a ruling class of individuals that either belong to a bloodline or have been adopted in. These families are called Clans and each clan has a ruling lord that seeks to vie for supremacy over the other nations. As the Grand Emperor reaches his final days, the already-fragile peace between the nations has devolved into all-out war. There is the stout and loyal Crab Clan, the ferocious Tiger Clan, the clever Monkey Clan, the devious Snake Clan and the wise Dragon Clan. There are clans that exist outside the rule of the Grand Emperor. Mistrusted and often seen as enemies to the rule of the Grand Emperor, there are the graceful Crane Clan and the malicious, deadly Scorpion Clan. \nWho will rule the nations? You must decide.\nOur intention with this Kickstarter campaign is to make the best version of Warsong Second Edition possible. Getting your support now will allow us to fund the best production, use the best components and perhaps even add even more art and content to the book.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully finished and completed six Kickstarter projects and several more are headed to completion as you read this.

All pieces move in the direction of the reversed S letter.\nPieces: Each Player has 5 pieces and they are printed with different number dots 1 to 5.\nStarting position: Two groups of pieces are placed alternately from No.1 starting square (sun) like as 5,5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1.\nStarting position\nRules\n\u3010Dice rolling\u3011\nDecide which player will place their piece on starting square (sun). Players continue to alternate turns, with each turn consisting of the rolling of two dice, followed by the movement of that player\u2019s playing pieces. The values on the rolled dice indicate how many spaces a playing piece moves. Exception: If the player has only 1 remaining playing piece left on the board, then they can choose to roll two dice or one die.\n\u3010Movement options\u3011\nPlaying pieces may be moved according to any of the following rules.\nTwo playing pieces are moved, each using the value of a different die.\nA single playing piece is moved according to the combined value of the two dice.\nPlayers can't move a piece to the square where own piece occupied, but they can move it where opponent piece occupied. \nThat occupied opponent piece must go back to starting square (sun).\nWhen it goes back if a piece(regardless own and opponent) is on the starting square, the piece on the starting square must be taken off the board. That piece is out of play for the remainder of the game.\n\u3010How to go up goal : bearing off\u3011\nBearing off goal is beyond the No.30 square. Playing pieces must be able to land exactly on one space beyond the No.30 square to bear off. If there are more spaces to move, the playing piece must move backwards on the board, starting from the number 30 square, the number of spaces left.\n\u3010Winning\u3011\nWhen 3 pieces(regardless own and opponent) reach the goal, the game is over. The total of the finished piece's dot(s)  is the score. The winner is the player who obtains the  highest score. When scores are tied, the player who has more finished pieces wins the game. Passing on your turn is not allowed. The player who doesn't have legal move at his turn loses the game.\n\u3010Special effect squares\u3011\nSix symbol tiles except for starting square(sun) are special effect squares. If the piece stops on there, it must do below options.\nIf a piece stops on the No.15 square(bird), it must move to the No.27 square(egg).\nIf a piece stops on the No.26 square(sunset), it must move to the No.1 square(sun).\nIf a piece stops on the No.27 square(egg), it must move to the No.15 square(bird).\nNo.28,29,30 are safety squares to go up the goal. Other piece(s) out of three squares can't move to these squares occupied with pieces. But piece(s) on these squares must move at their next turn.\nThese piece(s) on the special effect squares can move to any squares regardless the space is occupied with own or opponent piece.\n\u25cfSupporter's aid Senet-modern laminated paper board edition with creator's signature. 1,000 JPYen (Approx:$9USD) free shipping anywhere in the world.\nBoard\uff1alaminated paper, 4 inches \u00d7 8 inches\nPieces\uff1aceramic tiles, 0.6 inch square\u30010.2 inch thick\nTwo dice and a rule note\npackaged with plastic bag\nYou can get additionally this reward simply to increase your pledge money 500JPYen(Approx:$5USD).\nReward is shipped by ordinary SAL air mail.

You will pick your adventurers, spend your coins to boost their stats, and then sit back and watch as the dice determine their fate in the old Bracket Dungeon. You'll also place bets on your favorite groups, trying to gain complete sets of Red, Green and Purple coins. In the end, all of your adventurers may be dead and gone, but you can still be the king of Semifinal Fantasy! \n  Once you get into the Dungeoncrawl phase, groups will roll dice to compete in a variety of trials. They'll compare results and the winning group scores coins, and the adventurer that contributed the most scores extra coins. These can be used to boost and bet in future rounds, or hold out for endgame scoring.  \nAfter 3 sets of trials, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.\nComponents\nThe game consists of 9 pages that are used for each game session. Print them each time you play, or laminate them for endless replayability.\n4 pages of player tableaus\n4 pages of adventuring teams\n1 page with the bracket and alternate adventurers\nPlus 2 pages of rules that you will only need to print once.\nYou will need to provide one (or preferably two) set(s) of polyhedral dice, and something to write with.\nBlack and White Version\nIf you want to save on ink, this is the way to go. Old school and bare bones. It's just black ink on white paper, and you can print at Kinko's for like 5 cents a page or on your printer that is likely going to be out of ink any minute now. \nLite Color Version\nThis one has just the essentials. Colors separating the 3 types of trials (Speed, Power and Intelligence). It holds your hands and guides your eyes a little, allowing you to focus on the important things (like making sure anyone other than your brother ends up winning the game). \nFull Color Version\nIf you actually have color ink in your printer (I don't believe you, but it was a good try), this is the full deal. Full color pages that both guide the eye and define the characters. It's an impressive layout when the entire table is covered, and feels like First Class Semifinal Fantasy.\n What else is there to say?\nLet's see. This game started out as a massive big box prototype at Unpub 4 back in 2014. The name was Fantasy Fantasy, perhaps the most perfect name to ever exist. From there myself and Luke Peterschmidt of FunTo11 discussed some options with the game (merging concepts with a game that he was working on) and a few publishers took a look at it. Eventually I set it aside as things for Button Shy were ramping up, and the price point was just too high. The game used almost 200 coins, and had 8-16 different tableaus. It was ambitious, but it felt right. The game was about big crunchy stats, mixed with big hinging die rolls, and deep competition mixed with an odd sense of collaboration. But it would have a $60-80 price tag, and I couldn't pull that off.\nFast forward some time and JR Honeycutt and Daryl Andrews release their game Fantasy Fantasy Baseball. The most awesome name of all time was no longer an option. I simply waited too long, and it happens. Sometimes it's crushing and other times you can turn it around into something even better, which I was able to do here.\nIt took a LONG time, but Semifinal Fantasy clicked one day and it clicked in a big way. I now prefer it to the original name, except it's just missing the sass of the original. But it's here and here to stay. Once the name was back in place, I was motivated to get this back on the table and featured it at the Granite Game Summit in late 2016. It was still the big massive version, and I considered just making it a con game. I'd run it at cons and it would be a great time, that nobody could afford to reproduce at home. But is that a bad thing? I'm not so sure. I still love the idea of a con only game, and this one is ripe for it. Anyway, Granite Game Summit was awesome, and the game went over very well. I was happy to get it moving again. \nCome along 2017 and roll & writes are everywhere. It's a design space that I love, since you can easily get it to the table with little other than the paper, pencil and some dice. Semifinal Fantasy crossed my mind as a possibility to reduce the component count. When I actually started on it, I realized how much it fit, not only mechanically, but also in theme. Old school fantasy football drafts on paper, and classic roleplaying character sheets were a big inspiration. \nThat brings us to today, Black Friday 2017. What better day is there to release a football-inspired budget conscious game? ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first time making a roll and write game.

Truesdell [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\nBesides his works of cosmic horror, he also wrote a series of poems, short stories and a novella set in a high fantasy world know as the Dreamlands. The Dreamlands was an alternate dimension that could be entered through dreams filled with ancient ruins, monsters, seedy taverns and cats. Unlike the dread of his horror writing, the dreamlands were filled with heroism and adventure.\nHeather and I are tremendous Lovecraft fans, as are many of our friends. And once again we had ideas\u2026 so many ideas\u2026 too many ideas for just one card. So we decided to make nine of them. They are meant to seem like \"normal\" Christmas cards when viewed across the room on the mantle. Its only when you get closer that their true nature becomes apparent. Not only do we have new cards but we are offing the old cards again if you missed our other 2 Kickstarters and we are offering WRAPPING PAPER!\nThe Project\nSince we are making quite a few designs we are breaking them into 2 separate packs. Each pack has 4 unique cards and the Cats of Ulthar card. One reason for this is that Heather just didn't have the time to make a 10th design. The other reason is that Lovecraft LOVED cats (and ghouls apparently), they appear all over the Dreamlands and we love them too. We felt that many single pack backers would feel disappointed if they didn't get the cat card in their pack. There is a stretch goal to alter one of the cat cards if you are backing both packs and don't want a duplicate. The cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope. We have been told that the paper takes ink from a quill pen fantastically. Each card will also come with a matching envelope. The envelopes are square backed and will have a self adhesive strip - so no licking needed.\nHeather is hard at work finishing the cards, she has done color studies for all of them and has started all the paintings but as we launch only 2 of them are \"final\" final. Instead of showing half finished paintings we have posted the sketches of the cards which will be replaced as the paintings are finished. You will be able to see all the final art well before the end of the campaign. \nDreamland Xmas Pack Set 1 (5 cards)\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 1 - Santa Toad\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 2 - Yak Riders of Inganok\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 3 - Moonlight Sledding\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 4 - Love Gugs (Under the Mistletoe)\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\n  Dreamland Xmas Pack Set 2 (5 cards)\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 1 - Sarkomand Starlight\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 2 - Cavern of Flame\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 4 - (Santa vs.) The Black Galley\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 3 - Happy Zoogs of Zoogville\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\nThe Gift Wrap\nThis year we are trying out some gift wrap. Its just a single design printed on a single side (if it proves popular there is a later stretch goal to expand it to one sheet each of five different designs.) The 18\" x 24\" gift wrap comes in five folded sheets. It folds down to 9 x 12 so we can fit it into a standard mailer. It is printed on a 70 lb. high quality matt stock.  A single sheet will wrap a moderately sized box.\nWrapping paper design\nPrevious Year's Cards\nFor those of you that missed the previous year's cards we are offering them again!\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Pack Set (5 cards)\nThe cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope.\nCthulhu Card 1 - The Snows are Right\n  Cthulhu Card 2 - Lovecraft Claus\n  Cthulhu Card 3 - The Yithmas Tree\n  Cthulhu Card 4 - Ho Ho Migo\n  Cthulhu Card 5 - The Innsmouth Carollers\n  Cthulhu cards envelope and seal\nThe King in Yellow Pack Set (5 cards)\nKing in Yellow Card 1 - The Day Has Come\n  King in Yellow Card 2 - Twin Suns\n  King in Yellow Card 3 - No Mask\n  King in Yellow Card 4 - Behind the Moon\n  King in Yellow cards envelope and seal\n  Dragon Wreath (fantasy bonus card)\nReward Levels \n  Stretch Goals\n$4,000 Printed Interior\nAt $4,000 the cards will get color printed phrases and holiday platitudes.\n$5,000 Silver envelopes\nAt $5,000 the lilac envelopes will be replaced by silver metallic envelopes to give your cards that extra bit of class. The envelopes are square backed and will have a self adhesive strip - so no licking.\n$6,000 Printing on envelopes\nAt $6,000 we will add a printed line art holiday illustration onto the silver envelopes.\nPrinted Silver envelopes\n$7,000 Silver key embossed seal\nAt $7,000 we will add a 2.5 x 1.75 inch oval embossed seal printed on a dull silver foil with a hot stamped and embossed shiny silver key. In the several of the stories the Silver Key is used to allow dreamers to enter the Dreamlands.\nThe Silver Key card seal\n$8,000 4 Free Gift tags\nAt $8,000 every physical order will receive 4 free 2\" x 4\" card stock full color gift tags. The gift tags will also be added to the PDFs.\n2\" x 4\" Gift tags\n$10,000 5 different wrapping paper designs\nAt $10,000 the single design for the five sheet pack of wrapping paper will change to 5 different single sheet designs.\nGift wrap designs\n$12,000 Alternate art for cats card.\nAt $12,000 the \"Ulthar Cats Want In\" card in set 2 will have its colors and detailed altered.\nInternational shipping\nWe are shipping to Canada and Europe this year. We would like your support but we ask that you consider getting the PDFs first if you are not in the States. We CANNOT guarantee that your cards will arrive in time for Christmas, so if you plan on using them this year you may be out of luck. Some European countries also have notoriously bad mail systems when receiving things from the states (Spain, Italy, Eastern Europe), we have had personal shipments take months to arrive, have been in poor condition or even lost. The price is also very steep and please be aware that some countries will charge a customs handling fee on items over a certain price / weight, unfortunately we have no control over this. If you are willing to take the risk we will ship to you.\nWe need your help\nThis is where you come in. We need your help to offset around 2/3 of the printing costs. We would like to have enough funding to print cards for both the Kickstarter rewards and to stock them for next year. Timelines are tight but we have printers' assurances that printing will start right after the Kickstarter finishes and we can ship cards out in good time for you to send them for the holidays. We want to get them into your hands early in the first week of December (we\u2019re shooting for the 1st of December). We have been told that we have the fastest turnaround that our supporters have backed. Help us to achieve our vision of making the holidays a little weirder, you will be getting some beautifully printed cards of you own to start you own new holiday tradition.\nWho are we?\nHeather paints the pictures, Daniel handles the rest.\nDaniel Gelon has over 25 years of art experience. He has done illustration, UX, graphic design, production and art direction. He has illustrated Magic cards, created logos for DC comics, art directed Dungeons and Dragons books and has worked on various video games. He is obsessed with machines made of paper. Heather Hudson\nHeather Hudson is a frequently digital fantasy artist with a traditional paint sensibility and a love of early-20th century popular culture. She\u2019s worked on tabletop and hobby games including Hasbro's \u201cMagic; the Gathering\u201d and Pagan Publishing's modern Mythos RPG \u201cDelta Green.\u201d Past Lovecraftian projects she's illustrated include \"Casino R'lyeh, the Lovecraft Poker Deck,\" and \"Mother Hydra's Mythos Rhymes.\" Currently she divides her time between commissioned illustration, personal projects and creating her own fantasy world somewhere between Oz and the Dreamlands. She has a fondness for illuminating monsters.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe final art is not finished. Heather has done final sketches and color studies for the outstanding pieces and has all of them started in various degrees of finish. She is confident that she has the time finish the work before the campaign's end. Barring some accident or carpel-tunnel syndrome we will be fine. If the art can't be finished, we would cancel the campaign rather than go through with it and collect your money. \n\nWe run extremely fast turnarounds to make the holiday season deadline. There are a lot of moving parts. The final files are in the printers hands before the end of the Kickstarter. The day after the campaign ends surveys go out and the printers get out final count for the jobs and it takes several weeks for the jobs to arrive to us. We do our best at hacking through the rewards to get them out in a timely manner. The process could gum up at any point. We know this and this will be our 3rd time doing this, we know all the timing and have all our systems in place best we can. We also have enough wiggle room to do expedited printing with the same printer or an alternate printer if things really go south. We are confident that we will have product in time to get it into your hands with time to send out for the holidays. \n\nThe only great unknown is the international shipping, this is the first campaign that we are trying it on and don't know yet what if anything can go wrong.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Just helping out", "descp": "Your reward is our THANKS.

Scared!?  \n...You should be.\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for THE DARE a scenario for The Call of Cthulhu\u2122 role-playing game, as licensed by Chaosium.  Originally written by Kevin Ross and published by Triad Entertainments in 1996, we have revised and expanded the scenario for the 7th Edition rules.\nWhat is it about?\n\"Children will always be afraid of the dark.\" - H.P. Lovecraft\nDo you remember what it was like to be a kid?  When in every shadow there might lurk a monster?  When a nightmare might be escaped from by diving under your blankets?  When the morning light brought escape from all your fears... for a little while?\nIn THE DARE, players take the role of a group of average kids who are forced by their neighborhood bully to spend the night in the dreadful (and haunted!) Barnaker house.  This being Call of Cthulhu, there are actually things in the house far more dangerous than even the most terrified child might imagine.  The kids must then work together to explore the nightmarish old Barnaker house and investigate its mysteries if they hope to survive until the morning.\nDraft of cover by Ian MacLean\nWho will enjoy it?\nHopefully you! THE DARE is a scenario ideally suited to a single session of play - for both experienced and novice players.  It can be a fun break from Cthulhian horrors your gaming group regularly faces or as an introduction to the game for newbies.  We're proud that Kevin Ross has given us the opportunity to resurrect and expand on his homage to the horror of Stephen King (among other authors) and are excited to share it with a new generation.\nWho are we?\nSentinel Hill Press is a small press focusing on Lovecraftian Horror with an emphasis on New England's history and folklore; we're also a Chaosium Licensee.  We produce the Arkham Gazette, a magazine for the Lovecraft Country setting for The Call of Cthulhu\u2122... and now this scenario.  More stuff to come, hopefully!\nTHE DARE's Features\nOur revised and expanded version of THE DARE includes the following features:\nGreatly expanded text (about 3 times the length of the original), updated to The Call of Cthulhu\u2122 7th Edition rules.  This includes an expanded description of the old Barnaker house, additional horrors and terrible encounters within, and advice for the Keeper in running the scenario to maximize fun.\nSuggestions for how to run the scenario for players new to the game as well as for younger players - we're including notes on how to run the scenario as if it was an R-rated movie as well as  PG-13 one for younger players.\n10 pre-generated kid-investigators.  We've set the scenario's default era to be the 1980s; it is not just a nostalgia kick (though that helps), it also serve to keep thing simple when it comes to explaining the setting while not having to worry about certain irksome modern technology.\nA simplified skill set, best suited to child investigators (and as an aid to new players).\nNew art by Ian MacLean; at a base level we will have a color cover, 6 \u00bc page black and white illustrations, and 10 investigator portraits.  One stretch goal will double the interior art to 12 pieces!\nNew and improved maps by Richard LeDuc, included in the scenario and as a separate file for your ease of printing.\nThe scenario is about 20,000 words long (including pre-generated characters) and is estimated to be about 40 pages.  Our goal is to get the scenario in your hands as quickly as possible. The text of the revised version has already been written and backers at the $10 level and above will get a PDF copy of the draft of the scenario IMMEDIATELY upon the close of this 10-day Kickstarter.  While the finished product will likely not be ready by Halloween, you should still be able to run THE DARE while eating miniature candy bars and sipping apple cider. \nI've selected stretch goals that are straightforward - no tote bags! - and won't significantly delay this project's completion.  We want to get this out in your hands are rapidly as we can. \nStretch Goals\nSpeaking of stretch goals...\n$3500 - Introduction by Kevin Ross; Kevin will write about his inspiration for THE DARE, give some background for the scenario, and perhaps suggest some instructive viewings for the Keeper before running the scenario.\n$4500 - More illustrations! More money means I can pay Ian to create even more terrifying illustrations.  The base scenario will have 6 \u00bc page illustrations plus cover and investigator portraits; if this stretch goal is reached, we will double the interior art to 12 \u00bc page images!\n$5500 - Modern Day setting notes and Investigators,  While the default era of THE DARE is the 1980s, is we reach this stretch goal we will add notes to the scenario about running it in the modern day and we will create an additional PDF of our ten child-investigators updated to the present day.  Now your kid-investigator can Instagram their terrifying demise!\n$6500 - Haunted House Scenarios in the Call of Cthulhu RPG; I will write a bibliographic essay about every \"haunted house\" scenario ever written for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, totaling about 5000 words.  More than just a list of \"haunted house\" scenarios, I'll dive into the qualities that make certain scenarios unique and, hopefully, inspirational.  Backer at $10 and higher will get a PDF of the essay.\n$7500 - 1920s setting notes and investigators.  Not interested in the 1980s or the modern day?  While not hurtle yourself back to yesteryear and play the scenario as it might have been in the 'Classic era' of Call of Cthulhu, the 1920s.\n$8250 - Archaic Secrets!  If this stretch goal is reached, all backers at \"Halloween Party Goer\" and up (aka $10+) will receive a PDF copy of Kevin Ross' original notes for the scenario.\n$9000 - 'Lovecraft's Circle' and 'Pulp creators' as investigators.  Dive into the meta-textual experience of playing as H.P. Lovecraft, his friends, and other Pulp writers/artists as children trapped in the Barnaker House!  We've found an author just mad enough to transform 10 Pulp authors and artists into kid-investigators, letting you live out your heretofore unknown dream of adventuring as Howie Lovecraft, a 'tween Clark Ashton Smith, or Miss Maggie Brundage tangling with horrors from beyond. \n**$12,000** - \"Horrors Yet to Come\".  If we reach this insane height, all backers at $20 or higher will get a preview of Kevin Ross' (as of yet untitled) sequel to THE DARE, set 30 years after the events of the scenario.  What nightmares does the future hold for THE DARE's survivors?  Timing of this reward is TBA. \nA Note About Shipping\nYou will note that none of the Print On Demand options including shipping.  This was intentional.  We have elected to leave shipping costs to POD buyers; you will get a notice that Sentinel Hill Press has provided you a copy of THE DARE via DriveThruRPG and will, at that point, pay for shipping.\nThe reasons for this are two-fold, which we hope our backers will view as beneficial.  The first is simplicity - the Kickstarter will not have to set up any differing pledge levels for other locations, or have add-on costs you need to calculate.  Most locations in the US, Canada, the UK, and EU will probably have a shipping expense of only a few dollars (my current estimate is around $4 US).  The second benefit is that by excluding these costs, you won't have to pay a premium by paying Kickstarter's fees on your shipping costs, which are roughly 10% of the money we raise. \nSo - you will pay the shipping cost of THE DARE, but you will ultimately pay less.\nImportant Licensing Note and Credits\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium, Inc. and is used with their permission.

It\u2019s also about embarking on life-changing adventures, battling supernatural horrors, and often, simply surviving life in an unforgiving world fraught with danger, where even the Nemissaries\u2019 great powers won\u2019t necessarily protect them.\nSINS RPG Stretch Goals\nSINS Distribution for the US is supported by BackerKit\n SINS is a Friendly-Shipping Project - No Duties to the US or EU.\n Sins is all at once an exciting, mysterious and terrifying game which crosses several genres, and contains a rich mythos with a great deal to explore and inspire the imagination, all whilst taking familiar genres that you know and love into creative new ground.\nA Dying World  \nSins takes place in our own world, albeit about a century from now. The world as we know it is gone, replaced with a bleak post-apocalyptic wilderness. Some areas of the world have been scorched by nuclear weapons, and others have returned to their natural state, but the one constant is that mankind is no longer the master of the world. Large nations or civilisations are rare, and most contact takes place primarily on a local level between nomadic groups and small settlements. There are exceptions however, and one of the core themes of the game is the re-emergence of civilisations.\nA Monstrous Enemy  \nA major aspect of the setting are the aforementioned Brood, which are best described as a vast horde of highly mobile animated dead who share a dim collective consciousness and have the capacity to evolve into more dangerous, specialised forms. It\u2019s a mistake to view the Brood simply as the walking dead, because as their numbers grow, they begin to hear a strange, unearthly call, which lends a frightening degree of regenerative endurance and cunning coordination to their actions.  \nForgotten Horrors \nA major part of the world\u2019s history, and one of the reasons for the dramatic fall of civilisation was the emergence of seven individual beings with almost god-like destructive capabilities and the capacity to control the Brood. These creatures, now most commonly known as the Reapers, slaughtered their way through the largest concentrations of military might, and personally took a hand in the murder of many of the world\u2019s leaders.\nAt the height of their reign of terror, their victory seemed certain, but after a succession of surprising setbacks, including the death of one of their number in China, they seemed to disappear utterly. The Reapers now represent one of many unsolved mysteries for players to potentially stumble upon.\nDark Heroes \nThe beings which players portray were originally individuals consumed by the Brood, who fought back against their Hive-mind to retain a sense of self-awareness, and as such, regained their human forms and consciousness. Striking out against the Brood, they became known as the Nemissaries, after the ancient Greek goddess of retribution.\nIn a way, the Nemissaries sum up everything about the setting. They are at once monstrous, forced to survive as parasites, feeding on human emotion, but also incredibly powerful, capable of leading the way into a new future, and even opposing the Reapers, should they re-emerge. Nemissaries have many powers at their disposal \u2013 not least of which are the five primal Songs granting control over Blood, Bone, Flesh, Will, and the Brood. Collectively, these Songs of eldritch power, along with their impressive physical abilities, allow Nemissaries to overcome almost any opposition, particularly when they choose to work together. Nemissaries have a dark side as well, however \u2013 a strange wound in their soul, perhaps a side effect from their rebirth, or the lingering power of the Brood. In any case, every Nemissary contains their own worst enemy, and greatest weapon, inside of them - The Hollow. A demonic alter-ego of everything a Nemissary hates about themselves, the Hollow is an internal monster that just wants to watch the world burn.\nThe Judges\nThe downfall of the 21st Century began with a phenomenon known as the Black Rain, where a great number of crystalline objects, most roughly the size of cars, but many much smaller, fell to Earth. These objects have now come to be known as the Shards, and represent one of the deepest mysteries of the 22nd Century. On the one hand, most of the Shards seem to repel the Brood, but on the other, they often also have a damaging effect on the human psyche, forcing people to relive the mistakes of their lives, sometimes driving them to insanity or death. Some of the Shards are also known to be more positive, offering a strange sort of oasis in the wastelands of the world, free from the Brood. It has also become common knowledge that the tiny fragments of the Shards \u2013 also known as Voidglass \u2013 are extremely damaging to the Brood. The Shards themselves are also capable of communication, often giving out cryptic advice to the Nemissaries, along with spiritual guidance, but anyone who spends prolonged time communing with one will soon begin to suspect that the Shards know far more than they are willing to tell...\nGreat Conspiracies \nWe\u2019ve mentioned that in the world of Sins, civilisation as we know it has fallen. The existence of the Nemissaries has offered new hope, but also brought about new conflicts and pain. Across the world, new powers are emerging. Some extol the nearly-forgotten virtues of Democracy and Freedom. Others are authoritarian dictatorships. Behind it all however, are the influences of the First-born \u2013 the eldest of the Nemissaries \u2013 who have begun to use their powers to build their own visions of the future. The Nemissaries themselves, along with mankind as a whole, have often fallen in with the factions these powerful individuals have woven about themselves. Their gathered followers preach their ideals and cooperate with one another, rebuilding human civilisation but also setting the stage for the horrifying conflicts to come.\nHope and Despair\nThe world of SINS is bleak, and even considering everything we\u2019ve just mentioned, it gets worse. The Brood is not defeated, the factions of the Nemissaries are at each other's throats, and the Reapers are still out there somewhere, licking their wounds. Worse still, powers long asleep have begun to take an interest in the mortal world for the first time in millennia.\nThe truth is though, is that SINS is really about hope. The characters you play, for the most part, are those individuals who want to change the world for the better. They are people who aren\u2019t content to let their loved ones die, or to be the pawns of mad gods. \nThey mean to make the world a better place, or die in the attempt. This is the choice each player will make \u2013 the choice each character must make \u2013 to stand and fight when the dawn seems furthest, or to just be one more collaborator in mankind\u2019s demise. \nCaught Your Interest?\nGreat! This is a 357 page, full colour, Core Rulebook, complete with everything needed to play and stunning artwork throughout, all by Will Kirkby (Grenade, Wraithking, Tuk Tuk,and featured in Image Comics, Oni Press, and the upcoming Critical Role Artbook)\nOur plans are for at least another 3 further major expansions which will be released over the next 3 years, along with smaller, intermittent supplements supporting the game's longevity and an active social media presence that provides weekly lore updates and free, supplemental scenarios and game prompts.\nIn other words, once SINS is out, we'll constantly have new content for players to explore - handy for those busy weeks where the GM might not have had time to prepare!\nSINS runs on its own unique engine, the HOPE engine, based on Degrees of Success from small, attribute-based D6 dice pools that average 7 die and never exceed 10 die, even at the top levels of play.\nPlayers gain Successes determined by Skill Ratings, and compare their results against target numbers to gauge if they've scored a Success or not.\nThe GM sets the amount of Successes required to pass an Action, and any more Successes than required become outcome, a unique system that allows for epic, cinematic and co-operative actions. \n\nThe game boasts over 100 unique powers, known as Arietta, and over 75 Skills, Traits and Qualities with which to affect both mechanics and narrative, supported in play with an easy to read, single-page character sheet.\nAnother integral part of the SINS system is the lack of a conventional levelling system. Instead, characters take narrative-based paths towards their goals with Motivations, and as they work towards them, they gain Achievement Points. These in turn can be used to mechanically increase a character's stats, skills and abilities in the more traditional sense.\nCharacters can also call on Motivations they believe to be important to the Session or events in play, and receive appropriated bonuses as a result. We believe this integral combination of narrative and mechanics right at the heart of the system is the perfect balance of progression and achievement, and defines SINS as a truly narrative-driven roleplaying game.\n The SINS system, and in turn the HOPE engine, have now been play-tested by hundreds, including both private groups with varied experience levels, and by open display groups at the 2017 UK Games expo, each to overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n As with any Kickstarter, the amount you choose to pledge will reflect the products and extras you receive. As both avid Kickstarter backers and Roleplayers ourselves, we understand that too much choice and not enough budget can be overwhelming! To that end, we're keeping our tiers simple, affordable - and we believe - worth every cent & penny pledged.\n\nWe also offer a tailored pledge tier exclusively for Brick & Mortar store owners and independent retailers looking to stock SINS, allowing us to bring the game to as wide of an audience as possible, all whilst supporting the local gaming stores that make this RPGs and the tabletop industry possible.\nThe world as we know it is gone, and the undying horde are countless.

It was bounced around amid all the other creative ideas he keeps in there for long enough for it to grow to maturity. From time to time he would bring it out to the table to play in one form or another and then put it back and let it grow some more.  \n It might have stayed a hidden from the world at large if not for a post-game conversation with his local game store owner that moved onto the topic of how there was now enough of SINS in Miquel\u2019s head to fill a book. It\u2019s a little known secret that games store owners are generally very enthusiastic about games and are often very good at sharing that enthusiasm.  \nSome enthusiasm for the idea became the encouragement to take things a step further. And the project to make SINS - the RPG began. One of the really nice things about this book and this project as a whole is the way the game was developed and refined through a network of eager and talented people that all frequent that very same games store. In fact everything from play-testing to proof reading, artwork to layout was done by people, amateur enthusiasts and professionals both - from that very same gaming community. Even the making and printing of the GM Screens has been done by a printer that is a regular to our local gaming store!\nAnother little known secret about games store owners is that they can be very, very patient people and even though this project has been in development for almost 5 years now, with a lot of ups and downs and some major shifts in both the industry and the RPG market, there has always been members of the team carrying the torch and keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel.\nSINS, like many tabletop RPGs, began life as a simple collection of ideas around a kitchen table many years ago. Since then, it has grown into a fully fledged book, and proof-read copies have graced many darkened kitchen tables and game rooms up and down the UK in the last few years. After all this time of tweaking and revision, we believe now is the time to bring the franchise into the wider market, and utilise this Kickstarter to establish ourselves as a small start-up team with a wealth of ideas just waiting to be realised.\nUltimately, we're really all just about having great games with friends. \nSINSwas born from that very act.  \nIt is the sum of a lot of influences poured into a great big melting-pot and stirred thoroughly with the spoon of enthusiasm and left to simmer until it was good and ready. Back in 2014 when we showed SINS to some people over at Chronicle City one of them said of it;\n\u201cit wears its influences on its sleeve\u201d and we believe that it truly does just that.  \n At its heart, Sins is a game that pays influential tributes to lots of things that we love, and all of it served up with a little of our own seasoning.  \nWe hope you get to enjoy it as much as we have.\n- The SINS Team\nAll this looks pretty complete... Why Kickstarter? \nOur Ultimate Goal - is simply to get a book that we love out there and available to gaming groups and to as many people as possible, and we believe that Kickstarter is the best medium to do this as the SINS Project establishes itself in the industry.\nAlongside that, we also value the support of 'Brick and Mortar' stores, who we recognise as being integral in the growth of any roleplaying product and vital to the communal spread of tabletop games. Through Kickstarter's tiered pledge system, we can offer Brick and Mortar stores varying degrees of support for our game in a way that benefits both us, them, and most importantly, players! \nStores that back our Retailer pledge - will be provided with unique covers, rewards and accessories directly from us, providing the much-needed extra support that allow stores to demo and run games without eating into their profits.\nSINS is hoped to be the first of many high-quality tabletop games in our planned repertoire that interact and evolve alongside both their playerbase and the commercial market, and if our feedback from the UK Games Expo is anything to go by, we believe it demonstrates our ability to deliver premium, professional-standard games straight from humble beginnings, all whilst doing service to the local gaming stores that made this project possible in the first place.\n\nI'm really into all this, where are all the stretch goal goodies & accessories?\nWe could, can, and have created a whole bunch!\nAnd these are only proofs, with a whole lot more planned and in development to support our game. \nBut the truth to their availability is that we believe the livelihood of a game is in the quality, and the availability, of its core rulebook - and how many people can get to enjoy it. There's nothing worse than hearing about a cool Kickstarter RPG, only to find out their initial print-run is over and that you have to wait to get to play it...\nTo that end, we're only focusing on getting out core rulebooks - as soon as we possibly can. They're finished, so there's no reason not to!\n\nThe more orders we receive for the core rulebook, the quicker you and your players can get it to your gaming table.  No fuss, no frills, and certainly no delays or waiting around on accessories and extras yet to come. Simply a complete, finished corebook that you and your gaming group can enjoy as soon as possible. If we can deliver that, we can launch a fully-fledged webstore with all of our books, accessories and future releases available at affordable prices, forever.\nSINS RPG Confirmed Accessories\nThese accessories will be available as add-ons, along with additional copies of the book through the BackerKit checkout.\nSINS RPG Prophecy Cover\nSINS RPG Voidglass Cover\n            LINKS: TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | SPOTIFY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone!

But if you really want one we will do one. But if you are not fussed here's a summary: You play a member of an Elite Special Forces Unit sent to sort out Drug Cartels, Crime Lord, Terrorist Cells and Warlords. Travelling from jungles to deserts, arctic regions to urban sprawls.\nRules for K9 companions that improve as you do. \nRules for Squad Actions (coordinated takedowns etc). \nReal world settings. \nModern and future tech weapons and gear.\n Assault from boats, planes or vehicles. \nIf you like Tom Clancy and computer games like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell this is the Tabletop RPG for you.\n Ghost Ops is a Tabletop RPG based in the world of Military Special Operations. You will be part of a Black Ops team made up of international Elite Special Forces Operatives sent out to the worst trouble hotspots in the world. The game will cover Eastern European crime organisations, South American Drug Cartels. International Terrorist cells and African warlords to name just a few. In one mission you could be assaulting a Tanker in the Indian ocean the next be in the Jungles of the Congo taking down Guerilla forces.  \nThe game is designed to not only deal with oneshot missions where you and your squad get airdropped in the heart of the action but also campaigns in which you may need to take down a corrupt government or infiltrate a Terror group. We will even include rules for skirmish missions where you can dig out those miniatures and battle against a friend.  \nIf you love computer games like Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon and Call of Duty then this is the Tabletop Game you have been waiting for to immerse you in the world of Special Operations. Join the official Facebook group here and our official G+ Group here\n  The Game itself will come in two flavours Original and Savage Worlds.\nBoth will have a detailed background system where you choose the Special Forces unit you trained and worked with before becoming a member of Ghost Ops. Both will include rules for vehicles and also K9 companions, yes you will be able to have a secondary character of a trained Spec Ops dog, who will level up and learn like you do.  \nThe Original - The Original ruleset is the one we started building a year ago and have been playtesting for 6 months, it is based around the Fate Dice used in the Fate System, but it is not Fate. We use a system of busts and boosts to determine the difficulty of tasks as well as difficulties based on range and other circumstances.  \nThe Original also has a wound system that adds modifiers to rolls and a unique system of breaks that allow you to re-roll dice but each time you use one the GM gains a break for themselves.  \nThe original is a fast, cool system that utilises the Fate Dice perfectly allowing you to really get the sense of tension and drama in every mission.\n Savage Worlds - The Savage Worlds version will include unique Edges and Hindrances and also new Squad Edges that the whole team benefits from as they grow and work together. Players will choose which international Special Forces unit they came from and gain unique benefits from those. They will then choose their Archetypes, from Assault, to Recon and Specialist and so forth.  \nThe Savage Worlds book will also have rules for taking your characters into Showdown the Savage Worlds Skirmish rules, vehicle rules and also K9 companions.  \nWe have not gone with the two book option that many Savage World settings do, instead this will be a huge 150 -200 page book with everything you need to play and GM the game, no spending extra.\n The game will be designed by members of the FGDystopia team, some of whom just finished work on Shelter. We have a great artist and some great writers working to bring the game to life, the rules are mainly done and we have to just clean them up and start work on the backgrounds.  \nMost of the art will be done by Coty Polk who designed the image below.\n With larger environment images by Russell Goh.  \nThe Savage Worlds and the Fate Dice books will be written & designed by Ian F. White and Jay along with a few of our playtesters getting their ideas thrown in.  \nWe also have some more great writers involved like Darren Pearce, August Hahn, Jody J. A. Cummings, Christian Nommay, Alan Bahr and Brandon Williams who will be creating adventures and sourcebooks for the game.  \nWe even have a military advisor to help us at least stick to a bit of realism, though the game will verge on the cutting edge fiction of Tom Clancy more.\n  We have a whole bunch of Stretch Goals planned and we will unleash them as and when we need them.   \nCurrent Value of the Stretch Goals = $180 \n\u00a34000 - Mission Pack 1 - Unlocked - PDF\nMission Pack 1 includes 5 adventures designed by some great writers, each adventure can be used for both Savage Worlds and the Original rule system.  \n'My Brother's Keeper' by August Hahn: One of the Team has gone missing and you have 24 hrs to find them.  \nRed on Red by Jody J.

Basic information gathering. Something kids fresh off The Farm could have handled and not screwed up. Yet here you are, on the run, security services trying to hunt you and your team down, local news painting you as terrorists and saboteurs. Things have officially gone FUBAR. You're in a safe house for the moment, but you're not sure how safe it really is. The last message from HQ wasn't encouraging. A single word: \"CAUTERY\" and the number 48 after it. It's the one scenario no operator likes to consider: one of your own has betrayed you, sold you out to the opposition. And you're up against the clock. You have 48 hours to figure out which of your comrades turned on you and eliminate them. If you can't, then things move from \"cautery\" to \"amputation.\"  \nRansom or Revenge by Jeramy Terry - A Big Oil exec is living in Angola Africa, his Wife and teenager are being held hostage with Ransom demands.

They have attempted to unlock the dormant part of the brain which can do incredible things, perform superhuman, or supernatural feats akin to magic. In 1960 there were experiments that involved remote viewing in Russia, of course the West, not to be outdone activated numerous projects in response \u2014 one of those was called Project Parallel and produced a modicum of success, using prisoners who were transferred from death row and subjected to terrible dark experiments they managed to create highly unstable individuals who could hurl objects around a room. Unfortunately they were all psychotic and many of them had to be terminated. The project was shut down by the lead when a Psi-enhanced soldier ran amok in the installation and turned it into a charnel house.  \nIn 1981, led by Duncan Bright, the Bright Corporation found the old notes of Project Parallel and reactivated the program using cutting-edge science and artifacts rumoured to be pulled from the very depths of Hell itself. No one believed this of course, it was too preposterous for the average mind to comprehend. Duncan knew the truth and Project Lucifer was born that day. The goal, create a special force of men and women who could use psychic and supernatural powers to control the battlefield of the future. Operating from a remote base somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, Bright\u2019s new project was highly successful and soon they began to train soldiers in psychokinesis, telekinesis, mental combat and more.  \nDuncan had opened a door to a new world, a brave one, and a dangerous one.  \nBecause some doors that are opened can never be closed.  \nWhen Duncan died in 1994 the new CO of Project Lucifer, Madeline Cross took over and she took the project to new heights. The daughter of a Project Lucifer soldier, she had been born with incredible powers. Madeline began to push Lucifer\u2019s research into new directions, taking the company toward a PMC (Private Military Contractor) and offering her psychic soldiers to the highest bidder.  \nYou\u2019ll join the cadre of soldiers who have to face down what Project Lucifer has unleashed, fighting the supernatural with your grit, guns and wit. Facing down the soldiers of Madeline Cross who have been corrupted by terrible powers and may have been possessed by demons or worse. \nWelcome to Project Lucifer, Soldier, next stop: Madness!\n\u00a39000 - Mission Pack 3 - Unlocked - PDF\nCarrying on from Project Lucifer Mission Pack 3 includes 2 One sheets and 3 Adventures set in the world of horror and Psychic soldiers.

The player characters are \"Storm Knights,\" heroes from all the cosms who fight against the High Lords. They use magic, technology, miracles, and even super powers against the Reality Raiders and their endless minions.\nThe Storm Knights are agents of the \"Delphi Council,\" an international organization led by Quinn Sebastian to counter the High Lords and their many forces.\nJoin the fight and you can play a....\n...monster hunter from Orrorsh armed with alchemical creations, magical medals, or a \"Slayer's Gun\" loaded with various bullets carved with cryptic runes...\n...heretical cyberwitch, valiant priest, or resistance fighter decked out with stolen cyberware, battling the Anti-Pope in the technologically oppressive world of the Cyberpapacy...\n...knight, wizard, or elf of Aysle, including the fantastic dwarven \"Dragon Warriors\" who wear armor forged with amazing enhancements and steam-powered devices of doom...\n...hard-boiled hero of Pan-Pacifica or an \"Electric Samurai\" armed with high-tech \"Ion Gusoko\" armor and ion-charged katana...\n...psychic survivor or irradiated scavenger of Tharkold, using Occultech against the cruel demon masters who once enslaved you...\n...savage human of the Living Land accompanied by a saber-toothed cat, or a mystical edeinos who can call on the miracles of a fierce and powerful goddess whose interventions are very real...\n...pulp hero of the Nile Empire, racing through the skies with a rocket pack or firing your ray gun at the dastardly shocktroops of Pharoah Mobius...\n...stalwart Core Earther, a realm runner who can negate your enemies' powers or summon phenomenal reality storms to strip foes of their very Possibility Energy!\nAnd so much more!\nCharacters of each realm choose from different \"Perk\" sets generally only available to certain realities. Every character stands out and is just as valuable as any other. Edeinos of the Living Land might have Death Claws, Star Eyes, or Whip Tails, for example, while heroes of Pan-Pacifica can call on Ki Powers such as Unflinching or Focused Strike.\nCheck out our updates for more previews of Perks and how they'll help YOUR Storm Knight resist the High Lords!\n    Shane, Clint, Jodi, and Darrell playtesting.\nD20s and Bonus Dice\nAs with the original Torg, the central mechanic of Torg Eternity is a d20 roll on a \"Bonus Chart.\" Rolls of 10s and 20s \"explode,\" allowing another die to be rolled and added to get a result. Something new for Torg Eternity is that a high enough number on an attack generates extra damage from 6-sided \"Bonus Die.\"\nRolling a 10 or 20 on the d20 causes it to \"explode,\" adding to the total! The infinity symbol on the six-sided Bonus Die adds +5 to your damage and allows you to roll again!\nPossibilities\nStorm Knights (and some villains!) have a resource called Possibilities they can spend to roll extra dice or absorb incoming damage, allowing them to bend reality to their will. More Possibilities can be earned by playing roleplaying, achieving objectives, or playing the all-new Cosm cards (see below!).\n  The Drama Deck\nInitiative is controlled with the Drama Deck. Each card features a Conflict Line that grants benefits or hindrances to either side as the tide of battle ebbs and flows.\nPlayers also have a hand of Destiny cards that help them pull off spectacular maneuvers or add new elements to the game.\nCosm cards are a new addition that help reinforce the World Laws and sometimes grant Possibilities or other advantages--though often with consequences!\n    If you want more detail, watch our Let's Play!\n  If you're a fan of the original Torg like we are, you're probably wondering exactly what's changed. We stayed true to the spirit of both the setting and the rules, but this is a new edition from the ground up so there are definitely some big ideas in this gorgeous, full-color book.\nHere are a few highlights:\nPerks are a system for buying and balancing all those awesome special abilities characters have!\nCharacters from cosms like Core Earth now get their due, with unique Perk sets for everyone! Medals, Occultism, and Alchemy for Orrosh! Electric samurai in Pan-Pacifica! Cyber witches in the Cyberpapacy! Outsiders for Aysle!\nTharkold--right from the start!\nStreamlined reality rules that make some of the strange edge cases a little more clear!\nEdeinos are MUCH more savage and frightening!\nDamage is simpler and doesn't need a chart. The change also fixes the \"glass jaw\" problem!\nInteraction results are much simpler, with no chart needed!\nEvery cosm got an overhaul from the ground up, updating those that were out of date given the 30 years that have passed since the original game was released, refocusing some that had gone a little astray as the original game grew, and generally making each realm tougher! We had the luxury of all the development the original team did on the original cosms, so we consolidated some of the most beloved material and worked it in right from the start. \nCore Earth characters are now as awesome as those from all the other cosms. They own the Reality Perk set!\n  We have two special Pledge Levels for this Kickstarter, the Delphi Council Cargo Box and the Seat on the Delphi Council pledge!\nBoth these pledge levels get the Delphi Council Cargo Box, a sturdy, custom box designed to hold all your Torg accessories, and it comes with EVERYTHING listed below...and more!\nTorg Eternity Rule Book (Hardcover + PDF)\nGM Screen and 16 Character Archetypes (Print + PDF)\nDelphi Council Cargo Box - (Print, see text)\nDrama Deck (Print + PDF)\nDice Pack (Physical)\nStatus, Shock, and Wound Counters (Print + PDF)\n20 Possibilities (High Quality Poker Chips with unique art, Physical)\nPoster Map of the Possibility Wars (Print + PDF)\nA \"tear off\" pad of full-color character sheets (Print)\nALL Original Torg books!

This can be you, your favorite character, a character you made up, or even a friend or relative you want to honor (with their permission). \nWe'll write up a brief description of them in the CORE rule book (the space is already reserved!), and commission a high-resolution illustration from our best artists you can print and frame.\nNOTE! By pledging for this reward you give us permission to become the copyright holder of the character. We'll be able to use them in our stories to deliver missions to Storm Knights in various parts of the world, involve them in fiction, plots, and other intrigue, and they might even make the ultimate sacrifice.

You don't even start as Storm Knights... but you might have your \"Moment of Crisis\" if you prove yourself worthy!\nDesigner's Note: The original Torg had several \"person on the street\" interviews that gave some insight into what it was like to be a normal individual in the world of Torg on the day of the invasion.

These cards are the player's best friend, allowing them to play cards such as Action that adds to their skill tests, Romance that helps them strike up an amorous relationship (and gain Possibilities!), or Seize Initiative to change the Drama Deck when things are bad. And so much more!\nTorg Eternity also introduces Cosm cards, which reinforce the tropes and World Laws of each cosm and grant the heroes an advantage of some sort, though often at a price!

The dice pack also includes additional \"tracker\" cards you can use to track your rerolls.\nDice Pack: Add $10 to your pledge for each additional pack of two d20s, two Bonus Dice, and tracker cards.\nPossibility Chips\nPlayers in Torg Eternity use \"Possibilities\" to affect their die rolls and soak damage.

This allows us to assure that we are US, EU, and Australia-friendly. We also have a partner in Hong Kong (VFI Asia), which means many locations in Asia and the Pacific Rim are cheaper, though not all customs for those countries may be covered.\nOther locations will be more expensive based on how difficult it is to ship from those four centers.

P. Lovecraft.\nThrough investigation, puzzle solving, time travel, knowledge of the Mythos, situational music, timed events and horrible scenes, the players will experience an interactive and unique scenario\u2014an epic mini-campaign playable in one (long!) gaming night.\nThe setting is London 1927, though the investigators will soon discover the need to dig deeper into England's occult past. The scenario may be played as a standalone event or incorporated into an ongoing campaign\u2014preferably its end, as the very world itself may collapse should the investigators fail.\nPuzzle solving: The players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear, but do they have the skills to fit them all together and complete the sigil before the world ends\u2026?\nSituational music: At three key events during the scenario, music plays an important role. Three specific soundtracks heighten the mood and accompany the situation, as well as function as a time limit for the investigators to complete certain tasks. The soundtracks are not provided with this Kickstarter but are easily found on any musical service like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play or YouTube.\nKnowledge of the Mythos: As stated, this is a scenario meant for experienced players. They need to have some scenarios under their belt, as well as some basic knowledge of the Mythos. If they have never heard of R'lyeh before, then this scenario is not for them. Yet.\nCultural knowledge: The players will meet famous and historical persons of the time. They will also dig into England's past to uncover some horrible truths. Any real knowledge of persons like Christopher Wren, Aleister Crowley or a certain J. R. R. Tolkien could prove useful. Though such knowledge is not necessary, it could prove to tip the scale towards saving or ending the world...\nEpic: From a small and seemingly irrelevant situation, the players will soon find themselves facing the horrors of great Cthulhu himself. As they discover more and more of the past and its shocking implications though puzzle solving and investigation, they will soon feel the burden of humanity's future on their shoulders. They have never, and will never again, be this close to total destruction.\nPlaying time: Initial playtesting of the raw material suggests a play time of about six hours. This could easily be expanded, as the scenario will come with optional false leads and expanded situations to suit your needs. This versatility may easily expand the scenario into a mini-campaign.\nTwo endings: In the very last moments of the scenario, it becomes up to the GM to decide how it ends. The \u201cnormal\u201d ending will (hopefully) result in the players as victorious against the dark powers\u2014this is a satisfying option for the players since they have fought hard with brains and skills to achieve their goal; huzzah! The \u201cother\u201d option is something completely different; this is an ending that will turn upside down everything the players have found out and believed throughout the scenario. This is an option that will leave their jaws dropping and produce \u201cI did not see that coming!\u201d reactions. It\u2019s your choice. You're the GM.\nAction-oriented or not?: Some players (or GMs) may want to solve some situations using muscles & guns, though this scenario is meant to be completed without firing a single shot. For those players (or GMs) an \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) is included where relevant.\nSkill use: The purpose of the scenario is to create a special atmosphere where the Mythos feels eerily alive everywhere. As such, rules and skills are less emphasized so as not to \u201cdisturb\u201d this purpose. The scenario may be played almost exclusively using the character's knowledge and ideas; only a few skill rolls are necessary. So how does it work? Let's say you find a strange book entitled The Book of Eibon. You are not meant to do a skill roll to discover what this book is; you're supposed to have heard about it before, both as a player and character. And if you stumble upon a lot of clues in a pile, you're not supposed to roll a Search, Luck or Library Use to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d clue; you're supposed to use your own wits and investigation throughout the scenario to figure out which are the correct ones. The use of skill rolls will be needed from time to time, but only to give alternative approaches to different situations, and never to interfere with the atmosphere.\nContent: In many RPG scenarios, there exists an elaborate description of the NPCs, their history, their minds, plans, surroundings... You will not find much of that in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d We've read too many scenarios where the relevant information is somewhat \u201chidden\u201d in too much description. Don\u2019t get us wrong; it's entertaining to read about the family background, accent, tattoo and shoe size of the local bartender, but if his only appearance is when he gives the investigator a letter, that info is not very relevant for the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d tells you what you need to know; the rest is up to you.\nMature content: What stands the Lovecraftian world apart from many other themes is the atmosphere of fear and horror; if played well, both for the investigators and the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d follows this pattern; the fear is always lingering, but the \u201chorror level\u201d may be adjusted to your taste. The scenario may be enjoyed fully without a single drop of blood spilled, or you may choose to adjust some scenes to incorporate the ultimate horror targeting both your character and your own sanity. As such, it could potentially resemble the \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) mentioned above. Call it AHA if you'd like (please don't).\nFact and fiction: The scenario combines the real world with the Mythos. The characters you meet and their story/surroundings are mostly historically correct, mixed with the occasional Mythos element. A complete Fact & Fiction section at the end of the scenario keeps you up to date, but is yours to bend to your own will...\nQuality: This is in a full-color page layout in US letter format! This scenario is a delight both to read and play.\nAbout the creators\nJarle Haktorson is the writer behind \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d. He bought his first CoC rulebook (5th ed) back in 1993 and was intrigued. This was totally different from his former RPG experiences playing mostly AD&D (2nd ed). During his later studies, he realized he fit the classic CoC investigator, as he studied Latin, Greek, Coptic, history, religion, etc. It also helped that he worked in a mental institution during his studies, and so understood how sanity really works (and doesn\u2019t work). He is currently the general manager of the Epix Haven gaming company (www.facebook.com/epixhaven), the leader of the local gaming club, and plays board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s, slaying kobolds in D&D. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. Even is in the creative advertising market, and has done all the layouts, book binding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign. Even is a gamer and a dreamer, and one of his dreams is this game.\nJoseph Diaz has created the heart of this scenario with his superior illustrations. He has previously worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Never has Cthulhu himself felt so threatening or near as in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d is the first such idea made a reality.\nWith help from you, this scenario could become even greater.\nNOK 18.000 (about US/EUR 2000): Scenario map over London\nThe players will travel around London gathering clues, slowly understanding the graveness of their search. This period-accurate map will help both the GM and the players better navigate the world; there is one version for the players and another for the GM.\nNOK 27.000 (about US/EURO 3000): More artwork and quality upgrades for clues\nMost of the cost creating this scenario is related to the artwork. We wanted more, but couldn't risk this project not become a reality. This stretch goal will add more artwork to the scenario and upgrade all the clues, making the horrors come even more alive.\nNOK 45.000 (about USD/EUR 5000): Custom-made soundtrack!\nYou read it right! Unlocking this goal enables us to create a custom-made soundtrack for the scenario! It will be available for ALL backers through download!\nNOK 63.000 (about US/EUR 7000): Art book\nA FREE art book to ALL backers containing all the sketches, images, clues, etc. used in the scenario, complete with discussions, \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d etc. Sent as PDF via DriveThruRPG.\nNOK 90.000 (about US/EUR 10.000): Physical puzzle option\nThe players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear. This stretch goal will give backers an option to receive a physical puzzle as an add-on. More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 135.000 (about US/EUR 15.000): Another scenario!\nThe world may be saved from destruction this time, but what about the next\u2026?! This Stretch Goal will provide a completely new FREE scenario to all backers! More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 200.000 (about US/EUR 22.000): \u201cCan we make it?!\u201d\nMore on this as the campaign progresses.\nFAQ\nWhat game system works with this scenario?\nThe short version: any (see the \u201cSkill use\u201d section above). Skill rolls play a minor part of the scenario. Where deemed necessary, a percentage system is used, like those found in CoC. It is easily modified to suit any system you'd like. We would also like to mention \"Cthulhu Dark\" by Graham Walmsley, as this is a rules-light system created to play Lovecraftian horror at its most intense.\nMust the scenario be set in exactly 1927?\nNo, you could tweak it some +/- five years or so if you'd like. Some historical characters need to be adjusted somewhat though; the scenario includes relevant information on how to do this.\nWhat does the title actually mean?\nIt's Latin for \u201cThe Cthulian Peace.\u201d You do not want that to occur and neither do the investigators, so help them out!\nIs this a production licensed by Chaosium?\nNo, and we are very aware of that. Hence, we only use our own illustrations and ideas, finding inspiration in H. P. Lovecraft's work available in the Public Domain. We do not use material (signs, symbols, characters, spells, etc.) owned by Chaosium. This scenario is a homage to Lovecraft's dark world.\nHow do you send the PDF files?\nWhen the campaign is finished and the scenario is ready to play, you'll receive an e-mail; this will include a link for your free download of \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d at DriveThruRPG, the largest RPG download store.\nWhat does \u201cPOD\u201d means?\nIt means \u201cPrint on Demand,\u201d so if you pledged for the PDF version only, but decide to have a soft-cover version later, you may POD; that means that DriveThruRPG will print and ship a soft-cover version to you. You will need to cover those costs, though (they are included in Reward #2).\nMay I choose any name/picture in the story?\n(Concerning Reward # 4-5)\nWell, we do not know you personally, so you're free to supply us with the name and picture you want\u2014who are we to judge what people are called or how they look? :) We would hesitate though to supply names like Biggus Dikkus or provide photos of a badger (apologies to all people who look like a badger). Your name will of course also be mentioned in the credits!\nMay I provide any idea for the story?\n(Concerning Reward #6)\nYes, by and large, you may. This scenario is designed using unique storytelling techniques, but the main story may be altered along the way should the right ideas come up. This reward is also the only option to be given the story beforehand\u2014you'll need this knowledge to be able to think out and discuss your ideas with me. Your name will, of course, be mentioned in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPax Cthuliana is currently in a developing stage.

His temples bulged, and his eyes were bloodshot with concentration as he ranted. \"Take one step toward me, and I will obliterate you with my mind!\u201d  \nHalo kept her martial stance, her eyes never leaving the rat\u2019s. \u201cThen do so,\u201d Halo said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d The rat didn\u2019t seem to have anticipated this.  \n\u201cDestroy me,\u201d Halo pressed. \u201cWith your mind. Go ahead, magician.\u201d\n\u201cI am no magician!\u201d the rat screeched. \u201cI am a scientist! I have studied the ancient records of the Old Ones, and I know the true power of the universe! I have mastered 47 of the 100 Theories!\u201d During his tirade, the rat\u2019s bulbous eyes began to water, and he finally did what Halo was waiting for.  \nHe blinked.  \nWhen the rat opened his eyes a fraction of a second later, Halo had leapt into the air. Her foot glowed with a blue aura as she kicked him in the snout. The pain was intense, and the rat could feel his fur and flesh becoming bitterly cold as the blue energy enveloped him. He tried to speak, to unleash his mental attack, but he couldn\u2019t move. The ice cracked and popped as his eyes froze solid. \nHalo nodded in satisfaction as the frozen rat fell over the side of the roof, and turned away from her opponent. She needed tell the Ruling Council that the cult of Labo Tor had infiltrated the monarchy of Korat.\n  \"Welcome once again to a world of fantasy adventure in the ancient future.

It\u2019s a complete tabletop roleplaying game that acts as a companion game to, and is totally compatible with, my first RPG, Pugmire. The Monarchies of Mau is a nation of cats tenuously comprised of six city-states.\"\n  \"Anyway, they live in the ashes of our world far in the future, seeking danger and mystery. Think Three Musketeers meets Planet of the Apes, but with cats.\"\n\"These cats have been uplifted to use technology and language. Some cats acquire the remnants of human technology, believing them to be literal gifts of magic from ancient, god-like servants. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using the Precepts of Mau agreed to in the heat of a terrible war.\"\n    \"Enemies of Mau can either be monstrous, like demon-possessed zombies, or simply other misunderstood people, such as the dogs of Pugmire.\"\n\"The world is dangerous and mysterious, but the instincts of a good cat will always be true.\"\n      \"My company, Pugsteady, is working with Rich Thomas at Onyx Path Publishing to expand on our Monarchies of Mau Early Access version (see below).\n\"We\u2019re running this Kickstarter so we can make the best version of Monarchies of Mau that we can, adding more art and writing to make this a complete and amazing product. If funded, we will produce a full-color 7 x 10 hardcover book (about the size of a graphic novel), with around 200+ pages.\n\"One of the highlights of the Monarchies of Mau game include this evocative, mysterious, and family-friendly setting, presented from the perspective of iconic characters like Blayze and Sabian here.\"\n  \"Monarchies of Mau uses a customized version of the 5th Edition rules from the world's most popular fantasy RPG. It's been redesigned for streamlined play, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. Creating heroic and cunning cats is easy, and there are a variety of callings and noble houses that give focus to a cat\u2019s role in society and in the adventuring party. To help you with your decision, I\u2019m providing a copy of Monarchies of Mau Early Access. It\u2019s a playable version of Monarchies of Mau that has over a third of the material you can expect in the final book.\nMonarchies of Mau is totally compatible with Pugmire and uses the same rules system.

We love retailers, but we know that modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores.

This knowledge has been applied to Onyx Path's partnership with Pugsteady as well as the FAQ below:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: Monarchies of Mau isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped fifteen Kickstarter projects, Pugmire is being printed, and several more KS projects are headed to completion as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The Early Access PDF is finished and playable and we will be expanding that into the full book\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Monarchies of Mau.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges. Both methods allow us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. Because of Kickstarter adding the option to their tools, we are able to be more specific as to shipping costs based on your country. These costs will be added to your pledge automatically by KS if you are outside the US. As always, local or VAT style taxes will need to be paid by the backer when appropriate and are not included in these costs.\n\nRisk: The project will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for several of our last KS projects several months before the estimate, and recent Kickstarters started shipping in the month or the month before we estimated.
