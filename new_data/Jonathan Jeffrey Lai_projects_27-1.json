[{"backer": "Jonathan Jeffrey Lai", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Alpha and Omega Playing Cards are 3 decks of fully custom, hand-drawn, poker-size playing cards beautifully depicting some of the most significant periods of Church history in useful game pieces. Each deck in the series covers a different time: the Early Church, the Protestant Reformation and the Great Awakening.\nEach deck in the Alpha & Omega series faithfully captures a different period in Church history. You will meet heroes and villains of the early church, Protestant Reformation and Great Awakening as you play your way through these beautiful decks.\nWe believe that relationships are one of the most important parts of life, and it\u2019s our goal to create products that help people unplug and connect with each other without screens.\nOur vision is to redesign the centuries-old humble deck of playing cards into something that people would not only want to enjoy together, but could also be used as a tool to educate and start conversations. We want to create a resource that will be used, that can be gifted and can be displayed as a starting point to faith conversations.\nGood question:\n Biblical themes are a deeply rooted part of our history and cultural fabric. Creating a fantastic deck of cards around this gives an artistic and tangible resource to the faith of millions of Christians around the world.\nPlaying cards are a small, universal and effective way to promote real-life relationships over a game. We wanted to use the illustrations to start meaningful conversations which could change lives.\nWe wanted to make a really good deck of Bible cards - none of this cheesy clipart-Jesus slapped on a standard deck nonsense. Something that Christians would be proud to display in their homes or gift to others.\nAs an MDiv with 10+ years of ministry and church leadership experience, our founder Ben wanted to bring his love of Christianity and cards together in a practical, respectful and engaging project.\nBy necessity we couldn't fit all of church history into this project. We approached this from a Protestant perspective, which dictated which periods we covered in these decks.\n If you play card games, you need cards. Don\u2019t keep using your grandma\u2019s beat-up old deck; upgrade your games night with a truly premium deck.\nIf you are interested in history, the accurate details in each of the cards will be of great interest to you.\nThese cards make a unique game piece or gift for anyone interested in Christianity or playing cards.\n Youth groups, Bible studies, small groups and home gatherings will get a lot of use out of these playing games.\n Playing card collectors, cardists and magicians will love the intricate designs, premium materials and special features.\nThis is a deck that everyone can enjoy.\nEach design in the Alpha & Omega series has been hand-illustrated from the ground up in authentic wood-cut style to faithfully represent significant people during these important periods of Church history.\n\nThe rewards cover any combination of decks, with the greatest discounts available for the bundle options (a mix of all 3 decks in different quantities). However, if you only want 1 or 2 of the designs, you can do that too!\n\n Printed by UNITED STATES PLAYING CARD COMPANY on PREMIUM BEE STOCK \nFaces and Back designs - LUXURIOUS GOLD METALLIC INKS \nSize - STANDARD POKER SIZE \nArtwork - 100% CUSTOM COURT CARDS, ACES, JOKERS AND BACKS \nTuck Cases - PREMIUM SOFT TOUCH PAPER WITH INTRICATE FOIL & EMBOSSING \nAll tuckboxes come with intricate embossed foil throughout; creating a clean yet elegant display for the cards within.\nThe Alpha & Omega decks will be printed with luxurious gold metallic inks on the card faces and backs. These inks give the cards a dull golden shine and look incredible when they catch the light.\nThe small dimples in the card stock traps little pockets of air between the cards, allowing for smooth shuffling, dealing and handling. This premium finish will ensure that your cards feel fantastic from the moment you take them out of the box.\nWhile not immediately obvious, the cards are embedded with subtle details which embellish the story behind them.\nFor example, Martin Luther (Reformation deck) is depicted on one side of the card nailing his era-defining 95 Thesis to the door of the church in Wittenberg, while on the other side he is confined to Wartburg Castle to escape the Catholic Church; a scene complete with the ink stain from his encounter with the devil.\nAnother example: Felicity and Perpetua (Early Church deck) were two 3rd Century women who were captured and martyred together in the Roman military games. They are depicted holding hands while their executioners draw near behind them.\nSee what these look like in real life and what you can expect when you open the box.\nPLAY\n\nCardistry routine by Bear Smith with the Reformation Deck\nPLAY\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was one of the most consequential and significant periods of (relatively) modern church history. The split between the Roman catholic church and the reformers in the 1500's had monumental repercussions, and the rich stories from this period are replete with instruction, inspiration and example.\nDue to the geographical and historical scope of the Reformation, it was extremely difficult to narrow down those involved to fit into a single deck of cards! For this project:\nThe KINGS are the primary leaders of the Reformation in their respective geographic areas: Luther, Calvin, Knox and Zwingli.\nThe QUEENS and JACKS are other key figures who played important roles.\nThe ACES are milestone events in the reformations\nThe JOKERS are the principal opponents of the moment: Pope Leo X and Johanan Tetzel.\nLuxurious packaging featuring Luther\u2019s Rose in embossed gold foil signifying the hearts of the Protestant Reformation.\nOrnate hand-drawn back design with a central cross with open book design representing Sola Scriptura; a central Reformed tenet.\nIntricately detailed face cards in wood-cut style, printed on professional grade playing card stock with shiny metallic gold accents.\nBeautiful number cards consistent with the deck theme.\n The Early Church period was an age of theological titans, doing philosophical and religious battle against the seemingly-endless heresies that sought to add or subtract from the scriptures. Covering the period after the apostolic age, these people shaped Christianity up until the modern day.\nThe face cards of the Early Church deck are comprised entirely of significant individuals:\nThe ACES are the venerated doctors of the church - the most historically significant figures who shapes the course of the church for centuries (in some cases, millennia): Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome and Gregory the Great.\nThe KINGS, QUEENS and JACKS are a mix of significant leaders, thinkers, writers and martyrs who's thoughts, words and blood drove orthodox Christianity forward.\nThe JOKERS are Diocletian - a pagan Roman emperor whose harsh persecution of Christians drove them to the breaking point, and Constantine the Great - another Roman emperor succeeding Diocletian whose conversion to Christianity (however real) and subsequent victory at Milvian Bridge legitimised the religion which spread through Rome\nLuxurious packaging featuring a Bible crossed by a sword and a shepherds staff, signifying the original leaders of the church.\nOrnate hand-drawn back design with a central Chi Rho symbol (or charismon); one of the earliest forms of Christograms. The design is bounded by an Ichthys; a popular motif of the early Christian church.\nIntricately detailed face cards in wood-cut style, printed on professional grade playing card stock with shiny metallic gold accents.\nBeautiful number cards consistent with the deck theme.\n The Great Awakening (or the first among three evangelical revivals) swept through Britain, Europe and North America in the 1700's, giving birth to the strong traditions of Anglicanism, Methodism and many other foundational beliefs of the Western protestant church. Characterized by zealous speakers, passionate leaders and inspirational thinkers; this period left a theological legacy that continues to inspire and instruct us today.\nThe ACES are significant events of periods around this time. The landing of the Mayflower, the Westminster Assembly of Divines, the open air preaching and camp meetings were pivotal events which drove the movement forward.\nThe KINGS are the primary leaders of the awakening in their geographical areas. From preaching, to administration, government, grassroots revival and theological contribution; these figures shaped the religious revival of the 1700's: Whitefield, Edwards, Wesley & Wesley, Goodwin, Rutherford, Zinzendorf and Burroughs.\nThe QUEENS and JACKS are other significant contributors who, though their involvement both great and small, continued the movement of Reformation.\nThe JOKERS are the principal opponents to the great awaking: Charles Chauncy was leader of the 'Old Light' factions which vigorously opposed the new revival breaking out, and William Laud who was the archbishop of Canterbury under King Charles I, who persecuted Puritans and dissidents.\nLuxurious packaging featuring a flame-encompassed dove, symbolizing the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the Great Awakening.\nOrnate hand-drawn back design with a central Huguenot cross; a popular symbol of the reformations sweeping the contents during the period. The design is bounded by a stylized sailing ship indicative of those which brought the first protestants to the new land.\nIntricately detailed face cards in wood-cut style, printed on professional grade playing card stock with shiny metallic gold accents.\nBeautiful number cards consistent with the deck theme.\nDon\u2019t know many card games? No problems. Every single pledge will also receive an instructional eBook with 10 of the most popular card games from around the world.\n\nIncluding a mix of player numbers, difficulties, game types and even video walkthroughs; this will help you get the most out of your deck for years to come\nReady to order?

This project is running in AUD; approximate USD conversions have been provided for your reference.\nWe have extensive experience with production, warehousing and fulfilling playing card projects, and the timeline below is very conservative. While we expect to deliver ahead of schedule, Covid is still going on and unexpected events can arise.\nElephant Playing Cards started in 2015 when founder Ben Jones asked: \u201cWHAT HAPPENED TO FAMILY GAMES NIGHT?\u201d\n\nBen used to love games nights as a child, when everyone would get together for a fun hand of cards: no phone, no computer & no internet. Just good old-fashioned quality time together!\n\nBut now our time is increasingly consumed by TV, social media & the internet which has replaced real, genuine human relationships.\n\nHis solution was to reclaim family time by making cards so interesting that everyone would want to unplug & play, and in doing so bring back real fun & connection into relationships.\n\nTo date Elephant Playing Cards has produced over 30 different decks of cards and we print more than 100,000 decks a year. Add to that more than 10,000 reviews on e-commerce channels, and you can be sure that you are in safe hands.\n\nWe continuously turn out some of the world\u2019s most interesting decks of cards, and we\u2019re only just getting started!\n\nWe launch some of our products on Kickstarter because it gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds we generate on Kickstarter covers the costs of promotion, production and fulfilment, and because this project consists of multiple decks, the amount is consistent with the costs involved with them. It lets us focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can possibly make, fueled by support from the best customers we could possibly ask for.\n\nSince starting EPC, we have successfully launched and delivered 13 Playing Card Kickstarter projects. We have an extensive network of manufacturers, logistical support, warehousing and fulfillment operations, and we will not close this project until every single person has their reward. We are 100% committed to getting you what you pay for!\nIf you support us by backing this project, we promise that we will not stop working for you until you have your full reward in your hands. Whether it be manufacturing errors, wrong delivery, damaged products, incorrect versions; whatever it is, if you have an issue you can reach out to us and we will make it right.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince 2015, Elephant playing cards has successfully designed and produced over 30 decks and counting. From starting on a shoestring and a dream, we now ship over one hundred thousand decks to customers each year and have warehouse locations around the world. Our partnerships with manufacturers, logistics providers, import/export services, warehouses and fulfillment centers makes the process of Kickstarting projects with us very low risk. As with all our campaigns, we will not close a project until every single backer has received their full pledge, that is our promise to you.\n\nHowever, unexpected events do come up from time to time. Strikes, delays, machine malfunction, peak shipping times, holidays, human error, weather events and mis-deliveries can all cause unexpected issues in the process of getting your reward to you. We will do everything in our experience and power to mitigate this risk, and if things do go wrong we will be clear and open with ongoing communication until the problem is resolved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe are using the acclaimed premium Bee Card stock from USPCC; a world leader in printing techniques and playing card manufacturing.

Tyler is from Ontario, Canada, and a graduate of The Master's Seminary. He currently serves as a missionary in Cambodia with his wife and two boys.  \n\"Pilgrim's Progress was the first book I read as a young Christian. I was captivated by the imagery and the idea of the Christian life as a journey to the Celestial City. As the years went on, that image of being a pilgrim in this world stuck in my mind and shaped the decisions I made. I hope this book will inspire my two sons and many other children to seek the Celestial City.\" \nMany versions of Bunyan's timeless tale have been published since the first edition in 1678, but when Tyler looked for a version for his children, he found there were none that combined engaging full-color illustrations with simplified language for children.\nThis version keeps the depth of the message, while making the themes understandable for early readers. Working alongside a professional editor with 40 years experience in Christian publishing, the wording and concepts have been carefully chosen and crafted to be relatable to young children. It is designed for families to read together with their younger children, and for older children to read to themselves.\nAs a help to children and parents, there are short summaries at the end of each chapter which explain the spiritual significance of the characters, places, and trials encountered. A question and study guide will eventually be available for free at www.lithoskids.com \nTo start, Tyler's plan is to translate Little Pilgrim's Big Journey to Khmer and French languages, and hopes to work with like-minded missions agencies and Christian publishers to translate it into many more. \n\"As a missionary in Cambodia, I desire to see this book spread the beauty of the gospel message far beyond the borders of North-America. We plan to use a portion of the profits from each book to help cover costs of translation and printing so that Christ can be known across the globe. It is easy to forget that many churches overseas have limited biblical resources. In Cambodia, we see firsthand the impact that translated, gospel-centered children's books can have on evangelism and discipleship.\"\nPublishing a book of this size and quality is an expensive endeavor, and our initial target only covers the cost of printing and shipping fees. We wholeheartedly believe it is worth every penny, even if we don't make a penny.\nTo ensure that your books arrive to you before Christmas 2020, we have already confirmed pricing and factory samples.

The object, simply, is to attract a coalition of NPC followers to your cause, whatever that is. The first player to 15 is the winner.\nVirtue Signal simulates the power struggles and one-upmanship that goes on between activist groups. The issues themselves are of little consequence, they are merely useful tools to get leverage over others.\nMay the wokest warrior win.\nWarriors, Come Out To Play\nThere are eight justice warrior characters in the base game, and more in development. Each warrior has xir own unique persona and special abilities, making possible a wide array of different strategies and play-styles.\nThe Alignments\nThere are four alignments in Virtue Signal, represented by four colors:\nRed - Economic Justice\nBlue - Political Justice\nGreen - Diversity\nOrange - Identity\nAlignments govern how your NPC coalition can be built, and also how microaggressions and virtue signals are played.  More on those in a second.\nThe NPCs\nNPCs come in three tiers:\nMicroaggressions and Virtue Signals\nA microaggression is a some bizarre infraction against your progressive piety that makes others cluck their tongues,  and stroke their beards.\nMicroaggression cards are played on an NPC card in a player\u2019s coalition, rendering it inert.  An NPC with a microaggression card on it cannot be added to, and it does no count toward the player\u2019s score.  In most cases it also cannot be destroyed or stolen.\nMicroaggression cards are removed by virtue signaling. A virtue signal is some overt display of progressive piety that make you seem like a better person, but which doesn\u2019t actually help anyone or accomplish anything. To remove a microaggression, one must play a virtue signal of the same alignment as the microaggression card. Red for red, blue for blue, etc.   Pretty simple.\nPlots\nPlots are universal modifiers that alter the rules of the game. Only one plot can be in play at a time, and it affects all players. Plots combine with the characters\u2019s superpowers to create interesting play strategies and in some cases pretty devastating effects. \nTestimonials", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA large proportion of the artwork has been finished already (as you can see) so this project is more or less entirely infection and risk-free. \n\nThe biggest risk to this project is that we'll be deplatformed by some humorless bint.\n\nIn the event that happens we'll try again somewhere else.

Dized teaches you the rules exactly when you need to know them and also answers your questions. You can forget rulebooks and simply focus on having fun with the people around the table! Watch the below video to see how it works!\nYou can also try it out yourself! The Early Access version is free to download for iOS and Android. In today's market, on average, there are more than 10 new board games being published every day, and we want to make it possible to learn them ALL like this! In order to make that happen, we're running this Kickstarter campaign. Dized will have lots of content and some of it will be priced. You can get the access to the priced content in the form of Credits at a deep discount from this campaign! That way you, the valued early adopter, will not only have helped us make this possible, but will get access to everything for next to nothing! Let's do this!\nDized, the premiere tabletop companion app, will bring tons of helpful content to your gaming sessions. And this content allows you to get more out of your tabletop games! To begin, we're launching with RULES, followed by interactive TUTORIALS!\nTutorials allow you to get into the game immediately. No need to read the rulebook as Dized is all the guide the guide you'll need. The fully-voiced, interactive Tutorials are able to react to what's happening in your game, so you can learn as you go, turn by turn. Dized acts like the friend that explains the game to you while you already play.\nOnce you already know a game, you still need to check-up on some Rules every now and then. Dized Rules are fast, searchable FAQs able to respond to all the questions you might have. Gone are the frustrating times where you find yourself endlessly flipping through the rulebook or scrolling through forums searching for a \"quick answer.\" And if something isn't covered, the publisher of the game can always update the content in a blink. No game night will be complete without Dized. And with Dized, no game night will ever be the same.\nIt's also important for us to note that Dized will be able to offer content in multiple languages!\nDized is designed to handle every type of game you bring to the table, including highly-strategic board games, family-friendly experiences, tabletop miniature games, collectible card games, chess, Bridge, and so much more.\nWe're giving you a look into the future with Dized Early Access, open to everyone right now. Anyone with an iOS or Android device can experience the Rules for a growing library of games, and also the interactive Tutorials for the 2017 Spiel des Jahres winner Kingdomino, award-winning designer Eric Lang's Blood Rage and 2017 Kinderspiel des Jahres Winner ICECOOL. The Tutorials are just a taste of what's to come, so check back throughout the Kickstarter for additional content.\nBased on feedback and conversations we\u2019ve had with gamers, families, education experts and others, one topic stands out: everyone learns and plays games at their own pace. There is a desire to use Dized in a way that works best for them according to their gaming experience, with fewer or more details throughout the interactive Tutorials.\nThrough the success of this campaign, we can address this need by incorporating learning algorithms directly into our Tutorial engine. We call this feature Adaptive Profiles. Your profile will learn the types of games you like and understand your level of gaming experience to better deliver custom learning experiences to you table. It ensures every player is on the same level, so everyone can focus on playing the game and enjoying their friends at the table.\nPublishers are on board with how Dized is changing the rules of learning and playing games. Feedback from Early Access tells us players are much more willing to try a new game if they can learn it through Dized. Even better, that leads to adding the game to their collections. That's why so many publishers you know and love are ready to get their games on Dized, which means the library is going to explode with new content.\nWe're happy to say that the Rules Creation Tool is now available for publishers and content-creators! The Dized Rules for a game can be completed in a very short time using this tool. We're also deep into development of the Tutorial Creation Tool (expected to release in 2019) that will do exactly what the name suggests: make Tutorial creation easy and fast.\nPublishers, sign up for the tools here!\nContent-Creators, sign up here!\nCreating the initial content for Dized Early Access took months per title, but we learned a lot about the type of Tools we needed to create. Without sacrificing quality, the Content Creation Tools will dramatically reduce production time for everyone using them and won't require a team of tech experts to use them! With our team, publishers and content-creators using the Content Creation Tools, you can expect the Dized library to expand fast and furious. More information about the content creation available here.\nDized is the medium on which publishers offer content for their players to use.\nDized will have both free and paid content available and in both cases Dized charges a Platform Fee from the publisher. For free content Dized charges a flat per download fee from the publisher and for paid content Dized charges a commission of the sale. You can read more about the Dized business model here.\nWe have a pledge level to suit every need! On this campaign we're offering Credits, game Promos and some other goodies. Read more about them below the Pledge Levels.\nThe first two tiers (Guardian and Adventurer) contain digital deliverables. Champion level ads in even more credits and a set of physical game promos! The Fellowship level is for those who want to share the loot. It comes with several sets of the promos and also sewable Dized badges. At the Jester level you can really SHOW your support by getting the ridiculously big one cubic meter sized inflatable die. Alternatively, in case you're a publisher (or really want to surprise your favorite publisher), you can get game rules to Dized with the Dized Rules level. Please read the Dized Rules and Dized Tutorial level conditions.\n* Publishers, please read the Dized Rules and Dized Tutorial level conditions.\nCredits allow you to access the paid content on Dized. For each credit you can choose to get either get all-access subscription for a month, or permanent access to single game's content (game pack).\nAs an early supporter, we want to ensure you\u2019re getting an amazing value. That's why credits are being offered for deeply discounted rates. Subscription rates are estimated to be $5 per month or $50 for an annual deal. For example, the Champion Pledge Level Credits could be used for 2.5 years of subscription at the price of 1 year!\nCredits will be delivered to each backer as a code. Each code can be redeemed to one Dized account. Redeemed Credits are not sharable. Please note that the $99 and $250 pledge levels come with multiple codes which allows redeeming those Credits to multiple different Dized accounts (or all on the same one). Credits system is not yet available on the app, but will be implemented as development continues.\nSome of the hottest publishers working with us have produced unique promo items for a variety of games. From the Champion to Jester Pledge Levels you'll receive:\nWe have some great stretch goals lined up which will be unlocked if the campaign becomes really successful.

The Dized team is a passionate group of board gamers, developers, and artists. Based in Helsinki, Finland, but with team members all over the world, we've spent our careers working on several cool board games, tabletop RPGs, video games, and more. If you're interested in learning more about what we do at Dized, check out this recent blog post.\nWe also have an incredible group of shareholders. In fact, after our initial pitch a couple of years ago, industry veterans became immediately interested, including the amazing Eric Lang, who became one of our first investors.\nFor Our Previous Crowdfunding Supporters!\nIf you supported Dized during our Indiegogo, we salute you! Without you, Dized wouldn\u2019t be at this next great step in development. The Kickstarter does not impact the delivery of your digital and physical rewards, and no action is required by you. If you choose to support the Kickstarter, the new Reward Credits will stack with your previous ones. Whether you pledge to this Kickstarter or not, we appreciate the immense support you\u2019ve already shown. We'd also love (and be very grateful) for you to help us spread the word about Dized by sharing this campaign with anyone who missed out before. Let's welcome new fans to our amazing community!\nSo Why Kickstarter?\nWe decided to bring Dized to the Kickstarter community for a couple reasons:\nThe reach Kickstarter gives us as a startup company is invaluable. We have an amazing base of supporters already, but the larger the community the better. This includes our awesome Dized users along with publishers. The more people who know about and use Dized means more content!\nOur team is amazingly talented, but scaling up production and introducing features like the adaptive profiles takes time, money, and a larger team (Want to join? Check our open positions here!). Achieving a successful Kickstarter will ensure increased support after the campaign, including: New Dized Users; More Publishers; Government Funding; And Much More.\nYou can read more about the Dized Crowdfunding efforts here.\nWe'll be shipping all promo items from our hub in China. Shipping all over the world is $4. Additional shipping may applied through BackerKit if you add additional pledges when the project is funded.\nFor this campaign, we are using BackerKit, an amazing third-party service that assists in ensuring your rewards are well managed! You will confirm your shipping and email addresses are correct through their system to receive your physical and digital rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoftware Development\n\nDeveloping software, especially something like Dized that has never been done before, is incredibly challenging. Timelines shift, staffing changes, and unexpected costs and delays arise. While we do our best to mitigate any of these issues, the unfortunate truth of developing software is that it is difficult to foresee every possible roadblock. We fully believe in our ability to deliver on this project, as is evident by our Early Access already being available, but timelines may shift despite our best efforts.\n\nPhysical Delivery of Promos\n\nWe're always in touch with the publishers that are working with us on the promos. While we're carefully planning production and delivery so that everything goes smoothly, something might be delayed by the factory or during transportation.

It's Ticket to Ride for the Two Girls One Cup generation. Sphincter-tighteningly good.\" \n-James Wallis, The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen  \n\"It's highly unusual for a euro-inspired game to reward you for going up an animal's butt, but here it is! With the chance to evolve into an even cooler Visitor, this game can get vicious as it plays out. Check this game out if you like a little spite in your life!\" \n-Christopher Chung, Lanterns\nWe're making a board game!\nThe hilarious and disgusting Newgrounds smash hit about an alien slug who dives into creatures butts to eat them from the inside out can now be shared with friends and family across your gaming table.\nThe Plot\nAlien slugs from beyond the stars have crash-landed on earth. These \u201cVisitors\u201d only know how to do two things: feed, and evolve.  \nAt first, their prey are small \u2013 a frog, a bird, a cat \u2013 but as they grow larger so too does their hunger. Before long they\u2019ll need something much bigger to satiate their appetite.\nOnce unleashed, they\u2019ll tear across the countryside, ever evolving into new and more dangerous monstrosities. They can\u2019t be stopped; even their death only seems to slow them down. In fact, the only thing that stands in their way of becoming the top of the food chain is each other\u2026  \nHumanity\u2019s days are numbered.\nHow to Play\nThe Visitor: The Board Game is a competitive dice-allocation game for 2 to 4 players that puts you in control of an alien slug who eats other creatures in order to evolve.\nEach round you will draft different coloured dice from a shared \"DNA pool\" based on your strategy. The red dice are aggressive; they help you get to your food and eat it faster. The blue dice are speedy; they allow you to rush around the board with ease. The green dice are smart; they solve puzzles with superior efficiency. There's also the black dice, which are gross. Typically, having one or two gross dice in your hand is no fun at all, and may even slow your progress! But if you go \"all-in\" on ramping up your slug's gross-factor, you can dive into a creature's butt and eat it for free.\nTravel around the board, solve puzzles blocking your path, and eat your way to the top of the food chain. Evolve faster than your opponents, and you win.\nThere's a little more to it than that; there is a human character that everyone wants to eat (and the one who does automatically wins), a handful of cool mutations your slug can develop to help you in your path to victory, and even rules for player-versus-player combat (if they are willing to dive into a butt for a meal, do you think they care about cannibalism?), but the elevator pitch doesn't need to go into all of that. If you're interested, the full rules are available for download here. Bear in mind that these rules are an early draft only, and do not represent the final rules of the game.\nWhat's in the Box?\n1. Game board\n2. Player aids (x8)\n3. Human meeple\n4. Player tokens: small visitor meeple (x4), medium visitor meeple (x4), and large visitor card + stand (x4)\n5. Player mats (x4)\n6. 32 dice\n7.

Stay tuned!\nShipping will be charged after the completion of our Kickstarter campaign, through our third-party pledge manager provider (Backerkit). As Chaotic Rogue Entertainment (that's us) is based in Canada, we can personally guarantee that all Canadian orders will ship from within the country.\nFor orders outside of Canada, we are currently in talks with third-party distributors to ensure that your shipping costs remain competitive and that they are presented up-front wherever possible (no surprise customs charges). At present time, we are prepared to ship all EU and US orders from within their respective countries. It is our hopes to be able to offer the same to Australia, China, and Mexico, but we will need to see at least 100 game level backers from each of these countries before it is feasible for us to do so. If there is a large influx of orders from specific countries outside of those listed here (at least 100), we will absolutely look into what it would take to make those orders as friendly by working with local distributors.\nHere are some initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please bear in mind that these costs are average estimates only and may rise depending on changes to global shipping prices, unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel, and any add-ons you supplement your initial pledge with during the pledge manager phase.\nCANADA: $12\nUSA: $20 to most states, $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: $20-$35, depending on what part of the EU you are in.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): $40 to most other countries. We cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nPlease note that these prices do NOT include the possible brokerage and/or customs fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country. These fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). If your country is listed among the friendly shipping icons above, you will have no import fees to pay. All of these estimates are in a constant state of flux and could change at any time, but we are committed to finding you the best possible shipping rate available and have/will continue to spend considerable time and resources towards getting you your game with as least hassle as we can.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter, we have the experience and advice of industry professionals guiding us along the way. We've received feedback from great designers, and have done two years of play-testing to get up to this point, so the path ahead is clear. \n\nThe largest risk is that we don't hit our deadline - while we believe we have all of our ducks in a row, there are many steps to this process and every single one carries the possibility for unforeseen delays. You can rest assured though that we will do everything in our power to keep delays to a minimum, and that where we can't we will communicate that with you.\n\nNo matter what, we are dedicated to providing an amazing game, and we will keep the lines of communication open at all times.

In his words:\n\"It\u2019s so rewarding seeing an idea take shape into a game that people enjoy. I feel like a \u201cGame-Smith\u201d, crafting it out of raw meeples and cards.\nEver since I could roll dice I\u2019ve been playing games, and losing to my older siblings. Like a lot of people, I started designing with some \u201chouse-rules\u201d, then started creating whole new parts. After a while I realized I could just design a whole game straight from scratch.\n My first game was an attempt to combine Risk with Settlers of Catan. It was an overly complicated failure, but I learned a lot from it.\nNow my design process starts with a feeling, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if?\u201d\nGnomes at Midnight\u2019s feeling was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if checker pieces could \u2018hold-hands\u2019 and move together; and if the board \u2018changed\u2019 as you played!\u201d. I knew right away, I wanted gnomes scurrying around together; and eventually worked out the idea of shifting moonlight for a \u2018changing\u2019 board.\nIn the end, the incredibly supportive game design community helped me go from a prototype to a great game. It\u2019s been amazing to connect with so many generous people who want every game to be it\u2019s best. (Thank you all for your time, experience, and support!)\"\nDavid Van Drunen - Board Game Designer\nMany others deserve so much credit too:\nThe box top illustration was commission from Kiri \u00d8stergaard Leonard. Kiri is a professional artist originally from Denmark and living in Austin, Texas; and is a famous Gnomie with a large body of Gnome work to her name.  We can't wait to see future Gnomes that may come out during 'Gnomevember'.\nKiri \u00d8stergaard Leonard - Early Illustration\nMichael Christopher, a professional board game art designer with several games to his art portfolio including 'Centrix', created all the components and the box layout, with inspiration from Kiri's main illustration.  Michael is a gem.\nMichael Christopher - Board Game Artist\nAlong with the support and input from many friends and family members, Gnomes at Midnight also benefited from the play testing venues made possible by: Board Game Bliss, 401 Games, Proto T.O. and Snakes and Lattes.\nAlso, many play testers generously gave their time and shared their feedback, which subsequently translated into game play improvements, making the game what it is today.\nWe think that you'll love this unique, fun, new tabletop board game, and we need support in making this a reality so we're here on Kickstarter, seeking crowdfunding in the amount of CA$12,750 (or about US$9,800).\nIf you help us successfully reach this goal, then we can start production almost immediately and the funds will be allocated, as follows:\nPlease pledge, comment, and share this page!

Peter & I first met while creating Sagrada by Floodgate Games. Peter Wocken has worked on a ton of amazing games including: Dead of Winter, Sagrada, Xia: Legends of a Drift System, and Dinosaur Island. Many of these games became possible because of Kickstarter. \nFor our first Maple game, we are partnering with Michael Schacht, designer of the Spiel des Jahres (\"Game of the Year\") winner Zooloretto. In the game Dragon Boats of the Four Seas, Michael has designed us an elegant family friendly euro game that includes bidding, set collection, and area control. \nTogether, we hope you will join #TeamMaple; help us publish amazing games by backing our projects and inviting friends and family to pledge too. Thanks for your help! \n- Daryl Andrews (President of Maple Games)\nNote: Additional dragon boats are strictly for fun - no additional gameplay function. Also, the player cloth bags are strictly for storage of player components. \n10K = Yay! We reach our funding goal!\n12.5K = Increase cardstock quality from 260gsm to 300gsm (Base & Deluxe)\n15K = Screen printing on the bid discs. 'Direct' Exclusive (Base & Deluxe)\n17.5K = Increased token thickness from 1.2mm and 2mm (Base & Deluxe)\n20K = First Player Token upgraded from cardboard fan to actual fan (Base & Deluxe)\n22.5K = Bags upgraded from cloth to silky (Base)\n25K = Screen printing on bag (Base)\nWhat is a 'Direct' Exclusive?\nDirect exclusives are component upgrades that will not be included in the first print run of the retail version of the game. However, Maple Games will reserve the opportunity to sell direct exclusive components directly with customers. Example: we may sell direct exclusive components at conventions and/or directly online. (https://maple.games)\nYou can learn more about the gameplay by clicking the button \"View the Rulebook\" below.\nAlso, you can scroll down to the \"Ancient Wisdom\" section to watch some videos to learn more about gameplay.\nMichael Schacht was inspired by a design competition in 1992 to create and release his first games. By 2005, Michael shifted his career to full-time game design, and since then has over 200 releases with various publishers. \nIn 2007 Michael Schacht's game Zooloretto received the Spiel des Jahres (game of the year) in Germany. Michael lives with his wife Marianne Hartz in Frankfurt, Germany.\nPeter Wocken recently left the world of freelance board game graphic design to co-found Maple Games, as the Creative Director. He has over a decade of experience working in the art and design field with such notable companies as Plaid Hat Games, Fantasy Flight Games, Pandasaurus Games, and Floodgate Games. \nPeter has always loved ink wash and brushwork from China and Japan. Inspired by the art piece \u201cRiver Landscape\u201d (an ink on silk from c. 1300) and ancient legends like the Dragon King, Peter has created a beautiful tranquil setting for players to explore various islands, and expand their kingdoms to forgotten lands.  \nThis campaign includes Customs-Friendly delivery to the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU. Customs-Friendly means, if you live in any of these regions and have any additional charges for receiving your package, simply email kickstarter@maple.games a copy of your customs receipt and we will reimburse you via PayPal. Note: If your country is not in one of the above-mentioned regions, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. (For example, Norway & Switzerland are not in the European Union.)\nBe aware that all pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline may be shipped at a later date.\nDue to the unpredictable customs practice in Brazil, we'll not cover any duty charges or other fees occurred. If the backer refuses to pay the charges or fees and the game is returned to us the backer will not be reimbursed for their order.\nAll shipping prices above are per unit. For the bundle of six games - expect the shipping to be approximately six times higher (x6) in price because of weight of shipping. Also, we cannot send bundles to all regions. Locations are limited.\nADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS: To add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:\n1) Go to the Dragon Boats Kickstarter page and Press the 'Manage Your Pledge' Button above. If you have not pledged yet, it will say 'Back this Project'.\n2) Increase your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' box by the total of the add-ons you want to add. \n3) Do not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. You will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you choose. \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned, and the tshirt size (Womens: S, L, XXL) (Mens: M, XL, XXXL) you want.\nNOTE: All add-ons require a base pledge to be at the $53USD tier or above.\nDo I need to add shipping/handling?\nShipping/handling is NOT included for the t-shirt & hat add-ons. Additional shipping is as specified during the after campaign survey. \nThe puzzle add-on includes shipping and handling.

The latest in the Treasure Hunters series (which includes the hit games Scuttle! and Ninjitsu!), any of the games in the series can be played separately or shuffled together for pirate-ninja-zombie mayhem!\nThe game takes 5-10 minutes to play, and each game is totally different. \nDownload a print-and-play copy of the game here! \nBrains! brings a new, unique mechanic to the Treasure Hunters series - graveyards! At the start of the game, each player is dealt a random card to start their graveyard.\nWhen you discard a card from your hand or your collection, it moves to the top of your graveyard. Cards at the top of your graveyard can interact with the game in a few different ways:\nCards like the Guitar change their value based on the top card of your graveyard!\nIf you've never played a Treasure Hunters game before, Brains! follows the same basic structure as Scuttle! or Ninjitsu! - each turn, you either draw 2 cards, play a card, or bury a card.  \nEach card has a different ability - use your zombie army to collect juicy, delicious brains. The first player to have 21 or more at the start of their turn is the winner.\nBrains! introduces a special new action - instead of drawing or playing on your turn, you may bury the top card of the deck. \nAs well as the above abilities, cards in your graveyard can be reanimated later in the game for further use...\nFor more information on how to play, check out the video below: \nEveryone who gets the game through Kickstarter will also be sent some special promo cards: \nCaptain Bluebeard. His ability is simple but powerful - he allows you to swap your hand with your graveyard. If you time it right, this can trigger any number of zombie abilities, and fill your hand with all your recently-lost treasures!\nZombie Ninja. This card is like a master undead thief-assassin - you pick a number, and every opponent moves all cards of that number from hand or from their graveyard into your graveyard. That's right - you're not only taking their unplayed cards, you steal their zombies as well! \nAs we unlock stretch goals, more promo cards will be added.\nLike all Jellybean Games, Brains! is simple enough for young gamers to enjoy, while having enough strategy to engage grownups as well. The unique \u201cgraveyard-building\u201d mechanic means that destroying your opponents\u2019 cards can be a double-edged sword, triggering powerful abilities and allowing combos!\nThe Burial! expansion offers 14 new cards, adding (six feet of) depth to the game. Cards at the top of your graveyard now protect your other treasures, allow you to draw 4 cards as an action, or allow you to draw cards from opponents\u2019 graveyards! And with a multitude of new \u201cbury\u201d effects, you can combo actions until your opponents will wish they were (un)dead...\nWith more zombies (and a kid in a Zombie Costume), more treasure (such as the delicious Bucket of Brains) and more ways to outwit your opponents, this Brains! expansion will totally change the way you play the game.\nBrains! is the third game in the Treasure Hunters series - as well as being played as a standalone game, it can be shuffled together with Scuttle! and/or Ninjitsu! \nAvailable as an add-on to any pledge is the Treasure Hunters Expansions, a set containing 3 unique expansions that work with any game in the Treasure Hunters series, including Brains!\nMasters of Magic: An ancient grimoire has been uncovered, unleashing the secrets of ancient magic! These 15 cards add a unique twist to the game, and can be shuffled into any game for a magic touch.\nThe Elements: Seize the powers of nature with these unique player abilities! Master the forces of the elements to crush your opponents. Use the powers of Fire to protect your treasure, or to steal cards from your opponents! \nHeavy Weather: It\u2019s raining, it\u2019s pouring, it\u2019s...flooding? Shuffle the Event cards into the deck, and change the weather each time one is resolved! Sunny days allow players to draw new cards, fog can make you play blind, and snow will let you retrace where you\u2019ve already been\u2026\nThese three expansions can be played individually or all at once, whether you\u2019re playing Brains! by itself or combining it with any other game in the Treasure Hunters series. \nUNLOCKED - We have hit $3k: the game is funded! The Treasure Hunters series has a new, undead entry!\nUNLOCKED - At $5k, we upgraded the box to a telescoping box.

You are the only one left alive after your group was ambushed by monsters - now you must avenge your friends and reclaim your freedom. Quick to learn, easy to set up and playable in a brief 20-30 minutes, the game will challenge you to make the right decisions or fall victim to the many dangers of the monster-infested caverns.\nPlan wisely and take calculated risks - you do not have much and must use every resource at your disposal to prevail. Each journey in the dark is unique as you play as one of four different characters and face a variety of monsters and encounters. Your character gets better with experience and so will you - Unbroken is a game that encourages and rewards repeated plays to refine your strategies. \n                                                           Hanging on by a thread. You snuck past a giant spider along the way but now want to arm yourself, hearing monsters ahead. You need some wood for a sturdy club.\nYou could gather your strength at a shrine or distract the feasting goblinoids to steal their food. No wood that you wanted, but you\u2019ll use the shrine \u2013 hunger isn\u2019t the biggest threat to your survival now.\nStill a bit of time left - you push on, looking for another encounter.\nFinally, some wood! You could fashion a weapon from these branches. But you are weak \u2013 gathering the wood, then crafting the club would tire you out. Instead you decide to rest up and to face the upcoming monster with your bare hands.\nYou are short on time \u2013 another encounter could yield resources, but if time gets to 0 the monster would ambush you. You decide not to risk it and face the monster.\nYou face your foe. The unfortunate wretch trapped in these caverns has long gone mad with despair.\nYour gamble not making a weapon paid off! The Survivor\u2019s Special effect would disarm you, wasting all resources you would have spent on the weapon.\nYou didn\u2019t have to go into the fight blindly \u2013 you could Scout the monster and knew what to expect. It would cost resources but would provide certainty.\nIn Combat you will spend effort to wound your enemy. Good thing you feel strong after stopping at that shrine!\n\nYou would be in trouble encountering an armoured monster - dealing with that using just your fists would lead to a quick defeat.\nYour victory is rewarded! Which weapon upgrade tree will you choose? Which skills will aid your struggles? There are two more truly dangerous monsters to defeat before you are free of this accursed place!\nUnbroken has been designed to be played regardless of how strapped for time or company you might be. All you need to get it to the table is a small space, 20-30 minutes of free time and just one player - YOU. \nSome games have add-on solo modes. Some allow you to play versus a virtual opponent. Unbroken doesn\u2019t settle for the fact that you\u2019re playing solo - it celebrates it. The survival story you\u2019re telling is that of individual triumph in the face of adversity, and it has been crafted to be enjoyed in exactly this way.\nUnbroken is won by careful planning and calculated risk. There are several strategies you can go for including a focus on skills, trickery or different weapon upgrade trees. Your approach will determine your success much more than the limited luck element. Every game you will learn how to best prepare for the challenges of the dungeon. Every next game you will be a little better at surviving. \nDo you spend your resources to find out more about the coming dangers or do you hedge your bets and go in blind? Do you risk looking for food to not starve even if you might be ambushed by a monster? There are many difficult decisions in Unbroken and these will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering if you made the right one. \nUnbroken is built on a flexible system that is centered around a variety of characters to play and monsters to combat. We already have great designs in mind for expansions that we will start working on in full after the campaign. We can\u2019t wait to have the community\u2019s input on the new content! \nWe are so certain that you will like Unbroken that we are happy to offer an unconditional full refund (including shipping) within 30 days of you receiving the game.

Why they got into EDC? How they started creating EDC? Personal Role Models, Personal Collections, Biggest Challenges, Community Involvement and much more. Get up close and personal with some of the most talented EDC makers in the world and explore how and why they became a maker of Every Day Carry.\nThe film will then go from category to category of some of the worlds most popular EDC gear, covering almost every aspect and genre of some of the worlds most incredible metal and leather goods and explore the process of how it's made...\n\"So............what do they make.....?\"\nThat's a little more difficult to answer.\nThe term EDC actually originated decades ago. Every day carry is simply what it implies \n\"- to carry every day.\"\nThere is a sense of preparedness that goes into the carry.\n\"- always be prepared.\"\nThere is also an element of stealth and portability that is seemingly apparent in all aspects of EDC. Most of the items have to fit in your pockets, clip onto your keys, or be wearable in some way; The individual who takes part in EDC will be ready for anything life decides to throw their way, but not be inconvenienced by heavy gear.\nEDC is not all serious tasks though. It can also be incredibly entertaining with precision instruments such as tops, spinners, sliders and oloids?!.\nWhat's an Oloid you ask?\nSee why we need to create a film.....?\nHere is a great example - \n     Rich Stadler from Billetspin creates metal precision spinning tops that exceed spin times of 20 minutes being spun by hand. They do so by attaining near perfect centres of balance while minimizing friction and air resistance. Not to mention they are spinning works of art and are completely limited in numbers using some of the worlds most precious and rare metals. And that's just one of more than 30 cast members in the film that are just like that.\nThe film will also be educational in nature and as an added experience - all the backers get to take place in an immersive and interactive platform using facebook live and video links - in real time while we are filming the movie.\nThere is an exclusive members only group for backers of the film and we will even allow you the possibility to shape the outcome of the film with questions asked to each maker. It is available at a very affordable backing level because we want everyone to be a part of it.\nThis type of interactive production has never really been done before and we will be setting a precedence of interactive film making - with the advancements of social media we can make this easily possible. We already have the community.\nThe film itself will be a very high level documentary film as far as image quality is concerned. A great deal of documentary films are shot in REC 709 on Digital SLR cameras and this creates a more \"video\" type of image in the final production when compared to your typical Hollywood Blockbuster film. Although there is nothing wrong with shooting a documentary like this, It can sometimes lack the necessary colour science and dynamic range to produce a film that can represent a scene, object or person properly. \nSUPER 35 DNG RAW DIGITAL FILM\nBy shooting in DNG RAW Lossless video codec - we will be able to take in the full spectrum of image data to better show you the viewer - just how spectacular this gear really is. The footage will be professionally colour corrected and graded to emulate a blockbuster motion picture. \nFor Every Day Carry : The Official Documentary,  The entire film is to be shot the Black Magic Ursa 4.6k Digital Film Camera in Super 35 DNG RAW with exceptionally high levels of dynamic range and exquisite colour science. This is a larger type of Cinema Camera that has extraordinary post production flexibility.  The image quality will be of the highest of cinematic excellence in order to capture the essence of the artistic masterpieces that these makers create. \nThe scope of the film is very large and we have a lot of people to get in front of so the majority of the budget will be used in obtaining that footage globally and getting camera crews in front of our talented cast of over 35 makers. We have some makers in Denmark (ANSO) and some in England (ROTABLADE) and one even in Hawaii (KEN ONION)  for example - These makers along with all the others are very important to the overall story and will create the huge overall depth of this documentary. \nEDCD CUSTOM STUBBY REWARD BY ROTABLADE\nThe challenge at that point will be to narrow down over 50 hours of footage into a 160 minute film. (Over 2.5 hours total run time)\nThe film will also involve complete maker tours and exclusive video of some of the most incredible EDC work in progress. You get a complete look of some of your favorite artists in action with behind the scenes footage. You might even get a tip of two for any future makers watching.\nTORQBAR LUNA - special EDCD stamp limited ed\nThe film will take an in depth look at the charity efforts of Rob Baptie and an incredible Not for Profit organization called THE HATE PROJECT which to date has raised over $750 000 for organizations such as MAKE A WISH, THE CURE STARTS NOW, RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE and THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOUNDATION with the sale and distribution of Hogs of Hope and Hate Dust. \nTHE HATE PROJECT\n  The Hate Project Fundraising Army\nFinally the film will educate.\nWhy do knives lock differently? What steel is best for each task? What's the difference between steel and titanium? What the &%$# is superconductor? \nWhere did the fidget spinner come from? What is Tritium? What are Lumens? Open or sealed bearings? Drop Point or Tanto blade?\nWhy do some tops spin longer than others, How big can some collections get? ( you wouldn't believe it if I told you.....)\nBACKER REWARD PORT WALLET BY CRAFT & LORE\n  PORT WALLET BY CRAFT & LORE\nBlades, Bearings, Knives, Pens, Lights, Tritium, Spinners, Metal Art, Tops, Leather, Spoon Rings, Knucks, Beads, Key Holders, Clips and Biners, Tools, Prys and much more. We will dive into each genre of EDC and take it all apart - so to speak.\nMost EDC items are handmade, very limited in production and sold amongst the most passionate collectors the world has ever encountered. The quality of the items is immeasurable and the items are so well built they are easily passed on through generations. \nAnd if you don't know what some of these things are?\nYou will.\nAll we need is your help to fund the production so we can show you. :)\nTORQBAR REWARD ZIRC COPPER special EDCD stamp\nFor the EDC community of collectors this will be a chance to create a project along side your favourite artists.\nTORQBAR REWARD ZIRC MOKUME - special EDCD stamp\nSome of the levels even allow you to have your name immortalized in history with this project in the credits (which in itself will be a visual presentation of backers and supporters from this campaign) along side your favorite EDC makers.\nSome levels allow for video clips and even cameos.\nkeybar\nWe want to involve you the backer in the film. We are ready to show the world how incredible this community really is.\nAnd finally the film will dive into the most important part of EDC.\nThe part that makes it all possible.\nYou.

The community would not be where it is today without the love and support of these collectors and we will try to capture that essence on film and show it to the world.\nAt the end of the day - we are all collectors of something.\nHelp us create a film so we can show the world what's in OUR pockets.\nI am the director of the film.

Highest value wins. It's a 2 or 4 player game (2 teams of 2). At the start of each round, each player is given 3 cards with which they must win at least 2 tricks out of 3 to win.

At any time in the round, as long as a player holds a card in his hand, whomever \"Truts\" simply announces to the opposing team he is certain to win the round. Of course, he can bluff. He's got 2 options then: to give up or take up the challenge! Knowing that winning a \"Trut\" can lead to a greater... or to a huge loss. \nA game lasts between 5 and 10 minutes, but the pace is really fast, and the game is so addictive that players often easily play several games.\nLes r\u00e8gles du jeu en Vid\u00e9o (en fran\u00e7ais, sous titr\u00e9es en anglais) \nCliquez sur ce lien pour visionner la vid\u00e9o sur Youtube (n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 activer les sous-titres si n\u00e9cessaire). \nLes r\u00e8gles du jeu en PDF (en fran\u00e7ais, anglais, allemand, espagnol et n\u00e9erlandais)\nThe rules of the game are found in a video (in French, subtitled in English).

Il serait un descendant du jeu d\u2019Aluette. Les anciens y jouent traditionnellement sans e\u0301changer la moindre parole... Leurs regards d\u2019acier e\u0301tant suffisamment e\u0301quivoques. De nos jours, il est encore pratique\u0301 en France avec un jeu de traditionnel 32 cartes par quelques irre\u0301ductibles dans les Deux-Se\u0300vres, le Maine-et-Loire et la Sarthe (province fran\u00e7aise), ainsi que dans certains pays de cultures hispaniques. Ce jeu, pourtant tre\u0300s dynamique, tombe lentement dans l\u2019oubli faute de pratiquants.\nDevant cette injustice, toute l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Robin Red Games (c\u2019est \u00e0 dire moi) s\u2019est mobilis\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter que ce jeu ne disparaisse totalement.\nTRUT is a card game called \"a counter one\" with uncertain origins of which one would have heard for of it the first time in the seventeenth century, somewhere in the west of France. It is believed to be a descendant of Alouette's game. Old people play it traditionally without exchanging a single word... Their iron looks are sufficiently equivocal. Nowadays, it is still practised with a traditional game of 32 cards by an irreducible few in Deux-S\u00e8vres, in Maine-et-Loire and in Sarthe, as well as in some Hispanic countries. This game, despite being very dynamic, is slowly falling into oblivion because of the lack of practitioners.\nFacing this injustice, the entire Robin Red Games (that is, for me) has mobilised in order to prevent this game's full disappearance.\nPar cette e\u0301dition personnalise\u0301e, j\u2019espe\u0300re lui redonner ses lettres de noblesse et lui rendre sa popularite\u0301. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019ai particuli\u00e8rement soign\u00e9 les illustrations (environ 192 heures de travail), tant dans le trait du dessin que dans le choix radical de l\u2019iconographie. Toutes les cartes sont diff\u00e9rentes. Mon objectif \u00e9tait de donner au jeu une identit\u00e9 visuelle forte et atypique. Le TRUT \u00e9tant encore farouchement pratiqu\u00e9 dans les Deux-S\u00e8vres, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remercier ces vaillants pratiquants en utilisant pour les cartes \u00ab Secondaires \u00bb des d\u00e9cors typiques du pays de G\u00e2tine et des environs. Ainsi, les observateurs vigilants pourront reconna\u00eetre certains paysages ou monuments. \nThrough this personalised edition, I expect to give it back its nobility and restore its popularity. That is why I have particularly taken care of the illustrations (about 192 hours of work), both in drawings and in the radical choice of iconography. All cards are different. My goal was to give the game a strong and atypical visual identity. TRUT being still fiercely practised in Deux-S\u00e8vres, I decided to thank these valiant practitioners by using \"Secondary\" Typical scenery of the country of G\u00e2tine and the surroundings for cards. Thus, vigilant observers will recognize certain landscapes or monuments.\nLes re\u0300gles utilis\u00e9es sont celles les plus couramment pratique\u0301es. Cependant, la variante \u00ab A la Ga\u0302tinaise \u00bb est \u00e9galement disponible dans le livret de r\u00e8gles.\nThe rules being used are those most commonly practised. However, the variant \"\u00e0-la-G\u00e2tinaise\" is also available in the rulebook.\nA l\u2019occasion du festival du FLIP 2017 qui a accueilli cette ann\u00e9e plus de 350 000 personnes, j\u2019ai eu l\u2019occasion de faire jouer une bonne centaine de parties de TRUT \u00e0 un public tr\u00e8s large (du simple joueur occasionnel jusqu\u2019au plus pur hard-gamer). A chaque fois, le succ\u00e8s fut au rendez-vous. Le jeu s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel. Le succ\u00e8s attira m\u00eame les m\u00e9dias et le TRUT peut s\u2019enorgueillir d\u2019avoir eu un article dans la presse locale.\nOn the occasion of the FLIP 2017 festival, which welcomed more than 350,000 people this year, I had the opportunity to play around 100 games of TRUT with a very wide audience (from the casual player to more pure hard-gamers). Each time, success was at the rendezvous. The game proved to be particularly intergenerational. Success attracted even the media and TRUT can be proud of having an article in the local press.\nL\u2019\u00e9diteur / The Editor\nRobin Red Games est une maison d\u2019\u00e9dition de jeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que j\u2019ai fond\u00e9e en 2012. Passionn\u00e9 de jeux, d'illustration et d\u2019aventure c\u2019est le meilleur moyen que j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 pour m\u2019\u00e9panouir au quotidien et r\u00e9aliser un vieux r\u00eave. Par le biais de cette entreprise, j\u2019invente, revisite ou r\u00e9habilite avec enthousiasme des jeux in\u00e9dits, oubli\u00e9s, originaires d\u2019autres pays ou de cultures diff\u00e9rentes, peu ou pas distribu\u00e9s en France.\nChaque jeu est int\u00e9gralement con\u00e7u et r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en interne, en France puis test\u00e9 par des associations de jeu (des familles, des enfants et des adultes) avant leur lancement, dans le cadre d\u2019ateliers de jeux.\nRobin Red Games is a publishing house of board games that I founded in 2012. Being passionate about games, illustration and adventure, this is the best way I have found growing every day and achieving an old dream. Through this company, I invent, revisit or rehabilitate with enthusiasm new, forgotten memories, originating from other countries or different cultures and little or no distribution in France games.\nEach game is entirely conceived and produced in-house (in France) and tested by game associations (families, children and adults) before their launch, in the framework of games workshops.\nDepuis sa cr\u00e9ation, Robin Red Games a \u00e9dit\u00e9 de nombreux jeux, accessibles pour tous les \u00e2ges (certains d\u00e8s 4 ans), 4 de ces jeux sont \u00e9galement disponibles pour les non-voyants, en version braille, en fran\u00e7ais et anglais, afin que tous puissent jouer ensemble avec un plaisir \u00e9gal. Pour en savoir plus : www.robinredgames.com.\nSince its creation, Robin Red Games has published many games, suitable for all ages (some from 4 years old on); 4 of these games are also available for blind people, in Braille, in French and English, so that everyone can play together with equal pleasure. To learn more: www.robinredgames.com.\nLa date de livraison / The Delivery Date\nAu moment o\u00f9 vous lisez ces lignes, la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui constituent le jeu sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours de fabrication. La campagne de financement va me permettre, en plus des diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9penses inh\u00e9rentes au Crowdfunding (exp\u00e9ditions, commission\u2026), de financer le lancement du jeu, le conditionnement et, je l'esp\u00e8re, la fabrication des 3 cartes \u00ab Bonus \u00bb qui viennent ajouter un peu de chaos \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique du jeu. \nCompte du succ\u00e8s incroyable de cette campagne, de la quantit\u00e9 impressionnante de SG d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s et surtout du nombre des contributeurs, la date d'exp\u00e9dition des contreparties est d\u00e9cal\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre 2017.\nAs you read these lines, manufacturing of most of the elements that make up the game is already in progress. The funding campaign will allow me, in addition to the various expenses inherent in the crowdfunding (shipping, commission...), to finance the launch of the game, the packaging and, I hope, the manufacture of the \"Bonus\" 3 cards, which add a little chaos to the mechanics of the game. \nConsidering the incredible success of this campaign, the impressive amount of SG released and especially the number of contributors, the date of shipment is delayed at the beginning of December 2017.\nLes frais de port / Delivery costs\nLes frais de ports sont GRATUITS pour la France. Pour une livraison en dehors de l\u2019hexagone, je demande une participation de 4\u20ac pour l\u2019Europe et 6\u20ac pour les autres pays.\nDelivery is FREE within France. For delivery outside the hexagon (mainland France), please add a lump sum of \u20ac4 to your total for Europe and \u20ac6 for the rest of the world.\nQuelques cartes \u00ab Figures \u00bb / Some \"Figures\" cards\nQuelques cartes \u00ab Secondaires \u00bb / Some \"Secondary\" cards\nA propos du mate\u0301riel\nLe jeu TRUT est compos\u00e9 d\u2019une bo\u00eete-cloche en carton \u00e9pais (700g) sur lequel est contre-coll\u00e9 une feuille de papier couch\u00e9 (115g) imprim\u00e9e en quadrichromie, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par un vernis UV brillant. La bo\u00eete contient 32 cartes de 58x88mm imprim\u00e9es en quadrichromie recto/verso sur un papier de 305g + 28 jetons de 15mm de diam\u00e8tre pour compter les points + 1 jeton \u00ab Donneur \u00bb + 1 livret de 32 pages contenant les r\u00e8gles du jeu en 5 langues (fran\u00e7ais, anglais, allemand, espagnol et n\u00e9erlandais). L\u2019utilisation du pion Donneur est facultative, il sert simplement a\u0300 de\u0301finir celui qui commence la manche (les manches sont si rapides que, parfois, dans le feu de l\u2019action, les joueurs peuvent perdre le fil). Les jetons sont utilise\u0301s pour comptabiliser les points. Les \u00ab Petits \u00bb sont noirs avec un trait orange et les \u00ab Longs \u00bb sont oranges avec un trait noir. Quand un joueur marque des points, il prend les pions correspondants et les place devant lui.\nTRUT game consists of a thick cardboard box (700g) on which is glued a sheet of coated paper (115g) printed in four-colour process, protected by a glossy UV varnish. The box contains 32 cards of 58x88mm printed on a paper of 305g + 28 tokens of 15mm diameter to count the score + 1 \"Dealer\" token + 1 booklet of 32 pages containing the rules of the game (available in 5 languages: French, English, German, Spanish and Dutch). The use of the Dealer token is optional; it's useful just to define who will begin the round (rounds are so fast that sometimes when action is on fire, players can lose track). Tokens are used to count the score. The \"Small\" ones are black with an orange line while the \"Long\" ones are orange with a black line. When a player scores, he takes the corresponding tokens and places them in front of him.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLe jeu \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 essentiellement de cartes et de jetons, le projet a un niveau de risque bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de beaucoup d'autres jeux plus complexes, notamment ceux qui n\u00e9cessitent la fabrication de figurines. De plus, comme le projet est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours de fabrication, il n\u2019y a tout simplement aucune chance pour qu\u2019il n\u2019aboutisse pas.\n\nCela \u00e9tant dit, bien que je me sois entour\u00e9 de fournisseurs comp\u00e9tents et efficaces, on ne peut pas exclure un probl\u00e8me technique impr\u00e9vu. Si cela devait se produire, il n\u2019y aurait, au pire, qu\u2019un retard d\u2019une quinzaine de jours. Bien \u00e9videment, vous en seriez imm\u00e9diatement inform\u00e9s.\n\nAttention aux frais de douane ! Les contreparties seront exp\u00e9di\u00e9es par La Poste en lettre suivi mais il se peut que certains pays en dehors de l'EU r\u00e9clame des frais de douane.\n\nThe game uses essentially cards and tokens, so the project has a much lower level of risk than many other more complex games, especially those requiring having figurines manufactured. Moreover, since the project is already under construction, there is simply no chance of not succeeding.\n\nThat being said, although I have surrounded myself with competent and efficient providers, one cannot rule out an unforeseen technical problem. If this were to happen, there would be, at worst, only a delay of about fifteen days. Obviously, you would be immediately informed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "NUMERIK", "descp": "Le fichier PDF des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du jeu en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement.\nINCLUDES:\nLes cartes + Les r\u00e8gles + Les tuiles, au format PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "BASIC", "descp": "1 exemplaire du jeu + 1 sticker exclusif\nINCLUDES:\n1 bo\u00eete-cloche\n32 cartes\n1 livret de r\u00e8gle\n28 Jetons\n1 pion \"Donneur\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "FAN", "descp": "1 exemplaire du jeu + 1 sticker exclusif + 1 marque-page exclusif + 1 badge exclusif + 1 d\u00e9dicace + Tous les objectifs atteints\nINCLUDES:\n1 bo\u00eete-cloche\n1 livret de r\u00e8gle\n32 cartes\n28 Jetons\n1 pion \"Donneur\"\n1 sticker exclusif\n1 marque-page exclusif\n1 Badge exclusif\n1 D\u00e9dicace\n+ Tous les objectifs atteints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["593 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac36 or more", "title": "DOUBLE-FAN", "descp": "2 exemplaires du jeu + 2 stickers exclusif + 2 marques-page exclusifs + 2 badges exclusifs + 2 d\u00e9dicaces + 2x Tous les objectifs atteints\nINCLUDES:\n2x la contribution FAN\n2x tous les objectifs atteints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["171 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Status report and planning", "update_content": " Hello everyone ! \nAll the packages of the contributors having filled the Pledge Manager are shipped.

We started working on the concept for a violent Unicorn game right away, and pretty soon the whole team was obsessed.\nWe spent months carefully calibrating and balancing the game through extensive play testing.

Visit our website to find out how to get Karmaka.\nKarmaka is a tactical card game set in a karmic universe. Players begin the game as lowly Dung Beetles. In life after life (hand after hand of cards) they climb their way up the Karmic Ladder, racing to see who will achieve Transcendence first.\nWork your way up the Karmic Ladder from Dung Beetle to Transcendence!\nDuring each of your lives you'll be working towards 3 ends: \nScore enough points to climb the Ladder and keep up with your rivals.\nStash a good selection of cards to your \"Future Life\". This will become your opening hand next life.\nPlay cards for their abilities to help yourself or to hinder others. But what goes around comes around. A key tension in Karmaka is that after playing a card for its ability, a rival may take the card into their Future Life. Your actions may come back to haunt you in the next life...\n                                                                We love card games like Dominion / Ascension, Lost Cities, Smash Up, Magic, Netrunner... but felt there was a sweet spot in the space we wanted to play. Here's how Karmaka fits in.\nKarmic Balance: A key mechanic is, whenever you play a card for its ability, your rival(s) get a chance to take the card into their Future Life. What goes around comes around!\nDrafting a Future Life: A unique aspect of Karmaka is how it feels like card-drafting in parallel with play. Your opening hand and deck may be random, but you explicitly choose which cards go into your Future Life. Cards do not automatically cycle, unlike in deck-building games.\nHand Management: Karmaka is filled with interesting choices. There's the tension in how to group your card colors, as well as how to play each card \u2013 for points or for its ability. You'll want to consider card synergies and which cards you want this life versus the next. And you'll need to consider what's going into your rivals' Futures!\nHighly Replayable: Karmaka is a very dynamic game that urges you to \"think on your feet.\" We still find ourselves enjoying and improving at the game after hundreds of plays.\nFocused: Karmaka's set of 64 cards is intended to be a complete, deep play experience, with an interesting meta in and of itself. So it's quick to pick up, and there's no need to constantly add more cards to the mix to keep things interesting. We *may* create an expansion down the line if there's demand, but we don't feel there's need.\nSimple, quick setup: Just shuffle the deck, deal, and play. Unlike many deep card games, there's no need to separate/gather cards, lay piles, make decks, etc.\nPlayer Interaction: Karmaka is a race (e.g. Dominion, Lost Cities) that also has elements of confrontation (e.g. Magic); it's somewhat of a hybrid in this respect. The amount of aggression that emerges in a game is really up to players \u2013 we've seen games ranging from peaceful to highly aggressive, dependent on player style. Just keep in mind that your actions can come back to haunt you in the next life, and aggression is often not your best play. Many cards in the game can cause you more harm than good if played unwisely. Timing is everything.\nPLAY\n\nDave explains the essentials of Karmaka in the video above. To get an even fuller picture, check out Karmaka's free Print and Play, or flip through the rules.\nDownload the free print-and-play\nIf you think you'll like the game (see above), and you can afford it (see your bank account), please back this project!\nThis may be your only chance to get it. We honestly don't know if there will ever be another Karmaka print-run.\nYou're getting a great deal! Even if the game is available post-Kickstarter, it certainly won't be this cheap. Karmaka's MSRP (sticker price) will be about $30; your $25 pledge buys the game for under $20 (the rest is shipping)!\nWe need your help getting it made. The more people who back it, the more stretch goals we can include, making the game better for everyone!\nWe've put a lot of love and attention to detail into this game, from the mechanics to the art to the cards to the rulebook to the graphic design.

Order them anytime from Society6, who will print and ship them right away to your door. Order the Box Art or the Karmic Ladder as a simple print, framed, or printed on canvas, in your choice of size.\nWe recently added 2 card prints to our Society6 portfolio as well: Embody and Swindle.\nAll stretch goals have been unlocked! Thank you so much for helping us to achieve 100% of our vision \u2013 our ideal version of Karmaka. This game is going to rock!\nAdditional information about some of the stretch goals listed above can be found in our updates:\nCustom Meeples. The meeples will be thicker than they might appear in the image above. The mockup of the 2-card Ladder in that update gives a better perspective on them.\nMultiplayer Variants. Note that the latest rules can always be found here. \nArt prints. These are all available on our Society6 page.\nPlastic Insert. The image in this update isn't the final design, but it's more accurate than what's pictured above. And yes, we will make sure the card wells are wide and deep enough to fit card sleeves.\nTranslations. Note that we are printing Karmaka in English. These translations (rules + quick-lookup sheet for the cards) will be freely available to download from our website when they're ready.\nPortable Ladder. That update contains a bigger image so you can see how it'll look.\nWe've done a lot of research and legwork in order to provide you, our backers, with the most reliable and cost-effective way to get Karmaka into your hands. And we're happy to say we've teamed up with the folks from Cards Against Humanity to handle fulfillment via their new Blackbox service. (They did a bang-up job of this for Exploding Kittens.)\nGames will be shipped in bulk to fulfillment centres in the US, Canada, and the UK, meaning that we will take care of any customs fees & VAT so you don't have to worry about additional charges on delivery.\nPart of your $25 pledge goes towards shipping your game to you. For backers in the USA, that covers it, and so US backers simply pay $25. For folks in other countries, our costs are higher, and so we add on an additional amount at checkout:\nCanada and UK: $7\nEurope (EU countries, other than the UK): $14\nRest of World: $7\nNote that for backers outside the US, Canada, and the EU, we will be using an alternate shipping solution: air-mail direct from China. This is a more cost-effective solution (doesn't ship from within those countries), especially for backers in Asia, Australia, etc. That's why the \"Rest of World\" price above is so good.\nNote shipping is only added on once per pledge, not per game. You can add additional copies (for gifts or to share shipping costs with a neighbour) for $20 apiece if you're in the USA, Canada, or the UK, or for $30 apiece if you're elsewhere.\nEddy Boxerman and Dave Burke are sharing hats on Karmaka, from design to development to logistics to support.

Our life-long love of tabletop games \u2013 and our belief in this game \u2013 has drawn us from the digital sphere to the physical. Karmaka is not our first tabletop design \u2013 but it's the first we believe in strongly enough to actually publish. We think you'll enjoy it.\nMarco Bucci is the artist behind Karmaka's box and all its beautiful cards. He is a freelance illustrator with a wide range of experience, including work on the Monkey Island, Frozen and Star Wars franchises, and such clients as Walt Disney, LEGO, LucasArts, and Mattel.\nLane Brown painted some gorgeous pieces as well \u2013 foremost the Karmic Ladder!\nScott Nicely is our primary graphic designer, lending a touch of class to the card designs, the rules, and this very page.\n\nBig thanks to:\nOur friends at Cards Against Humanity / Blackbox (especially Dan Dranove and Max Temkin) for taking us under their wing in the intimidating land of worldwide fulfillment.\nBrent Kinney of Panda Game Manufacturing for guiding us (and answering our million-and-one questions) through the land of tabletop game manufacturing.\nAlyssa Bistonath for her pro work on our videos, and Sarah Davignon and Andrew Patten for sound.\nOur partners at Indie Fund for their financial management help.\nAnd of course big thanks to our families, friends, all our playtesters, and the generous folks in the tabletop developer community who have given us so much of their time and advice on this exciting project. <3\nIf you'd like to know more about our process, check out our blog.\nBack us! :)\nAdd a second copy to your pledge for your most karmically deserving friend.\nTell your friends about the game via the Facebook and Twitter buttons below, or via good, old-fashioned mouth-to-ear communication.\nSend us your thoughts and feedback in the project's comments section.

As such the only real uncertainty we see for the project are the timings for manufacturing and shipping.

So, we're basing our schedule on what others have actually managed to deliver, rather than what they've promised \u2013 and have added a little safety factor.

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

I never thought of myself any different. I wanted to be a Chicago Blackhawk exactly like my brothers. That was my dream.

It\u2019s a man\u2019s game.'\u201d - Cammi Granato, Olympic Gold Medalist & First Female Inductee to the Hockey Hall of Fame (2010)  \nPhoto credits, L-R: Jarred Alterman, George Spiers\nImagine this: You're 4 years old and skating on the frozen pond behind your grandma's house. You take a shot, and for the first time, you don't fall down or slide off in the opposite direction. \nBy middle school, you're waking up at 5 AM to get to the rink and practice before school starts. You miss your senior prom to attend a select hockey camp. It's the first time you play with other girls. In college, you go on to lead your squad to the NCAA Frozen Four. And then -- just as your former male teammates land opportunities to play professional hockey -- it hits you: that door is closed for you, because you\u2019re a woman. Just as you're hitting your athletic peak, the road ends. There is no Title IX for life.\nEvery elite female hockey player shares a version of this story. But the script is being rewritten.\nTHE FILM\nOur team of independent filmmakers is following the National Women's Hockey League - the first and only professional women's hockey league in North America to pay its players - through their inaugural season. What goes down in history is dictated by those who record and retell it. We're determined to preserve this groundbreaking moment for people everywhere, but especially for little girls looking for heroes. Our feature documentary, NWHL: History Begins (working title), will trace the formation of the fledgling National Women's Hockey League while telling the personal stories of its pioneers. Our cameras will be there for the pre-dawn workouts and the late night practices. We'll capture the power in a blistering slap shot, the spray of ice from each stop and pivot, every muttered expletive, and every cry of agony and joy.\nPhoto credits, L-R: George Spiers, Jarred Alterman, Gerry deSimas.\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\nIt\u2019s 2015. Women from each major political party are running for President. Combat jobs in the Army and Air Force are opening to women. But women still make $0.77 for every dollar men earn. In professional sports, the gender wage gap is even more profound. Female athletes receive a fraction of the prize money, pay, and media coverage men enjoy. Consider, for example, that the US Women\u2019s soccer team was awarded $2M for winning the World Cup, while the Men\u2019s team got $8M for being eliminated in the round of 16. Or that the average annual NBA salary in 2013-14 was $4.9M, compared with $72K in the WNBA. And until this year, the best female hockey players in the world couldn't even get paid to play.\n\u201cFine,\u201d you say, \u201cbut people prefer men\u2019s sports.\u201d That could be because we barely hear about ladies who are making layups. Just 2% of sports news coverage focuses on female athletes.\nOur documentary is not just for hockey fans. It's for anyone who cares about the place of women's athletics in our society, and, ultimately, anyone who cares about the ongoing fight for gender equality.\nInfographic by Erika Schneider\nInfographic by Erika Schneider\nInfographic by Erika Schneider\nWHY $45K\n\"History Begins\" is an ambitious project, and ambitious projects often cost money. Our estimated budget is still many times that - and even that's with a lot of cost-cutting measures, including many of our crew volunteering their time and doing multiple jobs at once. To put our frugality into perspective, consider that the \"24/7 Road to the Winter Classic\" series, which follows NHL teams during the first half of their season, costs about $1.6M to make.\nWe need $45,000 to get to the next stage in creating this film. Reaching the goal will enable us to shoot critical footage over the next 2 months that will define the film's narrative and position us to pursue important partnerships. \nWomen players still don\u2019t have anywhere near the same opportunities as men, and that goes for projects like this about women's sports, too. That\u2019s why we're asking you to get involved.\nEVERY contribution counts, no matter how small. We are forever grateful for your support.\nHere's how the funds from this Kickstarter campaign will be distributed: \nInfographic by Erika Schneider\nCAST\nTeam sports are inherently rife with drama. Teammates spend long hours together, forming intense bonds and relying on each other for support. Yet they\u2019re also competing for playing time and the increased compensation and opportunities that come with it. As the inaugural season progresses, tough losses and personal fouls will be remembered and avenged, and tension will mount as teams vie for the Isobel Cup. Meanwhile, the pressure is on for founding commissioner Dani Rylan and league personnel to prove that a professional women\u2019s hockey league is viable. The triumphs and failures of the individual players and their teams will be set against the backdrop of the ultimate success or failure of the entire endeavor of professional women\u2019s hockey.\nPhoto credits, Left Column: Buffalo.com, Today's Slapshot.

Throughout these adventures, Stearne discovers the power the occult has and vows to rid the world of evil. \nAfter obsessively learning everything he can related to it, and medical theory surrounding it, he becomes MR. MONSTER! Or, an occult vigilante of sorts. Think Constantine or Hellboy but from the 40s. The series was printed throughout several titles before its final publication in 1947. \nRecoloured version of the original. Comic included in the book will be restored only.\nWhy Doc Stearne/Mr. Monster? \nThere are so many facets to the answer of this question. He began as just adventurer/doctor Jim Stearne during a time when comics were light hearted and mostly for kids. This was a time when superheroes were what the world needed. After the war ended, popular genres in comics shifted and to more adult tastes and the late 40s saw the early development of horror and romance comics. This is where Doc Stearne became Mr. Monster and bridged the gap between these popular genres. The comic was definitely ahead of its time. \nDoc Stearne/Mr. Monster is also one of the many great comics that came from the Canadian Golden Age. The first issue appeared circa 1943 and the final in 1947 making him one of the last Canadian Golden Age superheroes to be found in print, and one of even fewer to be found in colour! Mr. Monster\u2019s first recognized appearance was in the same colour issue that housed the only colour story of Nelvana of the Northern Lights, Super Duper #3. \nThis strange comic book hero has an even grander history. In the early 1980\u2019s, creator Michael T. Gilbert discovered the issue of Super Duper #3. So taken with the concept and lost history of the character he created his own stories derived from the original. Gilbert ushered his series to success as a comic book cult classic attracting guest writers such as Alan Moore, William Messner-Loebs and even an introduction by Will Eisner. \nFred Kelly\u2019s initial character remains a favourite to this day among many comic fans. \nOriginal panel excerpts from Super Duper #3.\nWho is producing this book? \nI am Rachel Richey, a deeply nerdy person regarding Canadian comics history, a part time illustrator and writer, and a longtime fan of Mr. Monster. I\u2019ve worked with the John Bell Collection of Canadian Comics at Library and Archives Canada, documenting, cataloguing and researching all kinds of Canadian comics. \nMost recently I\u2019ve also worked to produce Nelvana of the Northern Lights and Last summer\u2019s Johnny Canuck, both of which had hugely successful Kickstarters. So I know what I\u2019m doing.\nFun things in this Kickstarter\u2026\nSTRETCH GOALS!\nSTRETCH GOAL 27K UNLOCKED: THANK YOU PAGES WITH ALL BACKERS' NAMES IN THE BOOK!\nSTRETCH GOAL 30K UNLOCKED: ALL FUNDERS $25 AND UP GET A MR.

HILL. \nSTRETCH GOAL ADDED!!\nWith just over a week left and the first stretch goal hit, we figured it was time to announce the second stretch goal!\nIf we hit $50k by the end of the campaign we will be giving everyone at every level a seperate digital FABRIZIO FIORENTINO sketch book that will include the character designs- layouts-breakdowns-alternate pages and commentary. This will be a real inside look to the thoughts and process that make up the final product. On the main page you can get a taste of some of the original sketches and how amazing Fabrizios work looks before it goes to finishes. This book will be designed by John J Hill and will be delivered before the final book to get everyone excited ahead of time. If we hit the 50k, expect some more stretch goals to come, and thanks everyone for all your social media and word of mouth. It really has made a difference.\ncover by TIM BRADSTREET!\nThe Basics: Fans of our run on JONAH HEX and ALL STAR WESTERN are in for a treat as we offer a hard hitting and graphic, yet intensely dramatic character driven story in the same genre, free of any existing rating systems. \n With this graphic novel adaption of a screenplay by Spencer Marstiller, we introduce an unconventional western set in a town where illicit sex, gambling and even murder are legal under the right conditions.  The story art gorgeously illustrated  by FABRIZIO FIORENTINO, whom we collaborated with on ALL STAR WESTERN and this is complimented by the lush digital painting of  ALESSIA NOCERA. Also featured is a dynamic and beautiful cover by award winning illustrator TIM BRADSTREET , with special reward catagories featuring a special limited edition mystery cover by multiple Eisner and Shuster Award winner DARWYN COOKE and another special cover by award winning and fan favorite artist  AMANDA CONNER. We are happy to also announce our new partnership with  the awesome crew at ADAPTIVE  STUDIOS . \nThis entire square bound SOFTCOVER book will be a total of 72 pages plus material printed on the best paper stock available and printed in the USA. We need to raise the amount featured to cover production handling and distribution costs involved in producing an original graphic novel this big and beautiful. \nThe inspiration for this project comes from our love of mature westerns, murder mysteries and the horror genre as well as the original unpublished screenplay it is based on. This was a project we fell in love with immediately. \n\nTHE STORY:\n\n\u201cIn the distance the silhouette of a sprawling boomtown rises ominously from the earth like a gravestone risen from Hell.\u201d\n  Set in the late 1880\u2019s American West, Abbadon is a city steeped in sin, where anything is possible if you have the money, influence and power to obtain it. Poised to become the next boomtown, Abbadon is plagued by a series of murders heralding the arrival of U.S. Marshall Wes Garrett. A legendary lawman, Garrett\u2019s claim to fame is that he killed a notorious murderer, who cut a bloody swath across the country and left scores of mutilated men, women and children in his wake. Garrett\u2019s arrival exposes the secret that Abbadon\u2019s sheriff Colt Dixon has desperately been trying to conceal \u2013 the victims have all been mutilated the same way they were by the killer Garret stopped \u2013 a man some called a monster, but the papers called him Bloody Bill. Garrett and Dixon join forces to uncover the killer\u2019s identity in a town so full of corruption that everyone is a suspect.
