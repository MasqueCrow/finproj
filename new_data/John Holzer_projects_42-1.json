[{"backer": "John Holzer", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "New Stretch Goal Added! Tory Belleci becomes card #11. Details in Updates.\n---\nIt all started in 2010. \nFirst pass at the Geek A Week design influenced by Art Spiegleman's Wacky Packages created 3/2010\nIn the late winter of 2010, I hatched an idea that ended up becoming, and still is, a large part of my life: Geek A Week.  I did 5 successful seasons, 4 of which were funded through this very platform.  I did several additional exclusive sets for Discovery Channel\u2019s Mythbusters and it became a permanent part of my brand.  Geek A Week opened a myraid of doors for me creatively, allowing to work with and interact meaningfully with some of my geeky heroes. It changed my life dramatically. So it goes without saying that I wanted to do something special to commemorate the 10th anniversary. \nBut it all really started in 1999.\nThroughout the process, my wife and I were raising a family. A BIG family of seven children. My kids were growing up around me.  They witnessed me drawing some amazing people. They would come home from school and I would share who I was able to interview that day.  Weird Al Yankovic. Guillermo Del Toro. Neil Gaiman. Steve Wozniak. Stan Lee. It was mind-blowing. One of the kids who was observing all of this was my son, Maxmillian.\nMaxmillian Circa 2003\n All of my kids were interested in drawing and expressing themselves creatively, but Maxmillian was different.  He seemed to excel at anything he put his mind to whether it be his artwork, writing stories or playing bass with his brothers in their band, Lumpia (named affectionately after the delicious Filipino eggroll).\nMaxmillian and I in 2019\n\n Eventually he took up traditional painting in high school and his skills rapidly developed over the course of a few months.  Maxmillian is about to graduate from the Cleveland Institute of Art this spring, launching into the world as a highly skilled traditional painter and fine artist. He's amazingly talented and I can't do what he does. Here's a recent write-up about him. And here\u2019s some of his work:\nAlexa with Fendi, 60\u201d x 48\u201d, 2021, by Maxmillian Peralta\nDibbs and James, 60\u201d x 48\u201d, 2020, by Maxmillian Peralta\nLamar in Pleasures, 40\u201d x 30\u201d, 2019, by Maxmillian Peralta\nThe Scribe, 60\u201d x 48\u201d, 2020, by Maxmillian Peralta\nPortrait of Mr. Patel (Employees Only), 60\u201d x 36\u201d, 2020, by Maxmillian Peralta\nI had been thinking for a while that I wanted to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of Geek A Week with a symbolic changing of the guard. I wanted to hand over the reins to a new generation of artist. Someone with a youthful and unquenchable passion for art.  That is the basis for this project.  \nWe got you, Fam.\nPreliminary cover art for Geek A Week Masterpiece trading card set\nThis is the first project where I\u2019ve been able to collaborate artistically with one of my children. Geek A Week Masterpiece is a love letter to the reason I pushed so damn hard on this project 10 years ago. It helped me forge an identity as an artist and hopefully have it ultimately benefit my family.  Max has been following a similar path. And I am now seeing all his hard work come to fruition.  That\u2019s what makes it so exciting to try to make this type of project go.\nThe core of Geek A Week Masterpiece stays the same: Maxmillian and I are doing new physical and digital paintings of geeky people and turing them into trading cards. The difference is, we have chosen some of our favorites from over the past 10 years and given them a new spin. Max has applied his reniassance style to a brand new set of 5 paintings.  Not to be outdone, I've upped my style and done 5 new digital paintings of some of my favorites cards.  The images below are still in need of branding and layout so the end product may differ slightly than what is shown.\n The list of cards is:\nJonathan Coulton\nPaul and Storm\nFelicia Day\nKelly Sue DeConnick\nKari Byron\nBonnie Burton\nTrace Beaulieu and Frank Conniff\nVeronica Belmont\nSumalee Montano \n(young) Wil Wheaton\n10 cards for 10 years.\nJonathan Coulton\nPaul and Storm\nFelicia Day\nKari Byron\nKelly Sue DeConnick\nBonnie Burton\nTrace Beaulieu and Frank Conniff\nSumalee Montano\nVeronica Belmont\n(Young) Wil Wheaton\n This time around the cards will be oversized, 3.5 x 5 which seems apropos since the physical paintings are really large and deserve to be seen as best they can. See size difference below:\nA look at the size difference between previous Geek A Week card sets.\n3.5 x 5 oversize cards compared to the original card size\nWe\u2019re choosing to do a very simple reward system - a base set, an autographed set and versions of those sets with high quality prints.  We are also providing a few high level rewards where Maxmillian and I will paint portraits of you or even fly you out and give you the Royal Treatment with a pro photo shoot and a huge 60\u201d x 48\u201d physical portrait of you.\nSimple Add-ons\nWe have also have a few add-ons that you can add to any reward level.  \n\n Seasons 1 and 5 of the Geek A Week project which feature 100+ cards which are also a playable game.  Add that to any level for $30 + shipping.\nSeasons 1 and 5 of Geek A Week are a playable game designed by former Geek A Weekers, Mike Selinker and Kid Beyond.\n \u201cTop Fragging\u201d a 12 x 18 print based on the Valve game Counterstrike. Add it to any reward level for $35 + shipping.\nBudgeting\nAs you can see below with our project budgeting, the majority of our funding costs are to cover printing, shipping, Kickstarter fees and taxes. We have sourced a Cleveland-based printer so we can keep in control of the process and don't have to worry about unforeseen circumstances. The sets are more or less done and all that's left is to set them up to get them printed.  Both Maxmillian and I feel very confident that we can deliver these new sets on time and at a very high quality.\nAll in all, this is super exciting and we can\u2019t wait to get these in your hands.\nThank you for your support.\nLen and Maxmillian ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have done these in the past and successfully funded and fulfilled all of them.

And we have been working like maniacs to get this off the ground.\nIn the summer of 2020, the coffee workers of Augie\u2019s Coffee (that\u2019s us) attempted to unionize. With reminders to one another that it is against the law for employers to fire workers for unionizing still ringing in our ears, we nonetheless found ourselves illegally fired within days of presenting our union petition. This turning point set us on a quest to champion workers\u2019 rights, pursue justice with the National Labor Relations Board, and fight to gain our jobs back or stubbornly create new ones. From battling internet trolls to relentlessly popping up whenever and wherever society would have us, we have been working hard to make a living for ourselves. Along the way one thing has become clear: with each other and the help of our friends, we can bring actual change to our lives and our cities.\nSo here we are, the newborn magic baby \u201cSlow Bloom Coffee Cooperative.\u201d As a cooperative we are 100% worker owned, each one of us accountable to each other in a completely democratic spirit. We have no bosses, only ourselves. And we need your help!\nStarting a business is expensive, much more expensive than the initial goal we have set, but we need to start somewhere. To be honest, we need about $80,000 for one year of operation and this campaign would be a place to begin. We need a coffee roaster and a building to roast in and everything that endeavor entails. So we are selling awesome things that everyone loves like t-shirts, bumper stickers, and coffee mugs. We are offering you some even cooler things like fame and glory through personalized short stories, sweet lacquered plaques with your unforgettable name, and a literal Roast of you and your friends.\nHow can you help us achieve the co-op of our dreams?\n Create a Kickstarter account\n   Log in using your email and password (or Amazon account information)\n   Click on the rewards you so desire.\n   Share our project like crazy. Spread it to anyone and everyone you know, or we might not get any of the money. This is all or nothing so please, go wild!\n  What Will We Do With The Money?\n Buy a Coffee Roaster. Roasting coffee is not only how we make money in coffee, locally roasted coffee matters to the friends in our communities and it keeps dollars in our pockets and our cities. We have our eyes on a couple of coffee roasters that run between $15-20k. Our initial goal would cover some of this, but not all of it (not included in our goal is the cost of producing the sweet rewards for y'all).\n   Lease a Building. We have dear friends helping us find a building in Redlands and/or Riverside, but they cost money and in order to begin roasting coffee we need a building to roast in. While we would love to return to all of our communities immediately, this is rather difficult. So we are focusing our efforts on one space that can serve many purposes: a roasting space for coffee, a kitchen for brewing cold brew and prepping other menu items, and a front of the house cafe to (one day later) build out into a cafe once Covid is under control and the world is safe again. For now we hope to have a sort of permanent pop up scenario in the building in which take away drinks can be bought and enjoyed somewhere else!\n   Build Out the Space. Brewing coffee takes equipment we don\u2019t have and adherence to building codes that, again, costs lots of money. This goal will take time and oodles of cash but we can use whatever head start we can get. Equipment we need includes a batch brewer, espresso machine, grinders, countertops, water and gas hookups, etc. All of the good stuff.\n  Stretch Goals:\nEvery week we will be releasing new merch items to help keep the momentum going and keep offering you things we all love. The initial goal will be enough to buy a roaster, but not enough to build out a space to roast in. We\u2019d love to have a space to roast, a kitchen to brew in, and a bar to safely serve coffee out the door until Covid is under control and we can think about having a cafe once again. If we can hit our first stretch goal we will keep the ball rolling to raise funds for the build-out of this space.\nSweet Pics of Awesome Rewards:\nBeanie\nTote\nT-Shirt\nSuper Special T-shirt\n32oz Growler\nClassic Diner Mug\nSlow Bloom Trading Cards\nSolidarity Card", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a lot of rewards to offer. We handle this by making several of them exclusive versions of retail items we would otherwise sell and making many of them experience based and easier for us to deliver on. The biggest risk you take in this Kickstarter is the timeline. While we are already operating and many of these products are already close to existing, they may take a while to ship. The kickstarter will run for about 60 days so you can expect the items to take at least that long. Keep in mind, these are technically preorders and we will get them out ASAP if/when the goal is met. Some of the experiences can take even more time if they involve a building or equipment. \n\nBut all of this is overcome by loving generosity.

Whether you\u2019re working remotely, looking to maximize your workspace, or seeking more creative flexibility - Luna has you covered. As the only hardware solution on the market, you can...\nTurn any iPad into a wireless second display for your PC or Mac\nConnect via WiFi or USB \nExperience lag-free lightning-fast speeds\nUse any Windows or Mac app\nUtilize full touch support and external keyboard support \nChoose from two unit options for PC: USB-C or HDMI\n\nMore people than ever are working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're a fully-remote company ourselves \u2014 and have been since we started 7 years ago \u2014 so we truly understand the struggles of working remotely. That\u2019s why we built Luna Display!\nLife is better when your workflow works\u2014 \nNot enough screen space to work efficiently? Luna acts as a second display, so you can extend your workspace from your desktop to iPad.\nTraditional monitors leave you tethered to your desk. But Luna works wirelessly over your existing WiFi network \u2014 so you can move your workspace around your house, to the office, and everywhere in between. \nMobile second screen setups are often complex to set up and require lots of wires and tools. With Luna, you can pair a Windows or Mac computer to an iPad with just some apps and your Luna. No need to buy new screens - make the most out of what you have.\n\n\n\n\nLuna works with any Mac or Windows desktop application \u2014  \n\nLuna gives you the flexibility to work wherever you want, however you want. Whether it\u2019s stepping away from the confines of your desk to working from anywhere within your home, you can create the ultimate wireless setup with minimal effort. \nLuna will connect as long as both devices are on the same WiFi network. You can even take your workflow outdoors with a strong WiFi connection.\n\nWe've spent years building Luna\u2019s custom video compression technology we call LIQUID. Every line of LIQUID code was originally written to meet the demands of pro artists, and the result is stunning image quality and responsiveness. That means Luna can keep up with any heavy-duty workflow.\n\nUnlike our competitors, Luna\u2019s custom-engineering guarantees consistent performance across all of your favorite PC programs. Enjoy the same reliability of a traditional monitor but the flexibility of your iPad. \n\n\nTake your mobile workspace on the go without worrying about a bunch of cords or heavy clip-on screens. Just pack your laptop, iPad, and Luna and you\u2019re ready to go! \nLuna\u2019s hardware dongle is discreet, compact, and beautifully designed. Unlike other bulky tech accessories that take up space, Luna fits neatly in the compact box that it\u2019s sent in.\nEach box contains a Luna dongle, sculpted foam packing to safely hold it in place, and a simple card with instructions to help you get set up in seconds.\n\n\nLuna Display for Windows is available in two port types \u2014 USB-C or HDMI. \nIf you\u2019re a Mac user, Luna is available in USB-C or Mini DisplayPort (available for immediate purchase at lunadisplay.com). The USB-C version is compatible with both PC and Mac. \nYour purchase includes the Luna Display hardware unit along with access to the free Luna Display desktop and iPad apps.  \nNOTE: Luna for Mac is available in both mDP and USB-C. However, Luna USB-C for Mac will only contain Windows support after the Kickstarter. If you choose to purchase Luna USB-C through our Kickstarter, you'll receive special Kickstarter discounts and support our Windows effort.  \n\n\nTens of thousands of happy Mac users have already transformed their workflows with Luna Display. Here\u2019s what they have to say \u2014\n\u201cReally enjoying my new set up, thanks to Luna Display! Such a great tool to expand workflows. \ud83d\ude4c\u201d  \u2014Travis V.\n\u201cGenuinely blown away by how well it works. Never thought I\u2019d ever be able to use a desktop computer whilst laying on the sofa. Thanks Luna Display!\u201d \u2014Alastair M.\n\"This little device from Luna Display is incredible! It allows me to use an iPad as a second screen wirelessly with retina resolution. 2 min out of the box and up and running. \ud83d\udc4d\u201d  \u2014Shane D.\n\u201cMuch needed second screen for my 13\u201dMBP when not at my desk. Big workflow gain. Works great over WiFi or tethered USB.\u201d \u2014David T.\n\u201cI just got my Luna Display in the mail, and it's incredible. Truly feels like the iPad Pro is just another monitor.\u201d \u2014Zack K.\n\u201cReally happy with my LunaDisplay. I use it constantly when I travel. Such a beautifully engineered solution, a real \u201cIt just works\u201d piece of kit.\u201d \u2014Harrison T. \n\u201cThis device is such a game changer for me. For somebody that works offsite and needs more screen real estate in apps like After Effects, Luna Display knocks it out of the park. And there\u2019s little to no lag because it works off a solid WiFi connection. Highly recommend!!\u201d \u2014Miles F.\n\u201cI can take my iPad and the mouse to another part of a room and control the Mac - perfect for home recording / microphone chamber. Luna Display is great!\u201d \u2014Hannes O.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried almost all of the \u2018use your iPad as a second display\u2019 options and the ONLY one that legitimately delivered on the promise is Luna Display \u2013 thank you for making this!\u201d \u2014Stephen S.\n\u201cStill can\u2019t believe how solid Luna has been day to day. Literally feels like I\u2019m using a retina touch screen Mac when it\u2019s open.\u201d \u2014Daniel P.\n\u201cJust set up my Luna Display! I don't remember the last time I've ever been so excited about a piece of tech. My two screens and I thank you.\u201d  \u2014Lauren B.\n\u201cThe speed and resolution are head and shoulders over software-only solutions!\u201d \u2014Martin L. \n\nSimply plug in Luna, launch the apps, and your devices will automatically connect! Luna for Windows is available for USB-C or HDMI.\n\nPlug Luna into your Windows computer. (You do not need to plug in a Luna into your iPad!)\nLaunch the respective Luna Display apps on your Windows computer and your iPad. \nNow you're up and running! \n\n\nWith full support for external keyboards, Apple Pencil, and touch interactions, Luna allows you to harness the power of your PC while extending your display to the iPad.

We\u2019re launching Astropad for Windows next year.\n\nAstropad offers complete workflow customization, featuring a packed suite full of creatives tools like unlimited workflow shortcuts, Magic Gestures, and custom pressure curves. Pairing Luna with Astropad gives professional creatives the freedom and flexibility that their workflow deserves.\nCount on your fingers to give you a hand! You don\u2019t have to go to Hogwarts to use Magic Gestures. Save room in the sidebar by assigning frequently-used shortcuts to finger-touch and tap interactions.\nPut the pressure on, or take the pressure off! Whichever way you lean, we\u2019ve got you covered. If the automatic pressure sensitivity of the Apple Pencil doesn\u2019t work for you, no sweat! Customize the pressure curve to your individual drawing preferences.\nThe curve settings in Studio helps you preview your adjustments, so you can better understand the changes you\u2019re making. Test the curve\u2019s pressure sensitivities at any time by pressing anywhere on your screen outside of the sidebar while the Pressure Curve settings are open.\nWho said taking shortcuts has to be a bad thing? No matter what your workload might look like, we\u2019ll keep up with you. Set up your perfect workflow and tool alignment just once, so you can come back to your perfectly-organized, on-screen desk every time. Free up your time and self to creativity!\nShortcuts automatically adjust when you switch apps, too. Even if you haven\u2019t already established shortcuts for an app, the Studio shortcut sidebar comes equipped with the most common tools in each app to get you started!\n\n\nWe\u2019re a small but mighty team of problem-solvers, creatives, engineers, and dreamers. \nAstropad was founded in 2013 by two former Apple engineers, Matt Ronge and Giovanni Donelli. Today, we\u2019re a nimble crew of 16 people. Within our tiny powerhouse, we have a Windows-focused engineering team; a Luna hardware and firmware team; and a dedicated team of technical support experts. \nWe\u2019ve always been a fully-remote company, with team members located around the world. Because of this, we\u2019ve made it our mission to build products that make life easier for other creative people that work remote. \nWe\u2019re a 100% bootstrapped company. We\u2019ve never taken outside investment, which is why we rely on communities like Kickstarter to help bring our products to life. \nPLAY\n\n A look at our prototypes:\nHere's a demo of the prototype hardware we used to shoot our main video:\nPLAY\n\n\n\nWe are looking for your support through Kickstarter to help us pay for our next large-scale manufacturing round. Here\u2019s what Luna\u2019s development timeline looks like:\nWe originally launched Luna Display for Mac on Kickstarter in 2017. Our campaign was wildly successful, raising over $645K \u2014 2,100% more than our original funding goal!\nNow we\u2019re back and ready to bring Luna Display to Windows. And this time around, we\u2019ve streamlined every aspect of Luna\u2019s production, so we can ship to you as soon as possible:\n\u2014 Strengthened relationship with our manufacturing partner \nOver the past few years, we\u2019ve cultivated a loyal and transparent relationship with our manufacturing partner in China. Before the pandemic, our cofounder Giovanni was taking quarterly trips to our factory to assess assembly processes and product quality. Over these many trips, we\u2019ve built a strong partnership with our Chinese team, and they are excited to come on this journey with us to launch Luna to the Windows market! \n\u2014 Scaled up distribution to accommodate more volume and countries\nOur distribution center in Atlanta, Georgia has scaled up to accommodate increased volume with our new Windows market. And since our last Kickstarter, we\u2019ve expanded our shipping capabilities to over 55 countries around the world. Our shipping timelines have been on-time and on-track, with few impacts since the pandemic hit. \n\u2014 Tripled the size of our Technical Support Team\nIn preparation for the Windows community, we\u2019ve tripled the size of our Technical Support Team. Timely and thorough responses are our top priority, as well as fully understanding our exciting new customer base. Our Support Team also works hand-in-hand with our Engineering Team for troubleshooting and providing immediate product feedback.  \n\u2014 Hired a team of dedicated Windows engineers\nTo build the best product experience possible, we hired a team of talented software engineers that are dedicated to Windows compatibility. As we launch Luna for Windows, our engineering team is standing by to fix bugs and launch new product features!\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2014 Developing cross-platform technology \nWe knew that building Luna Display for Windows would be an uphill battle. Like all of our products, we started from scratch. This meant learning an entirely new coding language and rebuilding our core Liquid technology to be faster, more durable, and work smoothly on Windows. We also hired a new team of Windows developers to help us ramp up development.\n\n\u2014 Getting to know the Windows community \nIn our cross-platform journey, we\u2019ve had to admit that we\u2019re in new territory, which means understanding a new audience. As we make strides in delivering on our Windows promise, we\u2019re dedicated to making our products better than ever. To better understand our new Windows audience, we\u2019ll be conducting ongoing market research about how our users like to be productive with Luna Display. \n\n\u2014 Production during a global pandemic \nNow that we\u2019re approaching the finish line, we\u2019re cognizant of the risks of production during the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s our goal to ship Luna Display for Windows on-time, but the health and safety of the employees producing our USB-C and HDMI units is critical.

Please spread the word in all the ways you can to anyone who might be into it. Like everyone else, I'm doing all I can to stay healthy, creative & sustainable in these strange & stressful times. Making music is the only real job I've ever had. It's also my favorite way to take care of myself, and offer love & support to the world. Like I wrote in the video, music helps me through, and I want whatever I make to help as many people as possible. I think that's what art is for.\nIt's been a minute since I've made an album. After releasing Me And You Are Two in 2014(?!?), I wrote a book about fatherhood & music, made a rad EP with J & Zach Jawbox, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Water & Solutions, updated my website (feat. a sweet online community), found a way to make all the different merch designs from over the years easily available, played a gazillion more shows... and then, just as I was getting ready to finally make a new album and do some touring around it, crazy-ass 2020 came along and turned everything upside-down. I try to just do the best I can no matter what's going on, so I've used the unexpected downtime to really think on what feels important and fun for me right now.\nOver the years, I've realized that while I'll always love making stuff at home on my own, there's something about collaboration that lights me up in totally different ways. Right now, in this time of social distancing and the loneliness that can come with it, I'm wanting more than ever to make something truly collaborative. It's gonna take more time & money to do it this way, and I know it'll be worth it for all involved, including you. Speaking of which, beyond the basic album-related rewards, I focused on more personal ways of interacting with you, from making you personal recordings to helping you make yr own. If my ideas spark ideas for you that aren't included in this project, let's figure it out.\nSo yea, as for this album: I want to finally, properly combine what I love about my solo/home stuff with what I love about my band/studio stuff. Jeremy Tappero is the perfect partner for that. We've made records and toured together in onelinedrawing, New End, and Gratitude. In the years since then, while I've been doing my thing, he's become a pretty amazing multi-instrumentalist, studio engineer, and producer. When we were talking the other day, he said his favorite instrument is the studio itself, and it reminded me: over the years, I've figured out that my favorite instrument to 'play' isn't my voice or the guitar, but the song/idea itself. It's gonna be fun to join forces. We're going to make something I could never make on my own. We're also going to be bringing in other people to play & sing on stuff & be part of it. I'm not gonna drop any names just now, but if our dreams come true, some real neat surprises await. Speaking of surprises, if/when we hit our goal, we have lots of fun bonus rounds in mind.\nPlease be a part of this project. Please spread the word. Please help us keep going through these no-touring times, and enjoy a lot of music & ideas along the way. \nThanks always & forever, for real.\nxo Jonah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've made a lot of stuff over the years, and a lot of you have been with me the whole way.

It's called 'Self Care,' and it's our first full length in six years.

We've recruited the incredibly talented Jeremy Hunter AKA Skatune Network to join the ranks of We Are The Union.

'Self Care' is already recorded, mixed, and mastered! We paid for everything up until this point out of our own pockets. Our goal is not to make a quick buck, or even to make back the money spent on the album thus far. Rather, the goal is to make the release of 'Self Care' something truly special, by functioning as our own record label - with all of you as our partners! That means we need to:\nGenerate physical copies for 'Self Care,' including vinyl & CDs\nCreate our own music videos, lyric videos, and other visual content to accompany the record with the help of our resident videographer, Chris Graue\nRun our own marketing, and yes, that means paying for ads. It's not glamorous, but it is true. In 2018, cutting through the static of an oversaturated music market means creating some (hopefully) cool content and spending money to get it to people's eyes and ears.\nPay Justin Gray & Eden Kittiver for the art, photo, and design of the 'Self Care' artwork\nPay for 'Who We Are' vinyl from Bad Time Records\nIf we meet our third and final stretch goal, pay ourselves back for the recording\nAnd of course, as with every Kickstarter project, we'll have to pay out nearly 15% of every dollar we generate, plus cover perk fulfillment costs\nDon't you need to be signed to a record label to be successful?\nWe certainly don't think so. There's no right or wrong path as an artist, but to us, success is finding the best way to bring the experience we envision directly to you.\nWe want to control every aspect of the record making process, so what you get is an unfiltered, real work of art. If a record label were to get involved, the experience would change dramatically as we tried to fit into their cookie cutter release plan. The truth is we don't want to just sit back and expect a record label or a manager to make this record a success. We want the opportunity to put in the hard work ourselves and make this happen on our terms. Further, our hope is that we can, in some small way, shake things up and inspire others to take control of their art, too.\nSimply put, this is our divorce from a broken industry that leeches off of the very artists it depends on. This is our declaration of independence. This is our Self Care.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's hard to say what to put here!

See this update on Kickstarter for details on the stretch goal and a new feature called Safe Replies.\nHi, my name is Manton Reece, and I\u2019m writing a book called Indie Microblogging. I'm also launching a brand new platform for microblogs.\nDo you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?\nIn the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren\u2019t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.\nToday, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can\u2019t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.\nI want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.\nI first set out to build a new service just for microblogs.

Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.\nI love real books, too, so I\u2019m even doing a limited run of print copies of the book in addition to the standard e-book. There are also rewards with Micro.blog stickers and more.\nOver the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles to my blog about independent microblogging and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing \u2014 as well as brand new essays and technical topics \u2014 to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into it.\nThere's a growing community and movement around independent microblogging.

Since anyone can post kits to the marketplace, you can find kits from your favorite home brewing forum members, your favorite brewing magazines, and even your favorite breweries. The site allows buyers to find kits that have won competitions, subscribe to their favorite authors, and to submit feedback about purchased kits to other potential buyers.\nHome brewers who have created great home brewing recipes will love to sell their kits on Kit Lab. Brewers can can upload recipes once and earn income off of their kits for life. The more highly rated authors' kits are, they more they will sell.\nOrganizations such as brew clubs, non-profits, brewing publications and breweries will all love using their existing platforms to sell kits and further fund their organizations.\nAuthors will be paid $1/gallon for the entire life of their kits.

Jake brews at least once a week. At least.\nJay Darden\nProviding support with warehouse planning and logistics, Jay managed a branch of a national retail/warehouse business.\nWe've been busy laying the foundation for a successful launch - here are some of the wholesale accounts we hold which help make this all possible.\nBSG Handcraft\nBrewcraft USA\nFermentap\nSeven Bridges Cooperative", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a few major challenges that we have to designed around in order to get Kit Lab off the ground.\n\nStock - We're essentially creating a marketplace that will allow you to upload any recipe you can think of, which could lead to unmanageable stock needs. The plan is to launch with a base set of ingredients (for instance, only one or two brands of grain, DME, LME etc) and expand the ingredient selection the instant we can. In the rare cases where a kit uses a very unique ingredient, the plan is to source the ingredient as quick as possible and ship the kit the second the ingredient arrives to the warehouse.\n\nPlagiarism - The recipes will be screened through the same sort of tools that college professors screen term papers through. It's actually really easy to spot direct rip-offs in an automated fashion, so that will keep the plagiarism down for sure. As far as small tweaks and changes? That's a bit of a gray area, but our feelings are if you've taken a recipe and put your own spin on it, you've added something original to it and its ok to call it yours. We also believe that the home brewing community is proud of their original creations and they kind of self police when someone does try to say \"Hey look at this new IPA I made. It's call Bliny the Belder.\" That's usually shamed out of existence pretty quickly :)\n\nIt's also worth mentioning as well that strictly speaking, you can't copyright a recipe. Nor can you copyright/patent a common production process. So really, its not actually illegal to represent someone else's recipe as your own. Just a super dick move. And something we will not tolerate as moderators.\n\nAnywho, the TLDR on the whole question is we'll have a very public frowny face regarding plagiarism, tools in place to screen the most obvious copies out, human moderators, and we'll feature the folks doing the best original work.\n\nTransparency - How will authors know that we are being honest about sales numbers? Each author will have their own dashboard when they log in so they can view every sale they've ever made, how much profit they've earned in a given period, etc. So the platform, which is made from open source pieces (so not secretive and specific to us) is pretty darn transparent. That, and we're looking to foster an awesome community of happy, engaged homebrewers, and stealing from them would kind of run counter to that goal :)\n\nEfficiency - Since each kit will be made to order and it will be impossible to pre-make any part of the kits, efficiency of employee processing could be an issue. We've designed recipe/order sheets that will help kit packing to happen as quickly as possible.\n\nShipping Rates - We'd like to offer the fastest and lowest shipping rates we can to all our customers, but until we start actually shipping kits out the door, we're not going to be able to negotiate better rates with the shipping carriers. This isn't as much of a challenge as it is just a reality that we've planned for. Shipping rates will start around $15 for a five gallon kit and drop soon after we start shipping at volume.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ryan Sanders\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nKit Lab is designed and built primarily by Ryan Sanders, owner of betterbeerkits.com, Web Design Lead at Lulus.com, and adjunct professor of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Kit Lab Passes $3,000 and Appears In Slate.com", "update_content": "Evening Labbers,\nJust a quick update for you to let you know that we've passed $3,000 and that we got a cool little write-up in Slate today!

Nick will be displaying his series of Brew Master portraits in our Tasting Room space during our Grand Opening month. Support Nick's Kickstarter (California BrewMasters) as he strives to reach his funding goal by Tuesday evening, March 18th!\nA little over a year ago, I was enjoying a weekend BBQ at our home with our family and friends. It's in our nature that where ever we live, our home becomes a gathering place. You know, the house on the block where everyone hangs out. On that beautiful Saturday afternoon, we were all enjoying the day. As I paused and looked around the BBQ, I saw my one-year-old use my sister as a monkey gym. I watched my three-year-old stare in wonder into her Godmother's eyes. I witnessed my 76-year-old Dad having a deep conversation with a friend, 40 years his junior. I watched my husband race my five-year-old, serve ribeye to our friends and enjoy a glass of craft beer, all at the same time and never spilling a drop.\nAs I took it in, I realized that our friends \u2014 from school, from our new neighborhood, and from the old \u2014 were family. All as important to us as our parents, sisters, brothers and kids. Just as I smiled, my husband Jonathan looked at me, handed me a glass of beer and gave me a little wink and smile. I took a sip. At that moment, I knew what I wanted to do. What I had to do. In that pint glass was no ordinary craft beer. It was actually my beer. A beer that I brewed myself just a few weeks before. And in that moment, I founded Three Weavers Brewing Company.\nNow one year later, I am so excited that I can barely find the words I want to share with you. Three Weavers Brewing Company is no longer a proud idea on the tip of my tongue. It is my new passion. It is my friends, my family, my hard work and my creative soul. All bottled and ready to share. Three Weavers is more than a beer, even more than a brewing company. Three Weavers is the very embodiment of our kids, our family, our friends and our community. It embodies all that we share our lives with. \nToday, Three Weavers Brewing Company is proud to be among the first woman owned craft breweries. And we are even prouder to have our very own brewmaster, Alexandra Nowell, at the helm. Alexandra, at only 28, is an award winning brewmaster and together we are excited to bring our Three Weavers community to you.\nIn our very important first year, Three Weavers has embarked on the constuction of a production brewery and tasting room in Inglewood, California. We even got to brew some collaboration beers with our friends at Noble Ale Works in Anaheim, CA and Golden Road Brewing in Los Angeles. \nWith our passion, our ideas, and of course, our amazing beer, I hope you, the Kickstarter community, will join us in building our dream brewery.\nThree Weavers Brewing Company. It\u2019s more than beer. It\u2019s community.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nThree Weavers was created with one goal in mind: create a community through beer. Our community is not defined by physical walls, but by gathering with friends and family over Three Weavers' beers in our backyard, at our kitchen table or even in our Tasting room.\nFrom the beginning the tasting room has held the heart of our brewery along with our notion of community.  We want to give our community a place to gather.  We envision a space that nurtures all friendships, old and new. A place that allows us to support local artists and non-profit organizations. Our tasting room will weave together our beer, our community and the arts. \nNon-profit Night\nOne Friday night a month we will sponsor a non-profit organization selected by the Three Weavers staff and Three Weavers Imperial Pint Glass holders. Check out our website for details.  \nLow Cost Gallery Space for Artists\nWe want to promote local artists through our brand and tasting room. The large walls of the tasting room will be designed to showcase art. Three Weavers compensation as a gallery will be a fraction of what today's galleries charge. We want the artist to be compensated for their art. \nAdditionally, we will be holding an annual art contest for local artists to create artwork for our beer bottles. The winning artist selected by Three Weavers staff and the Three Weavers Imperial Glass holders, will receive compensation for their artwork as well as kick off the current year's art shows. Runner-ups in the annual art contest will be given an opportunity to have art shows throughout the year. Check out our website for details.  \nThe Design\nWe've acquired the equipment and the team necessary to make our brewery successful. We have dedicated 1200 sq. ft. of our 11,300 sq. ft. production facility to the brewery's tasting room. Three Weavers will begin brewing in May and the tasting room will be ready to serve you in June pouring the freshest Three Weavers beer you can get. In addition to our core line up of beers and seasonal releases, we will also have offerings that will only be found at the tasting room. \nFunds will be used to implement the design by Jeremy Taylor Designs. We asked Jeremy to use as much recycled and repurposed material as possible. The minimum of $25,000 will allow us to get a great start on the space. It will fund the construction and installation of the bars, taps and cold storage. It will also cover the cost of lighting and construction of our tables and benches. Lynne just got a great deal on beautiful vintage bowling lanes that will be incorporated into light fixtures and table tops. Jeremy is stoked!\nStretch Goals\nDid we mention that we plan to have some outdoor space? Almost unheard of in Sunny Southern California, right?!? If you find us worthy and we fund more than our initial $25,000, we plan to spend the money on:\nExtra special design details like recycled doors for wall texture.\nConstruction of our outdoor seating area/deck.  \nOutdoor Picnic tables and chairs.\nCool landscaping to make the area lush and nice.\nRewards\nWe have some really great rewards heading your way, check them out!\nThree Weavers hats and bottle openers!\nThree Weavers founder made keychain (not kidding, Lynne made them by hand.)\nThree Weavers wool socks for men and women (Lynne did NOT make these by hand.)\n64 oz. glass growler\nThree Weavers t-shirts for men and women\nFlowy Circle Top Heather Grey\nCircle Top Black\nMen's Coffee\nMen's Grey\n64 oz. ceramic Founder's growler from Portland Growler Company\nCheck out Jonathan's BBQ skills here. \nThe Three Weavers Team\nCurrently, we are a small team with a lot of drive and big dreams. Lynne Weaver is the founder of Three Weavers, with a background in finance and a passion for craft beer who has decided to turn her love of homebrewing into a business. Lynne has the dedication and energy that is crucial to building a craft brewery, but sought someone with experience in the brewing industry to join the team. Enter Alexandra Nowell, a seasoned brewer with west coast flair, drawn to the Three Weavers project by a desire to build something great in an emerging craft beer scene. She's worked in craft breweries of all sizes, and even has a few national awards under her belt. All Alexandra really wants to do it create great beers, and if she can make a few people happy in the process, then that's awesome too.\nChris Gonzales, Assistant Brewer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're covering all the bases.

For production, we will increase the size of the metal surface amplifying the attraction effect of the magnets located in the charger. These magnets drive the charger into position allowing the charging of the battery. In the video you will notice the charging icon of charging turning on when the charger is engage and off when the charger is been remove from the Pebble.\nI proudly supported the Pebble watch through its Kickstarter campaign a few years ago. The love for my pebble watch has motivated me to create a custom armor system to protect and enhance it. I have dedicated a significant amount of time over the past few months designing; engineering and prototyping this protective armor for the Pebble and have recently coordinated production, quality control and logistics through an expert partner, Align Machine Works (www.alignmachineworks.com).\nI NEED you, Pebble lovers, to help me get the initial manufacturing started by becoming a backer for my project and by sharing this project with every single Pebble lover that you know.\nGet it Knighted\nPRODUCTION PLAN\nWe are working with Align Machine Works to produce Production Level Tooling, Manufacturing, Quality Control, Freight Logistics and Distribution in the US.Align Machine Works' specializes in helping companies with international manufacturing and supply chain management as well as quality development and enforcement. Align Machine Works' expertise in manufacturing will ensure the seamless and timely development of the Pebble Knight, from Tooling Ramp Up through inbound Freight and Distribution to our backers.\nFor this project: We will make the tooling from production steel, using both EDM and CNC milling. EDM stands for Electical Discharge Machining. EDM is an efficient way to make high quality, precision tooling. EDM is a manufacturing process where a desired shape is obtained using electrical discharges (sparks). (The files are engineered and ready to go)\n Material is removed from the tool by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid that is subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the \u2018tool\u2019 or \u2018electrode\u2019, while the other is called the workpiece-electrode.\n In addition to EDM, the tooling will also be produced through CNC milling.The CNC (Computer Numeric Control) mill process is another way to make high quality/precision tooling.A mill machine takes computer code from a CAD file and interprets that in to a number of coordinates, or paths, that the mill travels to cut out the desired shape.\nThis process is going to take close to 4 weeks.\nBelow is a photo from Align Machine Works of EDM in action:\nAlign Machine Works of EDM\nBelow is another photo from Align Machine Works of a CNC milled part.\nAlign Machine Works CNC milled part\nOnce the tools are complete, the parts will be made from a Die Casting process. Die Casting is similar to injection molding, but where injection molding processes plastic, die casting typically processes aluminum or aluminum alloys. For the Pebble Knight, we are Die Casting a material called ADC12, which is a high strength, high definition Aluminum Alloy. Align Machine Works has produced many Die Cast parts made from this alloy and they have the expertise to manufacture the Pebble Knight and complete the finishing (polishing, anodizing, packaging).\nThe Die Casting of the parts will provably take 3 to 4 weeks depending on the quantity.\nOnce the tools are complete and the parts are manufactured, Align Machine Works will put the parts through a statistically significant, 15 point quality check. The quality check will ensure that the parts being manufactured and shipped are exactly what we need. Align Machine Works will check the fit and function of the parts, ensure the materials and finishes are correct and will check the packaging and export requirements to ensure the parts are shipped to the US effectively and timely.\nQuantity control will take approximately 1 week.\nAlign Machine Works global freight forwarding network will then transport the parts from Asia to the US.\nShipment from China to US 3- 5 weeks (In this way we can keep our shipping cost low)\nOnce parts arrive in the US, Align Machine Works' Freight Forwarding Network will process the parts through US Customs and deliver them to the Align Machine Works distribution center. Align Machine Work's distribution center will handle all of the shipping and outbound freight to our backers, getting parts shipped out in a timely and efficient manner.\nUS Customs & Shipment to backers in the US 1-2 weeks\nProduction plan schedule.

Now it's ready for a smooth transition in to manufacturing. After SLA models, we evaluated the performance and tolerances of the part in order to create the metal components. We collaborated with ours supply chain to create 2 sets of prototypes: one made of aluminum and one made of stainless steel. These metal prototypes have given us an immense advantage to learn about final assembly and durability as well as testing the KNIGHT in the field.

It takes homebrewing to the next level giving you ultimate control over your brewing, any time any where.  \nIts hardware and software are open source so you can hack it and modify it all you want to meet the needs of your brew system, fermentation system or any other project that requires precise control of temperature.\nHow can it help me make better beer?\nTemperature control is often overlooked by many homebrewers, but is actually one of the easiest things you can do to make professional quality beer.\nThe Model-T will help you keep your fermentation and mash temperatures where you want them to be. Resulting in beer that you can be proud of!\nI'm not a brewer, why do I want one? \nThe device is currently marketed towards brewers but can be used to control power to any electronic device from the unit itself or through BrewBit.com.  You do not have to use the temperature probe to control the outputs if you don't want. You can have the outputs turn on and off manually via your command, or even based on time of day etc...  With our open source hardware and software architecture the device is extremely hack-able, making the possibilities endless.  \nSome of the cool non-brewing project ideas that we thought of, several that we have even tried, are:\nSolder re-flow oven controller using a toaster oven or hot plate.\nFish tank heating/cooling controller.\nReptile terrarium heating controller.\nControl a Crockpot, BBQ, oven, or even a George Foreman grill, helping you cook your meats to perfection.\nMake your own electronic meat smoker.\nMake your own Sous Vide machine.\nControl fans and AC units in your house, workshop etc.\n\nWhat can it do?\nSample Temperature Profile\nDual outputs - control multiple devices with a single Model-T\nDual temperature probes - control one or both outputs independently\nSupports Wall Mounting\nSupports Panel Mounting\nHow does it compare?\n(\u2020) Up to 20 A with a NEMA 5-20 cable and power outlet. Unit ships with a NEMA 5-15 cable rated for 15 A.\n(*) Denotes the estimated true cost of shipping, handling and completing the unit with similar features to the Model-T.  Most of the units above require electrical wiring for the unit to make it operational, which would include at least the following items (not to mention the skills to do it without electrocuting yourself or starting a fire!):\nelectrical wall plug with cable\nsingle or dual electrical outlet \nelectrical box\nelectrical box cover\nromex\nwire nuts/crimps\nwire cutters/strippers \nmultimeter\nThe BrewBit Model-T requires no wiring and is ready to hook up and go right out of the box.  There are no hidden costs or extra work!  The price you see listed includes shipping and handling fees (within the US).\nWhere is the money going?\nOur Vision\nOur goal is to build a family of devices that all work together to give you a unified picture of what\u2019s happening to your beer through all stages, from mashing to fermenting. We want to give everyone affordable tools to brew better beer and the Model-T is the first step towards that.\nWhere are we now?\nWe have produced several working prototypes of the final product using 3D printed plastics and PCBs from a manufacturer in the USA.  We hand placed all the PCB surface-mount components and soldered the through-hole ones ourselves.  We have gotten the units fully working and operational.  We have been using one of our prototypes to control our keezer and fermentation cabinet and another as a solder reflow oven controller to help us manufacture our PCBs. \nSome of the features of the Model-T currently include:\nOpen Source hardware and software.  You\u2019ll get all the code, schematics, drawings and software. Hack away and share your work with the BrewBit community!\nWireless connectivity over your WiFi network\nExecute temperature profiles loaded via WiFi connection from your account on BrewBit.com.\nControl from anywhere with Internet connection\nSleek, intuitive user interface\nSelf tuning PID control\nDual independent outputs\nDual independent temperature probes\nControl one, both, or none (logging only) of the outputs\nAssociate your data with a defined brewing session.\nWirelessly upgrade your unit when we roll out new software.\n\nFrom our website, you will be able to monitor and control the unit.  Some of the cool features that we have added, or currently working on, for the website are:\nFree API for your data and device. Develop your own killer features!\nModify all of your Model-T\u2019s settings and have them applied over WiFi\nCheck on the units status and readings\nLog the Model-T\u2019s data\nDisplay temperature graphs that are updated in real time\nAssociate temperature readings with a certain brewing/fermentation session.\nGet email or SMS alerts when something happens or the unit is having issues\nCreate and save unique temperature profiles\nLoad a temperature profile and send it to your device over WiFi\nSet the Model-T to ferment/mash your beer for any duration at a set temperature\nStep the temperature up or down automatically\nAdd as many temperature/time steps to the temperature profile as you need.\nIf you have other ideas or suggestions for a killer app please feel free to let us know, or you can implement them yourself via our open source software and easy to use web API!\nWhat's next?\nOnce we are funded, we will be able to immediately start production. Our current estimates target initial shipment in February 2014.\nProduction schedule\nThis includes:\nBuilding molds for the injection molded plastic parts\nGetting the PCBs manufactured\nGetting the wiring harnesses manufactured\nFinal assembly and testing of the product\nFCC Certification\nProduct Safety Certification\n\nProduct Implementation ideas\nHere are some awesome ideas on how the Model-T can be used for both brewing and non brewing projects:\nFermentation fridge build:\nDual Probe Model-T Uses:\n\nBrewBit Model-T 3D-printed prototype - The final version will be injection molded and will look much nicer\nI'm an uber-nerd, tell me more!\nARM Cortex M3 - STM32F2 series microcontroller (120 MHz)\nInventek Systems WiFi module (802.11 b/g/n)\nResistive touch screen LCD (320 x 240 pixels)\nFlash memory (If your WiFi drops out you won't lose any data!)\nDevice Dimensions: 5.2\" x 3\" x 2.3\" (W x H x D) \nSupports wall mounting and panel mounting\nUniversal input voltage: 100-240VAC\nPrototype power supply board\nPrototype control board\nModel-T Teardown:\n\n\nReward T-Shirt Design\nFront and back of T-shirt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all hardware projects, actually getting the final product manufactured is always a challenge. We still need to get molds created for injection molding the plastic housing , since 3D printing every unit would not be within budget.

Or that guy that hosts a show about Android. Or that guy who's really, really tall (or so they say. And they would be right.)\nBefore all of this podcast stuff, I was a musician and certifiable audio nerd. I'm a multi-instrumentalist and I've written music covering a number of genres throughout my life: Punk, Rock, Industrial, House, Trance, and Folk to name a few. But Yellowgold has always been my solo rock/indie project with over 20+ years worth of original material, all written, recorded, and mixed by yours truly.\nIn 2009, I decided to release my then latest album, The Mellower, on Bandcamp for free with the option to pay what you want, and demand was much more than I ever anticipated. Enough people chose to pay for the album that I was able to put that money back into my music and buy a new Les Paul guitar. Music funding more music.\nWhere is Yellowgold now?\nI've spent the past year writing, recording and mixing nine new tracks for an upcoming album which I've called Ever One. I've spent countless hours perfecting these tracks and I'm incredibly proud of what I've created. Truth be told, I'd be writing music whether I ever intended to release it unto the world or not, but enough people have asked about it that I again plan on releasing the album for anyone interested.\nBut I've always wanted to get my music professionally mastered. And this album feels like the right album with which to finally do so. Mastering means I hand over the finished recordings to a trained professional with an impeccable studio designed to pay attention to the sonic elements within the tracks and treat them so they sound good in all environments: Your stereo, car, headphones, laptop speakers, everywhere. It's the icing on the cake, and that's one cake that isn't a lie.\nWhy are we here right now?\nMastering isn't cheap. Neither is a nice run of CDs for those who aren't ready to go full-on digital with their music purchases. The beauty of this Kickstarter is that I've already done a bunch of the work and the recordings are pretty much complete. I just need help bringing it to the finish line.\nWhat is in it for you?\nIf you were planning on picking up a copy of the album already, this is your chance to score some cool and unique swag along with it. I've worked hard at offering a number of different funding price points and each offers a healthy dose of extra cool stuff, including even more music! Who doesn't love more music!  There is even an album art poster done by the one and only Scott Johnson that I think is super cool.\nOr, maybe you aren't in it for the music. Maybe you are an aspiring digital online media baron. Hey! I do digital online media for a living! (minus the baron part.) I might be able to help you in your quest of world (wide web) domination.\nTake a look at all that I offer and I'm confident there's a little something for everybody.\nWhat if it goes beyond the goal?\nThat's where the stretch goals come in and though I'm not listing those in advance, rest assured that I'll have some cool stuff to toss into the ring if this project goes above and beyond the initial goal.\nWhat happens once the album is officially released?\nI should be upfront with this so there is no confusion: Ever One will be available FOR FREE with the option to pay what you want, once the album is released for reals. So, if you are pitching in here, I hope it's because you want to see my project come to fruition--and see the goodies as a nice bonus. Cause I know I do!\nThanks for all of you support in advance.

We needed suitable and widely adopted devices to pair with the keyboard\n2. There was no easy way to connect the keyboard (writing and maintaining separate drivers for all the different devices was very painful and expensive)\n3. Mobile internet didn't exist, substantially limiting the usefulness for such devices\nHewlett and Packard famously started in a garage, as did the two Steves of Apple fame. We didn\u2019t have a garage \u2013 only a carport. We bought a small, numerically-controlled milling machine and started trying to make working prototypes. We used wood, metal and cannibalized commercial keyboards for parts. We could only use the \u201cfunction\u201d keys, as they were the only ones thin enough, so we needed a lot of keyboards. Brunn's oldest son would acquire and send us broken keyboards from his college IT department.\nEarly Prototype with Cannibalized Keys\nEarly Prototype in Metal and Wood\nIn 2001 we found and contacted George, a local Phoenix keyboard specialist, and arranged for the creation of a prototype. However, we could not overcome the obstacles mentioned above, and there the matter sat for nearly a decade until late spring of 2010. At that time we reconnected with George, essentially on a social call, and considered that the conditions had changed: smartphones (with their clumsy thumb boards) had become powerful computers and were widely adopted; Bluetooth had become a standard protocol for connecting to wireless keyboards; and mobile internet was quickly becoming fast, affordable, and ubiquitous.\n2001 Prototype with Custom Molded Keys and Palm Cradle\nWe began development on what was to become the myType Keyboard in the summer of 2010. By December of 2011, after about 10 iterations including a complete redesign, we had ordered and had received 50 units in five colors from our initial 1,000 unit proof of concept beta (1,000 being fewer in quantity than what the factory was willing to provide in production runs). They worked well, and we were thrilled, so we gave the green light to produce the remaining 950 keyboards. We received the 950 in January of 2012. The keyboards worked but did not meet our expectations. This was devastating. We spent the next approximately 9 months working closely with the factory to address these issues and make further improvements.\n2010 Early Prototype in Silicon Rubber\nAt this stage the factory agreed to provide us with another proof of concept beta run of 1,000 keyboards in our five colors. We tested the keyboards. They worked beautifully. However, given the history, we wanted more data points before launching our campaign. As part of our testing program, we marketed and sold a limited number on Sky Mall (132 units). The fact that the keyboard was well received and that we received very limited returns (1 before the start of our campaign and 1 subsequently) gave us the comfort and third party validation that we wanted before launching on Kickstarter. The myType Keyboard is not currently available on Skymall. It is still listed on the website, but is on back order until January of 2014 and will remain on backorder until all of our Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled.\nWe are a small organization and have put in a tremendous amount of effort and resources to get myType to a stage where we are confident that we will be able to deliver a quality product on schedule to our backers. We are especially thankful to both Kickstarter and our many backers for helping us get over the hump and by raising the necessary funds to get the myType into production and bring it to the world.\nEarly Prototype in Wood and Paper", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have followed many projects on Kickstarter, and have seen many of them struggle to deliver on time - or at all. We know, first hand, how frustrating this is for the backers, so we made a strategic decision to launch only after we had worked through the challenges most likely to cause delays. \n\nFor us, this meant securing and building relationships with suppliers, finalizing the product design, securing proof of concept beta run in each color giving us confidence that this process is repeatable.\n\nThat said, there are still risk factors that could impact our ability to complete our project, but we have identified alternate manufacturing channels, and are confident that we will be able to deliver our rewards on time.\n\nIf the project substantially exceeds expectations (what Ben's mom would call \"a nice problem to have\"), it could introduce some delays in fulfillment and potentially manufacturing. We have identified fulfillment partners, and are confident that we can get rewards shipped out in a timely fashion. The factory has assured us that they are equipped to handle large order sizes into the 10,000+ range quickly and efficiently. \n\nClaims and Disclaimer: Roysden Innovations, LLC, dba myType Keyboard and myType Mobile, claim a trademark for purposes of electronic devices on the name \u201cmyType\u201d and the phrase \u201coffice in your pocket\", and claim a copyright \u00a9 on this material, 2013, all rights reserved.

It is our belief that craft beer should be enjoyed among friends in an environment that promotes fellowship and camaraderie. To that end, we made sure to find a fantastic location for manufacturing and tasting that reflects that spirit. As a company, and as brewers, we're dedicated to making all feel welcome, from the craft beer enthusiast to the uninitiated newcomer.\nWe want to be a light in our city and to this world, pushing the boundaries of what a small business can do. Sanctum is striving to be more than a product, but a force for good. Generosity will be built into how we run things, from the ground up. \nTHE BREWHOUSE AND TASTING ROOM\nAs far as new craft breweries with an amazing tasting room and manufacturing in Pomona, we are number 1!! Though we are the only one, we're still fantastical! We are going to be one block from the bustling downtown area of Pomona, near the Fox Theater, The Glass House, and other awesome stuff. Pomona has recently dedicated itself to rebuilding, repurposing and redefining itself as a haven for art, music and crafted goods; we're excited to contribute to that goal. The first piece of our gorgeous building was constructed in 1916. The building is now undergoing a complete renovation and update! Check it out here Our unit specifically has a still-functioning scale dating back to when peaches were packaged there! Peachy! We're extremely excited to open our doors and let people experience our unique craft ales in a place that mirrors the spirit of our business! \nWe believe that beer should be a creative expression from us to you. As we mentioned in our video, we will be offering many different varieties of fresh craft beer available at our tasting room and through local distribution. \nOur goal is to provide the most unique, creatively crafted ales possible. Mixing different ale styles, ingredients and unique fermentation practices, we're constructing the most unique lineup of beers we can. We are always open to trying new things but never about being different for being different's sake. Some of the beers we make are out there, but we never compromise flavor, or magic...or deliciousness. Whether we're throwing lavender in a Strong Scotch Ale (bad idea that tastes like vapor rub) or putting maple syrup in a Belgian Trippel (which is amazing!), we're constantly trying new things and keeping what's worthy. \nFor a preliminary list of what we'll offer when we're open, scroll down to the bottom!\nWASTE NOT, WANT NOT\nOne of the coolest things about the craft beer industry is a dedication to limiting waste and maximizing efficiency. Whether reusing heat from cooling boiling beer, or responsibly managing our spent barley, we're dedicated to keeping our carbon footprint tiny and our beer footprint even more foot-printy. \nYOUR BACKING, OUR TRACKING\nWith your help we will ensure that the investments we've already received and the money we've invested takes us all the way to our goal. We are making every effort to innovate, cut down and limit ourselves without limiting the vision of our company. We're asking for $40,000 to ensure that we have everything we need. Even though this is a lofty goal, it is still only a portion of what it takes to succeed as a company in this industry. Despite that, we believe that with your help we can easily make this a reality. \nThe funds will go toward building modifications (plumbing, gas lines, floor drains), licensing, brewing equipment essentials and the construction and decor of our tasting room. Meeting, or exceeding our goal will allow us to remain debt free and focus on bringing the most excellent instance of our brewery to life. The more we raise, the more kegs, serving tanks, taps, decor, vibe, wittiness, and service we can furnish. Please partner with us today to keep us on track toward achieving what will be Pomona's first production brewery and tasting room. Partner with us today to help us realize our dream and bring amazing craft ale to the wonderful city of Pomona and receive awesome rewards like these:\nLogo tee.

Though it technically has 115 IBU's, it is remarkably smooth and easy to drink!\nHEATHER THE STORM: Strong Scotch Ale brewed with heather tips and smoked barley. This amazingly malty, smooth and smokey beer makes us wonder why Scotch ales aren't more popular!\nBARLEY ROSE: Belgian Golden Strong Ale brewed with distilled rose water and rose petals. This beer is very easy to drink, but complex and interesting with flower and rose notes in the bouquet and finish.\nBROKEN BREAD: Colonial Pale Ale brewed with toasted squaw bread. We call this colonial because it's a mix of English and American pales. We throw the bread in for bready sweetness to compliment the generous amount of Falconer's Flight, Bravo and Pilgrim hops!\nRYE'DIN DIRTY: Brown Ale brewed with rye malt. A delicious take on a favorite style. The rye magnifies perceived bitterness and gives a smooth earthy kick in the pants!\nCATHEDRAL DUBBEL: Belgian Dubbel brewed with dark candy syrup. This delicious beer has a wonderfully complex malt profile with delicious under tones of raisin and plum. A very easy drinker for a 9.3 percenter!\nWINNIE THE BLONDE: Blonde Ale made with honey malt. This brew is extremely enjoyable. It doesn't challenge the pallet, but neither is it simple. With complex honey, malt and champagne characteristics, this is a real winner.\nCREATIVE NAME IPA: This IPA is a clean, crisp wonderful beer that is balanced. Using Simcoe and Falconer's Flight, it has a wonderful aroma and delicious hop flavor.\nBEERANOSAURUS REX: Imperial IPA that consists of only two malts for the entire grain bill. The simplicity of the grain bill lets the purity of hop flavor and aroma shine through. Copiously dry hopped, it is a wonderful addition to the Imperial IPA cannon.\nDARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL: Imperial Stout brewed with Dutch-process chocolate. This deeply dark and satisfying stout is both intense and smooth. Rich dark and milk chocolate flavors mix in the mouth-feel of the beer to finish satin-smooth.

Regular classroom disruptions fall away as students become engaged in learning about astronomy in a new and exhilarating way. Kids relate to the fun and interactive medium of a portable planetarium in a manner that no other astronomy instruction can match.\nAccording to the Resource Area for Teaching (RAFT), students retain learning longer when that learning comes from an engaging, hands-on activity. When they are captivated by a unique opportunity such as an inflatable planetarium, they are more likely to share what they've learned with family members and friends, deepening their understanding with each repitition. These activities also transcend language barriers with their visual appeal.\nWe need more exciting educational activities in order to fight the intellectual apathy so common in our students today (what RAFT calls \"the engagement gap\")! As the pace of scientific research advances, the average person is faced increasingly with science and technology in his or her daily life. Yet, a study done by the University of Sciences in Philadelphia indicates that American students' interest in science is drastically waning.\nMy inflatable planetarium offers kinesthetic and visual learning to students who are hungry for stimulation. The wonders of the night sky can be brought right into the classroom! Right here, you have the opportunity to help bring science to life.\nThe Story\nFive years ago I was a middle school science teacher working at a Title I school. The school (and its students) had little money for field trips or fancy science equipment, but I longed to find a way to bring Astronomy to life for my seventh graders. Through much trial and error with my crappy sewing machine, I created the magnificent monstrosity you see on my cover photo.\nUsing a box fan (for inflating) and a $150 \"toy\" projector from Japan, I've given planetarium shows to thousands of students over the last several years. Even when I left teaching to become a mom and foster parent, I continued to give presentations to schools, youth organizations, and clubs. \nThe Goal\nTo build a bigger, better planetarium! Planetarium 2.0 will be able to fit 30 students instead of 15. It will be made out of more durable fabric. And it will be a golden yellow to represent our Sun! This way, the half-sphere shape of the planetarium serves a second purpose - to be part of a scale model of our Solar System (with the planets being represented by sports balls). \nIf I were to purchase a boring, black inflatable planetarium from a commercial company in the United States, it would cost at least THREE TIMES as much as my Kickstarter goal! By creating a planetarium myself, I am able to make the planetarium more fun AND more economical.\nThe Rewards\nSimple Science\nAt one point in my teaching career I had this grand aspiration to make each of my students a book of simple science experiments they could do with their family over the summer. This book turned out to be over 80 pages long and includes all of my favorite experiments to do with kids using common household materials, as well as a loooong list of science fair project ideas, and some of my favorite science websites. This reward comes in the form of a digital copy. (Please note that this is a collection of ideas I gathered over my years of teaching, most of which are NOT my own and I claim no ownership of the ideas or pictures in this book.)\nGeek Astronomy\nWhen I found out I have been invited to present at the Phoenix Comicon (one of the largest pop culture events in the world!), I totally geeked out! Not only did I create presentations for my scheduled shows, Harry Potter Astronomy and Star Trek Astronomy, but I also created several more shows for use at future Comicons. I have turned my notes into \"guides\" for your benefit. Each of these guides includes a labeled star chart, which corresponds to descriptions of your favorite pop culture characters, places, or events that share their name with a certain star or constellation. Imagine going outside on a clear night and using your guide to find the constellation Draco Malfoy was named after, or the star system in which someone stole Spock's brain!\nHere is a complete list of the planetarium shows I have created so far:\nAnime/Manga (29 constellations, 11 stars)\nDr. Who (10 constellations, 12 stars)\nHarry Potter (13 constellations, 8 stars)\nHitchhiker's Guide (8 constellations, 10 stars)\nMiddle Earth (10 constellations, 5 stars)\nStar Trek (22 constellations, 35 stars)\nMarvel Comics (23 constellations, 3 stars)\nVideo Games - includes both console and PC games (33 constellations, 55 stars)\nTV/Movies (27 constellations, 34 stars)\nEach of these comes in the form of a digital copy. To use the star chart properly you must print it out and you'll need scissors and a small amount of tape/staples to put it together.\nPlanetarium Party!\nI'm thrilled to have the opportunity to do a presentation for you, so I can show off my planetarium! Each presentation is fully customizable to your interests and needs. School presentations cater to the science standards for the grade I am presenting to - not only the science standards, but all cross-curricular standards that may tie into my show. Your show could also be used for a birthday party, science nights, scouts, youth organization, or any other social gathering you might think of! (If you have more than 30 people at your event, add $30 to your pledge for each each extra presentation you want on that same day.)\nSimilar Science Outreach Programs in Tucson cost $120-$150 each, so $79 is a steal!\nIf you do not live in Southern Arizona, you can STILL contribute for a planetarium presentation, and the presentation will be given at an organization of your choice! Think urban schools, boy scouts, girl scouts, boys and girls clubs, church functions, fundraisers, YMCA, group foster homes, clubs...the starry sky is the limit! Each presentation will be individually documented in your name, and posted in a Kickstarter update.\nI will be available for scheduling every day of the week except Sunday. I anticipate the planetarium to take 3 months to build, so please expect to schedule your planetarium presentation between September 2013 and June 2014. (If you would like to redeem your reward before September I can do a presentation with my old planetarium for you).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy first task (which I have already started) is to collect fabric samples and determine which type of fabric will work best for my needs. After ordering the fabric, I will use geometry to determine the measurements for each piece before sewing them together to make the dome shape and tunnels. Afterward, strips of fabric must be glued over the stitching due to the holes the sewing process creates, which lets light into the planetarium. Ultimately, I am confident that since I have created an inflatable planetarium once before, I will be able to navigate my way through the process a second time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "The Planetarium on Television!", "update_content": "In case you're interested, I wanted to share with you a short video of me (hugely pregnant) showing off my planetarium for Arizona Public Media's TV show, \"Arizona Illustrated.\" It was really fun to tape this TV spot, and even more fun to watch the final product!

Until I developed this cutting-edge industry-first design, draft beer stored in a growler could not retain its optimum freshness and the brewer's intended carbonation levels, especially after the growler's original seal was broken. Now, thanks to the Growler Saver, beer drinkers no longer have to consume an entire growler once they open it for the first time, or otherwise risk their beer tasting old, under carbonated, or full of off-flavors. With the Growler Saver, beer drinkers can open their growlers again and again, with the confidence that the beer inside will taste just as good as it did when it left the tap.\nThe Growler Saver\u2122\nWhat is the concept behind the Growler Saver, and How Does it Work to keep beer fresh and carbonated?\nThe Growler Saver applies similar principles and processes that brewers and home brewers use when they fill kegs. The simple design of the Growler Saver first allows consumers to inject CO2 directly into their growlers. After injecting their growlers with CO2, users then manually open the built-in relief valve and discharge all of the air and oxygen out of the growler's head space. CO2 can then be re-injected as necessary. This process creates ideal conditions for storing the beer inside the growler, and will ensure lasting freshness and carbonation. The Growler Saver's relief valve will also prevent the Growler from being over pressurized, while at the same time working as a safety valve that will relieve pressure that exceeds a preset factory setting.\nThe Growler Saver\u2122 System\nCan the Growler Saver re-carbonate flat beer or a growler that was not filled to optimal conditions?\nYes, in addition to ensuring lasting freshness and carbonation, beer drinkers can use the Growler Saver to re-carbonate beer inside their growlers. Most of us have experienced a flat growler, even upon its initial opening. The trusted principles behind the Growler Saver's design will allow users to re-carbonate their beer and turn it back into the beverage that was intended to be enjoyed right out of the tap.\nBefore and After comparison of an improperly filled growler that was then re-carbonated using the Growler Saver.\nHow has the Growler Saver been tested?\nThe Growler Saver was first developed roughly two years ago, and has been put through a series of rigorous tests since it's original prototype design. These tests include side-by-side comparison studies with growlers using a standard cap versus growlers using the Growler Saver.  I have also performed many hourly interval tests. These interval tests include pouring 12 ounces of beer each day from a growler with a standard cap and a growler with the Growler Saver at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-fill. Each growler is opened side-by-side at each interval and are stored under identical conditions, except for the difference in cap. The results of these interval tests have demonstrated again and again that the Growler Saver keeps growlers significantly fresher than a standard cap. In fact, such tests show a significant difference in taste and carbonation after only 24 hours. My testing indicates that beer stored in a growler with a standard cap begins to break down and oxidize as early as a few hours after the initial seal is broken. Beer stored in a growler utilizing the Growler Saver tastes fresh and properly carbonated for weeks.\nSide by side comparison 48 hours later, and opened 3 times since filled\nIn addition to conducting freshness and carbonation tests, I have put the Growler Saver through a series of rigorous mechanical tests that have helped to ensure that the device is easy to operate, safe, and will consistently perform it's intended function. I have incorporated both medical and industrial technology into my design, and have strove to source nearly all components that are manufactured in the USA. Much the same, all Growler Savers have been prototyped and will be fully assembled in the USA.\nWhat materials are the Growler Saver made from and Is it easy to maintain and keep sanitary?\nThe Growler Saver has been designed for optimum function, with medical-grade and food-safe components. Essential to the Growler Saver's ability to keep a beer as fresh as it was out of the tap is the fact that its design eliminates any materials or hoses coming into contact with the beer inside the growler. This design feature is critical to ensuring that the beer is not contaminated or infected. It has the added bonus of making the Growler Saver very easy to keep clean. The Growler Saver can be hand cleaned with soap and water, or most beer sanitizing solutions or any other readily available food-safe sanitizer.\nIndependent Growler Saver Review:\nhttp://www.homebrewfinds.com/2013/05/hands-on-growlersaver-pressurized.html\nTravel case shown below\nBONUS OFFER- Anyone that increases their pledge by a minimum of $2 or more will receive the Growler Saver tote shown below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have conducted extensive networking that has lead to the development of many great relationships with local facilities.

Over a pint or two, friendships are made, business deals are closed, and hot topics are discussed. Unfortunately, this ideal seldom finds expression in the Southwest. Veritas Brewing Company will exist to meet this need. As a central fixture of the community, Veritas will live or die by the quality of our fare, the service we provide, and the setting in which we deliver both. Quality, authenticity, purity, and purpose will define and guide every aspect of the business, with the customer experience always at the forefront of every decision.\nVeritas Brewing Company will strive to be the premier gathering place for the community; a pub in the classic English sense but with a southwest twist, where locals, especially families, can feel welcome and comfortable as they get to know their neighbors. We will offer the freshest craft beer, locally sourced, fresh food, and an atmosphere where the bonds of community are forged. Veritas will accomplish this by basing all we do on the following core principles:\nDeliver the highest quality food at an affordable price, utilizing as many fresh local ingredients as possible\nBrew craft beer with the finest ingredients, serve it at the peak of its quality, and always have something new and exciting on tap\nFoster an environment where everyone is comfortable and has the opportunity to \"do\" community\nOffer spaces that can be used for community, civic, church, and club functions in addition to a more formal restaurant space and an informal bar/lounge space\nKeep our focus on purity, quality, authenticity, and simplicity in all we do\nAttract and maintain the highest quality staff that will deliver the highest level of service and product\n\nIt takes a lot of money to open a brewpub like Veritas, certainly more than what we are attempting to raise in this campaign. The funds that we raise here will be primarily used to pay the legal fees that are required to create the private placement memorandum (PPM) that will enable us to attract equity investors to fully fund the company. \n\nBeer\nSample beer list (an example only, nothing's set at this point):\nCore\nAmerican Pale Ale - $4/16oz \nAmerican IPA - $5/16oz \nAmerican Red - $5/16oz \nOatmeal Stout - $5/16oz \nWit - $4/16oz \nRotational \nSaison - $5/12oz \nAgave IIPA - $6/9oz \nEnglish Bitter - $4/16oz \nImperial Red - $6/12oz \nEnglish Porter - $5/16oz \nGuest\nFour Peaks Hop Knot - $6/16oz \nStone Arrogant Bastard - $6/16oz \nMaui Coconut Porter - $6/12oz \nSan Tan Devil\u2019s Ale - $5/16oz \nFirestone Walker Pale31 - $5/16oz\nFood\nSample Menu (quality will be assured by the use of fresh, local, high quality ingredients, combined with a focus on doing a few things well):\nCommunity\nVeritas will function as a third place by being a space that people of all walks of life enjoy and never want to leave. We will utilize design elements such as seating arrangements that bring people together rather than separate them, and will encourage families to make Veritas their home away from home. Instead of having many TVs that shut down real conversation, we will offer couches, picnic tables and games that bring it to life. By dividing our space into distinct lounge and restaurant areas, we will be able to give everyone the setting they need to feel that they belong.\nFinally, our outdoor patio space will enable people to enjoy the valley\u2019s wonderful weather... at least when it\u2019s not summer. But even when it\u2019s warm out, our mister system will keep folks cool. We will also feature a dedicated cigar patio, and will have a stocked humidor and top shelf spirits to compliment our beer for those who wish to enjoy a cigar or pipe. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStaff/Customer Service: Finding and retaining competent and enthusiastic staff will be one of the most significant ongoing challenges that Veritas will face. Service has been the downfall of many otherwise good businesses, and we are committed to ensure that this does not happen at Veritas. Through continuing education in beer and food, fun incentives and challenges, and cultivating a positive workplace, we will minimize this risk as much as we can.\n\nRestaurant Failure Rate: Although the failure rate of new restaurants is often exaggerated significantly, reliable studies still put it at around 60% in the first 5 years. But Veritas is not a restaurant, it's a brewpub, and the failure rate of brewpubs is much lower, and though data is hard to find, seems to be between 12 and 17%. Veritas will not fail, not only because we are a brewpub, but because we are committed to delivering the highest quality, local beer and food in the Southwest valley in a truly enjoyable community setting.\n\nContaminated Batches of Beer: The first 3 rules of brewing a quality product are sanitation, sanitation, sanitation. If beer is contaminated by wild yeasts or other bacteria, it often points to a deeper problem with the brewing process. Although contamination is always a possibility, Veritas will minimize this risk in two main ways. First, we will buy new brewery equipment, designed for us, and installed in a professional way that will minimize exposure to contaminants. Second, we will hire an experienced head brewer that will be knowledgable in commercial brewing processes and procedures, and will run a clean, tidy operation in the brewhouse. If the worst happens and we do end up with a contaminated batch, all is not lost, since the size of each batch we brew is relatively small (7 barrels, or 210 gallons), accounting for about $1000 in lost revenue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Disappointment", "update_content": "I've been waiting for this week for the last several months. My partner/investor was finally going to come through with the funds to get Veritas off the ground. So when he invited me over to his house last night, I thought that we would be discussing the presentation of an offer on a property that we both liked. To my surprise and disappointment, he instead told me that, although the financing did come through, he could not risk the (large amount of) money right now. The economic conditions in the US and AZ are just not favorable to a startup business at this time. Although I think a brewpub can be successful even in difficult times, I get that he has a lot more to lose than I do if things didn't work out.\nWhat does this mean for Veritas then? Basically, we're on hold while I try to either significantly decrease the needed startup capital without sacrificing the core vision of the business, or find more investors to spread out the risk. Bob (my current partner) knows the restaurant industry and has many decades experience in it. He is a good, honest man and I'd be foolish to take his position lightly.

Scroll to the bottom to see our stretch rewards!\nTHE PROJECT\nLos Angeles Ale Works is a brewery based in Los Angeles, California.  For over 3 years we have been hard at work business planning, refining recipes, designing our brand, and acquiring the proper licenses for the first phase of our project, gypsy brewing.  After purchasing our kegs and marketing material and paying for the initial batches, we are ready to take this project to the next level.  \nThe contract or gypsy brewing phase demonstrates that our business is real and beer is salable but it is a means to an end.  In order to bring the operation to the next level we will need to secure equipment, a location, commercial licenses, and sizable capital that will allow us to build out our brewery.  Here's where you, the craft beer drinker, come in.  We will be doing a combination of private and Kickstarter fundraising.  This will allow the community to be involved in the project from the ground up.  After all, what is beer if there are no people to drink it? \nAll money generated through Kickstarter will go towards securing brewery equipment and fulfilling the various rewards for backers.  If we meet our goal of $25,000 by the end of our campaign, your donations will then go through. Hypothetically, if we don't reach $25,000, your credit card will not be charged. To pledge your support all it takes are following these four easy steps!\nCreate a Kickstarter account\nLog in using your email and password (or Amazon account information)\nDonate! Select your reward level. $1.00 minimum; no maximum.\nShare our project with your friends online and in person! \nWho Are We?\nWe are enthusiastic, dedicated, and award-winning homebrewers who love brewing beer and bringing it to the people we care about.  \n- John Rockwell comes from a business finance background in commercial real estate.  He currently works at an energy audit company that focuses on making businesses run more efficiently in their work spaces.  John is a certified BJCP judge, which makes him a serious quality control specialist.  Nothing gets by his palate.\n- Kristofor (Kip) Barnes works at a major film studio as a business analyst in customer relations.  He's learned the art of building relationships with his clients.  He's an accomplished gold-medal-winning home brewer who focuses intensely on new recipe creation and managing the brewhouse.  Kip founded Bierkast.com and is also a founding member of the LA Beer Bloggers.\nBoth John and Kip spend 99.9% of their free time brewing beer, tightening the business plan, studying the science of brewing, and getting involved in LA Craft Beer events!\nFun Fact: Both John and Kip met each other in the USC Marching band\nWho Do We Look Up To?\nOne of Kip's favorite breweries in Los Angeles is Eagle Rock Brewery.  \n\"It's hard to pick a favorite because there are so many awesome places, but Eagle Rock Brewery and the ERB team have been at the forefront of LA Craft Beer for the last 3 years.  Their mix of creative brewing, positive community action, and love of craft beer is a serious boon for all of LA.  Plus, they are just plain nice!\" - Kip\nJohn's favorite brewery in Los Angeles is a toss up between Craftsman and Taps Fish House & Brewery.\n\"Craftsman is a pioneer in the LA beer community and was here before the boom.  They are extremely creative and have consistently great beer.  They are a true small batch brewhouse.  Taps has an amazing respect for the classic styles.  They are one of the more underrated brewers in the area, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better kolsch or cream ale.  Good food too!\" - John\nWhat is our Goal?\nOver the long term we plan to raise enough capital so that we can make beer for a living.  We are currently balancing gypsy brewing with our day jobs, which is exhausting, but still awesome.  If we can raise enough money (beyond Kickstarer) to open a brewery of our own, we can focus full time on making tasty beer for the awesome Los Angeles beer drinkers!  \nRealistically, we need to raise a lot more than we\u2019re asking for here to execute our dream brewery.  We will be reaching that goal through private equity investment, personal and business loans, fundraising events, and social media fundraisers like Kickstarter.  \nOur goal on Kickstarter is $25,000, which is and isn't a lot.  In this situation we have to buy very expensive equipment. While this goal is modest compared to our total financial needs, it is a huge step in the right direction, as equipment purchases are some of the largest expenses when opening a brewery.   \nOur dream floor plan\nWhy Donate?\nWhy should you donate when you can just go down to the supermarket or pub and get your favorite beer?  Several reasons: \nDrinking, eating, listening to music, and filling growlers at a brewery is awesome! \nThe Karma you get for supporting a local brewery is incredible!  All backers, who pledge $25+, will be permanently recognized on a laser engraved plate on our fermentor.\nYou want to be a part of the magic!\nIt creates Jobs! Maybe even your job!  \nLos Angeles Ale Works will focus on not only getting the surrounding community involved with the brewery, but will also get involved with local philanthropic organizations.  We want everyone to not only like the beer that we make, but believe in the brewery and the people that are making it.  What better way to do that than to get everyone involved?\nBrewing the first batch of Gams-Bart at Ohana Brewing - (Left to Right) John Rockwell, Sean Inmann, Chris Walowski, Kip Barnes, Andrew Luthi\nWhere will my money go?\nYour money will go towards the following:\n15 BBL Fermentor $10,500 + tax\nCommercial Keg Washer $7,450 - $14,450 + tax (Manual vs. Semi-Auto)\nFreight & Installation $4,000 - $8,000 (vender estimate)\nKickstarter Rewards\nAs we said before, we are ramping up by gypsy brewing.  By aiding us in securing equipment early on, you'll be helping us grow.  We plan on sharing space in an existing local brewery until our facility is built.  Sharing is caring and also means we can brew our recipes, collaborate, and get our product to you sooner rather than later.\nStretch Goals\nIf we manage to raise more than we plan, here are a few other things we'll be spending the money on:\nSemi-Auto Keg Washer - This is a top of the line Keg Washer.  It's twice as expensive as the manual one, but the semi-auto feature allows kegs to be automatically cleaned which cuts out the otherwise time consuming manual washing process.  More time = more beer focus.\n15 BBL Jacketed Brite Tank - This is used to store and carbonate the beer after fermentation.  This will free up fermentation space to allow for more beer production.\nEducation - There are a number of brewing certifications and classes out there we want to take.  Certification means more knowledge.  More knowledge means better beer.  We know a lot already, but you can always learn more.\nREWARDS\nWhile we can't give away free beer, per California State & Federal Law, we can entice you with backer-only parties, swag, and exclusives. You\u2019ll notice that some of our rewards can be fulfilled immediately (swag!), while others - that need us to open a brewery first - require a little more patience. Either way, rest assured they are all fantastic!\nCommunity Tap\nThe community tap will be a handle dedicated to serving community voted beer.  Think of it as another seasonal that gets voted on by the people.  If everyone wants a triple Belgian IPA then that's what we'll make! If everyone is tired of palate-obliterating hoppy-ness and would rather spend the evening with the charming Queen Elizabeth, then English-style bitter it will be. These beers will be small releases that will be available to our backers first!  Consider it an extra thank you for all the love and support.\nEach reward level has a specific number of votes attached to it.  Each vote can be used to make various beer related decisions that we open to the public. It's simple, really - the more you pledge, the larger your say.  We will open up voting to all backers and members of the Shangri-LAAW club - 1 vote per person. By pledging to our Kickstarter, you will have extra say because you believed in us early on.\nAdmittance into SHANGRI-LAAW\nOur mug club.  An Eden in a concrete jungle.  Entrance to Shangri-LAAW has been shrouded in mystery, but you'll have first dibs as a backer at the $350 level.  Space will be extremely limited, first come first serve, and invite only.  Experience coveted bottle releases, rare tastings, special guests, unending happiness, and discover the undiscovered truths of Shambhalaaw.\nAdmittance to Shangri-LAAW is marked at specific reward levels.  Years do not compound. Please keep in mind that this membership will not commence until our brewery is open, so patience is key.  That being said, we will work to include the group in as many of our preliminary events as we can.\nSWAG\nBOTTLE CAPS: Los Angeles Ale Works bottle caps! We'll give you one for every vote you have - depending on your reward.  Hold on to these, you'll find out later!  These beautiful caps are made by our friends over at BottleMark.\nSTICKERS: Another locally sourced piece by one of our favorite craft beer supporters - Stickerworks!  We have tons of these cool stickers and would love to give them away to people that want to contribute!\nCOASTERS: Double-sided coasters that look friggin' awesome! Tired of that nasty ring you leave on your nice teak coffee table? Look no further than our fine coasters.\nT-SHIRTS: We are starting out with hand silk-screened shirts, which are locally sourced by a screen printer in Los Angeles, Mischief Brigade.  Why aren't we going with the big guys? Because the little guys rock!  Each shirt is unique and hand made.  Consider it the homebrew equivalent of T-Shirts.\nGROWLER BAGS: These bags are awesome.  They are insulated and screen-printed with our logo!  They are designed to fit the 64 oz growlers that we will eventually have, but hold up to three 22oz bottles right now! We are sourcing this through a small family run business called GrowlerCooler.com.\n*4-PACK BEER HOLDERS: These hand crafted wooden carriers are designed to hold four 22 oz. bottles.  They are LAAW branded and made with love by skilled woodworkers that we are lucky enough to be able to bribe with beer.  There are only a few of these in existence.\nLA BEER HOP: An exclusive party with Kip and John and the guys at the LA Beer Hop, the premier beer tour company in Los Angeles.  Come see LA through our beer colored glasses.\n*BEER BOXES: These beautiful hand crafted wooden boxes are designed to hold twenty-four 12 oz. bottles.  They are painted black and have our logo on them.  There are only a few of these in existence, in fact we love these boxes so much a small tear will be shed with each box we give away, thus they are a high level reward for our most dedicated backers.  Our handy friends Mike and Dan put these babies together, and boy are these boxes sick.\n*TAP HANDLES: You need to pull the handle to get the beer.  Think of it as a unique trophy given to you for the awesome contribution you made.  Hey, if you have a kegerator, you can even use them.  This was a team effort.  The whole LAAW crew assembled these by hand; they are each unique and not made in a factory.\n*Please keep in mind that some of these reward levels require extra shipping, which will be calculated when rewards are ready to go out.  These costs will be dependent upon your location.  International backers are welcome, but extra shipping will be required.  If you are local, we can more than likely get it out to you sans shipping.\n*Please note that some rewards are experiences in Los Angeles and travel and lodging are not included.\n*Please note that some rewards are specific to the reward level as there limited quantities.  These rewards are denoted with an *asterisk*\nTHE LAAW CARD: It's exclusive. It's unique. It's the Golden Ticket. If you are in possession of this card, and very-very-very-very few people will be, you will be entitled to Elite Access. We can't tell to what...or how...or why. But if you have it, you will have proven that you are willing to Follow the LAAW to the ends of the earth, and that, we can never forget.\nRELEASE PARTIES & LAUNCHES\nWe will hold special events for our backers when we open our brewery, but this is something that you'll have to be patient for.  In the meantime, there are plenty of local events going on.\nIf you are able to make it out to one of our Los Angeles release parties for Gams-Bart, you'll have an idea of what we are going for.\nOn February 23rd we'll be having a launch at Koreatown's premier beer bar, Beer Belly! On the 24th we'll be having a launch at the California craft-focused gastropub City Tavern in Culver City.  Other events in downtown are slated in the coming weeks as well including, but not limited to, Far Bar, Spring Street Smoke House, and Eagle Rock Brewery.\nSpecial thanks to the guys at Ohana Brewing Co for making this all possible.  We love you guys! Keep up the great work!\nBe sure to keep up to date with all the news on our Facebook page, twitter, and Website so you don't miss a chance to experience Gams-Bart with your own palate. #FollowtheLAAW\nLA ALE WORKS BEER\nOur first gypsy-brewed beer is GAMS-BART, our Bavarian Style Roggenbier.  It's one of our favorites, and we hope it becomes one of yours too. Here\u2019s a summary of the rest of our line-up:\nGamsBart - Bavarian Roggenbier - This multi award-winning beer is an intensely traditional German style ale similar to a Bavarian style Hef.  We use rye and roasted rye and ferment on the colder side which brings out the clove flavors from this traditional yeast.  \nDampfmaschine - California UnCommon - This is a classic California \"steam beer\" style ale, only it's accented with rye and late hopped with magnum hops.\nLievre - French/Belgian Saison - This multi award-winning saison is brewed will seasonal citrus peel, spices, and Indian sugar.  Funky and friggin' tasty.\nButtress of Windsor - Coffee Rye Porter - This porter has a generous portion of rye added to its grain bill and is cold infused with locally roasted coffee.  It's complex, hearty, but also incredibly soft like a feather duster.\nDas Kolsch - German Kolsch - John is a Kolsch nut, and this is his baby.  A well made Kolsch is hard to find, and this one is as traditional as we can make it without being in Cologne.  Soft water, perle and hallertau hops, German pils, and a splash of wheat.\nKarma Kolsch - Thai Tea Infused Kolsch - We take our Kolsch and infuse it with traditional restaurant style Thai Red Tea.  The tea and spices are assertive, but also blend nicely with the delicate style underneath.\nKetsara Soda - Thai Tea Soda - That's right, soda.  We want to have something for everyone.  We love beer, but we also want to have something for those of you trucking your friends around during brewery tours or those that just appreciate craft soda.  Palm Sugar and Thai Tea - Sweet and Simple.  \nFUN FACT: Soda played an important role for breweries trying to figure out what to do with themselves during Prohibition.  We want to make a point to pay homage to that time in history, but put a spin on it and produce small batches for the tap room.\nMugen Kurosake - We also hope to brew a black rice sake.  We'll need a commercial wine license for this one because the government has mistakenly identified sake as wine when it is, in fact, beer.  \nPhoto courtesy of Bernie Wire at \"Friends of Local Beer\"\nAnd More: Imagination is the limit.

A medal from the NHC, part of the Brewers Association and National Home Brewers Association, is the highest possible honor a home brewer can receive.  \nWe recently took home a two gold medals at the Pacific Brewers Cup 2012, one for whiskey barrel aged Roggenbock and another for our California Common, Dampfmaschine.  \nWe've also received numerous first place medals for our Lievre Saison and sodas.\nHere are some other awards \u2013 Local, California & National:\nOUR BRAND\nLos Angeles Ale Works is fortunate to have on our team one of Seattle\u2019s premier Branding and Design experts, Ken Barnes.

If the total pledges don't reach the goal, then the project is not funded at all.\nThe pledges aren't an investment in the business in a traditional sense (sorry, no company shares being offered here!) but you do get some cool stuff for helping us out (check out the list on the right hand side). Not to mention you\u2019ll be instrumental in ensuring that there is LA Ale Works beer on tap for years to come!\n**STRETCH GOALS & STRETCH REWARDS**\nStretch Rewards\n*Cardinal & Gold - Some of you may have seen that we added a new reward level called Cardinal & Gold at the $117 level.  This'll snag you a limited edition Cardinal & Gold version of the LAAW shirt.  What we failed to mention was that it also gets you a Cardinal & Gold sticker.  All those pledging above the $117 level will have the opportunity to choose which one you want.\nStretch Reward #1 $26,000\nUNLOCKED: LAAW Voting Event for Glassware\nAt $26,000 everyone at the $50 dollar (and up) pledge level will be getting a pint glass.\nWhat will they look like? You\u2019ll decide with your voting power at the end of the kickstarter. We\u2019ll provide several different choices and you can all vote and decide what our next glass is! How cool is that?! It\u2019s all about working together to make this brewery happen.\nNow this is where it gets fun!!\nStep 1, we open up new donation levels:\n$75 Pledge - get a classic keychain bottle opener printed/engraved with LAAW\n$150 Pledge - get a fidel/steamer hat with LAAW embroidery\nStep 2, set stretch rewards that take these new reward levels and make them ridiculously awesome!\nStretch Reward #2 $30,000\nUNLOCKED: Custom LAAW Professional Bottle Opener\nAt $30,000 everyone at the $75 dollar (and up) pledge level will be getting a customized LA Ale Works bartender style bottle opener. Forget that keychain bottle opener, this is no toss away trinket! It will become your household go-to bottle opener. There\u2019s a reason all professional bartenders use it. A true collectors item, these will be a small batch orders only made for the kickstarter.\nIn addition to this, everyone at the $75 and up level gets an extra bottle cap (+1 vote)!\nStretch Reward #3 $35,000\nUNLOCKED: Custom labeled LAAW Growler\nAt $35,000 everyone at the $150 dollar (and up) pledge level will get a 64-oz screw top amber glass growler. Custom printed with the LAAW logo in white. These babies will be awesome and we can\u2019t wait to give them out. The only catch is that you\u2019ll have to be patient. These will be given out next year prior to our facility opening. Think of it as your own private mug club in a bottle.\nIn addition to this, everyone at the $75 and up level gets 2 extra bottle caps (+2 votes)!\nAlso!!!! KARMA KOLSCH. Our Thai Tea Kolsch will be released along side Gams-Bart.  Having 2 fermentors will give us the ability to have two simultaneous beers.\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE! WE  COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU! CHEERS! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are very familiar with the brewing industry and have taken great lengths to immerse ourselves in both the culture, consumer arena and the manufacturing side. That being said, even those who are most prepared may face difficulties. \nOn the Gypsy side of brewing, finding a willing partner is always an obstacle to overcome. Expansions, facility upgrades, or other issues having to do with the host brewery could lead to production delay. Brewing with new facilities is like dating, you have to find the right fit and our beer ideals need to line up. \nAs we move from Gypsy brewing to our own facility there are many potential roadblocks along the way. Permitting through the city and state can take anywhere from 6 - 24 months. If we are unable to secure private fundraising our journey will also be delayed. We will still plan on moving forward, but at a slower pace.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Derek Springer", "content": "Ermahgerd, Kerma Kersh unlerked!", "time": "about 8 years ago"}, {"username": "Morgan First", "content": "HUGE CONGRATS!!!

Many recent graduates are burdened with large amounts of student debt and are finding it increasingly difficult to secure quality employment after leaving school.\nBeverage careers represent a largely overlooked employment solution for millennial college graduates. It is one of only a few industries that has experienced consistent growth during the recent recession, and one that offers a diverse range of amazing and creative career options for qualified college graduates entering the workforce.\nUnless you have a personal interest or connection to the beverage industry, it is extremely difficult to be aware of beverage careers and academically prepare to compete for those opportunities, especially with many college undergraduates being under the legal drinking age when they begin their studies and select their major. Furthermore, the beverage industry \u2013 particularly the wine sector \u2013 is traditionally exclusive, making it inaccessible to women and minority students and creating yet another barrier for college students who might otherwise consider a beverage career.\nOur Drink Careers 101 printed guide is the perfect solution to educate and inspire millennials in a creative and practical way about the many exciting professional opportunities in the beverage industry.\nClick here to see the full trend analysis.\nClick here to meet our advisory board.\nCheck out Drink Careers 101 on Facebook and Twitter.\nExamples of included careers:\nWinemaker\nBrewer\nDistiller\nLaboratory Technician\nViticulturalist\nPackaging\nBeverage Director\nSommelier\nBartender/Mixologist\nTasting Room Manager\nSpirits Producer\nBeer Producer\nWine Producer\nImporter\nDistributor\nOn-Premise Entrepreneur\nOff-Premise Entrepreneur\nBeverage Tourism\nOnline Entrepreneur\nSales\nTechnology\nBrand Ambassador\nMarketing\nWriter\nPersonality\nEducator\nPublic Relations\nWine Club Manager\nSocial Media Manager\nCoffee Roaster\nEvent Production & Marketing\nWhen will the project be fulfilled?\nThe Drink Careers 101 Guide will be released in fall of 2013.\n\nWhy are we raising funds via Kickstarter for this project?\n\nWe are a small, independent media company trying to make big changes with this grassroots campaign. Kickstarter is the vehicle that lets both industry professionals and students get involved with Drink Careers 101 in a meaningful way.\nFor those of you in the industry, you know this project is bigger than Mutineer Magazine. You have firsthand experience with why this industry is so amazing, but more importantly, you see the enormous potential we have for the future. We believe that the full creative power of this project can only be realized through inspired collaboration with you, the beverage industry and culture that we so humbly serve.\nFor those of you who are students or just getting your feet wet with drink careers, you are the absolute future of the industry. We believe that this guide will be the path that so many of you are looking for, and we invite you to start that journey today. Your backing, no matter how small, will bring this project to life.\nTo all our amazing supporters out there, we want you to have a vested interest in this project, because it's as much yours as it is ours. Whether you're a student with a knack for beverages or a marketer working in PR for a large spirits brand, we need your backing and belief in this project to make it a success!\n\nWhat will we do with any excess funds raised?\n\nFunds that are raised beyond our goal will be used to strengthen each aspect of the project \u2013 from expanding the guide to increasing its distribution \u2013 and ensure that this project is as successful and impactful as possible. The more we raise, the more we can bring this project to life in the most creative way imaginable.\nWhat is Mutineer Magazine?\n\nMutineer Magazine is a nationally distributed publication covering beverage culture with an emphasis on wine, beer and spirits, while also covering coffee, tea, soda, water, juice and other delicious beverages. Released in July of 2008, the 44-page magazine quickly doubled in size and grew to achieve national status with its fifth issue. As informative as it is approachable, Mutineer Magazine wants to change the way you read about fine beverages.\nWho are the Mutineers?\nTeam Mutineer is made up of a group of mildly insane, yet insanely creative individuals who regularly geek out over things like barrel aged bitters, and have a deep desire to express the amazingness of beverage culture through creative mediums. We are dedicated to being champions of beverage culture, and those within it. In order to do this, we need to take an active hand in the enrichment and growth of the industry, which is why we believe the Drink Careers 101 guide needs to be brought to life.\nPush Goals\nWhat do you get if we exceed our goal? \nIf we exceed our goal by $50,000\nMutineer Creative Director Julie Hadjinian will create a special, screen printed poster for all backers that contribute at least $50.\nIf we exceed our goal by $100,000\nWe will create an iPad version of the Drink Careers 101 Guide, which all contributors will have access to.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an experienced production team, work with a reliable printing company, and have access to Mutineer\u2019s extensive beverage industry and culture network.

When I returned home to LA I continued to brew because at the time there weren\u2019t many micro brews on the market and I found that the beer I made was better than most commercial beer available. Years later I started getting questions about where my beers could be purchased.\nI decided to take a leap of faith and start a commercial brewery, but, that takes a lot of money. So I found a way to brew at another facility and then sell it myself around the Los Angeles area. For the last two years I have been pounding the pavement with beer in hand selling it to bars, restaurants and retail stores throughout Southern California.\nIn Good Company!\nMy brand has reached a point that it is time for us to grow. We have over 400 accounts and we are opening more every day. We have just made our first nationwide shipment to Chicago and have orders for Arizona, New Jersey and New York!  In the last few months I have worked a beer festival every weekend serving over 10,000 beers to a wide range of beer lovers. The main question on everyones mind has been \u201cWhere is your tasting room?\u201d That is a good question. Our plan is to build a nano brewery and tasting room in the Marina del Rey/Playa Vista area of Los Angeles.\nPrime Location\nJust north of LAX. The location is a prime spot with the movie studios within walking distance, Facebook and Youtube now moving in nearby, about 5000 new condos in the area not to mention Loyola Marymount University just up the hill. I should also mention the 405 freeway is blocks away. In business they always say location, location, location. So I believe we have found the perfect home for Cosmic Ales. \nWHAT WE BELIEVE:\nThere is a craft beer movement happening all across the United States and especially here in Los Angeles. This is the perfect time to open a new brewery. A few have launched already and have already made an impact on the LA craft beer culture. \nWine and other spirits have always been known to pair well with food and to make a statement of great occasions. I believe that beer is the same, if not better in some ways. With so many styles and flavors, beer has become the new wine. Why not drink an incredible brown ale with a steak or a burger or a pale ale with great cheese platters or chicken dishes. A perfectly chosen beverage with a meal can taste like an ingredient that was meant to go with that dish. Great beer can be had on any occasion and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. Choosing the right beer for your meal should take as long as it does to find the right food.\nI brew by hand, not computer, and I carefully craft each one to be as flavorful and enjoyable for every moment of the day. Quality and excellence is our foremost goal. You will never have a Cosmic Ale that isn\u2019t up to our standards. If for some reason something happens to a bottle we guarantee it for 100% money back, better yet, come to the tasting room and we\u2019ll give you another pint straight from the keg. \nOUR DREAM:\nWe wish to someday have a large brewing facility that can help LA grow as a beer town. With so many people trying to get started in Los Angeles as new brands there are no real locations that can contract brew for them. This is how we started and we want to give back to our colleagues and help them succeed as well. But for now the next stepping stone is a nano brewery and tasting room. \nA nano brewery is this, a small scale operation brewing batches under 5 barrels at a time. The purpose is to be able to brew many different styles that we have created to share with the local community around the brewery. We will continue to brew on a larger scale at a facility in San Jose where we brew now for our commercial line of products. The nano brewery will be our tasting room and test kitchen where we will create the next great beer from Cosmic Ales. This will help with word of mouth around town and help to grow our brand and increase demand of each of our great products. Once the brand grows enough and word of mouth spreads and our sales hit another growth point we will be able to secure financing to build the ultimate brewery where we can brew, keg and bottle everything on site.\nTHE DONATIONS - Oh Where Your Money Will Go!\nYour donations will help us to grow and to succeed. Let\u2019s build a great gathering place for craft beer enthusiasts to come together to discuss and enjoy great drinks as well as sample from gourmet food trucks and cool live entertainment on a daily basis.\nIf you are interested in funding the larger of our projects, building the ultimate brewery, we are willing to sit and have a tasting with you and share our business plan and discuss the possibilities. But for now, help us to reach or small goal of opening a fantastic new hot spot for locally brewed beer in Los Angeles! Make sure you take a look at our website cosmicales.com and like us at Facebook.com/cosmicbrewery and follow our tweets twitter.com/cosmicales and #launchthespaceship; so you can learn more about us and what we are planning for the future.\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nWe have some great things we would love to do with this new facility.  First we need to open the doors, get licensed and all the legal stuff.  We already have a small nano system in place but we would love to upgrade.  This means more fermenters, a larger brewing system, more tables and chairs, etc.\nFor an extra $5000: We can buy two more 20 gallon conical fermenters.\nFor $5000 after that: More fermenters, or an upgrade for our draft cooling system and cold box. And some barrels for aging these great beers.\nFor every $5000 after that we will purchase new fermenters to be able to produce more beer for the tasting room and to sell specialty batches to local bars around us.\nTHE REWARDS:\nI figure you probably need a little clarification on some of the rewards we are offering.  I didn't want you to see another campaign that was full of stickers and t-shirts, sure we have those, but I have added a few new items to make it even more exciting.\nFIRST OFF: Let me make sure you know that EVERYONE that pledges money to help Launch The Spaceship gets enrolled in our Cosmic Kickstarter Coalition which gives you access to our private stock available to MEMBERS ONLY!\nFor instance: \nThe Cellar Club (tm)\nThis is like one of those exclusive cigar humidors only with beer.  Who has the time or money to build a cellar for the awesome beer you collect.  And why drink it at home?  Make our place, your place.  We will be offering a locker style system for you to store your precious barley pops, come to a great atmosphere and drink it here with your friends, or us!  With our reward we will give you a year membership and we'll stock it with great brews from our brewing friends like Drakes, Eagle Rock, Strand and more.\nThe Collaborators (tm)\nThis is another membership opportunity where you will collaborate with our brewmaster and help to brew beers throughout the year.  If the tasting room thinks it's a beer that needs to be out in the world commercially then we will do just that AND we will credit you on the bottle.  Talk about ultimate bragging rights!\nWe are also giving away tap handles both the new version and the classic as well as a barstool that is yours to take any time you are there.  Think of yourself as one of the Hollywood elite coming to YOUR table at a restaurant, well, this is the same thing.\nSo many great rewards!

Lurking underground for years, they risk throwing open fresh wounds in communities which are just beginning to heal.\nAfghanistan, a country with a long history of war, is dotted with these subterranean dangers. According to one report, about 1 million Afghans live within 500 meters of areas expected to contain landmines. Recently, a group of 10 girls lost their lives when they encountered a hidden mine on a routine outing to gather wood. On average, landmines claim about 42 lives every month.\nThis \u201cMine Kafon\u201d is a spherical mobile made out of biodegradable plastic and bamboo. It\u2019s light enough that the wind would--in theory--push it around naturally. But it is also heavy enough to set off landmines as it rolls over them.\n\u201cWith each detonation the Mine Kafon loses just one or two legs so it could potentially destroy three or four landmines in one journey\nThe Mine Kafon, at this prototype stage, has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Milan Design Week, Helsinki Museum, Dutch Design Week, Lodz Design Festival and acquired by MOMA in New York.\nAlthough it's been a great experience to have the Mine Kafon exhibited, we really designed it with the hope of deploying it in an actual minefield.\nWe now need your support to take it to the next level:\nHow much will it cost?:\nWe are asking for \u00a3100,000.00\nThis will cover costs related to engineering, fabrication, transport and the creation of a short documentary.\nCOST BREAKDOWN\nEngineering\u2013 \u00a324,500\nThis includes brainstorming sessions with an engineering company, engineering of the pressure points, the core with a GPS, the software (gps and website) and bamboo connection points. \nMolds \u2013 \u00a332,500\nMaking the molds ready for production \nFabrication\u2013 \u00a38,500\nPayment of team to build, fabricate and crash test the new design in the workshop.\nProduction of Rewards - \u00a316,500\nPayment and manufacturing of the rewards \nFilm Production- \u00a3 18,000\nCrew travel and transport of the Mine Kafon\u2019s to the minefield, documentary film licenses and other film production costs.\nRewards:\nPledge \u00a35 or more for a formal thank you credit on the film.\nThe documentary will be produced and directed by award winning, short film maker Callum Cooper. The documentary about the prototype is currently a finalist in the Sundance Focus Forward competition, so if you like that film, expect to see a longer, more involved movie.\nPledge \u00a37 and we will send you 3 very special Mine Kafon postcards.\nplus the thankyou credit on the film\nThese aren't just your typical postcard, they are way better, because they are augmented reality!\nSo when you point your smart phone or tablet at these seemingly normal postcard you will see things happen.\nThe first card is a video card, you see the kafon explode in super slow-motion. The footage is from the military tests we did last year that Callum documented and used in the short film.\nThe second card is a 3d model card, you see a 3-dimensional Mine Kafon move around ontop of the card.\nThe third card, we think is the coolest, it is the portal card. Just point your device at this card and you get a weekly window into how the project is progressing and other backer specific content.\nPledge  \u00a310 and gives you 10 Mine Kafon Wallpapers \nplus the thankyou credit and the postcards\nPledge \u00a312 and receive the Ferfrak PDF\nplus the thankyou credit, the wallpapers and the postcards\nThis is a toy we made as children in Afghanistan.

I have turned the Mine Kafon feet into a lamp. The diameter is 30cm and it's height is 20cm, it comes with a black cable (150cm in length) and black plastic screw fitting. It is suitable for a 60 watt bulb.\nUpon request we can offer the plug as European, North American or British.\nA Pledge of \u00a395 Lamp + Ferfrak \n+ the thankyou credit and the 3 postcards\nA Pledge of \u00a3165 or more gives you a set of Mine Kafon Lamps\n3 lampshades.

This will be added to the film production costs and offer the backer an insiders connection to both the overall project and the film production and release. The short film Callum made last year is a finalist at this years Sundance Film Festival Focus Forward competition.\nA Pledge of \u00a35000 (or more) gives you a scale model of the current prototype.\nWe have made 10 scale models at roughly 1:4 scale of the Mine Kafon, a miniature version of the one we presented in Callum's film. We think it would make a great art piece or talking point for any lounge room like this:\nMine Kafon 1:4 Scale Model\nhere is a video of us constructing them:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course with a project of this scale there will be some obstacles:\n\n1. We need to install the Mine Kafon with a specific GPS that has a higher than normal level of accuracy. We hope to develop this aspect with the engineering company that will partner the project. We will then need to develop the software which will allow this information to be mapped.\n\n2. We will need to engineer more advanced pressure points to detonate the mines more precisely.\n\n3. We will need to work with the engineers to improve the construction so it has higher durability. \n\n4. We will need to work with engineers to plan for mass production.\n\n5. We want to design a retrieval system for the Mine Kafon, which will possibly be a motorised system within the core. This will allow it to move out of, or away from undesired positions. We still want to fabricate it as cheaply as possible.\n\nSpecific Location of Mine Field for the field test and filming:\n\nSome of my family are still in Afghanistan so we have a fairly clear understanding of the stability of the region. If however, by next year it is too unstable to travel there, we will release the Mine Kafon in a a similar but less dangerous location, such as Western Sahara or Southern Lebanon.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Special reward tier made for you", "update_content": "Hey guys,\nAs you know our new Mine Kafon Drone campaign is coming to an end in less than 55 hours.

There are so many different mine types, not sure how well the equipment will survive triggering even the small ones.

Engineering is difficult, time-consuming work but it will pay off if not shielded from the real world. GPS mapping is a good idea if it can help you know where the threats have been detected, and if it can help you return to destroy the mine and verify it is gone, but this seems more like a long-term project given the difficulties of detecting, mapping and detonating mines from the air.

The description of the project here explains that they are going to work on a more precise gps system in order to track which paths have been cleared, and they are also brainstorming ways to retrieve the units mechanically and make them more effective at detonating mines by improving the feet/ adding metal detection. It may be the case that these units (which cost ~ 80 pounds) would not be as thorough as the detonation tanks that cost 12,000 pounds each, but they will probably clear a field faster and at a much lower cost. After these units clear a field, a single detonation tank could be brought in to make sure it is completely safe, and since presumably most of the mines will have been detonated, it will minimize any damage to the more expensive detonation tank, making it so fewer high-cost units are necessary. Also, even if no tank is available to finish the job - people are losing their lives every day due to hidden mines, so while it may be true that no official seal of completion could be provided after these units do their job, they will still help reduce tragedies like those mentioned on this website (e.g. ten girls who lost their lives on a routine search for firewood). Presumably some mines are buried outside of the demarcated areas of a minefield too, and these units would help to make high traffic areas safer. Since they are primarily powered by the wind, they also require less energy for maintenance and deployment, so they could work longer at the job than a typical robotic unit.

As a result of being laid off, home brewing took on an entirely new meaning, and what started out as a, \"Wouldn't that be cool to do someday?\" conversation, has slowly turned into a reality. Yes, sometimes we have to pinch ourselves to see if this is really happening. Yep. It's real. Well, almost real. And that's where you come in.  \n\nOUR LOCATION \nWe are thrilled to be located in the heart of historic downtown Escondido. Our building dates back to the early 1900's, and if you are a lover of all things old like we are, it just adds to the buzz of it all. Along with the charm comes an abundance of improvements. Currently the space is completely empty. We are literally building this brew pub from the ground up. That means we will be needing to purchase everything from lighting fixtures, custom bar, brew house, cold boxes, kitchen equipment, seating, kegs, glassware, not to mention the construction, plumbing and electrical work required to bring this building up to a standard that can accommodate the needs of a small brewery and restaurant.  \nOUR GOAL \nOur goal is to raise at least $40,000 to help us with some of the expenses already mentioned. Truthfully, we will need more than this, but if you're not familiar with the way kickstarter works, it's an all or nothing deal! That means that we must make our goal or we don't receive anything at all. We can go over our goal, but not under it. And just in case you're wondering, your credit card information is securely handled by Amazon and will not be charged until after our goal is reached. We can't do this without your help.\nGIVING BACK \nAs a way of acknowledging the generosity of those who have given to help make our dream a reality, we want to commit up front to give back a percentage of our profits to help serve and improve our local community. Whether it's an individual in need, a school project that needs funding, or a park that needs sprucing up, we want to find ways to help make Escondido and the surrounding area a better place to live.  And for you, our supporters, well let's just say we're about to make your day seem a little brighter. We've got everything from T-shirts, stemmed glassware, exclusive growlers, tickets to our VIP celebration, and more to show our gratitude to you. Check out our rewards to the right. We hope you are as excited about this venture as we are. Please tell your friends and get the word out about Plan 9 Alehouse! We can't wait to celebrate our success over a pint with you!\nPlease help us make Plan 9 Alehouse a reality, and follow these easy steps:\n1. CREATE a Kickstarter account. It's simple; all it takes is an email and a password.\n2. SIGN IN at Amazon.com - if you already have an account, you're all set. If not, no worries, it is easy to set-up as well.\n3.

An 8bbl steam fired brewhouse!\nWhat is this \u2018Independence from boring beers!\u2019 all about?\nAnyone that has had a generic Indian beer knows the plight of a billion Indian beer drinkers. There are a handful of fizzy yellow beers available in India and not a single craft beer in sight. Calling the industrialized beers of India \u2018boring beers\u2019 is being generously polite! Independence Brewing Company wants to introduce the art, passion, boldness, innovation and culture of American craft brewing to our friends in India.\nJoin us on our journey to bring Independence from boring beers in India!\nCraft beer half way around the world! Why should I care?\nFor the same reasons you care about craft beer or any other artisanal product; A sense of passion, pride, and fighting the notion that beer is no more than fizzy yellow stuff. Your support will help us introduce world class craft brewing to India\u2026and once even a fraction of a billion people start demanding better beer, the change will be dramatic and historic.\nTrue, Our cool gifts don\u2019t hurt either.\nDo Indians even drink beer?\nYes! The fizzy yellow beer industry in India is worth $7 billion. Scorching sun and hot food\u2026you need beer. Now imagine beers that rise to the level of the intensely wonderful flavors of Indian food, and we have the stuff of culinary glory.\nWhat\u2019s the plan?\nWe will be starting a brewpub in the city of Pune, a two hour drive east of Mumbai. Pune is an upcoming IT, Biotech, Manufacturing and Education hub. There are lots of students and professionals; the very people that are open to new ideas and will soon be demanding better beer. We will have at least six house brews on tap, with the addition of guest craft beers/special releases to keep things interesting. There will be some food served but our focus will be beer!\nThis will help us set up a base, get some cash flowing and begin to create a brand.\nOur ultimate goal is to establish a production craft brewery to reach a much wider audience. Bringing Independence from boring beers! \u2026one step at a time.  \nDo you guys know what you are doing?\nShailly has been home brewing for over 5 years, in California, and picked up awards on the way. He has also interned in brewpubs and brewed on professional equipment. His main job will be to brew awesome craft beer and keep the innovations flowing. Avanish is a business and finance guy and his main job will be to keep the business sound and healthy. \nAs Indians who have had their craft beer education in California, Shailly and Avanish became appalled at the industrialized beers being sold in India. Much as America has made a dramatic transition over the past three decades, growing from 42 breweries in the US, and flourishing to a robust 2,200+ today, the opportunity to change the landscape exists in India today.  As Indians and rabid craft beer enthusiasts, we started carefully researching the craft brewing industry, developing our business plan and raising funds to get started. Along the way we managed to convince craft beer visionary Greg Koch (CEO, Stone Brewing Co.) to come on as 'Chief Adviser,' and we have raised some money from Angel investors.\nAt this point, we\u2019ve spec\u2019d out our brewing equipment, shortlisted locations in Pune and hired key team members there, so we\u2019re well poised to get this project going!\nOver the next 6-9 months, we will be working hard in Pune to get this thing off the ground. Sure, we will have our challenges, but then great beer is all worthy of great efforts and we\u2019re up to the task!\nHowever, our goal needs your further support to become a reality.\nWhere will the money be spent? What if you exceed the funding goal?\nMost of the money will go into purchasing an 8 bbl (1 US bbl = 31 gallons) brewing system from North American suppliers. Some money will go towards purchasing malt, hops and yeast also from North American suppliers. If we exceed our funding we will have greater financial security till we break even. We would love to upgrade / upsize our equipment! \nIf we greatly exceed our funding goal (dreaming! dreaming! dreaming!) we might directly start a production brewery. Our goal will be to make you, as a craft beer enthusiast, proud of our efforts (and to supply a home base to your future travels in our great country)!\nAre you sure you are raising enough?\nBootstrapping is not an option for us. Considering that all our equipment and most of our supplies will have to be imported from North America our setup costs are substantial, plus we need some cash to fund operations till we break even. We have raised key funding from Angel investors, and that covers most of our costs. But we need a little more to get going and ensure success! Our goal on Kickstarter is the minimum we need to close the gap in our funding. But hey, we really could use all the help we can get!\nBe assured that bringing Independence from boring beers to a billion people is a great responsibility and we take it very seriously!  We certainly won\u2019t hit them all at once, or even a fraction of them, but we promise you one thing: We WILL be a success, and we WILL be an important part of the craft beer revolution in India!           \nHow do I Pledge?\nSimply select the reward on the right and follow the steps to complete the process.

We hope you are as excited to be a part of this project as we are. Please show your support and help spread the word about Jakarta Punk: The Marjinal Story. \nAbout the film:\nAnyone taking a taxi cab in Jakarta , stuck in a traffic jam, will have noticed 'street kids' coming up to the window appealing for money, often playing ukeleles and singing. Offering a few dollars worth of currency might leave one wondering -  'is this going to make a real difference?'\nIn Jakarta, there's a punk rock movement that established itself over a decade ago. Marjinal is one of Indonesia's original punk bands. The band quickly became popular because their songs offered hope for kids with few opportunities. Our film, Jakarta Punk: The Marjinal Story, is our way of spreading the message of change for those who cannot easily help themselves.\nPunk attitudes gave Marjinal the impetus to demand change against frightening odds. On the streets of Jakarta in the late 1990's, mass public protests brought about the end of authoritarian rule by then President Suharto. But Indonesia still has many social ills to heal, with around 50% of the population still living in poverty. Marjinal continues to sing about the injustices and corruption they see every day. Punk and its radical attitude is a cry from the streets. \nOur documentary has Marjinal at its core. It tells their story, as the voice of the street kids. Marjinal are inspiring a social and political revolution in Indonesia, helping directly through sheltering these homeless children, and teaching them creative ways to earn money. Punk gives these kids an identity, hope, a family. We look into the reasons why the punk community is a substitute for family and state support.\nFor your pledges to this Kickstarter project, we are offering you merchandise that is handmade by Jakarta's street punks, buying each item at a premium from the artists, providing them a means to earn a living. The remaining funds go to help cover the basic costs of making this film, dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of the marginalized in Indonesia. \nBeyond the documentary:\nWe have big plans for exhibits, bringing Marjinal on tour outside Indonesia, a photo book on Marjinal and Jakarta's punks and much more. Any additional funds we raise will improve our production standards for the film, and the better it does, the better position we will be in to achieve these future goals, raising the awareness of this dynamic and powerful punk movement in Jakarta.\nYOU CAN ALSO PLEDGE IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE U.S.A. !\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/JakartaPunkTheMarjinalStory\nREWARDS OFFERED WITH YOUR PLEDGE / ALL REWARDS BOUGHT FROM AND MADE BY PUNKS.

We've burned through 10 oil changes, 3 engines, and 2 transmissions. We've shoveled 56,000 pounds of ice, refilled 43,000 gallons of water, and washed & chopped 3,000 bunches of local kale. We've had first degree burns, third degree burns, bumps, bruises and sprained ankles. Life on the road has been fun, but we think its time to plant some roots and have a place to call home.\nWHY A RESTAURANT? \n1. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD keeping up with our ever-changing schedules and twitter feeds. It's time we offer them a reliable spot and provide an actual roof over their heads, with tables and chairs as apposed to curbs and parking lots. \n2. With a motionless kitchen we would be able to offer ELEVATED MENU ITEMS, cooked to order, in a MODERN, INNOVATIVE and COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE.\n3. WE'RE SET BACK BY BREAKDOWNS.

It was an honest effort to help people healthy and feeling their best.\nSupporting Local Farms:\nWe stand behind our slogan of \"Local, Fresh Organic.\" It has always been extremely important to us to source from local farms whenever possible. Our sweetheart farm- Tanaka Farms- is located less than 5 miles from the truck in Irvine. Tanaka Farms is a true gem and grows amazing organic produce that we feature in each week's menu. We've built a strong bond with the Tanaka family, the farmers, and the produce stand operators and send business their way whenever possible. We believe that SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMERS and other small businesses is the best possible way to do business and reinvest in our COMMUNITY.\nSo, WHAT'S THE $100,000 FOR!?\nWe need to turn a SHOE SHOP into a RESTAURANT. The project actually costs $200,000, but we are only asking for half. The location is on the promenade pictured below, to the right of the umbrella. \nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why dont you just find an existing restuarant that went out of business instead of bulding out a kitchen?\"  \nGreat Question! The answer is because we FELL IN LOVE with Downtown Santa Ana and see an opportunity to get into the most UP & COMING AREA of ORANGE COUNTY at the GROUND LEVEL. A lot of effort is being put into restoring this area and we would love to be able to help build the COMMUNITY  and offer a much needed healthy dining option.\nHere is a breakdown of where the $200k would be going:\nConstruction $90,000, Kitchen Equipment $44,450, Front of the house $20,000, Profesional Design & Plans by Architect $14,000, Licenses/Permits $12,950, Insurance $1,500, Inventory $2,000, Misc $5,000, Professional Fees $1,500,  Rent & Deposit $4,400, 90 day working capital $15,000.\nHow many seats?\nAnother great question! We're estimating there will be 30 indoor seats and another 15 on the patio.\nWhat's the menu? \nThe restaurant menu will be an extended version of the truck menu, including some elevated dishes that aren't possible to execute on the truck. We will be keeping true to our slogan, \"Local, Fresh, Organic\" by continuing to source from local farms and using organic ingredients whenever possible.\nWe also plan to obtain a Beer & Wine license and feature Organic Wines, Gluten Free Beers, and Mimosas with WEEKEND BRUNCH!\nWhat about the truck?\nThe truck will continue to roam the streets of Southern California.\nBirds preppin on the truck\nWHO is in CHARGE HERE?\nShe is...\n\n\"Hi! I'm Stephanie Morgan, the owner/founder/chef of the Seabirds truck. I would be the one managing the restaurant and creating the menu. I also do most other things (since this is a small business and all). My background is in sales, customer service and finance and I've been successful in managing the truck for the last 20 months so I know I would be successful in managing the restaurant.

The names will be a permanent fixture in the restaurant and a daily reminder of our eternal gratitude to YOU for making this dream a reality.

It is one of the longest established spirits in the world with a rich and turbulent history and it is exclusively associated with Ireland. The origin of distilling in Ireland dates back over 1,000 years. Before there was Irish whiskey there was poit\u00edn \u2013 a clear Irish spirit famous for its strength and \u201cmedicinal\u201d qualities. The word itself is Gaelic for \"little pots,\" which is derived from the small copper pots used by home distillers. It is an un-aged sprit that is traditionally made from potatoes or barley. Its taste varies by producer, but it generally has a somewhat herbal nose and is great as a replacement mixer in most whiskey, bourbon, or vodka cocktails.  It is also great neat or with a dash of water.\nNEW PLEDGE!! YOUR NAME HERE!!! INSTANT 'COOL' STATUS!!!\nThe name 1661 Poitin comes from the fact that the English Crown outlawed poit\u00edn in that year because of difficulty taxing it and as part of a larger effort to quash Irish culture. This ban lasted for more than 300 years. Recipes were handed down generations, and poit\u00edn was secretly distilled and shared throughout that period. Over time it has become a symbol of Irish pride and independence.\nWith your help I want to revive this age-old traditional Irish spirit. I want you to be able to taste and share this piece of Irish heritage. \nI plan to craft 1661 in a small batch Irish distillery and use only Irish ingredients, differentiating from most of the products on the international market that add \u201cpoit\u00edn flavor\u201d to a neutral grain spirit. 1661 Poitin will be a handcrafted, small batch, pure pot still spirit using locally sourced Irish ingredients. I have consulted with different brewers and 1661 will reflect both its heritage and have mass appeal.\nKickstarter allows people with great ideas a chance to execute them with help from supporters like you, i.e. a small donation.\nKickstarter will only charge your card and disburse the money to us if we reach the $40,000 goal by the deadline!!\n1661 Poit\u00edn is a spirit that is both historical and looks forward to the future.  I want to create a bridge between the Ireland I grew up in and the modern palate.  It is intensely personal to me because it reflects my own story.  I emigrated from Ireland, but I never want to forget what makes that place so special to me. Growing up on a farm in the heart of Ireland has given me a love and respect for truly Irish products because there was simply no alternative. Working as a bartender in the U.S. taught me that, although Americans love Irish spirits, they didn\u2019t have access to the most Irish of them all.  1661 was born out of my desire to share something uniquely Irish with the rest of the world.\nIn homage to this ancient Irish Spirit, 1661 Poit\u00edn will produce its first batch of poit\u00edn to revive the traditional Spirit of Ireland! \nThe money from this campaign will be used:\n- To work with the Poit\u00edn maker and the distillery\n- For bottling, label and packaging costs\n- For shipping, customs brokers and warehouse storage in the US\n- For distribution and licenses\nPlease remember that you won't be charged if we don't reach our goal. So click the \"pledge now' button and help revive poit\u00edn!\nWhy I am the person to make this happen:\nI have acquired my Federal Importer's Basic Permit and Federal Distributor's Permit from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the federal government. I have incorporated my company, traveled to Ireland to compute logistics, sourced distilleries, customs brokers, shipping merchants, labeling and bottling companies. I am now ready to produce my first batch of 1661 Poit\u00edn with your help! I have also worked in the bar industry since I was 15 when my parents bought a pub in the Irish Midlands!\nPlease take the time to watch my short video, to get to know me and learn more about 1661 Poit\u00edn! \nPlease remember that you won't be charged if we don't reach our goal.

Through Hallyu, many countries in Asia have sparked wide interest in South Korean television series referred to simply as Korean Dramas, which are dramatic love stories that rely heavily on character development, a complex plot, and intelligent script-writing. \nEducation Abroad hopes to contribute to the Korean Wave in America and other English speaking countries by attracting a wider audience to seek interest in Korean Dramas, and therefore start to seek interest in other forms of South Korean culture down the road. \nThe Story:\nThe show is about Danny Han and Heejung Kim. Two seniors who meet in high school and fall in love. Though Heejung is a new foreign exchange student from Korea, Danny is able to make a connection with her. However, when Heejung's father finds out that Danny is from a poor immigrant family with no high ranking name and can't even speak Korean, he quickly rejects their love and sends Heejung back to Korea. Although she cannot forget about Danny, she does as her father wishes, but returns to America for college at a prestigious international university. Danny, heart-broken, vows to never let something like this happen to him again, and goes to Korea himself as soon as he graduates. There he gets a tutoring job teaching English. He returns to America for college about a year later with a firm grasp of the language, culture, and even a Korean name. But what the two never expected was seeing each other again, as they both happen to attend the same prestigious international university! \nWho is in charge of the series?\nThe series will be headed by Terry Song, a Korean-American filmmaker. \nTerry Song is a part-time model and actor from Pittsburgh. After a while of being in front of the camera, Terry found a greater interest behind it. During his later years in high school he took advanced TV production courses where he was trained by Doug Martin, a national award winning teacher of video production and teacher of the year finalist. By the time he graduated, Terry learned to write, produce, edit, and direct the daily news coverage show through the schools full featured TV station. During his interview for college, Terry received an $8,000 scholarship for Artistic Achievement and currently attends Point Park University, where he is majoring in screen-writing.\nWhat your money is going to:\nYour money will contribute towards several different things:\n1.

The other Michael Jackson. But who was Michael, and how did he inspire a worldwide revolution?\nBeer Hunter: The Movie is a documentary film about the British journalist and author Michael Jackson, who's books and television series about beer inspired the global phenomenon that is the craft brewing renaissance. An intimate portrait based on over 60 hours of rare, recent video footage, Beer Hunter sheds insight into the life and contributions of this brilliant and beloved man, who, while quietly battling Parkinson's, became the leading voice and inspiration behind the craft brewing movement. For those who had ever met Michael Jackson, or were deeply inspired by his work, it's hard to imagine that he is no longer with us.\nBased on the huge success of his books and magazine articles about beer, Michael wrote and starred in a six-part television series, called The Beer Hunter, which was released in 1989 by Channel 4 in the UK, and aired in the early 90's on the Discovery Channel in the U.S. While the show became an instant classic and has since aired in over 30 different countries, Michael was never able to get another episode produced before he passed away suddenly in 2007. Now, with the help of the international craft beer community, we can produce another beer hunting adventure in his honor.\nBeer Hunter: The Movie is our attempt to follow up the original Beer Hunter series with a rare library of more recent footage, showing Michael on - and \"off\" camera throughout the great beer cities, breweries, and pubs of Europe and the United States. The footage will form the basis of a movie about Michael's life, with the remaining footage edited into a series to be released as an open-source public resource. The unprecedented growth and popularity of craft brewing and distilling, and the ever-expanding field of beer and whisky writing, would never have been possible without Michael's ground-breaking efforts and uniquely engaging voice. It's important that we tell his story and recognize his contributions before his memory fades.\nMichael especially inspired renewed interest in the creative and complex beers of Belgium. In honor of that, and as a tribute to his inspiration, the Beer Hunter movie will incorporate never-before-seen footage of five young American brewers, who in 2006, led by Sam Calagione and the Italian beer expert Lorenzo Dabove, (and also featuring Rob Todd of Allagash Brewing, Vinnie Cilurzo from Russian River, Tomme Arthur from The Lost Abbey, and Adam Avery from Avery Brewing) visited the inspirational mecca of Belgium on a trip they dubbed \"Belge-a-palooza.\"\nFor the past three years, through many hours of donated time, and with the generous support of a few sponsors, we have put together the basis of a film from our existing library of recent beer-hunting footage. News of the film, as well as the trailer, leaked out very early on in production, and there are now thousands of people around the world eagerly awaiting its release. While a bit premature, it's testament to Michael's influence. We have potential screenings set up on virtually every continent, and it is our hope that all screenings will be fund-raisers for Parkinson's organizations. Though we have momentum, we have exhausted our personal resources, and need some outside help to see this project to completion. We are hoping the craft brewing community can come together to help us finish this tribute to Michael, and in the process help raise a lot of money for Parkinson's research. \nYOUR INVESTMENT\nWe are seeking funding to accomplish the following goals:\n1. Gather current interviews from leading brewers, distillers, and writers telling Michael's story, how he influenced them, and their personal view on the evolution of craft brewing and distilling.\n2. Pay for a soundtrack, graphics, post-production, and global distribution. \n3. Edit a series from the all footage not used in the film, to be included on a special collector's edition DVD for die-hard fans (check our rewards!).\n4. Create a public archive from the entire library of footage used to produce the documentary. This will be submitted to the existing Micheal Jackson Collection archive at Oxford-Brookes University, in London.\n5. Set up the non-profit Michael Jackson Memorial Foundation, with the goal of organizing annual fund-raising events in Michael's memory, with proceeds to benefit Parkinson's Research.\nCAN WE EXCEED OUR GOAL?\nAlthough $30,000 seems like a lot of money, it will barely accomplish the goals listed above. As always, the production team will be donating most of their time and effort, but film production can be surprisingly expensive, especially at this stage. Legal and copyright expenses, insurance, post-production, music, distribution, and marketing add up very quickly. Most documentaries of this scope can easily exceed $200,000 in total production costs. But by calling on favors, self-distributing, and using the beer community to market the film, we can substantially reduce our costs and finish the film on time.  If we exceed our goal, we will be able to license archival footage, specifically footage from the original Beer Hunter TV series, which will not be possible within our current goal. Simply put, the more money we raise, the better this film will be, and the more people that will be able to see it and appreciate Michael's life and work.\nMORE ABOUT MICHAEL\nIn 1977, British news journalist Michael Jackson published a groundbreaking book called The World Guide to Beer. It was the first time someone had attempted to categorize every known style of beer in the world, and the book inspired a revolution of sorts. People started talking about beer with the same respect previously granted only to wine. Michael's books and writing introduced brewers and beer enthusiasts to a whole new world of beer styles, particularly the great beers of Belgium. His writing was particularly well-received in the United States, where he quickly became the Godfather of the American microbrewing movement. But Michael didn't just write about beer, he wrote about people, and was fascinated by the story of the brewers behind the beer as much as he was the beer. It was this approach, combined with his uniquely engaging style of writing, that made him the world's most beloved and influential beer writer. He also became the world's most successful writer on the subject of distilled malt beverages, and his books on whiskey have sold more copies than even his books about beer.\nMichael's sudden passing on August 27th, 2007, at the age of 64, rocked the beer world. The Godfather was gone.\nMORE ABOUT THE FILM\nI started shooting video tastings with Michael in 2003 for the Rare Beer Club. But as we traveled to various tastings and events, and witnessed the rock-star status to which Michael was treated by the craft brewing community, the project quickly took on a greater scope. For the next three years, I followed Michael around Europe and the U.S. on what was ostensibly going to be a documentary, or even another Beer Hunter series. Most of the footage I shot by myself, on the fly, although towards the end I was fortunate enough to have audio and lighting help from my good friend Clarke Paschall. In all, we gathered over 60 hrs. of rare footage of Michael in Ireland, England, the Czech Republic, Paris, Belgium, and throughout the U.S. But no sooner had the project begun, than Michael's health started to fail. In 2006, he suffered a heart attack, after which it was revealed that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, a fact he had kept secret from even his closest friends and colleagues for over a decade. But, in typically self-deprecating fashion, Michael embarked on his final book, entitled \"I'm Not Drunk\", a humorous account about being a famous drinks writer suffering from Parkinson's.\nOn August 27th, 2007, however, the sad news of his sudden passing rocked the beer world. The Father of the craft brewing Renaissance was gone.\nOver the past three years I have gone through my existing footage, logged everything, released short segments for our Facebook and YouTube subscribers, and gotten together the basic story of the film. Our Kickstarter funding will go towards adding new interviews from leading brewers to the existing footage, purchasing a soundtrack, and will hopefully cover most of post-production. At that point we plan on self-distributing the film, primarily through the craft beer community network. We'd like to launch the film on August 27th, 2012, on the anniversary of Michael's passing, so we have a lot of work to do. We are also planning on having the World Premier in conjunction with the 2012 GABF, which is currently the largest gathering of craft enthusiasts on the planet.\nWe can't possibly tell all of Michael's story, but we hope that, by establishing an annual event in his memory, we can continue to carry his spirit. He was the pioneer that opened up a new frontier for so many in the craft beer industry. Incidentally, Michael hated that word - industry - when speaking of craft beer. My apologies for lack of a better synonym.And, we want your content! If you have photos, videos, stories, anything related to Michael and his role as an inspiration to you, send it along. Go to our website (www.beerhuntermovie.com) for contact info.\nI am hopeful that we can reach our fairly modest goal. Whatever the outcome, I am resolved to see that this project reaches the eyes, ears, and hearts of those who will appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your support, your donation, and for helping spread the word. It's the least, and the best, that we can do for Michael in his memory.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "One week left for Whisky Chasing", "update_content": "Hello backers, \nThere's still one week left in our Whisky Chasing movie campaign, the second and final chapter to our Michael Jackson film project.

(And get some cool stuff like this growler, see the list to the right!)\nWe need your help to Kickstart Mississippi's 2nd Brewery!\nLiving in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country \u2013 but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world\u2019s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. For those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.\nAt Lucky Town, we\u2019ve assembled a team that has the skill set, the knowledge, and the passion to bring our beer to you. We not only want to provide the craft beer community with beer that they will love, but to challenge the rest to:\nBe Bold. Rediscover Beer.\nWhat are we doing?\nOpening a microbrewery in the Jackson metro area!\nLucky Town\u2019s ultimate goal is to stay true to our homebrewing roots by producing unique, artisanal, handcrafted ales and lagers. We intend to offer at least four year round beers that will roll out in pairs, but we also will be releasing small batch brews throughout the year that will be available in smaller quantities. Small batching will allow us more freedom to experiment with ingredients not normally found in beer that you find in Mississippi, providing for an ever-evolving product range rather than a fixed seasonal schedule. Examples include the southern pit barbeque inspired stout called \u201cStout of the Rising Sun\u201d which uses smoked grains combined with roasted jalapenos and Lucky Town\u2019s unique take on a winter warmer called \"What the Elf?\" that has cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel, figs and vanilla in it to give it a wonderful holiday flavor. Along with these will be the small batch Kaizen Saison, an ever evolving beer used to explore new flavor profiles and push the limits of what beer can be. We will never shy away from using non-traditional ingredients. Expect plenty of things aged in unique barrels, including sour beers that will spend as much as 3 years in the barrel getting funky.\nWhat do we need money for?\nWe can't wait to start brewing commercially so that you can finally have a taste of our hard work, but we need some start-up funds to do it first. We are asking for $20,000 but have a higher goal of $40,000 for initial funds, and of course the more we get, the faster we get started. With help from you we can move our vision from dream to reality!\nWhat Lucky Town will be...\nOur ideal space would encompass a tasting room with a broad selection of our beer on tap for patrons to enjoy, including growler fills and six-packs for sale so you can take our beer home with you. Unfortunately, the State of Mississippi doesn\u2019t allow for any of this to take place - we intend to change that. Lucky Town is devoted to modernizing our state\u2019s beer laws so that residents and visitors to our state can enjoy and appreciate a local handcrafted beer the freshest way it was intended to be appreciated, which is from the brewery taps.\nWe love Mississippi, and we plan on giving back to the local community once we are up and running. Lucky Town will produce exceptional beers within the brewery, but we intend to reach out and enhance the Jackson area by hosting craft festivals - music, art, and beer. We will also have space in the brewery that will be available for the public to use as a studio, meeting or gathering space for special events.\nSl\u00e1inte,\nLucas, Chip, Brandon & Angela\n\nLinks you should CLICK\nVisit our Facebook Page!\nFollow us on Twitter!\nCheck out our beers and learn more about us: www.luckytownbrewing.com\nClick here to listen to an interview we did with Aleheads.com.\nHere\u2019s a local pub run that we host every month that promotes running and craft beer!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Journey to Open Jackson's First Post-Prohibition Microbrewery", "update_content": "...and what a journey it has been.\nThe last few years of chasing our dream to start and grow Lucky Town Brewing Company has been full of ups and downs (and thankfully way more ups than downs).

Simple Earth Hops is a family run commercial hopyard with the motto \"Slower.  Smaller. Local.\" \nSimple Earth Hops brings the community together by organizing free farm events to spread education about growing hops as a sustainable farming option and to demonstrate how to duplicate and build on what we have established at the hopyard and with the brewing community.\nSimple Earth Hops is the recipient of a 2009 USDA-SARE grant which helped cover the cost of establishing our hopyard trellis in 2010 and helped pay back some of the costs from last year\u2019s free community outreach events. As we look forward into the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons, we still need a lot of support for upcoming outreach event costs and for some sustainable growing expenses. This is why we are asking for help with our project on Kickstarter. \nBy helping us out here on Kickstarter, you can be a part of our project by furthering our mission of demonstrating local hop production for Midwest brewers while we teach the community how to grow in a sustainable fashion.\nHops are an agricultural crop necessary in the beer making process, but not available as a local farm product to brewers in the Midwest.\nBacking this project will help fund our next outreach event and will help provide funding for hop growing costs at my family's small scale commercial hopyard -- located at a community supported agriculture (CSA) farm in Dodgeville, WI.\nThe goal of using Kickstarter for this project is to bring funding: (1)for some operating costs at our 1/4 acre demonstration hopyard and; (2)to cover the cost of hosting our next farm outreach event where we use education to demonstrate to potential and current farmers about sustainable farming methods and to share with others in the community the economic opportunity presented by growing hops as a high demand local crop for small Midwest brewers.\nThe next farm outreach event, titled \"Brewing Up a Community\", will be held this autumn at the farm for over 150 event attendees who will get hands-on experience harvesting hops while learning sustainable farming and while enjoying local craft beer and live music on the farm -- we have already began booking bluegrass bands, launched free ticket registration and begun securing commercial beer donations for this end-of-season community event.  \nThere are a plethora of expenses associated with hosting hopyard demonstration events and maintaining a profitable hopyard.  Here are some expenses we plan to take care of through your help here on Kickstarter:\nCB radio rentals to aid in communicating with event organizers to ensure a well-run event.\nSheriff's parking fee to help orderly parking.\nMeals for event volunteers\n8x8 Castle Moonwalk rental for entertainment for children at our free events\nGenerator rental for bands\nIce to keep beer cold\n20x40 tent rental for hop picking and keeping us dry at the events\nPort-a-Potty rentals\nChipper/Shredder to make own wood and paper mulch for our lasagna style gardening hop rows in the hopyard\nShovel to dig rhizomes and weeds\nPitch forks for digging rhizomes and moving straw mulch\nWheel barrow for moving dirt and plants in hopyard\nAdvertising on beer websites to help sell our conscientiously grown hops\nStraw to mulch entire hopyard\nTwine to string the hopyard in the spring\nIrrigation upgrades\nWork gloves for event volunteers picking hops\nHopyard and event labor\nVacuum sealer and bags for packaging hops\nOnline store for hop and rhizomes sales\nBoxes for shipping hops\nShipping tape for boxes\nHarvest trimmer to cut down the hops from the trellis at our harvest events\nLadder stabilizer to aid in cutting down plants\nPlease take a minute to review the rewards we have to offer to say thanks for your Kickstarter pledge...\nSimple Earth Hops website\nFacebook Page -- Please 'Like' us and share our Kickstarter project with your Facebook friends\nCommunity Event Example\nOur 2010 Movie: Year 1 in the hopyard", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Matt Sweeny\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nBased in rural Dodgeville, Wisconsin near Madison in the heart of beer-coutry U.S.A., Matt has a strong interest in working to support local...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Share this project or back us in the future", "update_content": "This Kickstarter has only raised just over 10% of the sustainable hops business'  Kickstarter project budget so Simple Earth Hops may choose to relaunching this project with a significantly smaller project budget [read: not paying ourselves but just covering operation and event costs]. \nFunding goal ends on 9/9 so please ask a friend to back this project.\nYou can also share this sustainable community hop business project on Facebook too.
