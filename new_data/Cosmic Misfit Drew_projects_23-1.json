Subscribe to our newsletter!\nWant to Wishlist the game on Steam? Do that here!\nYou can also Follow us on Twitter or join our Discord.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nWhisker Squadron is our fresh take on forward scrolling aerial combat, featuring feline heroes, dynamic missions, and procedurally generated bosses and worlds!\nComing to PC and consoles in 2022\n Wishlist on Steam | Website | Twitter | Facebook | \n\nHey everyone! \nWe are Flippfly, the team behind 2013's Race The Sun. We are so excited to let you know about our new project, Whisker Squadron!\nClick banner to wishlist Whisker Squadron right now!\nWhisker Squadron is the culmination of a creative spark that was lit over 20 years ago, and that has burned in us through our careers, and strengthened by modern indie games. When we created Race The Sun in 2013, we took aesthetic cues from classic low-poly games like Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, and created something with a uniquely minimalist feeling that was loved by our fans. Ever since that project shipped, we\u2019ve talked about creating a follow up that was more combat-focused, and that pushed the procedurally-generated elements even further.\n\nWhisker Squadron is that game.\n\nChoose your pilot and fight your way through procedurally-generated worlds and epic, procedurally-generated boss fights. You've got one life, and your tactical upgrade choices will be crucial to your success in this aerial roguelike.\n\nEngage in epic aerial combat with your feline pilot of choice\nTake on a series of epic, procedurally-generated boss fights\nFight your way through dynamic worlds in a mission that's unique every time you play it\nAnd there's more:\nProcedurally generated, rogue-like mission structure that's unique every time you play\nIncredibly dynamic procedurally-generated bosses that make for intense climax to every act\nChoose your pilots from a cast of 3 feline heroes\nDaily challenges and leaderboards\nDon't just take our word for it! Here is what the games press is saying about Whisker Squadron:\n\u201cSome of the bosses look downright inspired\u201d - PC Gamer \n\u201cIf this is where the game is starting in the public eye, I can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\u201d - Polygon \n\u201cIt's early days yet, but yeah, I'd play this\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun \n\u201cWhile on the surface Whisker Squadron looks like Starfox with cats, the addition of Race the Sun\u2019s elements make it a very different game.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201cThe foundation of a tried and true rail shooter mixed with procedurally-generated level design, roguelike gameplay, and striking art design is a solid one for Flippfly.\u201d - Shacknews \nWhisker Squadron is a corridor shooter with procedurally generated worlds, some light roguelike elements, and a cast of cats! Pilot your ship, avoiding obstacles and blasting the autonomous bots built by the sinister PAW Technologies corporation in an effort to save the galaxy from out of control algorithms bent on planetary destruction.\n\nThe game follows an action rogue-like formula: You get a single life to play through a 3-act campaign through several worlds and random space encounters, each with their own looks and threats. Challenge yourself to acquire higher rankings by avoiding damage, blasting all the bots, and keeping your multiplier high to earn the most rewards for beating each world.\nChallenge isn't everything, so we also offer a set of customizable gameplay settings instead of traditional difficulty settings. Start with more shields on your ship? Encounter less enemies? Get health pickups at the end of each world? Go for it!\nAnd if you want a nightmare, the settings will be there for you masochist-cats as well...mewhahaha\nDynamic mission map\n\nPlay as multiple characters, each with their own unique special weapon. Along the way you'll encounter shops and events to acquire a choice of new weapons and items to powerup as you make your way across the galaxy to stop the bots. Each play-through is unique, with each world being procedurally generated from a set of 'pattern' chunks, and a map that presents different connections and choices.\nAnd it's not just the worlds which are generated: each act culminates with an epic battle against a large enemy bot, and the bots are always looking for improvements so you'll have to keep on your toes each play-through because this bot is procedurally generated for a unique battle each time!\nJin is our character artist, and has drawn our wonderful cast of cats. Here's a few of them:\nSean is leading the way on the visual development for the game, using the custom world editor that we\u2019ve built for this game. We\u2019re evolving the minimalist style we developed with Race The Sun, and adding layers of visual flair on top. What you see on this Kickstarter page is a work-in-progress. We\u2019re improving the visuals more every week, and we\u2019re confident that the final look will blow you away.\nWe\u2019re also super excited to be working with Chel Wong on the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Chel has an amazing range of styles and really nailed the feeling that we\u2019re going for with this game. You can hear her work in the trailer above!\n\nHere\u2019s what Chel has to say about working on the Soundtrack:\n\u201cFor the soundtrack I have so many ideas I'm excited to work on! I plan on taking some influence from predecessors in the genre but also going to be putting my own spin on things. And as is my specialty, I can't wait to see what kind of adaptive layers I can put into this soundtrack to react to gameplay!\n\nSOUNDTRACK PREVIEW\nhere's a little preview of what Chel's cooking up for the soundtrack. This is the track for Lunar Canyon, along with the \"boss variant\" that will play at the end level boss fight.\n(Note: this is a work-in progress, Chel is still in the process of adding some sweet guitars!)\nHere are a few of the more unique Kickstarter-exclusive rewards we're offering!\n\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME ($200 and above)\nYou'll send us a photo of yourself, your pet or anything that's age-appropriate, and we'll add it to an object in a special \"Easter egg\" level that players can access in the game itself!\nPut yourself in the secret level, rough concept\nADD YOUR FURRY FRIEND ($500 and above) \nYou'll send us a picture of your pet, or some artwork of your personal animal persona, and we'll add it to the game as a secret playable character, unlocked with a unique cheat code.\nYour furry friend in the game, rough concept\nCUSTOM SHOUT OUT $1000 and above)\nWe'll send you a survey and code up a special conversation with the characters in the game, who will give you a shout-out by name, activated by a special personal cheat code. We'll work with you to make it special!\nCustom shout-out, rough concept\nAaron San Filippo is a co-founder of Flippfly and the company\u2019s lead programmer. He\u2019s overseeing production and code, building new tools to support the design of the game, and coordinating the team. He also built the prototype for the game and helps out with design.\n\nSean Campbell is the designer and creative director. Sean helped Flippfly build Race The Sun\u2019s portal worlds, and has returned as the world creator and Whisker Squadron\u2019s creative director. He\u2019s also leading the efforts on the game\u2019s 3D art. \nAaron, Sean, Chel, Jin, Chris, and Zaire\n\nChel Wong is a seasoned composer with multiple game soundtracks to her name. Chel works in a variety of styles with an incredible range, and she\u2019s creating an awesome original soundtrack for Whisker Squadron.\n\nChris Atkins joined Flippfly recently as a programmer, and is helping flesh out Whisker Squadron\u2019s gameplay.\n\nJin Li is a concept artist and animator from Sydney, Australia. She created and drew all of the characters for Whisker Squadron and contributed concept design.\n\nZaire Lanier is a writer and narrative designer from the Midwestern US. She's creating a comic called The Bone Herder, and will be helping create the WS universe, characters, and in-game dialog.\nJune 2021: beta-level backers and above get early access to the beta on PC\nDecember 2021: game is content-complete and enters final phase of testing\nMay 2022: The game launches and all backers get a PC copy\nJuly 2022: All physical and digital rewards are delivered.\nMost of the funding for Whisker Squadron comes directly from Flippfly. We have been working on this game for about a year, and we are in a fortunate situation where Race The Sun and our other games are providing a steady income stream that\u2019s allowed us to work on the game. However, this Kickstarter will be essential for getting us over the finish line, and if we reach our stretch goals, will allow us to create an even better game, and guarantee an on-time delivery.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested a lot of Flippfly funds in Whisker Squadron already, supporting a small core team to build about 1/3rd of the game so far. We are on Kickstarter to raise funds to help finish the game and expand our team. This money will help us create an original soundtrack, add additional features, and finish the game sooner.\nYour support means the world to us! Our fans have always been central to Flippfly\u2019s success, and you are quite literally making this project possible. Thanks for coming along for the ride and being a part of our dream project!\n\n* Platforms:\nAt this time, we are planning for Steam, Epic Games Store on PC. We're also looking into PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch We will finalize these plans in the coming months and keep you updated!

One thing that makes us geeks is obsession and passion for details -- for systems, for stories and for genius. We are compelled to solve these puzzles and to explore these worlds. If you know what I mean, I think you have a sense of what this movie is about.\u201d \nPhilip Shane, Director\nRand and Robyn Miller Photo credit: Adventure Gamers\nIn 1993, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, living in a double-wide trailer on the edge of a forest outside Spokane, Washington -- a.k.a., the middle of nowhere -- changed the home computer industry forever with the launch of MYST, a single-perspective exploration game that had no score, no violence and no set goal other than satisfying pure curiosity. In a world of flashy, shoot-\u2018em-up, beat-the-clock video game challenges, MYST quietly became the best-selling game of the 1990s.\nMore than a quarter century later, director Philip Shane is making a documentary film about the lives of the famous brothers as they continue to expand the world of MYST and other video gaming projects. He will also demonstrate how the story of MYST is part of a growing continuum of unsung electronics visionaries who constantly push the envelope of what gaming means. For every new level of innovation created, the next generation carries the torch to build newer, higher levels over the decades.\nPhilip Shane\nThrough extensive interviews with Rand and Robyn, along with several other gaming and computing luminaries, THE MYST DOCUMENTARY will tell the unlikely story of two brothers with disparate talents and interests, who were able to form a partnership that would revolutionize the way video games are consumed by the public. With few other gaming pioneers to use for inspiration, the Miller brothers were able to break new ground by writing an original script from scratch, creating an entirely new virtual digital environment long before the internet arose, composing an atmospheric musical score, and even recording and acting in short videos via their company, Cyan Worlds. In the following years, Cyan released several sequels, including RIVEN and URU, bringing new sophistication to the MYST universe, while Robyn has branched out with his own separate gaming pursuits.\nMYST Creator Robyn Miller with Philip Shane, Documentary Filmmaker\nTo date, Philip has completed some interviews and preliminary filming of the Miller brothers and others who helped bring the MYST saga to life. But the MYST DOCUMENTARY project still needs YOUR help to bring this story to life on screen.\nPhilip has determined that additional and substantial funding is needed to complete the primary filming required before it can be turned into a concise, entertaining cinematic story. For the next few years, Philip wants to capture the creative processes of these gaming masters and their collaborators. In addition, the filmmakers need to delve into archival materials \u2013 videos, articles, photos, early computer programs and hardware, radio interviews, etc. \u2013 to help flesh out the details of the exciting MYST story. These efforts will be funded by your pledges!\nCurrently in the \u201cpre-production\u201d phase, Philip plans to continue interviewing Robyn, Rand, and the rest of the team at Cyan, as well as many other luminaries in the gaming and computing world. He wants to use every available item -- props, early videos, computer hardware, original sketches -- from every Cyan project to describe their journey.\nWorking with cinematographer Kyle Kelly, Philip also wants to develop a cinematic style that is different from the traditional \u201ctalking heads\u201d doc. The finished product will be more in the spirit of the MYST game itself, shown in very-high-resolution to thrill not only those familiar with the game but newcomers as well. The goal is to recreate what it feels like to wander the different island worlds in an epic journey, using a visual language to convey complicated, abstract concepts.\nPhilip will also expand his focus to include  computer history museums, where he will locate old hardware and marketing materials, but most importantly the people who were there during the MYST journey -- the collectors, devoted archivists and historians who can recount each stage of the Miller Brothers\u2019 story. Much like the original Route 66 of the American Southwest, the traces of MYST\u2019s path are all there -- they just need to be connected in a visually exciting way.\nThe actual filming process for the documentary will follow two distinct timelines:\n The Origin Story: A reliving and retelling of the history of making MYST and RIVEN through interviews and archival videos, presented through stylized visualization in an abstract and atmospheric way. The film will visit locations of the Miller family\u2019s origins, such as Philadelphia, Hawaii and Haiti, as well as Los Alamos and Albuquerque, N.M., where Rand met his mentor, who first gave him access to a computer lab.\n   The Present Eras: Filming at Cyan in Spokane and other locations where new games are being created, as well as Silicon Valley, to meet those involved in the development of Apple\u2019s Mac home computer, and other places where new technology is being tested.\n  After filming, the editing process will begin to weave this incredibly diverse, complex and massive amount of material into a riveting narrative. On top of that, an original score and sound design will tie the elements together into an adventurous journey bringing the brothers from that double-wide trailer on the outskirts of Spokane to the dizzying, high-tech world of Silicon Valley, another island full of wonder and mysteries.\nFrom the launch of this Kickstarter, Philip expects the final print to be ready by the end of  2022.\nHere\u2019s where YOUR participation is especially important. We\u2019re excited to offer many cool rewards for fans of MYST, grouped into several \u201ctiers\u201d and named after our favorite iconic spots in MYST. We really appreciate your help in making this happen, no matter what tier levels you can contribute to. This is a movie by a community for a community.

MYST, he said, is to video games what Star Wars was for movies. \u201cI had never seen anything like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just completely swept me away into a whole new universe.\u201d He wanted to explore those MYST worlds, or \u201cAges,\u201d but also wanted to find out how they were made.\nPhilip has had the great fortune to work on many documentaries over the past 30 years, and had always been \u201cfascinated by creators.\u201d Twenty years later, he got a chance to talk to Rand and Robyn Miller, the creators of MYST, in 2016. \u201cThese are sweet, genuine, down-to-earth guys,\u201d he said.\nWhen he asked them whether anyone made a documentary about their story, they said no, and were \u201calmost confused by the whole idea.\u201d Immediately, they told Philip yes, they\u2019d be happy to take part, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in this, but we\u2019ve just finished a game, we\u2019re about to release it and we are beginning our next project that\u2019s totally top secret. Are you interested in following that?\u201d Awestruck by their generous query, Philip responded, \u201cAre you kidding??\u201d \nIn making documentaries, Philip\u2019s goals are always to help people appreciate a group of people who did something extraordinary that most people don\u2019t know much about. The Millers\u2019 lives were completely transformed by this work of art called MYST that they poured their heart into. Most people don\u2019t even know who they are, and now Philip wants to bring you in to meet them. But there were other people -- those who made the MacIntosh and the HyperCards that were all essential to the creation of MYST. He wants to introduce you to these people to see how they all fit together to build the MYST universe.\nAs a result, Philip wants to tell the story of these two brothers, living at the time in a double-wide trailer in the woods of Spokane, who, with the help of their friends and colleagues, made the most popular video game in the world.\n\u201cThese were two guys as far from the world of technology as you could get, with very limited means and experience,\u201d Philip said. \u201cAnd one day ended up on the stage with Steve Jobs.\u201d\nPlease join us to help make sure Philip has the resources to complete this ambitious project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDocumentary filmmaking is a challenging and time-consuming process.

Signs of an ancient advanced race and the residual technology they left behind is your only sign of hope... grab it with both hands!\nRESIDUAL is a survival platformer offering a combination of crafting and exploration. There are no weapons, it's just you, the planet, and an adventure for survival that's different every time you hit the \"New Game\" option. \nClick for Residual on Steam\nRESIDUAL is made by Orangepixel - previously known for creating: Gunslugs series, Heroes of Loot series, Space Grunts series, Stardash and the Meganoid series released on PC, mobile and various consoles. \nOrangepixel has a long track record of released games\nRESIDUAL throws you onto a procedurally generated planet with no humanoid lifeforms. Your task? Survive! \u2013 Explore the planet both above and below ground, scavenge, mine, craft, fish, pluck, chop, climb, jump, push, pull, and solve puzzles along the way. \nHelloooooooo!\nDiscover remnants of an ancient civilization and their advanced technology. It's not known why this civilization failed, but their technology is sure to come in handy when fixing your ship once you figure out how to use it.\nSupported platforms\nFeatures\n- Everything in the world is procedurally generated, from the layout of the environments to the flora, fauna, temperatures, water, types of fruit, and range of creatures you'll encounter. Each playthrough will offer a completely unique experience and there's a virtually endless supply of new planets to explore.\n- There are no guns in the game, but that doesn't mean the world isn't filled with danger. You'll just have to discover creative solutions to avoid being killed by creatures who view you as tasty snack, flesh-eating plants, and whatever else the world you're exploring throws up.\n- Each planet is full of useful resources, and you can use mining and crafting to take advantage of them. Collect resources, combine items, craft tools, and fix your ship!\nTechnology\nThe game has been developed using Orangepixel's new Nature engine, which allows for whole planets to be procedurally generated based on a set of nature rules.\nThe life present on each planet is dictated by the environment. The amount of sunlight each day, how hot or cold it is, and the types of terrain will all play a role in the vegetation and life that appears for the player to interact with. \nExpect to visit worlds that are ice cold, lush green, and stripped almost bare by heat. Each one presents its own unique challenges, but the tools are there to survive and escape, and you get to have a lot of fun finding and using them.\nYour visor will support you finding resources and identify things\nCurrent status\nRESIDUAL has been in development for a little over 3 months, which is the bare minimum to get a demo version up and running with some of the core features and technology implemented. Most of the work now is geared towards adding content and variations on gameplay mechanics, alongside fleshing out the world for the player to explore.\nVariety of life-forms will be bouncing around the planet\nFollow Development\nYou can follow development of the game on Twitter, YouTube, and Discord:\nTwitter @orangepascal - where I frequently post updates including videos and GIFs.\nYoutube Orangepixel - Every Thursday there is a new \"Behind the Scenes\" video, where I frequently do a Devlog on Residual to talk about, and show, new features and the general progression of development.\nDiscord - A place to talk about all things Orangepixel, including Residual!\n\nThanks for reading!

Where does one begin and the other end?\n Legacy: Discuss the importance of \u201880s Sci-Fi genre in a modern-day context.

Casting will continue throughout 2020 with filming planned to begin in the Autumn. Kickstarter backers will receive their items first and we are planning for a July 2021 release.\nOur physical rewards are manufactured and shipped from the United States. Backers will receive a tracking number and our items are sent in very study packaging (posters rolled, not folded) to ensure everything arrives with you safely.\nBecause shipping costs vary substantially depending on whether you are in the US or Rest of World, we have decided not to include shipping costs in the pledge tiers. Instead, shipping costs are as follows:\nUSA - \u00a37 (approx. $8.80)\nUK - \u00a312 (approx. $15)\nRest of World - \u00a312 (approx $15)\nWe are an independent producer of community-powered entertainment: long-form factual content that is funded, inspired, and shaped by a dedicated community of fans. Our projects include the critically acclaimed documentaries In Search of the Last Action Heroes and In Search of Darkness and the upcoming In Search of Tomorrow.\n Robin Block - Executive Producer & Founder of CreatorVC\n David Weiner - Director/Writer/Producer\n Jessica Dwyer - Producer\n Andrew Hawkins - Producer\n Samuel Way - Film Editor\n Nick Bosworth - Trailer/Montage Editor\n Clayton Benge - Art Director\n Paul Konschake - Motion Graphics\n James Evans - Copywriting\n Andrew Dalton - Community Manager\n Karla Hampton - Community Manager\nWe\u2019ve partnered with our friends at New Retro Wave again to curate our official soundtrack.

Our past experience funding, producing, and distributing documentaries, plus the year\u2019s work we\u2019ve already put in, means we are very confident of meeting our backer\u2019s expectations - however, unforeseen delays are possible.\n\nWhile many countries are in lockdown, due to COVID-19, we cannot start filming interviews with our growing cast. Our July release date does take this into account, but if the lockdown were to continue throughout the year we might experience a small delay to the shipping date. As always, we will keep backers fully updated regarding the situation and they will know well in advance if there is likely to be a delay.\n\nIf you were a backer of our previous project, you will know that we experienced delays with manufacturing and shipping for that product. This was due to mistakes we made when choosing a distribution partner, which led to us making a switch. We now have a very reliable US-based partner and do not anticipate further problems in this area.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nWe have accurately portrayed our project as it stands at this point in time, however, creative projects are subject to change and ours is no exception.

The levels take the shape of a gigantic circle. The station map is procedurally generated on each play through, with floors that are actually curved. Because of its circular shape, if you run far enough in one direction, you will end up back where you started.  \nPLAY\n\nTo me, science fiction is so much more interesting when grounded in real science because it opens up new situations.  \nYou see this in CreatorCrate, where the center of the station doesn't spin, leaving you in free fall.  Instead of running, you jump from wall to wall and use fans and other items to propel yourself through the level.    \nYou see the opposite on the outside of the rotational ring, where the centrifugal effect is so strong that you cannot safely navigate while the station is under spin.\nThough I know of a few games with these kinds of space stations in them, I've never played a game that lets you explore an entire rotating space station from the inside and experience its circular layout and changing levels of gravity for yourself.  That's why I decided to make one.  \nBecause the setting of the game has varying gravity, we leaned into the physical nature of all the interactions\nAll objects in the game are physics objects. You can pick them up  and throw them, so that they tumble along the ground and smash into enemies. You can release a knife in mid-air.  It will fly across the  room and slash the wires that power security systems. You can hold a table in front of you to block incoming bullets.\nYou'll need a new control scheme to do all this, which is why you have the Grabber Arm!\nWe've given you an arm that lets you pick up items and wave them above your head in the physical game-space.  The arm follows your mouse,  and lets you do things not possible in most platformers. \nPLAY\n\nYou'll find toys that interact in interesting physical ways. Fans that let you  hover in place, bunsen burners to start fires, or acid to melt through  walls.\nYou're an escaped 3D printer with legs. Why did they give you legs? I don't know, we'll have to ask corporate.\nBeing an appliance comes with some benefits. Consume any object to  learn its blueprint, and break down its matter to recharge your matter bar. For instance: what if you need lots of guns, but all you have lying  around is a few humans? EASY! Just use that useless biological matter to print out some handy-dandy firearms.  \nPLAY\n\nA word of warning: be careful when printing out some of the more complex biological blueprints. CreatorCrate gets them... mostly right.\nYou play as the CreatorCrate, a prototype appliance that can break down objects and use their matter to build new objects.  The CreatorCrate has escaped, and is running free on the space station where it was made.  The scientists who made it will do anything to capture the CreatorCrate, or destroy it if necessary.   \nAt its heart, CreatorCrate is like a monster movie from the monster's point of view.  You get to decide what kind of monster you are.  You can sneak through levels and use tools to creatively overcome challenges. You can throw vending machines to knock people down, hide in clouds of smoke, and swing above danger with a knife. Or you can shoot, stab, light on fire, or eat anyone in your way.   \n Read on to find out more about the CreatorCrate's friends, The Items:\nMaking a roguelike is different from non procedural games. If a player beats a level in CreatorCrate on their first try, they've only seen one instance of the much larger possibilities for what that level can be.  A good roguelike has a depth of content and level configuration that allows even experienced players to keep being surprised.  Roguelikes offer the feeling of exploring a unique world where anything can happen, and players can experience something that no one else has seen.\nIn addition to that, CreatorCrate has a depth of interaction between the different elements that gives players a lot of options in how they solve problems.  In CreatorCrate, you can block bullets with human shields, shoot guns out of the hands of enemies, cut wires to disable systems like security alarms, break windows to suck enemies into the vacuum of space, and much more.  If it makes sense for the game's elements to interact in a certain way, they should work that way.\nCreating this depth of content and interaction takes time, and the most important thing that the Kickstarter funds will do is allow me to spend the time that I need to insure that the game reaches its full potential.  \nEarth?\nCreatorCrate takes place in an alternate universe, in orbit around their version of Earth. Their history is similar to our history in some ways and very different in others.  \nHumanity has gained a tentative foot hold off world, though interstellar travel is still beyond its reach.  \nThe Space Station\nThe Space Station where CreatorCrate takes place was completed 18 years ago.  A collaboration between many nations and interests, it is humanity's largest off world presence.  Minoatech is the biggest shareholder in the station, with most other significant shares held by the Admiralty, other Aegean corporations, and an alliance of Chinese Syndicalist Communities.\nAegean Republic\nAfter the Great War of 50 years ago, several groups of mercenaries, generals, and aristocrats in hiding returned to a region on the brink of collapse.  To mediate conflicts between these groups, they formed the Aegean Republic.  Minoatech, the company that made the CreatorCrate, was founded by one of these mercenary groups.\nThe Aegean Republic is the strongest world power.  Massive corporations hide behind a thin pretense of democracy.  Assassinations and small armed conflicts between the corporations are common, though just as often, these conflicts take the form of covert sabotage and hostile legal action.  The culture of the Aegean Republic is matriarchal, and its presence in space is mostly female.\nThe writing system of the Aegean language is Line Arc, which resembles a cursive version of Linear B from our world. \nWith the initial funding goal, CreatorCrate will focus on it's core mechanics, physical action, and addictive, emergent gameplay.  Some characters shown here will play an important role in the initial story and be the focus of boss fights.\nHowever, some of these characters will only appear, or will be much more important, in the stretch goals. \nOur plan is to complete the game with all the features of our initial goal within 2 years. However, the bottom line will always be quality.  We are dedicated to releasing a game that we are proud of, even if it means releasing later.  \nSome stretch goals, especially those expanding the scope of the story, may move the full release date later. \nWe are also planning on an Early Access stage of development, once we feel the game is at the appropriate level of completion.  We want to have every area feeling fun and unique before Early Access, but we plan to continue to increase the depth of content during Early Access as well as adding new systems and game elements, especially those involved in Stretch Goals.\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development.

While there is a lot of content that I plan to add, the biggest and most difficult systems in the game are already there, including a circular world, procedurally generated levels, and intelligent humans that find their way through the levels, interact with items like guns, and fly through the air with ragdoll physics.\n\nSomething that my campaign offers is that I regularly stream CreatorCrate's development on Twitch, so there is a level of transparency where you can watch me live and be assured that I am hard at work on making the best game possible.\n\nIn the first few days of the Kickstarter campaign, I'm going to be doing extra streams for most of the day, in case you have any additional concerns about the risks and challenges in this project or would just like to get a better look at the game. \n\nAs the campaign progresses, I will continue on my regular streaming schedule at \n\n www.twitch.tv/CreatorCrate \n\nI hope I'll see you there.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jori - CreatorCrate Games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nJori is the designer of CreatorCrate.

Thanks for the amazing show of support! \nFirmament is the next step in the evolution of Cyan, deeply rooted in the spirit of Myst, Riven, and Obduction. Welcome to an all-new, enigmatic narrative adventure. \nA gasp for air... a release of chilled breath... the crackling sounds of melting ice.\nYou wake in a glacial cavern \u2014 perfused by blue. It's crowded with metal pipes and adorned with curious, clockwork gears.\nEchoing machinery resonates in your ears as a massive metal door opens before you...\nAs you enter a dark chamber, warm lights flicker to life, revealing a frigid, yet intimate stone interior, supported by riveted iron beams. In the middle of this room is an ancient table - a tea cup on one end and a frozen body slumped over the other. The corpse\u2019s hands hold an exquisite clockwork device \u2014 held out like an offering.\nYou reach for the device, and suddenly\u2026 a small whir\u2026 a blue glow is birthed from its core as it comes to life and lifts from the outstretched palms of the rigid stranger. It hovers above you, watching.\nAn apparition appears with a message from the woman that left this gift. She planned to mentor you... \n...but something has gone terribly wrong.\nAn immense, unexpected adventure now lies ahead\u2026 \nAlong your journey, you'll discover the deeper secrets.\nWe've already revealed too much.\nCyan revolutionized the adventure game genre with Myst and Riven. We pushed the boundaries of world creation with Obduction. We think that VR is an amazing technology for pushing storytelling forward for a new generation. But the VR market is still young, and we want to explore its creative opportunities now. \nThat\u2019s why we need your support. \nFirmament is a deeply immersive narrative adventure game for both VR and PC that stays true to the storytelling, artistic integrity, and inventive puzzles that Cyan holds dear. \nThis is an entirely new property - the beginning of an exciting new Cyan universe, delivered using Unreal 4, one of the most powerful game development technologies available.\nFirmament is designed for and will be built from the ground up to take advantage of the VR sense of presence and a seamless interface. Stunning and enigmatic locations (with a certain callback to the steampunk roots of Myst) were conceived to allow for highly immersive and eclectic visuals for which the world-building artisans at Cyan are known.\nBut unlike previous games you don\u2019t travel this world alone. You'll have a clockwork adjunct...\nThroughout this fantastic journey you are accompanied by an ever-present adjunct: a helpful clockwork companion, which provides assistance along the journey. \nThe adjunct doesn\u2019t speak, but it does understand you and your hand gestures. Through your interactions both you and your adjunct evolve a vocabulary of gestures you learn together. What starts as rudimentary communication evolves into a complex symphony of actions as you solve challenges together and begin to understand the epic nature of what lies ahead.\nFirmament will be designed for VR, but built to play on PC as well. All backers will be able to play the game on both platforms, and effortlessly switch between VR and PC to continue your progress in the game.\nCampaign Exclusive Content\nAs a special part of this campaign, Firmament will be available with exclusive downloadable (DLC) content and customizations. This DLC (that will only be available to backers of this campaign) includes three unique skins for your mechanical adjunct (including a special Myst skin) and other uniquely skinned items and elements AND a special personalization option that allow certain narrative elements of the experience to be customized. (Example: Imagine a book on a shelf that has a title that you choose, or a metal plate on a piece of equipment with a date that you decide).\nCyan's games would be incomplete without an incredible score. For Firmament we'll be collaborating with several composers who will contribute to the Original Soundtrack. \nFor this campaign, we are excited to collaborate with Fangamer on all the merchandise.\nFangamer creates outstanding products \u2013 shirts, plushies, books, prints, pins,etc. \u2013 inspired by some of the best video games of all time. They will be helping design many of the physical rewards outlined below as well as handling all the shipping and distribution. \nFor more information about Fangamer shipping, please go here. If you have ANY concerns regarding International taxes, fees, logistics, or other additional charges required by your local government or delivery service please read all the linked Fangamer information or check our FAQ.\nKeep watching for updates during and after the Kickstarter campaign as we share design progress.   \nStretch goals\nBecause of your generous support this Kickstarter campaign was successful enough to fund the creation of Firmament for PC, Mac, PS4, and PSVR platforms. But we\u2019ve found a way to continue the funding effort with an option to join the Firmament Development Campaign through Fangamer. With that in mind, we will continue with our next Stretch Goal, with more to follow that allow us to improve Firmament using whatever additional development funds we receive. Help us spread the word so everyone gets an even better Firmament experience!\nCommunity Social Media Goals - COMPLETED!\nCheck out this Update for more details.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1252280491/firmament/posts/2478667 \nWhy Kickstarter? \nFor more than 30 years, Cyan has done it all: we started self-publishing from our garage and hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We\u2019ve worked with publishers in various deals. But for quite a few years now, we have been back to our independent roots, and we like the freedom that brings. \nWe loved the feedback and support our player community gave us during the Obduction and Myst 25 Anniversary (1100% funded!) Kickstarter campaigns. Kickstarter provides a way for us to reach all of our fans and share the game\u2019s progress, as well as offer the community some amazing tier rewards and great swag. \nHow will the funding be used?\nAfter Kickstarter\u2019s fee, the cost of physical rewards and shipping, the remaining funds will be spent solely on Firmament. Though our goal of $1.3 million seems high, it is a relatively modest budget for the kind of experience that Cyan creates. But Cyan has plenty of experience, and a small, but talented team. We've learned over the years that a smaller, experienced team, working closely together can be very efficient and satisfying. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. \nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters. Connect with us on discord. There you'll be able to interact directly with the creators, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie! \nA Word to Mac Users\nCyan has always been a big Mac supporter. Myst started out as a Mac title, and over the years, Cyan has always tried to release each of our games for the Mac. We'd love to continue that tradition with Firmament, as an indie studio, but with the minimum funding and resources we anticipate having available, and the complexity involved, this campaign will be focused on Windows (PC and VR). \nBUT... We have announced a Stretch Goal! \nThe stretch goal would allow us to build both a Mac version and PS4/PSVR version. We're really hoping that we can reach the extra level of funding that allows us to build the Mac version. And of course, the world of gaming is changing quickly, and we'll continue to keep an eye out for other solutions that allow as many fans as possible to play Firmament. \nAbout Cyan \nCyan started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. Their first creation, The Manhole, a simple, whimsical, black & white world, was well received by children of all ages. \nFour years later, Myst would require everything they had learned about making worlds to create a truly unique experience for a more sophisticated audience.\n\nMyst immersed the player into the world and the story - exploring and understanding - and the response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales of over 15 million units worldwide made the Myst seriesthe best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nThe Obduction Team\nStill under the leadership of Rand Miller, one of the founders, Cyan draws on our past as we dream into the future, taking advantage of technology to create new adventures that will become your worlds. \nTo see all of our previous games please visit https://store.steampowered.com/developer/cyan\nCyan is located about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet (near Spokane, Washington).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing interactive entertainment is a very complex business, and we take it seriously.

Surpassing Cyan\u2019s wildest expectations, it not only became the bestselling PC game of the 20th century, it also had a direct influence on popular culture. Over the years, Myst has brought together communities of passionate fans and has been referenced in television shows, movies, books, comics, and more. Myst has also inspired other creators as they built their own unique realms. Myst has even earned spots in the Smithsonian Institute, MoMA, and other notable museums.    \nAll 7 Myst Games Together for the First Time \nLooking back on this incredible, 25-year journey, Cyan believes a celebration is in order!

As an indie developer, resources are limited for development, and acquiring these rights isn\u2019t always an option.

We wanted to extract the essence of Myst\u2019s enigmatic aura and make it come alive \u2013 to touch, to hold, to remember...\nSo, we joined forces with Idea Planet, a unique group of talented folks who make realistic video game artifacts that wow. Chances are, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 or have \u2013 some of their really cool collector\u2019s editions. Check out their portfolio by clicking on the link in their logo above. We are thrilled to be working with them on our very own Myst 25th Anniversary Collection!\nNow on to the good stuff \u2013 the details you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nThe Linking Book\nThe core of the collector\u2019s edition will be a Myst Linking Book. The Bookmaker tier book will have a die-cut \u201cwindow\u201d through which you can see the art on the game DVD sleeves. At the Maintainer tier and above, the book will include an active 800 x 480 digital screen with video fly-throughs from the games.\nDimensions: 7in x 9in x 2.5in (18cm x 25 cm x 6 cm)\nWindow cutout: 5in x 2.75in  (12cm x 7cm) \nMaterials: 1200g grey board & art paper, with Matte Finish \nEmbossed & gold foil on Logo & edges of leather art treatments \nWeight:  2.71 pounds (1.23kg)\n1:1 exact scale replica\n800 x 480 IPS high resolution LCD screen (Maintainer tier)\nSpeaker (Maintainer tier)\nGehn\u2019s Inkwell and Pen \nThe Writer tier and above will feature an authentic replica of Gehn\u2019s Pen and Inkwell, meticulously recreated. And yes, it holds your ink, so it\u2019s a functioning set! (D'ni Writer's Ink or common ink not included.)\nThis tier also now includes digital versions of the three Myst novels (The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni) as well as high-resolution scans of some of the Riven design maps.\nGehn\u2019s Pen: \nDimensions: 7in (17.78cm) in length \nMaterials: Wood & Metal Accents \nGehn\u2019s Inkwell: \nDimensions 5.25in x 3.5in (13.35cm x 8.89cm)\nMaterials: Die Cast Zinc Alloy \nDeco: Antiqued Brass Plating \nWeight: 1.75lbs (.8kg)\n\nOriginal Design Sketches from Riven\nThis Collector tier is extremely limited and very special. We've opened the vault and collected 25 original hand-drawn concept sketches made during the production of Riven. These are not copies or reproductions. These are the actual pencil sketches with all of their variations, notes, smudges, and watermarks. Many of them have never been seen publicly before.\nMyst's 25th anniversary offers us a rare opportunity to provide these images to serious fans of the Myst series. Each unique hand-sketched drawing comes with a certificate of authenticity. \nSince these items are so unique, each backer at this level will get to choose which sketch they prefer. The order of the choice will be based on when the backer made their pledge - first pledge chooses first, second pledge chooses second, etc. And because we'd really like to spread the love around, we're limiting this tier to one per backer. You can see the available concept images here.\nA Word to Mac Users \nMyst started out as a Mac-first title, and over the years, Cyan has always released each of our games for the Mac. But for various reasons, maintaining some of those Mac titles now usually means rebuilding them from scratch - an option that, as a small indie studio, takes time or resources we just don\u2019t have. And for games that were produced by other studios, even that option wasn't possible.\nBut Mac users rejoice! After some research and testing, and the help of CodeWeavers, we've been able to come up with a solution that allows us to offer digital and disc versions of all of the games in this Anniversary Collection for macOS.\nWhy the $247,500 target amount?\nTo deliver a high-quality Myst collector\u2019s edition at a reasonable price, we need to have a minimum number of orders. Based on quotes for the design, tooling and manufacturing, we've calculated that we need at least 2,500 orders at the $99 tier or above (2,500 * $99 = $247,500) to achieve the bare minimum and move forward.\nReward Tier Summary\nCommunity Goals \nThank you for completing our community goals! \n\n.\nThat means everyone in the community \u2013 whether they\u2019ve backed this Kickstarter or not, whether they\u2019re a long-time veteran fan or new to the Mystiverse \u2013 can enjoy these items.\n\n5 High-resolution images from Myst - angles never before rendered \n5 Scans of the Riven Concept Art hanging in Cyan's Office \n5 VR nodes on the original Myst Island (viewable via Google Cardboard) \n5 Complete Digital Age design documents from Ages in Uru \n5 3D printable files for items in Myst\nA link to the downloads will be available soon. \n\nYOU DID IT!\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nUnfortunately, shipping costs have skyrocketed over the past several years. To help insure our shipping is as high quality and as low cost as possible, we have partnered with Blackbox who has globally positioned facilities to help minimize customs fees and VAT. Additionally, we have simplified the rate structure and even subsidized shipping rates in many cases. Please note the shipping cost when you select your pledge level.\nThanks, Adam!\nOkay Adam, we know you have some kind of reputation for ruining everything, but you sure helped us out. Seriously, having Adam as the voice of this Kickstarter pitch was such an amazing boost! If his energy, enthusiasm, and brilliance doesn't infect you, then you're probably not breathing. Thank you so much, Adam. Your linking book is on the way (after September.)\nAbout Cyan \nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller when they released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. After that was Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx \u2013 two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. In 1991, Cyan began work on a much larger world they called Myst. Myst and its sequel Riven have sold more than 15 million copies worldwide \u2013 which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. After five titles in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. (Myst Online is still available to explore for free.) In 2013, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund an entirely new game - Obduction. The campaign succeeded, and Obduction was successfully launched on PC, Mac, PS4, and VR.\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet. We continue to build on our past as we dream into the future.\nThank you! \nOur fans are the best! You'll never know how much we appreciate your continued support over the years.

A small part of the crew will fly to Tokyo and shoot some outdoor scenes in the most cyberpunk city in the world!\nBesides Tallinn and its awesome locations, everybody knows that some streets of Tokyo are pure science fiction!\n\u20ac22.500 PRO STOP MOTION We will animate the Cyber Octopuses with the support of a professional and renowned stop motion studio.\nWe can do it ourselves in a pretty good way, but having a 60+ years experienced studio will improve the overall result.\n\u20ac24000 PROP REPLICAS! We'll buy some famous prop replicas from the 80s films, like the Blade Runner Voight-Kampff machine. And spread them around the film as tributes/easter eggs.\nATTENTION! The currency of the stretch goals is in EURO (\u20ac) not dollars ($)\nThe aim of \u201cAttack of the Cyber Octopuses\u201d is to re-create the look and feel of an eighties sci-fi classic, without using CGI. Therefore it will be shot in real locations and use various miniature models and handmade props.\nThe film is inspired by William Gibson's cyberpunk landmark Neuromancer as well as some of the most awesome sci-fi products of the 80s era, like Blade Runner, Terminator, Escape from New York, Aliens, Akira and many more.\nIn the last few years there have been some other 80s style projects, but what sets \u201cAttack of the Cyber Octopuses\u201d apart, is that we are not aiming to make a cheesy movie. Instead it will be made very seriously. However, it will likely have some involuntary funny moments.\n\nWatch the teaser:\n  The story takes place in Neo-Berlin, 2079. A dark, rain-soaked city held by mega corporations where the only enjoyment in life is connecting to cyberspace and taking \u201cBinary Trip\u201d a cyber drug that fries your neurons but promises a feeling better than a hundred orgasms at once. In this setting, a team of crack cyberspace detectives are investigating a new menace: an army of cyber octopuses that are terrorizing the city.\n  Here some pictures made by Guido Salto. This is how the film is going to look like!\nPete at the phone is looking Neo Berlin\n Maverick returns home while John and Tina are into cyberspace\nDimitri the hacker is attacked by a Cyber Octopus  \n The Master of Octopuses control room\n Maverick is chasing the Master of Octopuses\n  The original soundtrack is composed by Andrea Ragusa, a member of the band Mothell, and it\u2019s almost entirely made with analog synthetizers. At the moment two tracks are ready, the synth-wave one you hear in the teaser, and \u201cJoin the Cyber Octopus\u201d, a truly post-punk track, recalling Billy Idol. All together there will be 8 tracks, available for the backers on a vintage audiocassette (as well as in high quality mp3 files)!\n Here a couple of music videos for two of the original tracks!\n       There are many amazing perks, such as a digital copy of the movie in 4K with 5.1 surround audio, a large poster, t-shirts, a vintage audio cassette with the soundtrack of the movie and even the models and props used in the movie will be given out! Generous backers might have the weapons, vehicles, part of the city miniature and even the cyber octopuses! Check out the photos or the perks on the right side for more details.\n PLEASE NOTE: These are hand crafted props and models. They are not toys. Everything is self-made and some parts might be a little bit rough.\n  The person behind this project is Nicola Piovesan, an award winning filmmaker and producer, Italian based in Estonia, with more than 60 awards in hundreds of festivals worldwide. Check his showreel or vimeo channel for further details.\nA large part of the crew come from the Baltic Film and Media school, an international university of cinema, based in Tallinn. Some are still students and others are alumni. All have plenty of experience creating movies.\nBesides Italians and Estonians, there are members from Canada, the States, Portugal, Belarus, China and even Nigeria!\nIn the video below you'll meet some of the team members that are working hard to make this a reality.\n    These are just few photos of the work done to recreate the world of \u201cAttack of the Cyber Octopuses\u201d. If you want more info about the \u201cmaking of\u201d please visit the blog.\n  \"Attack of the Cyber Octopuses\" is set in Neo-Berlin, 2079 A.D.. However, we chose to film in Tallinn, Estonia. There are a couple of reasons for this choice. First of all a large percentage of the crew is based here. Second, Estonia is an affordable filming location. Third, and most important, Tallinn has some great locations and a wonderful mix of a very modern city with many relics from the Soviet Era. This will all be combined with our custom-made miniature city.\nBonus point: we will shoot in some locations where also the Tarkovskij's masterpiece Stalker was shot!!! \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike every B-movie with a low budget, the biggest challenge will be to do everything in time, while creating a high quality product!\n\nWe have more than 15 years of experience and many awards worldwide from class A festivals.

Get behind the wheel of a technologically advanced space-age sports car and tear it up as you battle to become A-number-1!

Thanks for everyone who voted!\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Power Drive 2000 is easy to learn, difficult to master. The two main game mechanics are drifting and boosting. The player has to drift around those tight corners to charge the \"Turbo\" meter and boost to gain some wicked speed! Master these two things and you will rise above the competition!\nGame Modes\nPower Drive 2000 offers more than the traditional arcade racer. Six unique game modes create an exciting new experience. Most modes support online and local split screen multiplayer.\nRace Mode\nStandard race against the clock or challenge a player's ghost from the leaderboards.\n\nCollector Mode\nThe player's score is based on time and how many diamonds are collected during the race.\n\nOutrun Mode\nWeave in and out of traffic as you try to outrun a police chopper through the streets of an 80's cyberpunk and neon city.\n\nVaporizer Mode\nThe walls of the track are lined with a laser fence. You touch them and it's game over. No checkpoints. Not for beginners.\n\nGauntlet Mode\nDodge obstacles in a procedurally generated environment as you try to escape a giant laser wall barreling towards you. Different from most 'runners' as you will have to make 90 degree turns and travel parallel to the deadly laser wall you are trying to outrun.\n\nTurbo Mode\nThe player will start the race with unlimited 'Turbo' for boosting.\nMultiplayer\nOnline and local multiplayer support. The player can also challenge ghost plays from the leaderboard.\n\n MEET C.A.T. (Computerized Autonomous Technology)\nThe Avenger 2000, built by Hyperdyne Motors, is specially designed with an integrated artificial intelligence known as C.A.T. (Computerized Autonomous Technology).\nCAT not only makes sure all the mechanics and electronic systems in the vehicle are performing optimally, she will also provide the driver with suggestions and encouragement about their driving. However, she is known to be rather sassy sometimes...\nThe soundtrack is an awesome mix of unparallelled Synthwave artists.

If something were to happen to me or I meet an early demise, the game would cease production. I'll do my best to make sure I'm extra cautious during the game's development--and always look both ways before I cross the road.\n\nVideo game development is also no easy task; it's grueling work and people burnout or quit. That should be a concern for backers, but it's also why I choose to work alone on this (as much as I can). I don't have to worry about the lead coder or artist quitting on me, or the person handling the budget taking the money and skipping town.\n\nSince I started creating the game, there hasn't been a day that's gone by where I haven't woken up and been excited about the game--not what the game COULD be, but the actual WORK itself. It's my passion and I hope it shows!\n\nThe biggest risk is to the game itself. If the Kickstarter goal is not met, it's not possible to finish the game in any capacity, much less what I have envisioned. There's a lot of work to be done on it, which would require my full time and attention.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact James Greb at megacomgames@gmail.com.\n\nThanks for all the support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Update", "update_content": "BRB.

Its power could not be stopped. All hope seemed lost, until four mysterious stone companions cast a spell that contained the curse. Now, years later, someone has plucked a seed from its twisted branches and unleashed the curse once again. Only the keeper\u2019s apprentice and one of the stone companions can hope to recast the spell, and save the land of Knottington.\nDeadwood: The Forgotten Curse is an epic tale about two very different characters learning about the true meaning of friendship. This engaging story is partnered with our unique gameplay blend of survival and adventuring.\nMeet the Characters.\nLathe - An avid inventor with a tendency to daydream most of his hours away, works as an apprentice to Radley, the old Keeper of Deadwood Pass. The Keepers job is to watch over the almighty tree of Deadwood Forest, and to make sure no-one ever plucks its wicked seeds. Having worked with Radley for the past few years, Lathe has grown fond of the old Woodling.... and learning about a possible Deadwood apocalypse is much more fun than going to school or doing house chores. Lathe enjoys the fact that Radley is incredibly passionate about his job as the Keeper, and takes the job of Apprentice Keeper very seriously, even though the town's people feel it's just a silly job to keep an old woodling occupied.\n\nRoguard - This deadwood infestation cannot be stopped by Lathe alone. What would a true hero be, without his rock solid companion? Roguard is made of stone and has a big heart that's captured by life\u2019s simple beauty. Roguard unfortunately has no recollection of where he has come from with the exception that he knows he's lived in the mountains for many, many years. He is troubled by one thought however. He feels the need to find these... sparkles, but has no idea what these sparkles actually are. When he runs into Lathe he realizes that there is a bigger problem afoot and swears to help in any way he can to prevent further danger to woodlings.\n Day/Night Cycle. Our world changes and the player must be able to adapt quickly in order to survive the night. Use your crafting skills to build tactical defenses and weapons to protect your sleepy friend, Roguard, against the Deadwood.\nA Visually Rich World. Deadwood: The Forgotten Curse has a beautifully painted art style and fun cartoony animation. Explore a \"quirky and cute\" world filled with dangerous forests, vast plains, and tons of fun and unique characters.\nChallenging Quests. Our map is filled with tons of world related quests. We wanted Deadwood to give the player the option to learn more about the world's history and characters with extended side quests.\nOur crafting system allows the player to build various types of weapons and defenses. Use the materials and amber modifiers you've gathered while scavenging on your journey. As long as you've acquired the design and the proper materials, you can craft away.\nThere are four core defense types: landmines, barricades, turrets, and decoys. All will require different materials and amber to craft, and each one has it's own strengths and weaknesses.\nScavenge, Secure, Survive\n\u2022   Scavenge: Search buildings/bodies for materials. Breakdown certain items for resources. Explore areas for items such as ammo and health.\n\u2022   Secure: Build barricades, traps, mines, and decoys to help hold down the fort and plan for the night\u2019s attack. Also fortify/repair existing structures during attacks as deadwoods wear them down.\n\u2022   Survive: Omni-directional top-down shooting mechanics. The deadwood take effort and strategy to kill, so be careful, they never stop coming.\nDuring your exploration of Knottington you'll gather many types of amber, which is used to modify weapons and defenses. Each modifier has a unique source of energy.\nSweet sounds. Andy Lackey has worked on some of the best games and films of the last decade. Including Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2, The Witness and Ori and the Blind Forest. He'll make our wooden zombies sound awesome.\nCatchy Music. Final Fantasy meets Dexter. Once you hear it, you'll have it in your head all day. Listen to some of the music scored by the amazing Luke Thomas.\nThreatening Enemies. Our main enemy type is a fella named Sprout. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but don't be fooled by this cute and adorable creature. They'll do absolutely anything to snack on some sap! We also have a baddie named Splinter. He is scarier and more powerful than Sprout. These are just 2 examples of the many different enemy types in the world of Knottington. \nOpen World to Explore. We have crafted a vast world filled with a variety of interesting locations to explore. With our custom hex tile system we can create massive worlds at an accelerated rate so we may spend more time with the art direction.\nInspirations. What if we created wooden zombies in a \"quirky and cute\" open world? Well, that's what Deadwood: The Forgotten Curse is! We wanted to create a charming world that was beautiful to look at with a dark added twist. Don't Starve and Tim Burton films were some of our inspirations for the darker elements. We we're also inspired by Zelda and Secret of Mana for the lighter side of things. Combining these inspirations we've created a fun and unique look that runs through the animation, story, interface, and every other facet of the game.\nWhy Kickstarter? Deadwood: The Forgotten Curse is a passion project for us. We have been working on it part time for a while, but have recently invested all of our savings and time into doing this fulltime. We currently have a core team of 6 and an extra 5 or so helping offsite. \nWe are now moving full steam ahead to bring you the best game possible. We believe in Deadwood and we believe that our team has what it takes to deliver it. We are looking to our fellow game lovers, developers and fans alike to help us push Deadwood into a more expansive direction with more quests, more explorable areas and a more intricate story line for our two grand adventurers to conquer.  \nThe great thing about Kickstarter is that it allows us to share our process with you. We want to give you an inside look into how we develop, market and explore new territory in creating our open world. We would love for you to be a part of this process through our live stream meetings, consistent dev updates, and blogs.\nWho is Steamroller? The Steamroller team is a league of creators gathered together to bring the Deadwood dream alive. We knew we built a strong and dedicated team when everyone was willing to juggle multiple jobs while working on Deadwood in their spare time. As the story progressively grew stronger and a solid foundation was built, the team realized that Deadwood has the potential to be something AWESOME. Reality set in that time was not on our side with everyone only working part time on the game. If we wanted to see Deadwood reach its full potential, something had to change. The decision was agreed upon for us all to leave the comfort of our day jobs and dedicate our creative efforts to the game. \nSteamroller Studios is located in the small, quiet town of Eustis, FL (a hidden treasure just outside of the Orlando area). Why in the world Eustis you ask? Great question! Well, in the pong years, Keith and Adam were born in this small town. Moving around and working in new and faraway places in the later years, they reunited home bringing alongside them a new friend and future game play designer, Jalil. Thus Steamroller Studios was born.\nThe Team. These awesome artists have contributed to the development of Deadwood in various ways.\nAdam Meyer- is our Game Director and captain of the good ship Deadwood. He's responsible for the look and feel of the game. Adam has worked for clients such as EA, Disney, Universal Studios, and Irrational Games. He has also lent his hand to a few other indie games, including Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville for Northway games. Deadwood is his baby and he promises not to drop it.\nKeith Lackey- is the brain, the wizard, and programmer extraordinaire of this operation. One of the co-founders of Steamroller Studios, Keith's love for making games sprung from his robust problem solving abilities. In his past adventures he has spent 8 years at Weta Digital where he worked on an assortment of films including The Hobbit, Avatar, Rise and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and The Avengers. Moving all the way from New Zealand, he has now pledged his genius to Steamroller Studios and is prepared to make Deadwood: The Forgotten Curse his next trophy.\nJalil Sadool - is our Creative Director and one of the co-founders of Steamroller Studios. He is also the co-founder of the online animation school CGTarian.com. Before Steamroller Studios and Dreamworks Animation, he was an Animation Lead at Weta Digital Ltd where he worked on such notable films as Avatar and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. At Dreamworks Animation he was the Animation Lead on the mighty Bewilderbeast for How to Train your Dragon 2 as well as part of the animation team who brought Jack Frost to life in Rise of the Guardians. His previous films also include The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, 9; Prince Caspian, The Water Horse, Night at the Museum and Charlotte's Web just to name a few. Jalil's passion for games and storytelling has become an integral aspect of Steamroller Studio's culture. His strong work ethic is the driving force behind the production of Deadwood: The Forgotten Curse.\nJames Mashock - is our one of a kind 3D Modeler. He is always in the groove with his work, forever active as he completes daily tasks. Often we see him running across the room to ask questions or answer our calls. We firmly believe he never stops moving... or doing mischievous things. Graduated from The Illinois Institute of Art- Schaumburge with a BA in Game Art and Design. He also was a huge help in the construction of the studio itself.\nAmanda Renfroe - is our coffee loving Production Manager. She started out at Magnetic Dream Animation Studios in Tennessee as an animator after graduating from Savannah College of Art and Design. She gets the fun job of cracking the whip on the others when Deadwood deadlines are coming up. Her other passionate skills also include animation, social media, and organization which prove to be very useful to the production of Deadwood.\nMatt Kessler - is our 'can-do' junior technical director. He graduated from the University of Central Florida with a B.A. for Digital Media with a focus in digital interactive systems. In his spare time he is lead administrator for the Reddit Blood Bowl League and creating his own card game.\nNaadia Manuoullah - is our lovely and talented concept artist whom shies away from no challenge. Although she lives in the very cold lands of Canada, she helps us bring the Deadwood world to life with her charming environment concepts. She graduated from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania in Fine Arts.\nJaryd Snover - is the rigging liaison of Steamroller. He got his start at Sony Imageworks and later Dreamworks Animation. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the latest film he worked on. He grew up in a family of chefs who taught him the meaning of hard work. If nothing else, Jaryd understands characters and how to bring them to life on screen... that and good southern cooking.\nMatt Sandoval - is our awesome intern whom goes above and beyond to get whatever nonsense sent his way done. He is currently attending Edinboro University of Pennsylvania for his B.F.A.\nThank you so much for taking the time to look at what we are creating. Keep checking in with us to see progress updates.

We are taking all the time necessary to make sure that Deadwood is polished to its highest standard, and has a compelling story alongside charming animations and an appealing world.\n\nWe are confident that with our experience and combined efforts that we can make Deadwood a success.

Thank you!\nThreshold is a puzzle platformer game where you play as a gnomish wizard, known only as Hood, who needs to find their way through a series of mysterious doorways. All is not as it seems, however, as depending on which direction Hood faces the world changes to present different challenges. \nThreshold was originally developed during the Global Game Jam of 2014. You can download the original GGJ version of the game at IndieDB. Some of the original team have gotten back together and, in cooperation with QuadraTron Games, are currently re-developing the game from the ground up. \nThe game is currently in development, and we estimate it will launch sometime in the last quarter of 2015 for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. We are strongly considering mobile platforms such as iOS and Android sometime after. We also, most definitely, have our sights set on consoles such as PS4, Xbox One, and WiiU.\nFeatures\nA hand painted watercolor world inspired by the works of Mary Blair and Gustav Klimt, Threshold breathes life into a natural looking world with natural mediums. While beautiful, Threshold is a world of mysterious and magical adventure.\nA dynamic ambient soundtrack that is influenced by the players actions. Its world switching mechanic not only affects the look of a level, but sounds too.\nMany hours of head-scratching platforming puzzles to solve. The world of Threshold bends and stretches with the seasons creating new challenges to players. With the game spanning multiple worlds each with two seasons, players have much to look forward to.\nGame Play\nPlatforming with a twist: It\u2019s one thing to play a game set in a magical land unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen before but we wanted to take that idea and turn in on it\u2019s head. That\u2019s why you get to play in two worlds at once! Based on the direction that you\u2019re facing you will shift back and forth between two distinct worlds with their own unique layouts.\nYou break the barrier between worlds with every move: Since you are the only thing that can bridge the gap between the two worlds you\u2019ll need to choose wisely, and sometimes quickly, what goes where and when! Pick up a key in the summer world but find out that you can\u2019t take it into the winter world. See a key frozen in midair in the winter world but if you don\u2019t get in to the right place at the right time when you enter that world that key will resume it\u2019s descent\u2026 you just need to be there to catch it!\nCrack each level your way: As we build up the challenge in each of the levels the player will have more and more tools at their disposal to solve each one. We want to give the player the freedom to combine the effects of items or objects in the world to see what happens! Think that by placing a key at the top of a ramp and freezing it in that world so that you can run down to the other side and catch it? Then go for it! Think that you know a way to make a jump that no one has ever made before by bouncing in just the right place? Show us! \nInspiration \nThreshold has evolved out of our love of games that have made incredible contributions to the way that we all look at games. Drawing inspiration from games like Braid and Fez that take interesting core gameplay and push them to their absolute limits. Not stopping there we saw how important it was to combine that gameplay with a visual aesthetic that would draw the player in to the world that we were creating for them to play in.\nGames like Spelunky, Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country are others that give us a ton of inspiration. Not only do they create worlds that give the player the freedom to go their own way and take risks but also reward the players for those risks. Hiding secrets just below the surface that give the player more and more reasons to keep coming back and visiting those worlds time and time again. Bringing all of this in to our game is extremely important to us. Making something that we think is the coolest and most fun version of the game, the game we want to play and explore!\nWe have been working on Threshold over the last year as a labor of love. Part time at first, then around fall of 2014, full time for three months. We wanted to advance the project to a state we felt best fit our vision. As a small indie game development team, we were entirely self funded during this process. There is still much that needs to be done to take the game to the level of quality, depth, and beauty we would like to see before we can say that it is finished. We would love to have your support in our journey forward!\nWe are confident that no matter what Threshold will be a playable experience that we fully stand behind. Going forward we may want to bring in some freelance artists, writers, or musicians to help us add even more cool content to the game.  \nCosts\nHere's a pie chart of our budget estimate for Threshold.

I mentioned to him that I had been recently consumed with the idea of a project that explored my love for heavy electronic music. Randy has always shared my passion for bands like Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, Portishead, etc. I knew he would be the perfect person to collaborate with.\nMy songwriting has always been a bit archaic in process. I managed to find a way to plug my guitar into my computer about a decade ago, and my methods haven\u2019t changed much since then. My knowledge of \"recording for real\" is limited to what I\u2019ve seen over the shoulders of extremely talented producers and engineers over the past 20 years. I can write it, I can (for the most part) play it, but I\u2019m at the mercy of those whose talents lie in the big picture to make it sound incredible during the process. Randy, for instance, is one of those people.I\u2019ve known Randy for a long time. Before (my current band) Demon Hunter, I played in a band called Training For Utopia. Living in Sacramento at the time, we made a habit of traveling to play in Southern California where the crowds were bigger, due to an already thriving scene. At several of these So Cal gigs, we\u2019d play with Randy\u2019s then band, Project 86. We saw each other infrequently, making small talk (if anything) for years. It wasn\u2019t until nearly 10 years later, when fate had thrown us both up north to Seattle, that we really got to know each other.\n\nOur first time actually working together was in 2007, when Demon Hunter was recording our 4th album, Storm The Gates Of Hell. Randy had recently been assisting our long-time producer Aaron Sprinkle -- editing drums and guitars, and helping record my vocals.\n\nOver the next few years, Randy and I started hanging out a lot. We bonded over our mutual adoration for heavy metal and electronic music, as well as authentic Mexican cuisine. We eventually ended up working together at Tooth & Nail Records -- Randy as A&R, and me as Art Director. On several occasions Randy helped out Demon Hunter by filling in on guitar.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems like we\u2019d been working towards NYVES for years. Both of us had been so enveloped in the world of heavy metal/hard rock for so long, I think we were both anxious to explore something different. We\u2019ll always be metal heads at heart, and I still very much enjoy writing and performing Demon Hunter songs, but in the same way I find fulfillment in my design/illustration work, my creativity is hard to keep in a box.\n\nIn September of 2013, Randy sent me the first instrumental track for this (still unnamed at the time) project. The song was a rejected remix for another band, but it was exactly the kind of thing I\u2019d heard in my head when we started to conceive this endeavor. It was the perfect catalyst for the style and aesthetic that would define the NYVES sound. I couldn\u2019t wait to write lyrics and melodies to it.\n\nDemon Hunter and Project 86 have never been strangers to electronic components. Both bands have explored these elements in the details of the songs. NYVES essentially puts a microscope to these elements, using them as a foundation, and adding familiar sounds like gritty, distorted guitars and real drums. The outcome could be described as a fitting extension of any of our other musical endeavors -- just with an emphasis on these electronic details.\n\nOver the course of the next few months, we managed to write and record a handful of songs that we were really proud of. When we realized that this was becoming something of legitimate substance, we quickly started putting together all of the pieces that you see now -- from the band name and logo, to the photo shoot and more. We couldn\u2019t wait to see every element of NYVES come to life.\n\nHere we are, a year later, ready and anxious to complete our first full-length... with your help.\n\nRandy\u2019s programming and production skills have reached levels that shock me.

Let us explain...\nOn April 24, 2014, a group of passionate believers gathered at the Livery in Lexington, Ky for an evening of worship. With roughly 250 people in attendance, the atmosphere was both intimate and exciting. This live recording is the culmination of a series of prayer and worship meetings dubbed \"Nightwatch,\" coupled with the songwriting gifts of Curt Vernon and Julie Futch.\nThere are ten songs on the album, all of which (save one) are original, flowing out of a desire to see God birthed, Spirit empowered, Jesus exalting and Word renewing revival sweep through Lexington, KY, leaving in its wake a lasting and undeniable change in the city and the church. Of course, you don't have to live in Lexington to appreciate the album. The songs are varied and beautiful in both lyric and arrangement. Some songs express the deep longing of a soul to encounter more of God's presence, while other songs are just a flat out celebration. (You can preview a couple of the pre-mixed/mastered songs by viewing the slideshow video above.)\nThe Livery was the perfect venue for a worship recording.

This includes a question about the $50 reward tier as well as international shipping costs.**\n When I was 7 years old (1987), my life WAS Nintendo. I wasn't just a passive consumer.  Games like the Legend of Zelda compelled my young creativity.\nIn the spring of 1987, a childhood friend and I painstakingly 'designed' a game called Mystic Searches. We designed everything from the manuals to the storyline to the concept art to map layouts and even music and sound effects (recorded with a crappy tape recorder and cheap casio keyboard).  We sent Nintendo of America a letter asking them to send us, and I quote, \"all the stuff to make our game\". We waited all summer for the delivery truck to roll up with our 'space age computers', certain we'd intrinsically know how to use them. We were crushed when all we got was a form letter. The designs for that 8-bit world were lost to time. We grew up.\nFound \"Concept art\" from 1987\nFast forward 25 years.  While visiting my parents, I accidentally stumbled upon a weather- worn cardboard box in their toolshed.  It was mostly destroyed, but inside were trace remnants of those 25 year old designs  And I realized something. Over the 25 years, I'd become a writer, a musician, a programmer...all, arguably, as a direct result of that time spent in those 8 bit worlds; maybe thanks to those unrealized design documents created at 7 years old.  My adult experience granted me a unique opportunity the child me had never had...I now had the ability to actually MAKE that game!\n\nSo, I assembled a team...a published fantasy novelist to help with the narrative development, an accomplished illustrator and cartoonist to design new concept art, a film score composer to create the music, and others. With the help of Kickstarter, we will actually build Mystic Searches as originally intended - a brand new 8-bit adventure game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nNot only that, but this particular NES cartridge will be a bit unique.  Yes, there will be an 8 bit game that will play on the actual hardware as expected, but it will also house a more modern game on flash memory accessible via a USB cable.  The two games will be able to talk to each other, so when you unlock secrets or achievements in the NES game, it will alter the world of the modern game that is playable on Mac or PC.  With this, we are hoping to provide gamers with a truly unique, multi-platform experience!\n\nOur intention is to release both the game and the documentary in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the NES console's release...which would be one year from the day of the end of our Kickstarter!\n\nEarly Concept Art Mockups\n\nAs a filmmaker, it occurred to me that this project would make for a great documentary.  Yes, a documentary about the ambitious homebrew community is long overdue, but beyond that, this quest to *save this virtual world from oblivion* will perfectly illustrate the hero's journey.  If our band of heroes prevails, this virtual world will be saved.  If we fail, it will be lost to time.  Each member of the proverbial party will have their own challenges to face in retrofitting their craft to something that will fit within the extremely limited capacity allowed by the NES hardware.  Over the course of the project, our creatives will be interacting with a series of professionals in the gaming world and homebrew community.  The growing list includes:\nDain Anderson, owner of Nintendo Age\nSivak, creator of Battlekid\nBrian Provinciano, creator of Retro City Rampage\nJoe \"Memblers\" Parsell, creator of Garage Cart\nMarc Ericksen, box and promo artist for actual NES games, including Strider, Tetris, and Megaman 2.\nTommy Tallarico, head of Video Games Live\nDavid D'Angelo, programmer for Yacht Club Games and their recent release, Shovel Knight.\nJohn Lester from Collectorvision\nRob McCallum, writer/director for the documentary Nintendo Quest\nPaul from InfiniteNesLives.com\n...and there will inevitably be more as we move forward with the project.\n\n\nI am incredibly humbled to be surrounded by such an amazing team for this project.  Below is a bit of information about each member.  Others are helping the project as well, and as this Kickstarter moves forward, I will be adding their stories to this list.\nJOE GRANATO is a creative chameleon.  He realizes his creative compulsions through the medium best suited to express them.  His day job vocation is Videographer for Ringling College of Art and Design, and outside of work he is an established filmmaker and documentarian.

During the global game jam Thomas met Joe Granato and many other great creators of interactive video awesomeness. Realizing it was to *dangerous to go alone* he dove head first into realm of game design and the treasures it held.\nMockup Examples of Some of the Rewards\nWhile this is certainly a passion project, even passion projects have their expenses.  Just like any film, real documentaries are expensive to create, starting with the legal fees and production insurance.  There are travel expenses, and this documentary will, at the very least, take us to various locations across the US.  Also, we have to account for being able to deliver you high quality rewards - that means very likely assembling cartridges by hand and testing each one, duplicating a run of blu-ray discs, pressing a run of soundtracks, and all of the other fun things we intend to make to reward our backers for their kindness.  Incidentals include all of those unplanned things; replacement bulbs and batteries, gallons of coffee for coding-all nighters, etc.  Anyone who has ever been on a production knows that they're always unpredictable...this is a small contingency budget for whatever form that unpredictability might take.\nWhat are people saying about the New 8-bit Heroes project?\nSome other great write ups around the web:\nOn Surfcaster: \nhttp://retrodef.blogspot.ca/2014/09/whats-old-is-new-again.html\nOn All Gamers (France): \nhttp://allgamers.fr/16087/mystic-searches-sur-nes-kickstarter-en-route/\nOn Nintendo Enthusiast:\nhttp://nintendoenthusiast.com/news/kickstarter-new-8-bit-heroes-nes-game-documentary-nes-game-dev-tutorial/\nOn GoNintendo: \nhttp://www.gonintendo.com/?mode=viewstory&id=237450\nOn Retro Dustbin: \nhttp://retrodustbin.com/2014/09/16/retro-chats-the-new-8-bit-heroes/\nOn Retro-Def: \nhttp://retrodef.blogspot.ca/2014/09/whats-old-is-new-again.html\nOn It8bit: \nhttp://www.it8bit.com/post/96429886233/the-new-8-bit-heroes-announcement-teaser-a-new\nOn RetroCollect:\n http://www.retrocollect.com/News/brand-new-nintendo-nes-adventure-mystic-searches-hits-kickstarter.html\nOn 8-bit Central: \nhttp://www.8-bitcentral.com/blog/2014/new8bitHeroes.html\nOn Game Info (Brazil):\nhttp://www.gameinfo.com.br/noticia/366-mystic-searches-novo-jogo-de-nes-a-caminho\nEl Blog Del Afro (Chile): \nhttp://elblogdelafro.com/nuevo-juego-de-nes-en-camino-mystic-searches/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne challenge is making sure the game is localized for different countries.

It is your mobile respawn point and if it is destroyed by the aliens you have no more lives.\nChallenging AI: Intelligent and fierce enemies await in the hive. \nUpgradeable Sci-Fi Weapons: Pulverize aliens with pulse rifles, flamethrowers, and a variety of experimental bombs and weapons. \nHand-Designed Challenges: Plunder challenge rooms and uncover lost relics to upgrade your arsenal.\nDynamic Lighting: Experience pixel-perfect dynamic lighting using Sprite Lamp.\nStrategic Campaigns: The results of your jumps directly impact the ongoing galactic war against the aliens. Manage your planetary campaign between jumps in a turn-based strategy mode. \nController Support: Play Hive Jump using your favorite console controller.\nPlatforms: PC / Mac / Linux (via Steam) and Wii U\nEach mission will place you and your JUMP team at the surface level of an alien labyrinth of tunnels and caves \u2013 which are collectively referred to as a HIVE.\n\nYou will explore each level, finding the single pathway which leads to the next level further below. All the while, the alien race known as the Ordovicians will attempt to stop you by viciously attacking your team. Certain pathways may lead to ancient Relics which were left in the hives long ago - each relic contributes resources to aid in the war effort when found. . Who knows what other vicious perils await you in the depths of the hive?\nBelow is the standard issue JUMP CORPS equipment list. These items help you survive. \nBesides being vicious beyond negotiation, the Ordivician aliens are made of an energy-rich substance (fondly referred to as \u201cgoo\u201d) which we use to create upgrades for your weapons and armor. Kill aliens and collect the Goo they leave behind.\nDescend far enough into the hive and you\u2019ll discover the Hive Queen\u2019s lair. Here you must activate a detonator, which will start a countdown. Protect the detonator until it arms. Then you can beam out and the Nuke will fire killing the Queen and freeing the planet for Humans to inhabit once again.\nHive Infiltration - TL:DR Edition\nWhen an alien hive is successfully cleared, it affects your ongoing planetary campaign! In this turn-based strategy mode, it\u2019s up to you to decide where to strike next, what upgrades and weapons will guarantee your success, and where to build up defenses against the alien counter-attacks.\nIn this campaign mode, you will have to carefully balance your two available resources: Jumpers and Alien Goo. Alien goo is a powerful supply of bioelectric energy, and can be used to requisition new weapons, research upgrades, build fortifications, and request more Jumper reinforcements.\nSome planetary campaigns will be more difficult than others. This is determined by the number and strength of hives, as well as the quantity of resources given at the beginning of the campaign.\nCampaign Map Interface\nThe planetary campaign is only complete once all the alien hives on the map have been eradicated. Human bases are represented in cyan, while alien hives are color-coded orange. Grey areas indicate an unoccupied territory that is ripe for conquest by either the humans or the aliens.\nHuman Base Options\nOn a human turn, players will be able to manage and upgrade their bases, as well as scout out a new alien hive to attack. Players can only JUMP one hive per turn, unless they have earned a bonus ability from successfully clearing a Hive that says otherwise.\nAlien Hive Options\nChoosing which hive to JUMP next is very important, so players have a variety of tools at their disposal. Gathering intel about a hive is helpful, and players can even spend resources to bombard a hive in order to reduce its fortification level, making it easier to JUMP.\nA successful JUMP will replace an alien hive with a human base! It will also grant the player a large amount of resources, as well as a random bonus ability to use at will. Bonus abilities are one-use items that can have effects like: Fully Fortify a Human Base, Take Another Attack Phase, Revive Slain Jumpers from this turn, etc... \nAfter each JUMP, the aliens will have a turn to retaliate. The aliens can expand to new territory, fortify their hives, and launch attacks on your bases. It\u2019s up to you to make sure they don\u2019t succeed!\n More weapons in development! Check our website for more information!\nThe Ordovicians, or 'Vicians for short, are a hostile alien race governed by queens in a hive society. The alien race outnumbers humanity a million to one and has no intention of sharing the galaxy with humans. \nThe aliens will hunt you throughout the hive, traversing the difficult geometry with ease. Their goal is to stop you at any cost and destroy the transponder backpack. Enemies come in 4 classes: mini, minor, major, and elite, each getting progressively stronger and more dangerous.\nExample of a Mini-Class Alien: Buzzers are a fast but weak flying enemy that harass you from a distance. While not very dangerous alone, the mini-class aliens become especially deadly if they start to swarm.\nExample of a Mini-Class Alien: Drones are worker aliens capable of climbing all over hive walls. Watch out for swarms of them crawling on the ceilings above you.\nExample of a Minor-Class Alien: Soldiers are strong and capable minor class aliens. They can leap short distances and their claws can tear right through your armor.\nExample of a Major-Class Alien: Crushers are hearty and devastating major class aliens. Their massive claws strike like a megaton warhead and can block conventional weapons fire as well. Approach with extreme caution.\nElite-Class Alien: The Hive Queen is the heart and mind of the Ordovician hive society. Once you find her deep within the hive, the H.S.A. ship in orbit will beam a portable nuke to the location of the Transponder Backpack. That should put this queen to bed permanently, provided you live long enough to arm the nuke. Good luck Jumper!\nThere will be many more variants and evolutions of aliens in Hive Jump, each with their own unique abilities and behavior. We'll be releasing more info about these enemies throughout the Kickstarter campaign. We'll also be working with backers at the Alien Designer Tier to get their alien ideas into the game. \nThe Hive Jump soundtrack is being composed by the mega-talented Jimmy Hinson, a.k.a.

While we\u2019ve been successful with that business model for over 5 years, it does take a lot of time to stock the coffers well enough to embark on an adventure like Hive Jump (without some help, that is). \nKickstarter offers us the best chance to secure the remaining funding we need to finish the game, while building an amazing community to support the game\u2019s development.\nWe\u2019ll be using the funds to meet the following goals:\n\u2022 Support the development team as we complete Hive Jump on an accelerated schedule.\n\u2022 Additional programming support allowing for faster development of core features and game modes. \n\u2022 Additional art support allowing for more game content: art, animations, and special effects.\n\u2022 Promotional support allowing us to demo the game at venues such as Penny-Arcade Expo South in San Antonio, TX this coming January. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a team, we have over 25 years of combined experience with credits in over 60 shipped titles. This experience has helped us plan for the risks that could impact Hive Jump. \n\nTime/Budget \u2013 Our $50,000 goal is not enough to fund our team forever so we will continue to balance some work-for-hire projects alongside Hive Jump to manage that risk. The plus-side is that the team will keep in peak condition as full-time game developers, and we can afford to evolve Hive Jump throughout development instead of being bound to only what we can do with our Kickstarter Budget.\n\nVisibility \u2013 We\u2019re usually bound by strict non-disclosure agreements, meaning we can\u2019t share information about projects while in development. Hive Jump is much different and we\u2019re doing our best to get it featured by press and fans alike. We\u2019ve set up a website, developer forums, Facebook and Twitter accounts; all of which are aimed at connecting with our fans and gaming press.\n\nUnknowns \u2013 We know disasters will happen from time to time, so we\u2019ve put enough redundancy in place to protect ourselves in the event of most common tragedies that befall your average dev cycle. We have a strong server infrastructure in place to back up our game/project code, we have a network of contract game developers that can help in a pinch, and we have strong work-for-hire relationships that can bring in extra capital to keep our studio running among other failsafe measures.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "HIVE JUMP MILESTONE MET | 1000 Day Sale", "update_content": "HOORAH!

When a murdered detective is 3D printed back into existence, he reopens his last case to uncover what he missed--a hunt that reveals AI corruption, corporate espionage, and the conspiracy that may have led to Earth's doom.\nCheck out our prototype design for our EXCLUSIVE BACKER T-SHIRT ($100 reward tier):\nBack at the $75 level to receive this custom-embroidered, exclusive, MARSTOPIA RESIDENT patch and to get your name in the game & credits!\nLAST LIFE is an epic story told in three engrossing episodes.  Our first funding goal will enable us to deliver Episode One.\nGameplay is inspired by modern point and click adventure games like Kentucky Route Zero and Telltale's Walking Dead series.  Like them, LAST LIFE focuses on atmosphere and storytelling, while also challenging the player's detective skills of interrogation and deduction.\nYou are Jack Parker, recently slain P.I.; Earth was destroyed 11 years ago; and no one is having a particularly good day on Mars. Yet, here you are: back for 4 hours.\nRace your way through the glittery mean streets of MarsTopia as Jack Parker hunts down his own killer.\nWrangle deadly secrets out of an enormous cast of bizarre characters using whatever works: charm, bribes, or something less pleasant.\nUncover the inner workings of the squeaky-clean United Corps, which run the planet like clockwork.\nDrink DNA-enhanced brewskis\nBreak robots.\nGAMEPLAY PROTOTYPE\nThe following scene is ripped right out of the middle of the game. It was originally created to test the adventure game systems such as dialogue, camera movement, and character animations. In it, Parker is trying to find Misty, who has the money he needs to extend his life on MarsTopia.\nEleven years before our story opens, all life on Earth was ended.  Now, only a few million humans still exist, scattered throughout the remaining civilized colonies of the solar system--forever exiled.  \nP.I. Jack Parker was one of the lucky few to have escaped Earth's tragedy.  \nOn that infamous day, he just happened to be working a case on MarsTopia, the crown jewel among these colonies on the red planet.  He survived on that destination resort development, but half-wished he hadn\u2019t.  The echoes of the life he left behind on Earth\u2026a life lost forever\u2026grew louder every hour.  Until, that is, the day 11 years later when he was gunned down and killed.\nBut here\u2019s where Parker gets lucky and our action begins.  The next day is MarsTopia\u2019s annual Dead Man\u2019s Party holiday.  Following custom, Parker and all the other recently deceased in MarsTopia get a nice perk: they are each 3D printed back to life in a new body and given just enough time to enjoy the gala.  But Parker has no intention of politely resuming his death after the party wraps.  He has just four hours to break out of the 3D lab, pick up the leads in his troubling case, and find his own killer.  And, rushing against time he actually doesn\u2019t legally have, perhaps uncover what triggered Earth\u2019s demise.\nJack Parker is a professional investigator who lives for little more than his next swig of Glenfiddich 18 to blot out the past.  His clients? That nervous breed of MarsTopia Corpexec who worry about cheating spouses\u2026 and backstabbing underlings\u2026 and the existential question of where your soul goes after you die.  For the right price, Parker finds them answers--to the first two, anyway.\nMisty Sheridan is perhaps Parker\u2019s only true friend. She, too, lost everything when Earth was destroyed...her sister had taken Misty\u2019s baby back to Chicago to visit their parents. But everyone on MarsTopia had a story like that, and Misty was a survivor. Running The Vapor Lounge, she tries to play by New Shanghai City rules and regulations\u2026 up to a point. There are clients who will pay a premium for privacy and security and Misty doesn\u2019t ever name names.\nKasper \u201cTiny\u201d Gutman is the mastermind behind the MarsTopian underworld gang, the Black Birds. He stays well back in the shadows, but like any fine puppet-master, knows how to pull all the right strings. Whether by means of blackmail or Tiny\u2019s sheer eel-like slipperiness, the authorities have never been able to touch him. While certainly not a man to be trusted, he and Parker have been of mutual benefit on several occasions. Tiny is as charming as he is deadly-- and the 300-pound behemoth is no one to cross.\nFor a long time, I've dreamt of creating a game that explores transhumanism.  In it, one's individuality is tested, the dark parts of one's soul are exposed to the light, and yet hope and a chance at redemption may be just around the corner. Add to that my fascination with stories that build mounting suspense and evoke a pervasive creep-factor (think: Twin Peaks), along with introducing nuanced witty characters.  And lurking amongst them\u2026I have hidden Parker\u2019s killer.\nThe game\u2019s landscape isn't some airless and desolate dystopia; it\u2019s a prosperous domed off-world community, packed with vibrant people, dark corners and luxurious bling.  Here, deadly secrets are waiting to be discovered as you venture out into the glittering MarsTopian night with the clock ticking, ticking, ticking down on your very last life. \nLAST LIFE is being developed by Sam Farmer (Rocket Science Amusements).\nPrior to starting Rocket Science Amusements, Sam was Lead Game Designer for BBC Worldwide where he developed PC games based on several top BBC television series. Before that, Sam won two IGF awards at GDC 2010 for Paper Cakes and Spectre. Then, his design work on Blink (project supervised by Sony Santa Monica), allowed him to create compelling stories within the context of a AAA action/adventure title.\nRocket Science Collaborators:\nThe Tone Ranger, who played in the bands Desire, The Results, and Kitty Kitty, has created our soundtrack.\nArt Center phenom Ivan Louey is creating concept art / refining character designs.\nJerrilyn Farmer, bestselling author of 8 mysteries (Wm. Morrow) and TV game writer of Jeopardy! and Supermarket Sweep is writing our script.\nAdam Howard is the voice talent that gives Jack Parker his cranky charm and deadpan resolve.\nAfter studying music at U Edinburgh, Jacob Pernell is bringing LAST LIFE's SFX to life. Mars and Scotland sound more alike than anyone realized.\nThe brilliant co-anarchists at Glitch City are our creative sounding board.  They have released and/or kickstarted the following acclaimed indie games: Threes!  Hyper Light Drifter.  Nidhogg.  Thirty Flights of Loving.  Skulls of the Shogun.\nAs I created the story, look and feel of this world, I was joined by some amazingly accomplished artists.  It is really a huge bit of luck that a few of them happen to be members of my own family, crazy enough to jump on this dizzying ride without a lot of questions.  As the game's story grew, several more friends volunteered to come aboard.  Literally, my high school drama coach came over to my garage to record Parker's VO.  Like that.  Yet now is the time to put it out there.  I know I need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing Episode One of an eventual 3-part Trilogy.  \nI am dedicated to making LAST LIFE the most amazing adventure game I know it can be. To do that, we\u2019re going to have to give it the time and provide the resources it needs. The funds from Kickstarter backers will allow the core team to maintain our focus, and enable us to bring on others to help us create character art for our expanding world, concept additional scenic designs and a map,  and all of the other expenses that crop up when you\u2019re dedicated to producing an exceptional game experience.  The independence that funding will give us is more appreciated than we can express.\n And now here's one final track from our game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been exhilarated by half a year of planning, writing, drawing, debating, revising, programming and finally of prototyping this concept. And yet, I'm certain there will be great challenges to overcome in the future--such is game development.\n\nLuckily, I will not be facing this challenge alone. Through the combined wisdom, support, and guidance of Double Fine and the Glitch City community, I now have a support network of developers, designers, and artists with decades of experience building and releasing independent games.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. All along this journey, I have had unfailing friends ready to offer honest feedback. Now, with launch of this Kickstarter campaign, I hope to extend this tradition to you, the backers. Let's build an incredible community of our own around LAST LIFE.\n\nIf you have read this far, you are either my mother or my new friend for life.

When you leave one side of the screen, you \"wrap around\" and come out on the other side.\nThe player has the ability to toggle screen wrap on and off at any time. The following images demonstrate this mechanic in action.\nThe game also gives players ways to enhance their abilities, as the images below illustrate.\nFour Sided Fantasy is a game about the limits of the screen.\nOn their journey, players will use their screen wrap power to explore the world of Four Sided Fantasy.\nPlayers take the role of a businessman insistent on breaking out of his seemingly endless office life.

We also have plans to release on other platforms if the opportunity arises.\nThe game is slated for a tentative release date in early 2015.\nExperience\nPreviously, I created The Fourth Wall, which went on to receive several awards. Four Sided Fantasy is a spiritual successor to The Fourth Wall that expands on the concept in many ways. The Fourth Wall serves as a nice prototype for Four Sided Fantasy, showing just a fraction of what this game will become.\n\u201c...it\u2019s utterly brilliant.\u201d John Walker, RockPaperShotgun\n\"I wish I could erase my memory so I could play it for the first time again.

It wasn't an easy choice, but it quickly became apparent that this is what I should be doing.\nFortunately, several of the artists and musicians that I admire most from working with them at DigiPen are joining the team. The reason that we can keep our Kickstarter goal so modest is that they are working full time jobs to help make this possible.

She is an enthusiastic artist who enjoys working with highly motivated people to make cool stuff. She does a lot of things well, and many others not so well, but there are few art-related tasks she doesn't enjoy. She is a DigiPen graduate, and is currently working at a small company in the boondocks of North Carolina.\nJesse Phillips - Animation, Environment art\nJesse is spending his life on improving his interplanetary funksmanship.  \nIn addition to his long-term, extra-planetary goals Jesse is an artist with a passion for animation and illustration. Four-sided fantasy is his first opportunity to work on a game outside the walls of DigiPen. He also does a bunch of other stuff like playing guitar, martial arts and kicking butt with his wife and two dogs.\nJason Wang - Concept Art, Environment Art\nJason Wang is a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation program from the Digipen Institute of Technology Singapore campus. Jason is an extremely efficient artist who specializes in 2D illustration. When he's not defeating you in DOTA or exploring different parts of Singapore, he's drawing up something crazy.\n   David Scamehorn - Graphic design, UI design\nDavid is working with anything that involves graphic design on Four Sided Fantasy. This includes the user interface, menus, and promotional materials. He even created parts of this Kickstarter page.\nA recent graduate of DigiPen, David was co-creator of the charmingly minimalist game Super Space ____.

Some of these tiers are skipped over in the descriptions (such as the $100 tier including the $50 tier but neglecting to mention the $90 tier). As a rule, a tier includes every tier tier below it in price but does not include the tiers that are limited quantity.\nNew! Have a physical postcard in the theme of the game mailed to you in an envelope. Hand-signed by Logan. You can now add a postcard as an extra reward to your current tier if you wish by adding $20 to your pledge (we'll see the amount, and a note from you on the survey that you'll get later on). To do this: \n1) Click \"Manage Your Pledge\" at the top of the Four Sided Fantasy Kickstarter page. \n2) Add $20 to your pledge by changing the pledge amount at the top. There is no need to change your tier. Remember, this is adding $20, not changing your pledge to $20. \n3) Click \"Continue to next step\" at the bottom of the page and finish the payment process.\nPlease note that this is the same for all backers - no matter what tier you are at, you will only receive a postcard if you raise your current pledge by $20. \nNew! We have added a tier for an in-game hat for the main character at the $12 level. Look stylish and solve puzzles at the same time!\nNew! We have added a tier that allows you to have an NPC in a secret area modeled after you, at the $70 level. The non-secret-area version of this tier was pretty popular, and this tier is limited to 25 backers, so get it while it's hot!\nNew! We have also added a tier for an in-game pet dog as one of the rewards, at the $90 level. They were all so cute that we couldn't decide on one, so it's up for backers to vote on which dog makes it into the game! \nTo vote on which dog you would like to see in the game, click here.\nNew! We have added a tier for an in-game hat for your pet dog. This tier is at the $125 level.

Do you have the skill necessary to build and manage the first sustainable extraterrestrial colony, or will your colonists become mere footnotes in the history of human space exploration? Their lives and legacies are in your hands!\nPeriaerion is a 3D real time strategy/simulation game of Mars colonization. The goal is to bring a team to Mars and survive the harsh environment while constructing a permanent, self-sufficient colony. Periareion challenges players to build, maintain, and improve a realistic human colony on Mars. Set in the near future, the technology and information available to the player is based on currently existing or newly emerging research.  \n  The gameplay of PeriAreion attempts to preserve realism while still challenging and entertaining players. To do this, we allow a player to act as mission coordinator, delegating tasks to each colonist individually, both within the base and on the surface of Mars. The game's intuitive user interface and feedback systems have been subjected to intensive testing for maximum ease of use.\nBase Building\nUpon landing, players must construct the necessary modules needed to survive. The 4 base modules (agri, med, geo, tech) need to be built in addition to the water tanks, connectors, and specialization buildings. Each module can be upgraded, making it larger, more efficient, and able to accommodate more colonists, who can be ordered from Earth throughout the course of the game.\nColony Tasks\nInside the base, colonists can perform a variety of tasks to facilitate the function of their base. Generic tasks such as performing repairs or tending plants earn the player experience needed to win the game. Performing a secondary function is designed to stop players from losing the game (e.g. repairs fixes module damage/malfunctions, tending plants provide colony with food). Each module also has the option to perform specialized research. Depending on the module, this earns different types of experience to be used on new technologies and innovations to benefit your colony.\nMap Exploration\n  Building modules and performing tasks cost resources that must be found on the map and mined by colonists. In addition to minerals, players must also drill for water as well as perform missions such as setting up weather research outposts, searching for evidence of past microbial life, or monitoring geological activity. Additionally, each map contains a number of points of interest, where colonists can perform tasks such as taking photos or collecting interesting rock samples to send back home to Earth. \nHazards\nWhile exploring each map, players must look out for their colonists well being. There are a variety of hazardous environmental conditions that can hurt or even kill your colonists. Accidents, sickness, and malfunctions can also be a danger to both your colonists and base. Players will need to respond to such dangers during the course of the game.\nBase Specialization\n Once you reach a certain point in your colony's development it will be time to choose a specialization. Specializing determines the purpose of your colony and each provides a unique way of viable sustainability. Like science?  Specialize as the solar system's premiere research station.  Perhaps you have more commercial interests? Then turn your base into the first extraterrestrial trading outpost. Each specialization unlocks a different set of winning conditions and goals.\n For backers we have a lot of cool swag lined up! Check out the graphics below, and stay tuned for more updates showing off our space-themed rewards.\n     While $3000 is the minimum we need to finish the game, this amount was decided on as the bare minimum to cover Unity licenses, workspace rent, and other team expenses. However, we do have stretch goals in place, in the event that we exceed our funding goal.\nExpanded Colonist Art                            $4000\nThis would include an overhaul of the crew selection process, and possibly the implementation of more in-depth character options and customization.\nFourth Playable Map                               $6000\nA fourth map, unique and different from the previous three sites.  We would love suggestions as to a great site to put another colony!\nCustom Bases                                          $8000\nThis was an original design feature, but time and budget constraints caused a free building placement system to be cut.  Included with building placement would also be in-depth base planning, such as water pipes and power lines.\nNew Colonists/Animations                     $10,000\nOur astronaut model is very costly in terms of performance.  We would love to create a whole new model with a number of different body types and with a wide variety of new animations.\nMarketing                                                    $10,000+\nAdditional funding above ten thousand will help us spread the word about the game and get it out to as many people as we can!  We would also like to use PeriAreion as a means of educational outreach.\nTBA Games is an Orlando-based indie game studio, formed in the spring of 2013 to design and develop the indie game PeriAreion.

Its intricate plot and outstanding voxel based design offers opportunities for intense action and unlimited creativity. Planets\u00b3 has been designed to promote multi-player gameplay, to share the fun with friends.\nToday, in the early development stage, all the elements are in place to develop a first PC (windows) release. What we need now is your help to make it happen!\nUpdates\nEvolution and stats\nMaterials and combat system\nMaterial's recipes\nMultiplayer\nGravity\nRumors have it that aliens who look like humans, crashed onto the planet some years ago. What happened? Where are they from? Why did they crash? Are there survivors?\nTo discover the answers to these questions, Planets\u00b3 players will have to solve a number of mysteries and build up their own little world, before expanding into the universe. Many adventures await them and they\u2019ll find plenty of help -and enemies- along the way. As they progress, they\u2019ll be able to level up their character to achieve more and more freedom, till they can roam the universe in their own starship, which, by the way, they may have created themselves\u2026\nWho said the Earth was round?\nPlanets\u00b3 adventures take place in a universe entirely made of 25cm\u00b3 blocks (voxels). Each planet represents thousands of billions of blocks. The blocks can be combined in a variety of ways to build beautiful objects and landscape elements of all shapes and size.\nConcept Art\nFree to roam\nIn this completely open world, freedom is the key. With entire surroundings that can be completely modulated, destroyed and recreated as you wish, the only limit in Planets\u00b3 is your own imagination! But this freedom comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, to leave our planet and visit the universe, players must unlock their own personal spaceship, or build one themselves\u2026 And you\u2019ll need the natives to grant you their trust, so you can master the craft system and learn new skills.\nShare the journey\nYou will find lots of characters during your journey, natives who will ask you to complete tasks for them. Once you have gained their trust, some of them will allow you to use their crafting skills: they will then become Job Masters, Job Masters are essential for your progression since they can provide assistance in many ways: They can research new recipes for you, help build new structures, repair broken items, dismantle objects to learn how to reproduce them; they can also harvest crops for cooking, and of course, fight by your side against any enemy\u2026 Job masters can be blacksmith, goldsmith, engineer, fighter, cook, builder or farmer.\nThe first one you will encounter is Watts the blacksmith. He will be the one to teach you how to craft low level tools, armors and weapons.\nExperience an amazing evolution\nPlanets\u00b3 is split into zones, which represent different levels of difficulty and mark the progression of the player in the story line.\nYou\u2019ll be able to level up your avatar and improve your character\u2019s skills while playing. In fact every action will improve one of your statistics: For instance, running and jumping will improve your form, making you run faster and jump higher; Pushing your limit will increase your stamina and endurance; Using heavy tools or weapons will improve your strength, and make it easier for you to use them.\nIncrease your technical level\nYour technical level is defined by the level of the tools you can create. How do you progress in this area? When traveling from one zone to the next you\u2019ll find new resources that can be used by the Job Master to research new recipes and craft more powerful items. You can also improve your technical level by taking the enemy\u2019s gear after you win a fight, to use it directly or to bring it to a Job Master to dismantle it and discover new recipes.\nThe more advanced your technical level, the more powerful the crafted items will become, but also the more complicated the recipe to create them (requiring more resources and/or rare resources).\nChoose your combat mode\nWith Planets\u00b3 you decide how you wish to fight: You may want to be a heavily armed warrior, fearing nothing except the lack of enemies. But perhaps you will prefer to play an undetectable ninja, sniping enemies from a long distance or sneaking up from behind\u2026 Players teaming up can combine their favorite fighting styles, so that, together, they can take on the most challenging of enemies.\nFight the enemies in dungeons\nDungeons take up a big place in the Planets\u00b3 story and in the secondary quests. Inside each dungeon is at least one boss, who protects a long hidden treasure by sending out enemy apparitions. To put an end to the attacks and reach the treasure, you\u2019ll have to get past the enemies and kill the boss. The treasure itself is a chest full of useful objects, with some unique items in it, which you can bring to a job master to discover new recipes.\nMost dungeons are destructible, but you will need to have the adequate tools to do so. Some will prove to be indestructible for the moment, and you\u2019ll have to make it through their labyrinth to get past them.\nBeware: enemies in Planets\u00b3 are clever. They will work together in groups, aiding each other to fight intelligently against you. When an enemy apparition is killed, there is no random reward but you can take the armor or the objects they were wearing.\nAnd explore every corner!\nAn important part of the adventure will take place in the depth of the planets, where danger is ubiquitous. Of course the player will harvest valuable resources (minerals or crystals), but mainly he will be led there by the story in order to solve quests or mysteries.\nConcept Art\nMore than just an adventure game, Planets\u00b3 is also a construction game, entirely composed of blocks. The wide range of shapes and materials allows you to create everything you need: tools, vehicles, housing\u2026 A hundred different materials are represented, including woods, rocks, metals, dirt, sand, gravel, transformed materials, and of course\u2026alien technology and materials! You\u2019ll be able to use them as you see fit, to make whatever you have to throughout the game.\nCrafting is key\nCrafting is the essential feature of the game, and the only way to evolve. All objects (except gathered resources) are done by assembling subparts; each subpart makes the tool unique in terms of form and material.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you find an object, with a subpart you can\u2019t craft yet, you can choose to dismantle it to learn how to reproduce the object at will or construct new objects with this newly acquired subpart!\nEquip every weapon\nIn Planets\u00b3 players can equip every weapon, whatever their progression. There are no restrictions, but each weapon has an important statistic for its use, called the \u2018recommended strength\u2019; this makes it easier or harder to use depending on your character\u2019s strength.\nBecome a builder\nSome quests in the game will ask the player to build houses (Job Master\u2019s houses for example) or vehicles. To accelerate things you can call on the builder Job Masters to help you out. You will then be able to record the building patterns for key structures and reuse them in another spot, at another time in the story.\nTravel the universe\nDuring your journey you\u2019ll come across animals which you can tame and mount. But the best way to travel is to create the vehicle you wish: Just assemble the blocks to get the shape you want and add the necessary control blocks (motor, cockpit, wheel \u2026). Vehicles control blocks are crafted as any other object in the game, but the player will need to find the engineer job master to unlock the recipes.\nGround vehicles and animals are not the only means of transportation. Planets\u00b3 will have specific control blocks for spaceships!\nSome of the stretch goals can unlock other specific control blocks for boats, planes and helicopters.\nCustomization and Sharing\nThe entire Planets\u00b3 universe is customizable via xml file (or Planets\u00b3 editor if the stretch goal is reached). Crafts can be modified, but also textures, 3D models, quests, planets generation (landscapes), predefined constructions and so on \u2026\nUltimately, a tool is due to be integrated in the Planets\u00b3 editor and implemented on our website so that players can easily share their creations.\nIn the case of multiplayers, customization is stored on the server so that when you join a server you will automatically upgrade your client files.\nWe are three friends who graduated from the same engineering school in France. We share the same passion for video games. After gaining experience, during 9 years, developing a range of applications (professional applications and/or video games) for Windows, Mac, mobiles and even consoles, we decided to found our independent game studio, Cubical Drift, last year in october.\nWe surrounded ourselves with competent and truly motivated people from different horizons (creative artists, graphics and musician) to develop the game of our dreams\nEvery aspect of Planets\u00b3 reflects what we like in video games: old classic RPG, new open world RPG, adventure game and \u2018sandbox game\u2019.\nToday we aspire to dedicating all our energy to this game.\nWhy should you trust us? The fate of our company and its team depends on the success of this game.\nMeet the Team\nMore about the team in the update #5\nTechnology\nWe use Ogre as our 3D engine, because we have years of experience with it.\nWe have developed specific multithreading algorithms to be able to display a massive number of blocks with a large (almost infinite) viewing distance in real time. This allows you to see other planets from the surface (by night and without clouds!). This was our focus in the actual prototype.\nAmong our top interesting features:\nMarked progression, with clearly defined zone levels\nScalable UI: you craft what you need (a map, a watch, radar\u2026)\nAn \u2018In Game\u2019 vehicle construction system to build your transport solutions\nNatural elements taken into account, such as planets alignment, because all the planets are in motion!\nRealism, with features like pipelines to transport resources, different smelting furnaces for metal, electric circuits management, farming and animal husbandry\nTechnical challenges\nPlanets\u00b3 is full of technical challenges such as:\nLarge viewing distance: you will be able to see everything that is happening in the solar system you are in\nMassive amount of blocs to display: a planet is composed of 32 000 000 000 000 of blocks! One tranche of planet is composed of 1 billion of blocks!\nComplex physical engine for blocks made vehicles\nCommunity Sharing management (to enable players to share their creations)\nParts of these technical challenges have been addressed. In particular, before coming to Kickstarter, we had created the \u00absub resolution based view distance\u00bb engine, which is the major display feature of the game. We reached that goal in December. Sure it will take us a lot of time to optimize the engine, but the hardest part is done!\nHere is an actual game footage. The dev team has been focusing on technical challenges leaving aside the gameplay and the artistic aspect of the game.\nPLAY\n\nAs for now 10% of the game has been developed (game design, artwork, development bases), but we need you to make the other 90%!\nRoadmap\nAs you see some of our stretch goals are really ambitious, and developing them will take more than a year. This is why we decided to release the game in 2 parts:\nThe first release, named Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, is to be finalized, with all features complete, for the fall of 2015 and will include all the goals up to 500 000$ (with the Planets\u00b3 editor). It will take place in the first solar system, with the storyline suspended beyond that...\nWe are targeting 2017 for the release of the 'full game', named Planets\u00b3: Space Enemies, which will open onto the universe and lead to a climactic story ending. Some clues will be scattered in the first opus, though mostly in annex quests and dungeons.\nBudget Breakdown\nMost of the funds will go to development and artwork, the two bigger parts of the planning in terms of the number of persons involved (we will expand the team) and the time needed to complete them. The game also requires writing the story, the quests and working on the sound. These are key to success, even if less demanding in financial terms\nWe plan to sell the game at around $30. As a backer, it means you'll save some money when you support us ; two birds one stone !\nKickstarter Pledges\nAll Backers (whatever the amount) will receive a special thanks in the game credits and an access to the private discussion forum.\nContact and/or delivery for pledges will occur this summer.\nPledge add-ons\nYou just need to add the chosen amount to your current pledge and reward tier:\nFor each additional +$10, you will get an extra digital download (1 access to the alpha, beta and release).

Available from tiers between $15 and $100, included in the $200 tiers and above.

For all the skeptics out there:\nHoly Cow! All Stretch Goals Met!\nYAY!!! Spirit just broke $8000! You know what that means!\nThanks to all Spirit's wonderful supporters, we have reached all three of our Stretch Goals!\nHere's a recap of what we've all achieved here:\nSpirit will now be filled with all sorts of cool moments, mechanics, details, and ideas that used to only be wishful thoughts...\nSpirit will now be TWICE as long! Holden is so excited about this that he has already written up the blueprints for the new extended game, and it is looking awesome.\nWith all the new levels, the Soundtrack must compensate by also DOUBLING in length!\nSpirit will now be followed by a Sequel! or will it be a Prequel??? Who Knows! Well we do actually... but we aren't telling yet. At least not until the script is more fleshed out, as it is only a concept with some corresponding artwork right now. However, I have a feeling that our $50 Private Forum Backers will be getting the inside scoop far earlier and in more detail than anyone else...\nSpirit will now be released for the following platforms and devices: PC - Mac - Linux - iOS - Android - Windows 8 - Windows Phone 8 - Blackberry 10\nWe've got less than two days left, so anyone who wants to forever be one of the people who made Spirit happen should hop on while you still can!\nPOST-SUCCESS UPDATE:\nSpirit will now be a real game thanks to all you awesome backers!!!\nHowever, we've still got some stretch goals to meet! So here's a detailed reminder of what is possible if we can meet these new goals:\n$5K = More Levels, More Polish, and Spirit will be released for Linux, Blackberry 10, Windows 8/ Phone 8:\nThis means that on top of the original script that has been written up for Spirit, we will write in a handful of new levels, add in a ton of extra details and polished features like more interactive environments and interesting aesthetic touches, AND release Spirit for Linux, Blackberry 10, Windows 8/ phone 8. \n$6K = Double the Length of the Game, Plus Extended Soundtrack:\nThis means that on top of the additions from the 5K stretch goal, we're going to write in a ton of new levels, expanding the Spirit world to twice its original size, in turn creating a longer and deeper experience in the game. This also means that because the game will be much longer, the Soundtrack will be extended too, so expect more music to listen to inside and outside the game!\n$8K = A Spirit Sequel !!!\nAfter we finish up the fully extended version of Spirit, we will start working on a sequel to the game! How it relates to the story of Spirit will remain a mystery until we reach this stretch goal! I hope you're as intrigued as I am!\nSo anyone else interested in reaching these goals??? Let's make it happen!\nSpirit is a game intended to bring out the imagination and desire for exploration in everyone.\nIn a remote mountain village, you have retired and built your dream home in order to live out your golden years in peace. Rumors of a mysterious temple beyond the valley have inspired you to set out and explore its ancient halls and crumbling ruins. Once you arrive, it becomes clear that deep within the temple walls, there is something magical that awaits you beyond this world.\nPLAY THE DEMO HERE! :\nWindows (Click Here)\n(Follow the link and download the zip folder.

Extract the folder and RIGHT CLICK on the \"Spirit OSX\" application, then select \"Open\", then when asked select \"Open\" again.)\nIf you enjoy the demo, and want to see the rest of the game through, we need your help to make it happen! And if you're the type of person who usually plays games on their cell phone or tablet, Spirit will be released for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices too!\nSpirit Poster #1\nSpirit Poster #2\nSpirit Poster #3\nUPDATE:\nAfter a lot of player feedback, a lot of our own playing, and a lot of deep thought, we have decided to add something very important to the game. We mention the addition of \"puzzles\" in the full game, though exactly how we were planning on implementing those puzzles was up to debate. But now, a decision has been made, and its one that we feel very proud of, as we think it adds another \"mystical\" element to the game, and doesn't take away from the already determined pace, atmosphere, and minimalistic gameplay.\nWe give you, the power of Telepathy:\nNow before you jump to any conclusions, this \"power\" will not be used for violence or for wreaking havoc of any kind. In addition to the more realistic interactions you experience with the Spirit world, you will now have the very calming ability to stop and meditate, becoming telepathically connected with the world around you. This new power will open up all sorts of new ways to interact with the environment and surpass obstacles on your journey, giving you an even deeper experience with the universe of Spirit. We don't want to reveal too much about this game mechanic just yet, but let's just say that it will definitely come in handy once you reach the whimsical world within the Temple...\nThe team behind Spirit is only two men, so they have all the weight on their shoulders!:\nHolden Boyles: Story, Artwork, and Music\nCiprian Stanciu: Cross Platform Programmer\nIt takes quite a long time to make and perfect even the simplest game, so over the course of production, this project will rack up expenses that we've calculated come to an estimated total cost of $4000.\nHowever, if we can exceed this financial goal, not only can we make Spirit even better, but we can also add more content and gameplay!\nIf we can hit $5000: A whole new system of puzzles and levels will be added into the game, just for some extra depth and gameplay. Also, we will release the game for linux, blackberry 10, windows 8/phone 8!\nIf we can hit $6000: We will double the length of the game! Tons of new levels and content will be added in to the story for a longer and deeper experience in the universe of Spirit.\nIf we can hit $8000: We will create a sequel to the game! There are lots of mysterious left unsolved in the Spirit story, all of which would be revealed in an equally exciting expansion pack.\nCheck out all of our rewards and play the free demo (top of page) to find out what Spirit is all about.\nIf you either want a little preview of the music in Spirit, or you love it so much from playing the demo that you must listen to it outside the game as well, here are some samples from the soundtrack:\nAlso, if you want to check out some other games by Ciprian, so you're assured that we have what it takes to finish this game, check out some of his past projects like Touch Path or Relative Puzzle.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Ciprian has been programming games for a long time now, this is Holden's first step into the realm of game development.

Each species has different advantages, so you have to adapt your strategy. Allies of different species complement one another and each can mitigate the other\u2019s disadvantages.\nResource Production vs. Military Power\nPlayers must balance military spending against industrial upgrades as you increase your power. Upgrading industry increases your future wealth, but you may lose it without military defenses. With a strong military, you can conquer the planets and industries of other players.\nMilitary:  Space vs. Ground\nMilitary power consists of warships and armies. Use your warships to control space around your stars and stop enemy attacks. Use your armies to invade enemy planets or defend your own.\nMany players focus entirely on warships or armies. With an alliance of two players, one ally can focus on warships while the other focuses on armies. The result is a stronger combined military, though they must work together to be successful.\nTechnology\nPlayers may research over 60 different technologies in the game. Technology affects all aspects of gameplay from terraforming your planets to building larger ships.\nAdvantages Of Our Token System\ngameplay based on strategy - no pay to win  \nprice transparency - no hidden costs \nevery player is invested - fewer idle players\nuse tokens how YOU choose - play multiple galaxies at once\nuse tokens when YOU choose - play every game or take a break and come back\nEach galaxy in the Strange Universe will have an entrance fee based on how long it runs. A 3 week galaxy will cost 3 tokens to enter. A 5 week galaxy will cost 5 tokens. 1 token for every week of game play. Our token price at launch will be $1.90 per token, $7.60 for a month of game play. The per token price will drop as you buy larger packages.  \nRewarding For Players At All Levels\nWe have built the Strange Universe to be satisfying yet challenging for players at all levels and reward tactical brilliance while keeping a high level of danger across the board. Not everyone can get to the top and stay at the top, but everyone can have fun. Balance is everything.\nThere are countless paths to victory in the Strange Universe. Wit and cunning can trump resources and size. Players who have been knocked-down have options and can easily come blazing back for revenge.\nEasy To Learn, Difficult To Master\nWith its depth of gameplay and lively community interactions, The Strange Universe is infinitely replayable. Some players will focus on technology, some on ships and armies, and some on industry. Some will try a more varied approach. Each has advantages.\nWe\u2019ve built a game for strategy lovers. It\u2019s endless fun and after years of play testing we haven\u2019t come close to exhausting the possibilities.\nCommunity\nWe're not just building a game. This is a community. Form alliances, trade resources and make new friends through our real-time, in-game chat system.\nVictory Based On Ability\nWe won't sell victory. Our straightforward pay-to-play approach assures that the game is always a level battle ground. This makes strategy and diplomacy the deciding factors between players. The Strange Universe has a chess-like quality where thinking through a chain of future moves is how you succeed.\nGalaxies run for a few weeks - usually 3 to 6.  When the next galaxy starts every player is on equal footing again.  No player has an untouchable lead.  \nStyle\nWe combine retro sci-fi and fantasy elements with a bit of strangeness added into the mix. Where else do you see Elves and Dragons fighting Robots, Martians and Demons?  \nPlayers add a huge amount to the look and the feel of the game.  Every player can:\nName their own stars and planets\nName their own warships\nUpload images for their player avatar\nUpload images and personalize their profile page - where all trophies, medals, and accomplishments are displayed.\nComplex Yet Easy To Use\nOur graphical star map is a marvel compared to other web games. And you don't need Flash or any plugins to play - any browser will work. Smoothly zoom and pan around the universe. Explore other star systems and keep track of any fleets that your scanners have detected.\nOur user interface keeps every option right at your fingertips in menus that are available from any screen.  Every menu option has a built in wizard to make sure you get the information you need.  \nCarefully Balanced\nThe design of the game encourages powerful players to fight each other rather than attack smaller, weaker players.  A bounty system rewards anyone attacking higher ranked players. Higher technology costs slow empire growth and keep players balanced in range of power.  \nThe Strange Universe has been self-funded until now. It\u2019s 90% done but we\u2019re out of resources.  Your donations will let us continue working full-time on the game so we can bring it to the public.   \nOur Costs:\n15% - Kickstarter/Amazon fees + taxes\n10% - rewards for you!\n75% - keeps the Really Big Spiders team fully focused on TFTSU as they finish it\nTo Do:\nA new chat system that will scale better as we add more players.\nA distributed moderation system that is run by the players themselves - to keep our community strong.\nBecome a part of the Strange Universe and help us to finish this wonderful game - then come play it with us!\nSherman Adelson is a software engineer. He was mesmerized by computer games at an early age, so it\u2019s no surprise he studied programming in school. His favorite game for years was Master of Orion, which was a big influence on Tales From the Strange Universe.\nJason Mize, a musician, artist and Jack-of-all-trades, grew up with a similar passion for games. He spent countless hours with Civilization, and when not playing computer games was immersed in sci-fi and fantasy literature. Jason is very competitive and loves strategy, especially when a daring gambit pays off.\nReally Big Spiders was founded by Sherman and Jason as a web development company, focusing on web design.  After a few years they turned to the dark side and embraced their true love, games.\nWe started building the game because we wanted a multiplayer strategy game we could play over the internet. We wanted a game like the strategy games we had enjoyed in the past, but in a multiplayer form we could play together. We lived in different cities, so it was harder to get together and we wanted an activity that we could enjoy on the internet.\nWe tried several internet games, but we were unsatisfied with all of them. They all had a tremendous difference in power between players who had been in the game for months and new players who had just started. Additionally, most players were members of large alliances, which made it hard for new players to compete.  \nAfter months of trying different games, we decided that it was time we designed and built our own.\nEvery tier includes tokens which will pay for entrance to the game (no pay to win!).  Higher tiers = more tokens = more play time.  All tiers include everything from lower tiers.  \nKickstarter Profile Badges: $10+\nThese stylish medals will adorn your in-game profile page, letting other players know that you were there when it all began.  \nDigital Wallpaper: $10+\nDecorate your electronics with 4 high definition space scenes.

Get your invitation and play for free until we launch to the full public!  Includes full access to the game's forum and the ear of the developers.  \nName Ship Weapon: $35+\nOther players are the biggest danger in the Strange Universe but our computer-run artificial intelligence (AI) are a close second.

Download a digital copy of 4 instrumentals written and performed by him and inspired by the game he helped to make.  \nPoster: $50+\nHang a bit of strangeness on your wall with this 11 X 14 limited edition poster, numbered and signed by both developers.  \nName Galaxy: $75+\nEach galaxy will run for 3 to 6 weeks with 100 to 500 players.  After that, it will be immortalized in our ranking lists and on the profile pages of every player who fought in it.  Name one! \nName Planet: $100+\nOur AI (artificial intelligence) each inhabit a star system with 3 planets.  Work with developers to name a new planet type (ex. tundra, acid, metal, etc.) and design what it looks like.   \nMeet The Developers: $100+\nJason lives near Lexington, KY.  Sherman lives in Cincinnati, OH.  Come to one of those and meet us in person or hang out with us online via Skype or Google Hangouts.  Ask us anything!  \nHand Drawn Game Art: $200+\nJason will hand draw and color something from the game and you'll get the original.

Be the envy of sci-fi fans and bikers alike.  \nName Species: $500+\nWork with the developers to design a whole new AI (artificial intelligence) species.  Name the species, name their leader, name their three army types, write a profile description, and decide what their armies/leader/ship icon should look like.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce our campaign is successful, one challenge will be server performance as our game runs with more players than we've ever had. We plan on bringing backers ($20 and up) who get invites to our beta into the game slowly, a few at a time. We can begin this immediately following the Kickstarter completion and continue adding them until we have the full complement of beta players in April. This should be a slow enough growth curve to allow us to identify and address performance issues as we grow. Then we'll have a month or two of beta play to finely tune the game performance before the game opens to the full public in June.\n\nAnother possible challenge would be wild success bringing tons and tons of players all at once. We've designed the game to be easily scaled with this idea in mind. Each galaxy will get its own server. We'll run each galaxy with around 500 players in it. If one fills up then we'll close it off and start a new one and run lots of galaxies at once. We're using Amazon and they have a great program for quickly scaling up as you need.

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates. There's lots of information you don't want to miss!\n UPDATE 4: The \"Over $450,000, reddit AMA, Bonus Q&A\u201d Update\nWe answer a lot of questions in this Update.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.
