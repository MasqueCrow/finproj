[{"backer": "Mark Dwight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The latest addition to our range takes all the strength, quality and craftsmanship you\u2019d expect from a WESN blade - and packs it into our most compact, lightweight knife to date. The Samla is inspired by our Scandinavian heritage and steeped in our love for the wilderness.\nNorthern Scandinavia is no place for a normal knife. Without a reliable blade to hand, it can be a remote wilderness, reluctant to yield its resources. But with the right blade \u2014 durable steel; an unrelenting edge \u2014 an abundance of wild game, fish and forage reveal itself. It takes a special blade to unlock the wilderness and make it home.\nOur Samla knife is inspired by our passion for the wilderness.  Before our blade was forged in steel, it was conceived in the blueberry groves of Michigan that I explored as a kid and the mountain tops of the Swedish wildness I later discovered as an adult.\nWe returned to this time to reimagine what a trail knife should be. It\u2019s why our latest WESN knife is extremely light and compact when carried, but versatile enough for food prep or precision cutting around camp. It\u2019s the knife that won\u2019t let you down when you venture to the edge.\n\nThe Samla knife is our latest design evolution of what an everyday carry should be. We started out with the sleek and practical Microblade, then scaled up to bigger tasks with the Allman. With the Henry pocket knife, we honored heritage. Each new design in the range is an extension not just of our pride, but of your capability in the outdoors.\n\nLight as a Feather\nEven casual day-explorers know that weight matters. For a hiker\u2019s knife, we knew we needed to make it compact and light as a feather, without compromising on toughness or durability. The titanium or wood scale handle measures a snug 3.25\u201d in length, and just 0.25\u201d in thickness. But this is a knife that punches well above its size - just 5.7\u201d from foot to tip when fully open, but that\u2019s steel enough to unlock the wilderness.\nWith Your Meals in Mind\nCarry the only knife you need in your cook kit. The sharp, precise steel blade measures 2.45\u201d and slices easily through prep work. It\u2019s tough and versatile enough to cope with everyday repair tasks around camp, from slicing rope to cutting canvas. \nThe Trademark WESN Durability\nOutstanding corrosion resistance means you can draw a bright, keen blade every time with minimal maintenance. We\u2019ve treated each component with care and attention in our design: From the non-locking friction folder for a smooth, steady action to the phosphor bronze washers for long-lasting, corrosion-resistant performance.\nThe Samla Sheath\nWe are excited to introduce the Samla Leather Sleeve. Hand made in Sweden, with natural vegetable tanned leather, the sleeve will age in time, showing character unique to how you use it. Both sleek and practical, the sleeve is the perfect companion for the Samla.\n\n\n\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nIn collaboration with BackersOnly, an exclusive crowdfunding agency for high profile creators. We've helped 500+ projects raise over $45MM.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a dedicated team focused on production. Since our first launch, we\u2019ve fulfilled over 30,000 orders. From our experience we\u2019ve learned there can always be bumps in the road. We promise to handle and solve each challenge in order to hit production deadlines. We have a strategic plan to hit those deadlines, however, due to unforeseen issues, there is always a small risk of delay in delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWith our products focused on being instant classics, nothing about our designs are trendy or cater to hype trains. The knife you carry today will still suit your grandchild perfectly when they use it. We insist on crafting our knives at the intersection of quality and beauty \u2014 ensuring your WESN knife suits any and every occasion.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur packaging is made from post-consumer materials and 100% biodegradable. Although it\u2019s cheaper to go with plastic pull tabs and bubble wrap instead of leather pull tabs and wood shavings, we followed our convictions and went the \u201cgreener\u201d route. With our plastic-free packaging, you can toss it away and feel good about doing mother earth a solid.\nSustainable materials\nThere are many design trends when it comes to knives. The worst we\u2019ve seen in recent times is using low-quality materials, at the cost of a quick buck. Through many hours of R & D, we\u2019re very pleased with our material choice and functional design.

After receiving input from our backers, we created an expansion card with a focus on bullet journalers. \nOur new design features 3 journal specific tools to take your bullet journaling up a notch. Use the BUJO Expansion Card by itself or combine it with the Original Sketchmark for even more creative possibilities!\nAfter packing the Original Sketchmark with over 15 features, we designed the Bullet Journal Expansion Card to complement it, not replace it! We built a card with 3 bullet journal specific features that fit into a small, compact design. Paired with the features of the Original Sketchmark, the possibilities for your journaling are endless!\nThe alphabet stencils were carefully designed to make it easy for you to add titles, dates, and more to your bullet journal! Our unique punctuation stencil allows you to easily create question marks, exclamation points, and periods. The stencils are designed to fit within two vertical rows of a 5mm x 5mm grid journal.\nUse the monthly tracker to keep track of all your habits! Track everything from your workouts, eating habits, sleep schedule, spending, and much more! Our unique design gives you plenty of versatility in creating your own trackers. Use the card as a stencil to create boxes for each day or use the card as a guide to quickly number your days in perfectly spaced 5mm x 5mm boxes. Unlike most stencils, we included 2 title boxes for more options! You can create amazing titles featuring letters and symbols when you use the alignment guides above the title boxes!\nTitle alignment points make it easy to add icons and titles above your calendars. When drawing a title box, simply stop at one of the 3 marking points to include a 1, 2, or 3 letter title.\nFor example, to add \"JUN\" to represent JUNE on your calendar, stop tracing at the alignment point with 3 dots to have the perfect spacing to fit your 3 letter title. \nA single icon fits perfectly when you stop at the alignment point with a single dot above it.\nAdd some character to your bullet journal with our 10 journal icons! We included 7 basic icons that can be used to represent anything you want! We also included 3 journaling specific icons that can take on a few different meanings of their own. Each icon is designed to fit within a 10mm x 10mm box.\nJust like the Original, the Sketchmark Expansion Card doubles as a bookmark! Sketchmark\u2019s bookmark cutout keeps your Sketchmark close to your journal at all times. Use it to mark your page in your journal, textbook, or book! \nSketchmark isn't just for journaling. Use it as your primary bookmark to quickly underline key passages or use the journal icons to take notes and star, check or otherwise mark your book or textbook!\n\nPair the Sketchmark BUJO Expansion Card with the Original Sketchmark! Launched in January, our original card has over 15 tools for journaling, designing and sketching. After raising over 1700% of our initial goal, input from our Original Sketchmark customers helped us bring the BUJO Expansion Card to life! \nWe designed the BUJO Expansion card to complement the Original Sketchmark, not replace it! The features of both cards are designed to work together to give you endless possibilities in creating your journal. Watch our first Kickstarter video below to see all of the Original Sketchmark's features!\n Add-ons will be available following the campaign through Backerkit!\nSketchmark's possibilities are endless! Check out a few samples of what is possible with Sketchmark and the Bullet Journal Expansion Card below! \nGet inspired by other bullet journalers by following popular hashtags on social media! #BUJO,  #bulletjournal, #bulletjournaling", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving launched successful Kickstarters in the past we are confident that we can easily avoid many problems that arise for first-time creators.

It was our dream to develop a notebook that was \"hippo sized\" and could hold many memories/thoughts/ideas in one place.  500 pages of 68GSM Tomoe River Paper strong, with the help of 1401 original backers and many Late Pledges, that project came to life in a big way.\nThe original project as well as this one are dedicated to our son who left this world too soon. He will always be our little Hippo in the sky <3\nThe #hipposquad originally planned to launch the B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto first, but since the original campaign people have been asking for a full sized A5.  We sent out a survey to feel out interest, and now heed the call for a dual launch!  This project is our most ambitious yet, with more collaborations, multiple sizes, and added features.\nFront: B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto, Back: A5 Standard Hippo Noto\nThe Pygmy Hippo and new A5 Standard Hippo Noto, pack all of the features loved from the original Pocket A5 Hippo Noto and also add a few new twists.\nOriginal Features:\nBack Pocket:  For all your swabs, mini notebooks, stencils and more!\nElastic Closure:  To keep your Hippo secure.\nTwo Bookmarks:  Convenience in the form of ribbons.\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper:  All the things you love about 52GSM but with less ghosting, and a more robust feel.\nWhats New:\nPage Numbers!:  One of the most requested features our backers from the last Kickstarter had.\nColored Dots:  Each Pygmy and A5 Standard Hippo Noto have interior dot grid that match the elastic band closure of the book itself.  To add a bit of pop to your writing experience.\nTons of Pages!:  The Pygmy Hippo Noto boasts 400 pages, while the A5 Standard keeps the 500 page count that the original has.\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding:  The original Hippo Noto was thread bound, and this time we are making the binding even stronger by adding a piece of cloth to the profile.\nCover texture:  Some of our cover options will be textured!\nNew cloth reinforced binding.\nWe are so blessed to have the talented Robert Oster do a brand new ink color exclusively for this Kickstarter.  It is lovingly named Pygmy Purple.\nIt is a berry magenta that has excellent shading and sheen, especially on the 68GSM Tomoe River Paper of Hippo Noto.\nUp close and personal with Robert Oster Pygmy Purple\nLets Talk Specs!\nA5 Standard Hippo Noto: \nMeasures 148 x 210 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  500 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nB6 Pygmy Hippo Noto:\nMeasures 125 x 176 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  400 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nThe Colors! \nThis Kickstarter will start off with two colors, one in A5 Standard and one in Pygmy B6.  We will add more colors as stretch goals, some of which the backers will choose!  We wanted to make this Kickstarter more interactive, as we had such a great response letting the backers choose the stretch goal color for the last campaign.\nA5 Standard:  So Black.  This Hippo will feature a black cover, grey interior end pages, grey interior dot grid printing/page numbers, black bookmarks, and black elastic band closure.  The Hippo Noto logo on the front will feature a dark grey foil, in contrast to the traditional silver we use on all our other models.\nB6 Pygmy:  Purple.  Hippos are purple after all!  This Hippo Noto will feature a royal purple cover with purple interior end pages, two purple bookmarks (light and dark), fanciful purple interior printing dot grid/page numbers, and a light purple elastic band closure.\nPurple B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto Prototype\nInterior dot grid that matches the elastic bands! ***In the So Black Hippo Noto, the dots will be a grey as to not be tooo distracting.\nThe Paper\nAt the core of Hippo Noto is the paper that we use, 68GSM Tomoe River Paper.

The 0.7mm acid free gel ink flows onto your writing surface like no other. It's very reliable, and starts flowing as soon as it hits the paper. No scribbling to get it going.

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.\nThere's none more black!\nBlack 3.0 is a super special acrylic paint. We have spent nearly 2 years tweaking its formulation to create a black that absorbs between 98 and 99% of visible light! Quite simply we've created the blackest black acrylic paint.\nBlack 3.0 brush applied to sculpture\nLast November we shared a beta batch of Black 3.0 with 1000 artists around the world for feedback and thoughts. We've now taken that information and reformulated it to be the best black we could possibly make. \nAll the photos and video content on this page are created with the final formulation of Black 3.0 from the UK factory that are producing it for us, we are excited to be playing with it and feel like it's perfect!\nWe need your help so that we can pay the paint factory to produce their minimum order quantity of our recipe so we can share our creation with everyone!\n The science behind the Black!\nWe wanted a super-flat, ultra-matte black that absorbed almost all visible light. To achieve that we went right back to the basics of paint making. The problem with existing black pigments is they are all slightly reflective (carbon is the most common and if you think of coal or charcoal you'll know it has a shine to it), so we created a whole new pigment in the lab and we call it 'Black Magick', it is born matte! This means that the mattifiers we used in Black 2.0, which added a tiny grey tint, are no longer needed making a way blacker looking paint! We've also managed to formulate a new acrylic polymer to hold the pigment, it's special because it has more available bonds than any other acrylic polymer being used in paints. This means it can cling onto way more pigment, leading to a really dense pigment load and a depth of colour not previously possible. We have sourced some brand new nano-mattifiers which we have added, these flatten out the last bits of stray light without compromising colour. \nUnedited comparison with other well known black paints\nWe have benchmarked Black 3.0 against 45 existing black paints, this photo demonstrates a small section of those, being the most commonly available black paints in the UK. We also sent beta versions of Black 3.0 to 1000 artists around the world, they filled in a questionnaire and 93% of them preferred it to our Black 2.0 (previously the worlds flattest mattest black). \nIt's super easy to use.\nOther super blacks are complicated to use and extremely expensive. Most require heat, science labs and specialist training to apply. We wanted to make a super affordable, easy to use paint that was familiar to artists so they could concentrate on expressing themselves. \nWe think that sharing your colours with others is nice! When Stuart heard that Kapoor was the only artist that could use the blackest black he felt sad but also a bit bad that he'd been making awesome colours and only using them in his own work. So he started sharing his colour creations on the internet with other artists. \nThe holy grail of paints is the ultimate zero-point black. We've been on a mission to create exactly that for a long while because we want all artists to be able to express themselves with awesome materials. The limits of your creations should be your imagination not how rich or successful you are. \nWe are a small team of artists and paint makers based in a studio in Dorset on the south coast of England. We are headed up by British artist Stuart Semple who has been making his own colours for nearly 20 years. \nWe've created and shared tens of thousands of the artiest art materials with artists all over the world including LIT (the world's glowiest glow pigment). PINK (the pinkest pink), Gold (the goldest gold), Black 2.0 (the mattest flattest black paint), Dazzle (the glitteriest plant based glitters) and many more creations. \nYou can see what we make and learn all about us on our website:\nculturehustle.com\nNo matter what reward you choose you will get at least one bottle of Black 3.0 but your support means so much to us we wanted to thank you properly.

Our goal remains to get everything done as quickly as possible and beat our listed delivery dates.  Thanks for the support!\nWe know what you are thinking, and we will go ahead and answer it for you. Yes, Kickstarter does need another pen project. Especially this one.\nSay hello to the Spoke Pen.\nThe Spoke Pen is a collaboration between Brian Conti of Spoke Design, and Brad Dowdy of The Pen Addict. And, most importantly, is built to specifically fit the best gel ink refill in the world: The Uni-ball Signo UM-151, also known as the Uni-ball Signo DX.\nThe Signo DX is a smooth-flowing, clean-writing, rich-color gel ink pen. Its quality among its competition in unsurpassed, yet on Kickstarter, the Signo DX has been mostly overlooked.\nSpoke brings an instantly recognizable design: A streamlined geometric-deco style in a world of minimal cylindrical machined pens. We're not knocking minimal design, but everything can't be minimal!  \nthe machined pen that's MACHINED A LOT!\nThe Spoke Pen features aluminum barrel construction, grip materials in aluminum or titanium, a magnetic cap for secure closure, and wide range of anodized aluminum colors. For you tech-spec geeks out there, here are the specifics:\nAs important as the specifications are, it was very important for us to get the feel of this pen right. We started prototyping all of the parts in June 2018, and went through many iterations to get to the final result we have today. The Spoke Pen feels light, but substantial. It is rock-solid and durable, but gets out of the way when writing with it or carrying it. It is high quality, and comfortable. The Spoke Pen is your new favorite pen.\nThe goal of the Spoke Pen campaign is to make the best barrel for the Uni-ball Signo DX on the planet. And, to have fun doing it by offering a wide range of colors in this campaign. Assuming it all goes well, after we successfully fulfill the Kickstarter we plan to periodically release future Spoke Pen 'editions' with more unique color combinations and materials. And yes, we may eventually make it for other refills too, such as the Pilot G2. \n Spoke Pen Classic Series: $60 Aluminum Grip / $65 Titanium Grip\nThe classic colorway has matching anodized barrel and cap, with black anodized accents (clip, ends, and slot see-through).  It is available with a black anodized grooved aluminum grip or a machined grooved titanium grip.  The Titanium grip is slightly heavier than the aluminum... and as a bare machined part it is a bit 'grippier' than the aluminum.\nBarrel color choices: Black, Blue, Red, Lime, Purple, Orange, and Rub/Brushed Aluminum\nSpoke Pen Classic Series colorway (black anodized grip)\nSpoke Pen Classic... aluminum barrel with Titanium grip.\n Spoke Pen Edition Series: \n1) The Joker, $60\nPurple Cap, Lime body, Black Aluminum grip, Black clip, Purple sleeve, lime top cap, purple end cap.\nSpoke Pen Edition Series... the Joker\n2) Orange Crush, $65\nOrange body, Titanium grip, Nickel clip, Aluminum see-through, Aluminum end caps (metal stamped Spoke 'S' on cap end). \nSpoke Pen Edition Series: Orange Crush\nAll pens ship with a Uni-ball Signo UMR-1-05 Black 0.5 mm gel pen refill.\nWe've concepted, prototyped, and iterated using 3D printing and machining. The design is now complete. Brian leads the manufacturing stage and has extensive experience with prior Spoke projects. While he has the ability to make prototypes and product in small quantities, we choose to work with professional machine shops to produce production quantity parts. While Spoke has traditionally utilized only domestic shops, the Spoke Pen will use a combination of US and overseas shops. Brian has lots of experience with overseas shops from his corporate days. The overseas shops have a good ability to deal with anodizing a broad range of colors over a relatively small quantity of parts. The plan is to use a specific shop in Shenzhen that Brian has experience with for the aluminum parts requiring anodize and the US shop Brian traditionally works with for the straight machined parts.\nEach Pen has 10 custom parts. These will be brought in individually and everything will be inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped out by Brian & Brad. There's quite a bit of work that goes into assembling each pen, and we'll show the process as the project moves along.\nA high level overview of the timeline is as follows ...\nBrian Conti is a design engineer and founder of Spoke Design.  Brian runs a small product development company with his brother Dan (Conti-Bros, Inc.). Their brands include Strong Like Bull Magnets, Yaket, and Baux.\nBrad Dowdy has been writing stationery reviews online at The Pen Addict since 2007, co-hosts The Pen Addict Podcast, and makes pen cases and paper goods at Nock Co.\nWill <insert refill here> fit the Spoke Pen?\nYes: Uni-ball Signo 207/307, Uni-ball RT1, Pentel Energel, Zebra Sarasa Clip\nNo: Pilot G2, Pilot Juice, Pilot Hi-Tec-C, Pentel Slicci, Pentel Hybrid Technica, Parker-style.\nWill <insert refill here> EVER fit the Spoke Pen?\nAt some point in the future we will design a Spoke Pen model to fit other refills.\nDoes the pen cap post on the back the pen?\nNo, it doesn't. This is to reduce length in use, lower writing weight, and provide better weight distribution and balance.\nThanks for visiting the project. We look forward to getting Spoke Pen into your hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Spoke Pen project brings together two veterans of running successful Kickstarter projects. As noted above, we've spent a good amount of time prototyping to get the design to a production ready point. We have good experience producing machined pencils and other products, and we have good experience with the overall Kickstarter process (funding/manufacturing/fulfillment). The main 'risk' is the delivery timeline. We'll be working with outside supplier partners, and so at times we'll have somewhat limited ability to 'push' to get things done.

I\u2019ve often been asked to compile them into an art book, and I finally have!\nfinished paintings on my workbench(technically a work floor, in this case).\nStrange Friends is a postcard book featuring 20 paintings of odd creatures, furry, scaled, blerpy, and/or horned. It will be offset printed on a lush felted paper, and each postcard will be a art-print quality piece of art. The cover will be a lovely thick cardstock, with foil printing! I make beautiful objects, and I intend to make this one as fancy as I can!\nOf course, I am a very practical person, so they are also nice postcards that should be sent to people you like. \nHere are some of the creatures that will be in the Strange Friends postcard book.\nGood friends. Much friends.\nThis is a very straightforward Kickstarter - you can buy the postcard book, or buy multiple copies of the book. That's because I just want to make this book, and I want to make it a beautiful and special object! There is a one fancier option, where I'll hand-wrap the book for you so you can give it as a very thoughtful gift. For Kickstarter's Make 100 program, I am also making a care package edition, which allows me to indulge in telling weird little narratives through ephemera and other objects.\nHere is a draft of what the cover will look like! I'll be hand painting it, and updating you on its progress in Kickstarter updates. The pink bits will be rendered on the cover in shiny foil! \nDigital First Draft - Strange Friends cover.\nThe Make 100 Care Package edition\nI love making care packages, as my long-time Patreon subscribers can attest to, and this is a lovingly hand curated care-package of the Strange Friends postcard book, limited edition prints, heartfelt letters from fictional girls, and other delightful handmade ephemera and found objects. I don't want to spoil the arc of the tiny-story-in-a-package, but the keywords are: mysterious disappearances, summer camp, and special beasts. \nI\u2019m using this as a platform to experiment with new found object narratives that won\u2019t be available anywhere else!\nCombining pledge levels\nPlease pledge at the highest pledge reward level listed that you would like, and add the additional cost of other reward levels you want to your pledge. \nCosts, and other details.\nPrinting costs for this book, including proofing, fancy foil printing, felted paper, and shipping from Malaysia, will cost approximately $11,500.00.

We worry almost constantly and there's nothing in this world saying that we have to. It doesn't change anything or fix the problem, but we do it anyway. We constantly pull from our bank of emotions and hormones to pay for this debt that doesn't exist. \nHow worrying can affect your body\nChronic worrying can lead to the triggering of fight or flight which causes the body's sympathetic nervous system to release stress hormones. Those hormones cause physical reactions like dizziness, fatigue, headache, inability to concentrate, nausea and shortness of breath to name a few. If excessive worrying and high anxiety go untreated, they can lead to depression. These effects are a response to stress. Whether or not you become ill depends on how you handle stress and there are things you can do to alter the way you respond.*\nHere are a few things that can be helpful\nExercise\nEat a healthy diet\nDon't drink too much caffeine\nLearn to relax\nMeditate\nBe conscious of your worries\n*I'm not a doctor. I just read a lot and have dealt with worry, anxiety and stress like all of us.\nA few years ago, I started manually machining various types of Worry Coins. They vary in metals, woods and sizes. Last year I had the idea that I'd laser engrave this quote into a coin but it was missing something and made these hand made coins even more expensive. I really wanted to be able to offer a more affordable version of a Worry Coin with this quote but, at the time, was not aware of Shire Post Mint's ability to create a concave surface on one side, so I shelved the project. A few months later, I saw what they could do with a coin so reached out to my favorite designer, Mike Major, and got to work. I couldn't be happier with the result. The size, weight, design and cost are the perfect balance and I'm sure you will enjoy.\nCheck out the coin page on my website to see some of the original hand made versions.\nwww.jllawsonco.com\nIs this coin the answer to your worries?\nI don't believe there is one answer to all anxiety or worry but I do believe that an object like a \"worry stone/coin\" can aide in self soothing. Here's a little excerpt about the origin of worry stones.\nFrom the perspective of cognitive behavior therapy, the use of worry stones is one of many folk practices that can function as psychologically healthy self-soothing exercises. Such techniques are imparted at an early stage of treatment, displacing any familiar but destructive coping methods (nail-biting, scratching, lip-biting, etc.) that the patient may have developed. This helps ready the patient to safely confront anxiety or trauma. Worry stones are simple and intuitive enough to be useful in therapeutic contexts where complexity and unfamiliarity are paramount concerns, such as when offering short-term treatment to refugees or children with post-traumatic stress disorder. After a patient has mastered a more sophisticated relaxation script for anxiety management, the worry stone itself can serve as a physical 'relaxation script reminder'; the patient may notice an impulse to use the object, and thereby become aware of their own anxiety.  The rubbing of the stone can create a sense of relaxation making the mind more relaxed and generating a sense of calmness.  There are also people that may use them during meditation practices, this is known to center a persons concentration benefiting the meditation\nThe soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing this concave coin is the perfect conduit to being present.\nLearn to relax, meditate and be conscious of your worries. This coin helps with all of those. Meditation equals relaxing but it doesn't have to mean sitting on a pillow in the lotus position. Meditating is being present and breathing. The soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing the concave coin is the perfect conduit. It's also a good way to remind yourself to let the worry go.\nMost importantly, carry this coin to remind yourself that worrying won't change the problem you're anticipating.\nThe original inspiration for my Worry Coins were traditional worry stones.\nThe difference between worry and concern\nAm I saying that you should never be concerned about a current or potential problem? Of course not, but take steps to handle the problem and let it go. I used to have a ton of trouble sleeping at night because I'd lay there thinking of all the things I needed to do in the near or distant future. In other words, I'm laying there worrying about it when there was absolutely nothing I could do about it at the time...I'm supposed to be sleeping! The worst part is that the majority of those worries never even came true...that debt I didn't owe again.\n1.25\" diameter\n.200\" thick\n1.1 oz\nAvailable in solid Bronze, Copper or .999 Silver\nsmooth concave on one side\nA little bonus for you spinning top collectors!

This Micro Top is a bit of an homage to my dad. He made the original around five years ago as a joke before the spinning top craze took off.

To ship one of these coins the right way, it has to be considered a \"package\" which is now a minimum of $13 for most countries ($9 for Canada). A 1 oz package costs me $13-$15 to ship. I don't pad the cost in any way. The only option that is cheaper than that is to ship a \"document\" and ranges $4-$8. The problem with this is that it's not a document so your package can get held up or sent back and it's just not worth the trouble. I know that other creators and companies sometimes charge less for International shipping but I can't tell you exactly why. Possibly they get better bulk rate, possibly they are shipping the product incorrectly or, more likely, they are padding the cost of the product with shipping costs to make it look like the shipping is cheaper or free. The fact is that shipping is shipping and no company can just absorb shipping costs unless they are making up the difference somewhere else. Thanks for your understanding.\nAbout us\nJ. L. Lawson & Co. was founded in 2011 with the idea to machine some rings and have a side gig. My dad was a manual machinist in the middle of the desert so work wasn't easy to come by. The company began to grow in 2012 so pops had to start training me (Anthony) in the shop. We made some spinning tops that year and machining was kicked into high gear since then. A few years ago, I came up with the idea to have a Decision Maker coin minted and found Shire Post Mint. This is my fifth coin design from the Shire and I couldn't be happier with the results. Finding good vendors for various businesses I've had has always been a nightmare so it's a true pleasure to find someone that I can trust and rely on. I believe Mike Major was sent to me via the universe when I realized that he was not only a customer of mine but I had been following a company that he was part of. He'd done the graphics for Wool and Prince and I kept meaning to reach out to them to ask who did there work. Before I could do that, Mike reached out to me to tell me how much he like the products he purchased from me and I noticed his email address was from Wool and Prince. Madness. To date, the trio of myself, Shire Post (Woody) and Mike Major has been the perfect marriage of talents and I'm sure there are many more pieces to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 11th Kickstarter campaign so I've gotten pretty streamlined with the process.

Ziusudra, a man well known for his humility and obedience. Ziusudra did as Sumer God commanded him and built a huge boat, in which he successfully rode out the flood. Then similar stories were then appeared in Epic Atrahasis (1500 BC), Epic of Gilgamesh, Deucalion in Greek folk mythology, Noah in Genesis, and so on.\nThe Deluges Stories\nThe Design: \nDeluge is the first series fountain pen released by our team, Genesis Pen. They tributes to the cultural heroes in the Deluge mythology by using the unique interior barrel design. The transparent barrel refracts the unique internal ink chamber. It assembled with a stack of rectangular blocks representing the Tablet of Eridu Genesis. Each layer of block rotates 11 degrees symbolizes the Deluge story in the Tablet XI of Epic of Gilgamesh. The whole structure consists of 50 layers of blocks and assembles as a helical structure that emulates the DNA 3D structure, the fundamental molecule of life. The ink chamber capacity is approximately 3 ml, which is larger than most ink cartridges, converters, and piston fillers. The Deluge initially comes with three styles named Ziusudra, Atrahasis, and Deucalion, after the historical heroes in the Deluge stories. Furthermore, we will release Noah, when the Stretch Goal is reached.\nClose-up of the metal rings\nThe ink channel\nZiusudra with ink\nZiusudra with ink\nModels:\nDeluge - Ziusudra\nZiusudra\nZiusudra with the cap on\nZiusudra comes with the unique glass-like resin with golden rings. The hand-painted golden helix symbol and the sliver/gold two-tone nib make Ziusudra unique. \n Deluge - Atrahasis\nAtrahasis\nAtrahasis, a fully transparent demonstrator comes with silver color German-made stain steel nib.\nDeluge - Deucalion  \nDeucalion\nDeucalion, with unique triple black design together with a black ruthenium plated steel nib, makes it one-of-a-kind fountain pen in the market. \nThe Making of: \nTo construct such a complicated ink chamber structure inside the narrow pen barrel will not be successful without the use of edge-cutting technology, the Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Resin Printing. This technology uses light to solidify liquid photocrosslinking resins into a rigid solid resin. This technology opens up a new horizon in fountain pen design. \nMaterial: Fountain pen users have a high requirement and expectation towards fountain pen's materials and their durability. We have been searching for resins that give satisfaction texture and at the same time, compatible to SLA 3D printing. After a lot of trial and error, we finally identified the ideal material by using a self-formulated photo-crosslinking resin that is ideal for the fountain pen. After constructed by state-of-the-art 3D printing technology, the material will be solidified and remains strong, transparent, and unique. The material is resistant to water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, and most other organic solvents. Stable up to 200\u02daC heating. The Deluge series uses the hollow eye-dropper type of ink filling system. To facilitate pen washing, we paid a lot of effort in formulating the resin that can make the pen washing and writing be enjoyable. The rings on the pen are costed-bronze, which is shinny and rust resisting. \nHandcrafting: SLA 3D printing together with the self-formulated resin only took us halfway in reaching our goal. After printing, the material is rough and non-transparent that does not look like a pen that people will love. In order to solve this problem, we recruited a specialist to our team who has good pen polishing skills. We spent a lot of time researching the best polishing process for this new type of material. Finally, we came up with a series of processes to turn the printed \"object\" into a unique fountain pen that is transparent and rigid, yet feels smooth and warm like ebonite. \nBefore and after hand-polishing\nPen washing has been a lot of people's concern, therefore we are adding a pen washing video to show the ease of cleaning. With our self-formulated resin, we ensure the ink will not be trapped in the ink chamber. \nPLAY\n\nSpecifications:\nLength: 142.6 mm caped. 112 mm without the cap.

Its uses are almost endless, yet few people use it. Why?\nBecause there is no holder designed to fit the needs of us makers.\nSo we decided to make one.\nThe Maker Knife is a tool made to be carried every day, everywhere you go. It is compact, lightweight, super quick and easy to open. No more looking for a blade. No more interruptions while you\u2019re working on a project. The Maker Knife is always there, ready to swiftly help you work more efficiently.\n- Jimmy Diresta\n          Oh yeah did we mention it\u2019s freaking magic? The locking mechanism is extremely easy to use. There are no buttons to push. No weird finger movements to do. You can just flick it open with your thumb or a finger.\nThe blade holder automatically locks securely into place when it reaches the top and by witchcraft unlocks when you pull it back down. It really does feel like magic!\n\"WTF!?? How does it work?\" - That guy in a red shirt that tried to figure out the mechanism for 2 minutes while pushing it back and forth.\nNo springs, just magic.\n          More magic! Pretty cool right? And this is without the use of springs! It's all you. You see the Maker Knife is adjustable. You can choose from a range of \"almost impossible to open\" to \"wrist flick to open\". Both offer great holding strength while retracted (no worrying about it opening in your pocket), and you can tune it to feel just the way you want it to feel.\nIt's also a fantastic feature for increasing the \"child safety\" factor of the knife as you can make it require a lot of force to open. (Obviously don't let kids anywhere near a knife of any kind though)\nWe made it for you, and us.\nWe love the utility knife blades because you can scrape, pry, cut, chop, stab, sand or whatever without worrying about them getting chipped, dull, bent or broken. They are cheap and easy to find at hardware stores, so you can just swap the blade when it gets worn out and have a new flawless, razor sharp edge in seconds.\n          What we don't like is the lack of a good way to hold them. Most handles are bulky and heavy, mainly made for industrial applications. - That won't work for us makers!\nWhat we need is a convenient, super quick knife that is lightweight and compact. A design that is made to be an EDC (Every Day Carry) item.\nSo we decided to make the Maker Knife.\nHere we are, five months later, with a finished design. You would think designing a holder for a blade would be pretty straightforward right? But we didn't just want to make a stick and shove a blade on there. No, we wanted to make something so good that you would like to carry with you, all the time, every day.\nPrecision manufacuring\nThere were these extraordinarily complex problems that needed to be solved in order to achieve the magic feeling we were seeking. Some parts were impossible to mill using CNC machines, so we used extremely accurate EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining), making cuts that are no thicker than a human hair.\nWith a core of high strength stainless steel\nSuper quick to use in either hand\n          It took many, many tries, prototypes and curse words to perfect this deceptively simple looking locking mechanism. A locking mechanism so intuitive and easy to use that you don't even think about it, you just use it, no matter which hand.\nSome of the very early prototypes\nYou can even unlock the Maker Knife wearing thick gloves.\n\"You really don't have to think about using the Maker Knife. You're already done.\"\nDid we mention it's waterproof?\n\"Unlocking the maker knife is the transition from a thought to an action. That is why we made it flawless.\"\nThe Maker Knife is available in two different finishes; Black or Silver.\nThe silver finish is very similar to a pretty well known computer model\nThe clip can be mounted on either side of the knife\nOnce the campaign is over, we will ask which finish you prefer, so you don't have to make this difficult decision just yet. Pledge now - choose later.\nMaterials\nTo ensure the best performance we made the core from high strength corrosion resistant stainless steel. The case is made from aerospace grade aluminium to keep the Maker Knife as light and agile as possible. This combination also means that the Maker Knife is waterproof.\nSpecs:\nHeight closed: 108mm\nHeight open: 140mm (with blade)\nWidth: 33mm\nThickness: 7.7mm\nWeight: 65g (with blade)\nAbout the thickness of a modern smartphone\nThis makes the Maker Knife very natural to carry\nSo that you can take it with you everywhere you go\nThis resulted in a knife that got its beauty through function\nWe really do believe we made the best utility knife. It's everything we ever wanted a utility knife to be. We think you will feel the same.\nCeramic blades\nCeramic utility knife blades? Yeah, they are really cool! Ceramic is really, really good at keeping an edge. You can cut foam, cardboard, leather, fabric and such and it will probably never go dull. It's fantastic for RC scratch builders, crafts, leather makers and many others.\nBut as always in life there are tradeoffs. Ceramic blades will chip when abused. Cutting very hard things like hard wood and such is not really its intended use. Use cheap metal blades that you can pick up local to you for stuff like that.\n- Only available as part of the knife bundles during the Kickstarter-\nBlades will be available on MakerKnife.com after the Kickstarter has ended. \n The Diresta Maker Knife\nJimmy Diresta decided to launch a Diresta version of the Maker Knife with a custom brass top plate that he'll customize himself with his brand. The Diresta brass plate comes as an addition to the normal top plate in the color of your choice.\nDiresta Maker Knife with Black Base\nThe Diresta Brass plate comes as an addition to the standard plate.\nHelp promoting this campaign by:\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox Partner Program\nPress Relations PressWisdom\n The Team\nTwo like-minded makers.

We need to make several molds and they can be quite expensive. It only makes sense to have them made if there is enough volume of parts being produced. That is why we are here on kickstarter!

Makers unite to make a tool!\n\nThis is our first kickstarter project and it's going to be a excellent learning experience for us.\nHowever it is not our first time doing product development and fulfilment.

We will try our utmost to deliver on time, but if we do run into any problems we will try to be as transparent as we can and communicate this to you here on kickstarter.\n\nThank you very much for supporting us in this endeavour.

Tarot; French cartomancy; transformation deck; analytical psychology; art; surrealism; symbolism; fingerprints; vintage prints; and illustrations (to name only a few.) \nWhy is this deck unique? Each card tells a story. The whole deck paints the landscape of our lives with vintage engravings and prints\u2014the ideal synergy between significance and design in a pack of cards. There is nothing like it out there\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it! \nCartomancy, divination? Yes, of course! The Catomancer Poker Deck uses the existing structure of a standard deck of cards as a canvas for a new insightful cartomancy system. ALL the cards feature universal archetypes and symbols making it a very instinctive tool for divination. But if you're not into this, you will still enjoy the deck for its beauty and uniqueness.\nMy dream will come true! When funded, each deck will be printed with the highest quality by the United States Playing Card Company. For me, the creation of this deck is THE quest to create playing cards I could see only in my dreams.\n_____________________________\nIMPORTANT: If you are from the United States, please select the rewards named \u201cUSA Shipping rate\u201d or \u201cUSA\u201d in order to get the proper price for your reward.\nDiamond: Sensation, perception with our senses, childhood and earth. \nSpade: Thinking, becoming part of society, early adulthood and air. \nHeart: Intuition, abundance and fertility, midlife and water. \nClub:  Feeling, knowing without reasoning, late adulthood and fire.\nAs a tribute to the people who have gotten their hands dirty with ink creating the engravings featured in the deck, I have made the suit symbols with fingerprints. As a result, no suit symbol is ever repeated on the same card. For instance, the 10 of Diamonds has 10 different fingerprints!\nThe timeworn paper background of the front of each card is a section of a larger paper so that the background of each card is different (no annoying repeated markings anywhere.) Of course the backs are uniform for obvious reasons.\nThe meaning of each card is printed in the margin of the card in both English and French as a tribute to French Cartomancie.\nThe deck contains hundreds of engravings, sometimes as many as five different designs in the same card. There is always something new to discover every time you look at them.\nRed Joker Unconsciousness: our deepest level of consciousness, a pool of desires, dreams, spirituality and emotions. \nBlack Joker Consciousness: our individual awareness of the world: sensation, thinking, intuition and feeling. \nThe ornaments on the tuck box and on the back of the cards are old foundry ornaments used in early printing.\nI want to include with each deck a companion book. It will be a 32 page booklet the size of the box, containing an introduction to the deck, keyword meanings for each card, and ideas for divination. To produce the booklet and include it with each deck we need to reach the STRETCH GOAL of $16,500.\nUncut sheet\nYou can really appreciate the collection of images and the color scheme for each suit on the Cartomancer Poker Deck\u2019s uncut sheet.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have spent many months working on every detail of this project to ensure that the production and shipping will be efficient and without issues. It's mainly for that reason that I have chosen not to include add-on items that could slow down the production of the deck itself.\n\nThe cards are designed and ready for production as soon as funded.

Last year we brought the KOSMOS Pen to life with your help. By now we shipped over 3000 pens around the world. Many of you have been waiting for a Titanium Version and after months of refinement we are finally able to present: the KOSMOS Titan.   \nWith your support we will be able to realize the production run of this ultimate Titanium Version of KOSMOS in two beautiful surface finishes. \nJust shift the Cap! - The magnetic forces inside KOSMOS are perfectly balanced. A strong Neodymium magnet holds the cap safely in the idle and writing position.\nFun to Play! - The simplest and most intuitive way to get a pen ready for writing: our new mechanism makes it possible.\nDesigned by Nature - The minimalistic design of KOSMOS is based on a universal pattern of nature: the Golden Ratio.\nThe best Material for a Lifetime Product - each part of KOSMOS is lathed from a solid block of highly durable Grade-5 Titanium.\nThe KOSMOS Titan is precision-machined out of solid Grade-5 Titanium. This remarkable material combines highest durability with exceptional light weight. We worked hard to achieve KOSMOS\u2019 ultra-high tolerances with Titanium. The effort paid off: the magnetic mechanism works more smoothly than ever which gives the pen a unique feel of quality.\nThe Titan comes in two distinct finishes: a mirror polished version and a matt version.\nThe KOSMOS Titan comes in a redesigned matt-laminated premium packaging in all black.\nThe Mirror-Polished Version of Titan runs through multiple extensive polishing stages to make it shine like a mirror.\nThe Matt Version of Titan has a nice satin feel of the surface and is especially resistant against scratches.\nThe classic version of KOSMOS is precision-machined from solid Grade-6 Aluminium. It comes with a matt surface finish, which runs through a special anodisation process. This makes the pen very resistant against scratches and wear.\nFor this new Kickstarter campaign, we improved the functionality of the classic Aluminium KOSMOS entirely. This 2.0 version of our original pen is not available anywhere else yet. Same as the KOSMOS Titan it comes with refined tolerances and a even smoother mechanism.\nYou can choose from 3 reward tiers: the KOSMOS Titan in a single pack, the KOSMOS Titan in a 2-pack and the classic KOSMOS Aluminium. \nIf you\u2019d like to receive multiple rewards, simply add the respective amount to your pledge:\n\u20ac89 KOSMOS Titan\n\u20ac169 KOSMOS Titan 2-pack\n\u20ac45 KOSMOS Aluminium\nYou will select the color you'd like to get in a Backerkit survey after the campaign.\nThe stilform Accessories will be available in the Backerkit Survey after the campaign.\nTo make your KOSMOS Pen truly the perfect everyday carry, we created a Leather Pouch that protects and holds it safely while you're on the go.\nThe Walnut Holder is the perfect place to keep your KOSMOS and present its design even better \u2013 wherever it may be: whether on your desk at work or at home in your living room.\n   Specifications:\nKOSMOS Titan Material: Grade-5 Titanium, Weight: 42\nKOSMOS Classic Material: Grade-6 Aluminium, Weight: 26 g\nBlack Premium Cartridge with German Ink and Swiss Tungsten Tip included, Size M\nCompatible with all G2 Standard Refills (Parker-Style Refills)\nGift Box Packaging\nWe have been working together with our trusted manufacturer for a long time. The production of the KOSMOS Titan is all set up and we have already produced a small batch of the polished version. In the process we gained valuable experience and resolved the production challenges of the Titanium material. So now we can make sure the production of all Kickstarter rewards runs as smoothly as possible.\nTo speed up the production process we arranged special condition with our manufacturer: We will order the raw material and start first lathing operations even before the campaign has ended. So you will receive your highly anticipated KOSMOS Titan as early as possible.\nThe final quality control of the pens will be done by ourselves personally. Afterwards a professional fulfillment partner will take care of the shipping of packages to your homes.\nSometimes the simplest things are the most profound. Attention to detail is of utmost importance when you want to look good.\nDesign and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter. Follow us on our journey! - stilform \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risks and challenges are as follows:\n\nProduction delays: \nWe are working with extremely experienced machining and finishing suppliers that are used to handling quantities well over the amount that are typical for Kickstarter which means that there is little risk of a production bottleneck. Though it is unlikely, delays can still happen as machinery can break down, raw materials can arrive late etc. which can create unanticipated setbacks. If this highly unlikely scenario takes place, frequent communication and transparency with our backers is our top priority.\n\nPens are popular on Kickstarter so our funding goal could be exceeded significantly.

It was discovered in 1929 by German sculptor, inventor and mathematician Paul Schatz.\n From art to toy, from math to joy...\nA desktop sculpture that brings art, science, beauty and technology together in a single piece of solid metal. Perfect for thinkers, makers, visionaries, learners, teachers, and even for children.\nIts hypnotic motion and flawless-smooth texture make it a great tool for stress-relief and concentration. A unique object that unleashes creative thinking and mindfulness.\nUNLOCKED AT $1,000,000\nThe Black Oxide Oloid.\n  The oloid is a striking, elegant piece that looks beautiful in your desk. Its fascinating shape is the perfect conversation starter.\n What is so special about the oloid?\nAlthough its shape is curved, it moves in a perfect straight line. \nAlthough its shape is not round, it rolls. \nIt has sharp edges, but its motion is gentle and smooth. \nWhile it rolls, every single point of its surface touches the ground.\nIts surface area is identical to a sphere of the same radius.\nIt's surface is developable, meaning it can constructed from a flat sheet.\nIt has incredible functional properties; the oloid shape can be used for water treatment, as a propeller in navigation, or as stirrer in biotechnology.\n  Made from liquid metal\nWe use a precision casting method to ensure every piece has the mathematical perfection of the oloid.\nFirst, we create perfect wax oloids out of a precisely machined aluminum mold. These wax shapes are used for the casting process.\nThe wax shapes are dipped in different ceramic materials and melted in a furnace at 500\u00ba C. Then, molten metal is poured into the ceramic molds, which need to get destroyed afterwards to reveal the metal pieces.\nThe mysterious shape\nIf the distance of two centers of disk is equal to the radius, then the convex hull produces another figure that rolls smoothly and is known as the oloid. (Schatz 1975).\nDue to his art studies and his discussion of questions relating to space and the zodiac, Paul Schatz discovered in 1929 that the Platonic solids could be inverted. In particular the Invertible Cube, elaborated in accordance with the respective laws, and its specific, rhythmic mobility were to become the basis upon which Paul Schatz was to build his Oloid.\nThe surface of the oloid is a developable surface, meaning that patches of the surface can be flattened into a plane. While rolling, it develops its entire surface: every point of the surface of the oloid touches the plane on which it is rolling, at some point during the rolling movement. \nUnlike most axial symmetric objects (cylinder, sphere etc.), while rolling on a flat surface, its center of mass performs a meander motion rather than a linear one. In each rolling cycle, the distance between the oloid's center of mass and the rolling surface has two minima and two maxima.\nRewards\n*To order multiple Oloids, just select the reward you want and increase the reward amount by multiplying the reward cost by the number of Oloids you want.  \nSpecs\n   Reward Upgrades and Add-Ons Guide\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge MX$ 440 or more", "title": "Early Bird Oloid!", "descp": "You can choose either brushed or polished finish.

There is always inherent risk when bringing new products to market. Production delays can occur, and we are first to admit that we have definitely experienced them before. This is our second Kickstarter campaign, and the experience we gained 3 years ago (and the journey since) has been invaluable for the planning of this campaign. We are now well versed in the production process, and have taken all steps to ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible. \n\nBut we don't like over-promising something - so here's a few potential risk areas, and how we have mitigated them. \n\n- Bottle production - quality. In our first campaign we hit a number of roadblocks - learning how to produce flat bottles with an offset neck, whilst maintaining good clarity and quality. There were months of back and forth with samples before we finally arrived at the final product. This time, we have done this grunt work in the lead up to this campaign, and have strong existing manufacturer relationships in place. \n\n- Soft good production - Manufacturing soft goods also has it's challenges. Maintaining a consistent quality of leather, fitment and stitching requires serious expertise. We've teamed up with Melbourne fashion label Kinnon to ensure that quality of the leather sleeves is top notch.\n\n- Shipping and logistics - setting up a logistics system to effectively and efficiently ship to backers all over the world is not easy - and is a hugely time consuming process.

It\u2019s been perfected to ensure a long lasting and stable bass performance.\n  Does a tiny speaker mean weaker sound? No. With 20-watt amplifiers (two pieces of 10-watt amplifiers) processing audio output, the Poison sounds more vast than other speakers of similar size.\nWe\u2019ve engineered renowned Waves\u00ae MaxxAudio Acoustic Solution that\u2019s built into the speaker, so it can produce richer and full-bodied sounding content. The algorithms of sound perception(including noise and music) create a perceived low bass and compensate for the acoustic limitations of tiny devices. Waves received a Technical GRAMMY\u00ae Award in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the recording industry.\nWith a 2000mAh built-in rechargeable battery, Poison can play up to six hours of CD quality music wireless and portable. If you prefer to connect in another way, the Poison also lets you connect via the aux cable.\n    Like a fine wine that became even more valuable with age. With a physical rotating dial for channel scanning, the Poison will bring back nostalgic memories of the good ol\u2019 days of radio channel surfing.\nCredit to @superphenblog\n     Check out iDB\u2019s review about the Poison here\n      Design iteration\n  Aging test and button life cycle test\nA little change for a better experience\nIn order to have the Poison more durable that last for years and lower defective rates in production, we\u2019ve decided to engrave functional symbols on the device\u2019s buttons instead of the original silk printing.\nWe understand you may love the previous design. But after we tested three prototypes in the past few weeks, we think the latest version offers the best user experience.\n  When you combine love and free, you get lofree. We all come from a designer's background - as reflected in our product. We dedicate ourselves to keep the most sophisticated product simple and elegant, in order to benefit and reach more people. We push boundaries in product design and have won several Red Dot and iF design awards. We love the way of life.

The Bona Fide Pen is a writing instrument designed for people that appreciate the quality and durability of machined pens and enjoy using them. The ergonomic design of the Bona Fide Pen combined with it's sturdy construction makes this pen an excellent choice as your every day pen. I hope this pen becomes part of your every day carry gear.\nThe Bona Fide Machined Pen - Silver Anodized\nI enjoy using a quality fountain pen at my desk. I wanted a pen that had the feel and classic styling of the pens I was already using, but also had the durability and strength to withstand the abuses of being used everyday, outdoors and in the field. I wanted a pen that was quick to deploy and return to my pocket with one hand. For this reason, the Bona Fide Pen needed to be a retractable pen. I also wanted a pen that used refills that could meet the diverse needs of the user and were readily available. Like the name Bona Fide suggests, this pen had to be genuine, reliable and built to earn your trust. It's Bona Fide!  \nMaterials\nBecause I wanted a sturdy pen, it had to be made entirely of metal without the use of any plastic. I experimented with stainless steel, aluminum, brass, copper and even titanium. The steel, brass and copper make beautiful pens but the weight of those metals proved to be too heavy for prolonged use.\nI finally decided on 6061 aluminum that had the best combination of machinability, strength, corrosion resistance and cost. 6061 aluminum will also accept a durable protective anodized finish that will keep the pen looking great even after years of use.\nDesign\nHere is the criteria I used while designing this pen: \nAppealing classic style\nErgonomic pen geometry\nQuality materials and construction\nPrecision fit and feel\nComfortable to hold and use\nDependable retracting mechanism\nA good variety of popular refill options\nGood price/value ratio\nThe starting point for the design of this pen was with the grip section. I like the way traditional fountain pens taper in towards the tip and then flare out again. This shape provides your fingers with a comfortable position properly spaced from the tip for writing and drawing. It also prevents your fingers from sliding down. Pens with sharp grooves or knurling can be irritating after prolonged use.\nThe undercut concave tip is inspired by the traditional nib shape found on fountain pens and adds style, strength and a clear view of where the tip meets the paper.\nThe Bona Fide pen is made with two slightly different designs machined into the barrel portion. The 'pinstripe' design has seven thin lines spaced 45 degrees apart along the barrel. The 'stars & stripes' design has the same lines as the 'pinstripe' style with the addition of eight evenly spaced stars, one above each of the seven pinstripes and one above the pocket clip.\nTop: Pinstripes - Bottom: Stars & Stripes\n  The two piece body of the pen is built strong with robust M10 threads and an extended shoulder to ensure smooth, positive alignment where the pen barrel and grip section meet. I chose the M10 x 1.0 thread because it has a pitch diameter that perfectly splits the distance between the inner wall and the outside of the pen. This provides the greatest overall strength where these parts connect.\n   M10 Threads\n  Fully Disassembled\n   We looked at a number of retracting mechanisms with the goal of finding one that was precision made and extremely durable. I consulted with Jack Roman (a great guy by the way) of Tuff Writer MFG who has agreed to supply us with his superior retracting mechanism. This American made Tuff Writer mechanism surpasses all others in quality and reliability and features an improved raceway and 416 stainless steel construction.\nPhoto courtesy of Tuff Writer MFG.\nThe spring is custom made in the USA to our specifications from 316 stainless steel.\nThe Clip\nRecessed Clip Attachment\nThe pocket clip on the Bona Fide Pen is made from 301 spring stainless steel and was specifically designed for this pen. The clip is laser cut and brake formed right here in Southern Oregon. The clip is then deburred and hand finished. Finally the clip is rigidly mounted to the pen in a close tolerance precision cut recess with two #2-56 stainless steel screws. Having the clip in a recess prevents the clip from moving and getting loose. 301 spring stainless steel resists corrosion and maintains its shape and spring retention. The clip has a slight pre-load tension and will be secure in your shirt or pants pocket or in your notebook.  \nMachining\nThe Bona Fide Pen design required a machine that can produce small, complex precision parts. I worked with Jay MacDonald of Precision CNC Products, also here in Grants Pass, Oregon, and chose the Star CNC Swiss-type Automatic Lathe to manufacture the pen.\nWe were able to make the pen barrel and grip section with all the design features I wanted while maintaining precise tolerances and a beautiful machined finish that was ready for anodizing.  \nFinishing \nThe pen barrel and grip section are then inspected for fit and finish. After the machined aluminum parts are inspected they are anodized to give the pen a resilient finish that will keep the pen looking great and performing perfectly. Anodizing is an electro-chemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion resistant, aluminum oxide finish. We anodize in silver, black, blue and gold.\nBallpoint Refills \nWhen deciding on which refill the Bona Fide Pen would be designed to use, my first candidate was the pressurized refill made by the Fisher Pen Co. The Fisher Space Pen refill is a popular choice because of it's ability to write upside down and write on slick surfaces. It is a great choice for people who work and write outdoors.\nRealizing that users of this pen will have different preferences, I wanted to be sure this pen could accept a wider variety of refills that met different needs. I eventually modified the pen design to accept refills that conform to an industry standard, the Parker DIN ISO 12757 specification. The Fisher Space Pen refill also works perfectly in this pen when used with the Parker adapter that comes with the Fisher refill.\nWhile reviewing the many refills available I came across the Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 refill. This highly rated ballpoint refill makes a smooth and solid line much like a rollerball. The Bona Fide pens will be delivered with two Schmidt easy FLOW 9000 refills, one black and one blue.\n Balance\nWe had a question about the pen balance. Here is a photo to show the balance point of the pen by itself. The pen has a neutral balance feel in average sized hands. I have large hands and when writing I find the pen rests slightly on my fingertips if I release my grip.\nPen Balance\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI feel this project has a very low risk for it's supporters.

We love to let our imaginations run wild with ways to use these resins in fun and functional ways. Creating the FireFly zipper pull was an idea that bounced around for a while in our minds. When we finally made prototypes and went on our first camping trip with them we were amazed at just how much everyone loved them and how functional they really were. We hope this product finds a place at campsites around the world and brings help and joy to all who use them.  \nMeet FireFly!\n        We ultimately wanted the FireFly to be a simple product for adults and children alike. It had to be durable enough for an adult to put wear and tear on it and easy enough for a child to throw it on and off a zipper.  \nAfter sampling all sorts of clasps and enclosures for attaching the glow resin bead and connecting to zippers and other object, we settled on paracord.\nParacord is a lightweight nylon kernmantle rope originally used in the suspension lines of parachutes. This cord is useful for many other tasks and is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during the 82nd Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. \nThe glowing bead on the firefly is a high grade high density glow powder infused Epoxy Resin bead. The way we produce the epoxy eliminates voids in the resin and is infused with an extremely high density of photo-luminescent powder so the glow is more vibrant and longer lasting than standard glow materials available on the market.\n                                           PARACORD COLOR OPTIONS:\n GLOW BEAD COLOR OPTIONS:\n        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with most projects like this, the main challenge is managing fulfillment.

I\u2019m a Los Angeles-based writer and director of online shorts (like Old/New, Real Gone and Plot Device) and branded content for clients like Bad Robot and Red Giant. I created the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool for writers like me.\nOoh Aah, That's How It Always Starts\nIn my experience, I've found that the second best part of writing is the beginning (the first best is finishing), when inspiration strikes and it feels like someone is beaming the story to your brain from an alternate dimension.\nYou're not so much making it up as transcribing it, relaying it. Your ideas at this point are like tribbles, growing and growing off of each other.\n...Until they're not.\nThe transmission eventually stops, and you're left with a pile of disjointed and half-baked ideas. And now it's up to you to turn them into a story.\nNow just turn this mess into a story. No bigs.\nCut to: the Storyclock Notebook.\nPicture Your Story Like a Clock\nThe Storyclock Notebook utilizes the simple method of visualizing your story like a clock.\nSeeing your story this way can quickly give you a bird's eye view of it, and reveal where your gaps are.\nThere's a gap.\nAnd rather than filling these gaps by making stuff up and dropping in ideas from the outside, you can extract ideas from what you already have -- using symmetry.\nWhat\u2019s happening on the opposite sides of the clock? Anything you can set up or pay off?\nIt's a simple and effective exercise to fill the gaps in your story with relevant and meaningful material, born from what you already have.\nThis doesn't mean Lawrence Kasdan wrote Raiders with a story clock, but it demonstrates that good stories have a \"rhythm and rhyme.\"\nA Research + Development Tool\nThink of the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool. The first half of the book is devoted to studying and analyzing existing stories, with the second half devoted to developing your own. \nThis is a Development page. The left is where you dump your brain, and the right is an empty clock to start laying out your ideas in a narrative structure, and start filling out your story.\n   This is a Research page. Sometimes it helps to rip off-- er-- STUDY the choices of other writers, so we've devoted the first half of the book for clocking existing stories.\n Purpose-Built for All Kinds of Stories\nWe designed the Storyclock Notebook for screenwriters, but it works for other storytelling mediums, too!\nIt's not just for screenwriters!\nBuilt-in Resources\nOn the inside covers we\u2019ve put a bunch of storytelling resources to serve you in your quest.\nNerd stuff!\n  A general story structure guide and list of archetypes inspired by much smarter people like Joseph Campbell, Blake Snyder, and basically everyone at Pixar.\n  A page/time converter that comes in handy far more often than you'd expect.\nThe Design\nThe Storyclock Notebook was designed to be both practical and creatively inspiring, a tool for perspiration and inspiration. Something that makes you WANT a reason to use it. For this we ended up leaning on old industrial handbooks and research logs to find the look and feel.\nThe touch... the feel... of industry!\nThere are 12 Research Logs and 12 Development Logs, a couple pages in the back for miscellaneous notes, and a table of contents page in the front for easy referencing and filing of your endless ideas and research.\nPrinting the Notebooks\nGuten Co. letterpresses all of our covers in San Antonio, TX, where the Earth's gravitational pull is optimal for letterpressing journal covers.\nOur friends at Guten Co. will be letterpressing the covers of the notebooks at their studio in San Antonio, TX.\nGuten Co. was indispensable in the development of the Storyclock Notebook, helping us source materials and finish proofs so we could field test it and get as close to the finished product as possible before revealing it to the world.\nIf you\u2019re looking to letterpress anything (i.e. business cards, invitations, posters that say WANTED in huge letters) or want some sweet handmade ceramic goods (seriously, come on), check out Guten Co!\nBecause the binding process is tedious to do by hand, we will print the interiors and bind the notebooks together at a larger company in Nashville, TN, where we will also pack + ship them out to our backers.\nSpecs\n5.5x7\u201d Finished Trim Size; 52 Pages\nCover: Neenah Environment \u201cWeathered\u201d 110# Cover\nInterior Pages: 80# Cougar Text - Natural\nWho's Responsible?\nThe Storyclock Notebook was created by me (Seth Worley), designed by Micah Lanier, and produced by Anne Fogerty.\nTeamwork!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nJust gimme it.\nWell firstly, I really want this notebook. We\u2019ve had a small number of proofs printed over the course of developing this, and I\u2019ve ended up using it to write 2 feature-length screenplays, a tv pilot, 3 inspirational talks, 2 company presentations, and a wedding toast. Oh and a Kickstarter video.\nMaybe? Maybe?\nI feel like other people could benefit from this as much as I have, and Kickstarter is a great way to find out how right or wrong I am about that. After being involved in other friends\u2019 campaigns and backing several projects over the years, I\u2019ve been able to see and experience firsthand the unique benefits Kickstarter has over traditional development routes - the biggest being YOU. By releasing the storyclock notebook on Kickstarter, I\u2019m able to get your feedback and input before we ever print it, ensuring that by the time it makes it to your hand, it\u2019ll be the best possible version of itself.\nExtra Extras!\nAlong with the notebook, we'll be offering extra awesome tools and resources in higher tiers to help you on your story quest, including:\nVideo Tutorial - A short video from Seth to help you make the most of the notebook.\nWriting 101 Pack ($55 Value) - 11 videos from Seth walking through the basics of story structure, character, theme, and a comprehensive walk-through of outlining a story in the form of a clock.\nWriting 201 Pack ($60 Value, Pre-Release) - The highly-anticipated sequel to the Writing 101 pack, not-yet-released!\nSkype with Seth (Pricelesssss) - Get 30 minutes of Seth's time to talk about whatever you want.*\n*Mostly to talk about stories. Keep it PG (maybe PG-13 because Seth acts like a 13-year-old [not really (ok yeah kind of really)]).\nWhat Do I Get?\nWe've got several reward tiers to cater to your personal (notebook-related) desires:\nWhere is my money going?\nSince we\u2019ve already done most of the development of this notebook (believe it or not we\u2019ve been working on it for two years), your contribution will go towards:\nNotebooks - letter-pressing the covers in Texas, printing the interiors in Nashville, and binding the books in Nashville as well (because these are physical goods, every notebook purchased adds extra cost).\nReimbursement for Development Costs - We\u2019ve already spent money to get this off the ground (illustration costs, fonts, proofs, etc) and so this will help pay people for the work they\u2019ve done.\nFees - Kickstarter is awesome and because it costs money for them to operate we\u2019ll owe them some money. And also credit card fees. We factored all of this into our goal amount.\nWe chose $12,500 because we think that number will help us at least hit breakeven on the cost to produce these notebooks. If we bring in \u201cextra\u201d money - which depends on how many backers we have for each tier, we hope to include some fun surprise flavor for you when you receive your notebooks.\nWhere you at?\nYou can follow us on Instagram at @StoryclockNotebook, or follow me on Twitter at @awakeland3d.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent a couple of years developing this notebook, and we're super excited to be sending it out into the world.

We\u2019d like your help to finish our next documentary - Hanzi, a documentary exploring international design, visual culture and identity through the lens of modern Chinese typography.\nChinese is one of the oldest and most used languages in the world, yet it is perceived as difficult to learn. Furthermore, there has been a lack of discussion on Chinese typography and its transition into the digital era compared to its western counterparts. Recently there has been a renaissance and reviewing of Chinese characters in Asia and internationally, with typography and lettering books often topping the best selling books, and more and more typographical courses and workshops being held in the cities. We think that\u2019s worth exploring to the discussion of design and cultural identity. \nCollaborating with filmmakers from New York, Hong Kong, London and Taipei, Hanzi includes interviews from ShaoLan, founder and creator of Chineasy in London; Akira Kobayashi, a Japanese renowned Roman font designer; Sammy Or, a veteran Chinese font designer based in Hong Kong; also Ri Xing Type Foundry, the last traditional Chinese letterpress type foundry in the world and more, gathering some of the most important figures and insight in the current Chinese education and typography field. \nThis film is not just about Chinese characters, we wanted to keep the ideas and messages applicable to all languages and cultures. Exploring universal subjects such as \"How does language shape identity? What role does handwriting play in the digital age?\u201d, Hanzi encourages audiences around the world to revisit and rethink their own culture, language and identity.\n(Please see the press links at the bottom.)\nAbout the team:\nSince 2012, we have been extremely lucky to work on two documentaries that have created impact globally, Design & Thinking and Maker. Both films were crowdfunded on Kickstarter, distributed independently, and have gone to screen at schools and organizations all around the world, including Google, Twitter and Harvard University.\nOur audiences have shared with us how much the films meant to them, like a designer finally being able to explain her job to her parents, or a teacher telling us how the films have bought inspiration to her students. Thus, after two innovation themed documentaries, we felt like it was time to turn the lens towards our own culture and explore what perspective we could offer to the world.\nBased in Asia and also constantly aware of what's happening around the world, we set out to make a film that's not just about Chinese typography. With our multicultural background, we\u2019re grateful to have these interviewees coming from diverse fields and countries, to help us put together a broad view of what a language can present. \nThrough making this film, we\u2019ve gained a new perspective towards our own language and identity, and we hope audiences of any cultural background can have as much insight and reflection towards their own language and culture as we have.\nDirector: Mu-Ming Tsai\nProducers: Mu-Ming Tsai, Iris Lai\nEditors: Iris Lai, Emily Hsiang\nAdvisor: Yu Hsiu Yang\nHow can you help? \nBy working with filmmakers around the world, we\u2019ve finished shooting in New York, Hong Kong, London and Taipei, gathering a wealth of informative interviews and interesting footage, and we\u2019ve been editing these materials since then to tell an insightful story.\nCurrently we\u2019re in the final phase of post-production, polishing the film with color correction, sound mixing and graphic design. Then we will need to move into the distribution phase where film festival submissions, promotion and marketing expenses will also require a significant amount of funds.\nYour support will help cover these expenses and increase the production value of the final product; ultimately assisting in spreading the important insights of language, culture and identity to a larger audience.\nHow can we thank you?\nNotes on $200 pledge: \nWe\u2019re very excited to present this unique type stamp set to our backers!

It's almost totally unknown that Britain once had the beginnings of such a Netherlands-inspired network, and with your help we could rediscover it and, in some cases, literally dig it up. This Kickstarter project could result in the (re)creation of many miles of protected cycleways \u2013 and as a backer you'll be along for the ride.\nUPDATE: We may have reached our Kickstarter target but that's not the end. In fact, it's just the beginning. Reaching the initial target will enable us to research and perhaps revive a number of cycleways but by no means all of them. Every single pledge, no matter how small, is important (the number of pledges could play an important later role when we start seeking the institutional funding required for national-scale cycleway improvements). If you haven't got the financial means to back this project right now please share it widely. \nIn the 1930s, Britain's Ministry of Transport commissioned the building of 500-miles of protected cycleways. Between 1934 and 1940 more than 300 miles of these innovative cycleways were actually built, usually both sides of the new \"arterial roads\" springing up all over the country.\n(The video says it was 280 miles \u2013 but, thanks to the publicity generated by this project, more mileage has come to light.)\nSome of these cycleways still exist, but they are not today understood to be cycle infrastructure: they should be rededicated. Others are buried under a couple of inches of soil: they could be excavated. \nWe are seeking your support to make all of this happen. Cash is needed to carry out further research and then work out how the historic cycleways can be meshed into modern networks. \nWith your help we'll be able to demonstrate that the space for cycling is there, and in many cases it has been there for a long time!\nThose who back this project will be supporting something of potentially national importance, and will gain behind-the-scenes access to our work as it progresses. You will receive timely backer-only reports that won't be published anywhere else. Whether you're interested in the historical side of the project, or the modern, practical side backers will receive regular updates and will be the first to be told of what could be important and, in some cases, genuinely ground-breaking developments.\nTake a look at the backer options on the right. You could buy us a cup of coffee to keep our spirits up or go the whole hog and get us to give you an up close and personal presentation to your club, company or organisation. We'll also be taking some backers on a guided cycle tour of one or more of these innovative-for-the-time cycleways.\n\"... if Britain managed to find money to produce state of the art bike lanes during the Great Depression, it can definitely do so again.\" \nFeargus O'Sullivan, CityLab.\n+++\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThanks to amazing support our campaign hit its target three days after launching! This doesn't mean the campaign ends, the more funding we get the more cycleways we can research and rescue. \nIf we reach \u00a310,000 we'll add Kickstarter Live functionality for all levels above Pizza Levels where either or both Carlton and John will host backer-only interactive video sessions. REACHED!\nIf the pledges exceed \u00a312,000 all levels above Pizza Level will get access to the premium level of a new podcast, CyclingHistory.Today. The site has been registered (thanks to @CyclistStaffs for the prompt) and a website will be connected to that URL soon. The podcast will feature cycling history from 1817 onwards. (Naturally, there will be plenty of content from the period connected with this Kickstarter campaign.) REACHED!\nWe are now beyond \u00a312,000 but are all out of ideas on stretch goals (the best suggested to us so far \u2013 and by @tynetom \u2013 was a night out in Whitley Bay). We'll think about it.\n+++\nWHO'S \"WE\"?\nWe are author and editor Carlton Reid (the project's historian) and Urban Movement's John Dales (the project's urban planner, and with a team behind him).\nDrone-eye view of the Neville's Cross 1930s cycleway, both sides of the Great North Road\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nBetween 1937 and 1940 the Ministry of Transport only gave grants to local authorities for arterial road schemes if they included 9-ft-wide cycleways both sides of the road, writes Carlton Reid. Some of these cycleways still exist (but are believed, wrongly, to be \u201cservice roads\u201d); others have been grassed over (but their concrete surfaces probably remain). Many are not marked on maps as cycleways (or considered to be such by local authorities.) \nThat Britain once had a great number of protected cycleways is now almost totally unknown. I started researching these Dutch-inspired cycleways for my forthcoming book Bike Boom (Island Press, June 2017) and when I started to dig deeper (sometimes literally) I came to realise there were far more of these 1930s cycleways than I, or anybody else, knew existed. By poring through ministerial minutes I discovered that, amazingly, the Ministry of Transport was working to plans submitted by its Dutch equivalent: Go Dutch, 1930s-style.\nBike Boom is out in June and has some info on the 1930s cycleways\n  Kerb-protected cycle tracks on both sides of Chester Road in Birmingham, 1946. (Click on the pic for same cycle tracks today.)\n    To date, I have identified more than 90 separate protected cycleway schemes around Britain, some of which can be found on this map. But I believe there are more to be found.\nThese innovative, concrete cycleways \u2013 many with granite kerbing \u2013 went out of use so rapidly that they were forgotten about soon after being built. A few were later grubbed up to make extra room for cars, but plenty can still be seen today \u2013 if you know what to look for. \nBy using long-neglected plans and maps I've been able to trace many of the buried ones; some appear to be tantalisingly close to the surface. \nIt's important to map, record and then rescue these cycleways. Many have lasted this long only out of sheer luck, and need to be \"listed\" so that they can't be destroyed in the future to, say, widen roads for motor traffic.\nSlivers of the buried long-distance concrete cycleway on the Thanet Way can be glimpsed via Google Street View\nThis is partly a historical \u2013 and even an archeological \u2013 Kickstarter but, as my project partner John Dales says in the video above, it's also highly relevant today because the space for cycling that many planners and politicians say isn't there is there! \nWe are combining to form a small team that will research and evaluate the schemes found to date, and then approach local and national authorities with plans for meshing the 1930s cycleways with their modern equivalents. Once the campaign has ended we can immediately start work on researching and evaluating some of the schemes identified so far. The more money we raise the more cycleways we will be able to research. We shall use this research \u2013 and the modern urban planning work \u2013 to push for grants and other monies to enable rescue work to take place.\n  GO DUTCH? \nIn 1934, the Ministry of Transport consulted with its Dutch equivalent before starting work on its cycleway programme. The MoT\u2019s chief engineer was provided with cycleway plans and advice by the director of the Rijkswaterstaat. \nMost of the 1930s cycleways were built alongside new arterial roads and bypasses. However, some were built in residential areas, such as the separated cycleway in Manchester seen at the top of this page. This cycleway still exists but, today, not all of it is marked or used as a cycleway \u2013 motorists park their cars on it, assuming it's a private road built for such use. The challenge is to find and research the history of this cycleway, and the 70 or so others, then link them into today\u2019s networks.\n1930s cycleway on the Mickleham Bypass (it's still there but much narrowed).\nIt\u2019s reasonably well known \u2013 in certain cycle advocacy circles at least \u2013 that there was a 2-mile protected cycleway on Western Avenue in London, opened by transport minister Leslie Hore-Belisha in 1934 (I wrote about it in Roads Were Not Built for Cars). What\u2019s very much not known is that this was just the first scheme, and that the Ministry of Transport majority paid-for at least 70 other schemes across the country, many of them kerb-protected and separated from carriageways. \nAfter 1949, cycle use in the UK dropped dramatically and less use was made of the innovative-for-the-time cycleways.\nIn time, it was forgotten that there had once been these many cycle infrastructure schemes around the UK. This project aims to bring many of them back to life both by rededication and by demonstrating how they can be linked in to wider networks. A great deal of further archival research is required, especially in city, county and national archives. Period newspaper reports describe when the cycleways were given the go-ahead and when they were opened, but it will require more digging to find grant-aid documents, further maps and plans, and period photographs of the cycle tracks in use. \nMost of the 1930s cycleways (at the time they were called \"cycle tracks\") were, on average, four miles long, but the 9-ft and 6-ft cycle tracks on both sides of the Southend Arterial Road (which are not marked on modern maps) extended for more than 18 miles. \nIf we could bring back to life even half of the built cycleways that's perhaps 140+ miles of cycleway that we don't currently know about, or treasure. \nThis is an ambitious and potentially very practical project, but it cannot happen without your help. \nThank you.\nCarlton Reid & John Dales\nUPDATE (28th April): Just three days after launch, we hit our funding target. This was wonderful news and means that, at the end of the campaign, we can hit the ground cycling. However, after the euphoria wore off, it's important to stress that this is just the start \u2013 it doesn't mean every single one of of the 1930s cycleway schemes identified so far can be researched and rescued. \nThe campaign lasts until 25th May, and the more funding we can raise the more cycleways we can add to our \"to do\" list. \nPleasingly, thanks to the publicity that the campaign has generated so far, we have been contacted by individuals and local authorities with more possible 1930s cycleways. The 70+ schemes we initially identified is now comfortably into the 80s. That's amazing. \nIt will require some digging (at this stage, mostly metaphorical) to confirm these as genuine 1930s-era cycleways but, in all probability, there are even more to be found. And the more we find, the more chance that these forgotten cycleways might have once linked together and, with effort, could therefore be more easily meshed with modern networks. That is, once improved, especially at junctions and side roads. \nIn the fullness of time we'll be producing plans and recommendations that could help convince local authorities (and perhaps even the Department of Transport) to release some meaningful cash so that as many of these cycleways as possible can be brought back to life. \nYou wonderful backers helped us get to the first stage, there are many more to come.\n+++\nCARLTON REID is the Newcastle-based executive editor of BikeBiz.com, and author of Roads Were Not Built for Cars and Bike Boom (both of these books were successfully funded on Kickstarter, and later picked up by Island Press of Washington, DC.)\nJOHN DALES is a transport planner and traffic engineer, and director of Urban Movement of London (\"our job is making better streets\").

Whether we are designing a magazine that will be printed, or an app that's digital, it all has its start as a sketch on a piece of paper. It allows us for more freedom, it allows for quick edits, it allows a flow of ideas that is hard to get when you work digitally. \nAs the idea progresses it goes from quick sketches done in a few seconds to more precise designs, and finally into the digital realm. During this process we use rulers a lot to make precise measurements, draw lines, and to cut what needs to be cut. The problem for us is that we have several rulers all for different purposes all with different measurements to them. There's no singe unifying product that allows us to work for every design imaginable. A regular ruler often lacks picas, a measurement used for print, and there is no accessible ruler that has simulated pixel measurements for your digital designs.\nOur goal is to combine all of these things into one ruler, the ultimate ruler for designers. The one tool you need in order to design for both print and digital.\nA bridge between worlds.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes in two colors, Luxe Silver and Midnight Black\n  Our design allows for twice the measurements\n\nDesigned with you in mind\nThe Lindlund ruler has been made with design in mind. Whether it is for print, digital, or just for regular old cutting. We have included four different measurements that will help you create for any medium. As you would expect there's the ever-present centimeters and inches, an essential core that we could not do away with. It is a part of the ruler vernacular.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes with four measurements: centimeters, inches, picas, and pixels\nMade for today\nIn addition to this we have the picas and pixel measurements. The pica, a typographic unit, is used for just that: typography. When you are writing a document and you are using a 12pt font, that is one pica. By using this edge of the ruler you can instinctively translate the measurements you see on screen into a physical size. You can, already in your sketches, measure the size that you need the font to be, or you could establish your margins, columns, and gutters.\nThe Pica measurement helps you sketch and visualize typography\n\nPixel perfect\nThe pixel edge has a simulated 150ppi (pixels per inch) divided up into batches of 10 pixels. It also has measurements indicating the size of an iPhone and iPad screen. This allows you to draw the size of an iPhone and immediately see, to scale, how big your design is. Laying out all of the buttons, and other design elements quickly on paper before heading into the computer and refining it. With the Lindlund ruler you now know exactly the size of your sketch and all the elements in it.\nOur pixel measurements allows you to quickly sketch digital designs\nAll about the details\nThe ruler also hides more features. Such as a rubber coating on the back that prevents you from slipping. Never again will you cut something wrong because your ruler slipped. As an extra bonus from our four measurements is the easy 90 degree angles. By drawing one line and then simply aligning the rulers measurements with the previous line, you are guaranteed a perfect angle every time.\nWith the Lindlund ruler you can create perfect 90-degree angles every time\n\nBuilt to last  \nMade from airplane-grade aluminium and cut with maximum precision we have ensured that every ruler will measure perfectly. Since they are made out of high-grade materials they won\u2019t be easily destroyed from bends or cuts.\nLight yet highly durable\nA superior finish\nThe choice of material and color processing has been based on looks and feel. We wanted something will stand the test of time when it comes to visuals and feel. The choice fell on anodizing our aluminium core, which will help protect it in the long run as well as provide a superior look and feel. Our choice of color is Midnight Black and Luxe Silver.\nAnodized aluminum creates a perfect finish\nPrecision cut to fit most pens\nVarious prototypes lead us to our final design\nThe Perfect Companion\nOur goal has been to create the perfect companion for a creative. We wanted to include as many features as we could, as many measurements as we could, all while maintaining a sleek and great design. In the end we have decided on our four measurements: 12 inches, 30 centimeters, 72 picas, and 1800 pixels. All organized along the four edges of the Lindlund ruler.\nCompatible with Apple devices\nOur pixel edge is perfectly compatible with Apples major iOS devices: iPhone, iPhone plus and iPad. With specific measurements made out for their size, you can quickly sketch a screen and then draw every element on it with perfect precision. \nDrawn to scale, ready to develop further\nFeatures\nWe have spent a lot of time considering every detail of the Lindlund ruler. Everything from the colors to materials has been discussed and evaluated. Our unique design allows us to pack a lot more features in than a traditional ruler. Here are some of the highlights we want to show you.\nThe Lindlund ruler is a bridge between worlds. With our innovative measurements you can create for both digital and physical at the same time.\nWith our simple, yet effective, design we have created a ruler that incorporates four different measurements on one side. That way you are ready for anything.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes in two colors: Midnight Black and Luxe Silver. Our Midnight Black ruler was made especially for use in darker situations, while the Luxe Silver is a more traditional color to match your other tools. \nThe rubber backing keeps your ruler secure. You won't ruin work by having your Lindlund ruler slip.\nMade from airplane grade aluminum the Lindlund ruler is made to withstand a lot. It won't be ruined by a knife or break when lightly bent.\nOur rulers are made to be extremely light. In fact, you won't even notice its weight in your bag when you are carrying it with you.\nOur rulers are precision cut and measured to make sure that you can fully trust your Lindlund ruler.\nThe ultimate ruler for creative people\nOur Midnight Black was designed to work in dark environments\nRewards\nSupport us and get yourself the only ruler you'll need to bring on a daily basis. Once you have yours, why not get one for your friend or your studio? We have a reward that suits everyone.\nWho are Lindlund?       \nWe are Axel Lindmarker and Jens Marklund, two Swedish designers. We met in the fall of 2013 and immediately struck up a friendship. Since then we have collaborated on a lot of projects and won some awards. Our collaboration always seemed natural, so we haven't really seen any point in parting ways. Instead we have gotten closer, moved around to different places in the world, working on different projects. You could say we definitely are in this for the long haul.\nThe name Lindlund is derived from our surnames. We have simply removed the similar part (mark) and ended up with Lindlund, which coincidentally has an actual meaning. Lind is Swedish for the linden tree, also known as small-leaved lime. Lund on the other hand is a Swedish word for a grove. So together we form a grove of linden trees.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBacking a project on Kickstarter is always a risk and we immediately knew we wanted to minimize the risk for all of you. As of now we are in contact with experienced suppliers and manufacturing partners that will help us produce the Lindlund ruler on a larger scale. They are specialized in making this type of product and have decades of experience doing so. As such we don\u2019t anticipate any major problems along the way.\n\nThat being said there are always risks and challenges when you go into manufacturing. We are currently partnering with one manufacturer that can take on this challenge, but in order to make sure the product gets made we are looking for secondary manufacturers that can take over in case of a crisis.\n\nWhen the product has been made, we will receive it and proceed to ship it out to you\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 225 or more", "title": "The Lindlund Ruler", "descp": "One Lindlund ruler: Midnight Black or Luxe Silver!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["934 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 405 or more", "title": "Twin pack \u2014 2 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Two Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or one of each!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["341 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 585 or more", "title": "Small Studio level \u2014 3 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Three Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or mix to your choice!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 1,725 or more", "title": "Studio level \u201410 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Ten Lindlund rulers Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or mix to your choice!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 180 or more", "title": "The Lindlund Ruler", "descp": "EARLY BIRD!\nOne Lindlund ruler: Midnight Black or Luxe Silver!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 360 or more", "title": "Twin pack \u2014 2 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "EARLY BIRD!\nTwo Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or one of each!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "160 backers"]}], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 133, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/355497638/lindlund-the-ultimate-ruler-for-creative-people", "project_name": "Lindlund: A Bridge Between Worlds"}}, {"backer": "Mark Dwight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We are a group of scientists and engineers who for the past five years have been trying to create the perfect lab notebook\u2014the notebook we always wanted with us in the lab. After years of producing and refining, we are ready to introduce our new dot grid lab notebook! A notebook that was built around years of field testing and feedback from you, our users. \nYour support can help make these notebooks a reality, and the more support we get the more advanced notebook we can ship to you! So please help spread the word! \n$5,000 - Softcover [Original Goal]\n$7,500 - Upgrade to Hardcover [REACHED!]\n$12,500 - Upgraded Cover + Ribbon Marker [Stretch Reward Level 2] \n$20,000 - Upgrade to Two Book Ribbon Markers [Stretch Reward Level 3]\n        Book Specifications\nWe have chosen our full-size lab notebook form: 144 pages, 9.25 x 11.75 inches, 70lb heavyweight writing paper. The large pages allow for ample writing space and makes adhering full size printed sheets easy. The three cover options are represented below. \nIf our initial goal is reached we can send out our softcover variation (left), with our lay-flat, permanent bookblock with water-resistant laminated cover. If our next stretch level is reached we can upgrade to our standard hardcover with printed cover. And if the final stretch level is reached we will be able to use our ultra-durable cloth cover with a book ribbon.\n  The Complete Design, Distilled \nWe have surveyed hundreds of labs over the years to come up with the ideal lab notebook layout. We started by generating a list of everything a user could possibly need or want, and through years of collaboration with a design team, we refined that list into the following streamlined layout. \n    Quick Reference User Information Block\n    Lab Notebook Protocol & User Guide\n  Complete User Information Page\n  Complete User Index\n  Dot Grid Spread With Numbered Pages, Signature & Date Blocks\n  Abbreviation & Accessory Data Chart\n  Reference & Conversion Charts\n    Why Dot Grid?  \nA dot grid provides the same amount of information as a traditional line grid, but does so in a less visually distracting way\u2014allowing your work to be the focus of the page. This is especially true when creating graphs, tables, or illustrations. The subtlety of the grid also allows for versatility of use\u2014the pages can be easily used as a blank page or a ruled page. Furthermore, dot grids minimize contrast on the page, limiting eye-strain when in the lab, a real problem for users in the lab all day.\n  Construction \nVela invested in years of material testing and refining manufacturing techniques. Every component has been optimized to result in a book that is durable, and lays flat for ease of use in the challenging conditions of the lab and field. \nThe Paper. \nOur new heavyweight writing paper is a less rigid sheet, allowing our new book to lay flatter than previous editions. While less rigid, this sheet still has high opacity, to minimize ink show-through. The paper is elemental chlorine free and acid-free for archival quality, and Sustainable Forest Initiative Certified.\n\nThe Binding. \nOur books are gathered and Smyth-Sewn in small page count registers, which translates into extraordinarily durable and lay flat binding that are both permanent (pages will not pull out) and tamper evident. In addition to the high strength sewn binding, each book is reinforced with multiple adhesive layers.\n  The Cover. \nOur hardcovers use extra heavyweight high-density bookboard to ensure no warping of the cover in even the most severe conditions. Our basic printed covers features a scuff-resistant laminate that also protects from spills and general wear and tear. Our Duracover fabric is out most durable cover material\u2014it can withstand aggressive use with little to no signs of wear.\n    Your Support\nYour support allows us to make these books to the highest standards, using the best materials and manufacturing processes\u2014years before we would be able to afford to on our own. It allows us to produce locally, supporting fair wage workers and their families. It allows us to use sustainable materials, like 100% recycled bookboard, american produced cloths, and SFI & ECF certified papers. Finally, your support allows us to reach more students, scientists, and engineers faster.  \n        Thank You!\nIf you like our project, please share and help get the word out!\n~Vela Sciences Team\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing a lab notebook is no easy feat. A good lab notebook needs to both be as flexible as possible, to ensure the book lays as open and flat as possible, and durable enough to withstand any lab condition and remain unaffected and unchanged in long-term storage for decades to come. Meaning every component of a lab notebook needs to far surpass the quality standards of any standard book, and if any one of these components fails the entire book fails. \n\nOvercoming these challenges, and going beyond the previous standards for lab notebooks, is therefore a very expensive and time consuming process. Involving years of material and manufacturing testing, as well as years of field testing - one of the main reasons why no one has ever created lab notebooks like Vela lab notebooks before. But we have always felt that if investing in better lab notebooks has the potential to accelerate the sciences, even just a small amount, the time, cost, and risk would be worth it. \n\nAnd after years of manufacturing and refining we are confident we can deliver our best lab notebook yet in this project, and deliver it on time.

It is designed to be hung on your wall like a picture frame. Joto is not another screen, quite the opposite, it turns pictures and words from your screen into pen and ink drawings.\nAs soon as you send something to it, Joto's pen starts to move. It has an eraser and a dock too, so the pen doesn\u2019t dry out and when you are ready for something new, it refreshes the surface and prepares itself for your next Jot.\nPeople say there\u2019s something about the way Joto jots live. There's something that mesmerises, excites and inspires. It seems some things in life are just better off screen! \nUsing the Joto app, on a computer or mobile device, you can discover, create and share jots. These are some ways you can turn images and text into beautiful ink drawings and make the most of Joto.\nJoto takes requests, sketching everything from works of art to love notes, to-do lists to puzzles. We believe Joto is as versatile as its users are creative. Here are some of our favourite uses:\nA sketch of Hockney for when you\u2019re hosting a summer BBQ. Klimt's The Kiss for romancing. And Dogs Playing Poker for a boys\u2019 night in. Obviously. \nWaking up to a new piece of art every day now is possible. To celebrate the launch of Joto we're releasing something special: 365 days of Art. Like the sound of it? Find out more below!  \nHang Joto in the kitchen and it\u2019s a family to-do-list. Pop it up in a cafe and it's an updatable menu. Or use it in the workplace and it\u2019s a nifty noticeboard. Joto is also easy to update, so you can schedule different content throughout the day to suits your needs. \nQuotations, tweets, headlines, happy birthdays and \u201cHello, how are you?\u201ds. Joto can handle them all. Jot-to-Jot Messaging is even enabled, allowing you to scribble on your friend\u2019s wall from anywhere in the world.  \nAn ever-growing community of design enthusiasts, artists, illustrators, makers and hackers are excited to see how Joto will change the way we communicate and display the things we love. \nWe\u2019re concentrating on getting the hardware right first, so we can build a community of users that love Joto.\nWe've made sure that Joto's software has been built so it can integrate with your favourite apps like Twitter, Spotify and Slack.\nFor all you makers and tinkerers, the accompanying Joto app has also been designed to allow further integrations and connections. We'll be releasing a public API and also making key parts of the software available and open so that you can experiment outside our cloud platform. We want you to be free to come up with as many amazing and crazy ways to use Joto as possible. We've even got it up and running with Node-RED!\nJoto will work with standard pens and paper\nSince we reached our initial funding target of \u00a3100k, we\u2019ve taken on board your feedback and we are excited to announce, if we reach our new goal, all Jotos will come with two new add-ons:\n- a pen holder\nso that you can use a wide range of both whiteboard pens and paper pens\n- paper grips\nthat allow you to use Joto with a sheet of paper.\nClick here for full update\nIt turns out people love Joto. We were over the moon when Joto was announced as Winner of the Beazley Design of the Year Public Vote at the Design Museum in February. \nJoto was the public's favourite over social and visitors to the museum, now we can\u2019t wait for you all to be part of the Joto movement and see what would you jot! \nJoto is made up of a pen, an eraser, a board and some sleek robotics: the key parts are a perfect balance of form and function; the surface is lightweight and wipe-clean, and the pen and eraser attachment is held and manoeuvred via a mechanical arm. The whole thing is controlled via the Joto app. \nTo celebrate the launch of Joto on Kickstarter, we\u2019re excited to announce something we call 365 days of Art. You can get your Joto with 365 unique pieces art, each created by a top illustrator. That\u2019s a brand new, inspirational image on your wall, every day, for a year.  \nWe're honoured to have artists from around the world excited about being part of 365 Days of Art. Just some of the illustrators that will be producing artwork for Joto include Anthony Burrill, Supermundane, Ben the Illustrator, Will Scobie, Mr. Bingo, Jon Burgerman, Quibe, Kaloian Toshev, Jordan Metcalf, Salventius, Sneaky Raccoon, Ben Johnston, Burnt Toast Creative and Thomas Hedger.\nPLAY\n\nThis series of three awesome illustrations created by JARD Design is just an example of the artwork that you can get delivered straight to your wall. Don't miss out, get your Joto with 365 Days of Art!\n   We have spent a year at the Central Research Laboratory in London. One of the UK's first hardware incubators. They have helped us develop both the hardware and our business with a programme of mentorship and learning.\nWe knew Joto had to be special and look beautiful enough to hang on your wall. We didn\u2019t want complicated robotics scaring away your guests. We\u2019ve gone through many design iterations and prototypes to get our close to prototype working. \nWe\u2019ve been working closely with our manufacturers in Shenzhen, ironing out any issues we may face in manufacturing so that when we push the green button everything will run as smoothly as possible.\nOur first prototype was part of the Beazley Designs of the Year exhibition at the Design Museum of London, and it ended up being one of the winners voted by the public.\nWe\u2019ve prototyped, prototyped and prototyped some more and we can\u2019t wait to start manufacturing Joto so people can get their hands on it. \nWe\u2019ve taken all the learning and expertise we\u2019ve developed over the last 3 years and put it into creating Joto. \nIt's been an amazing journey to bring this product all the way till here and see the Joto community growing. Kickstarter is a milestone to validate the product and fund its production.\nTo make all this a reality, we need your help. We are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to life. \nJoto is the next generation drawing machine out of Those\u2019s studio. One of the very first prototypes Barney ever made using chopsticks, string and anything else he could find lying around the home.\nThe Woodpecker \u2013 Proof of concept.\nThe first product was called Woodpecker and was designed to bring retail windows and public spaces to life. It caught everyone's attention, even the labs at the advertising agency Ogilvy described it as \u201cthe year\u2019s most innovative retail product\u201d. \nBuy this unique lightweight drawing frame for your shop, exhibition or foyer. \nThis is the only time we've sold our Woodpecker drawing machine.

Just capture the things in your daily life that you don\u2019t want to miss. It automatically converts your voice notes into text and organises them for easy access.\nSenstone's overview\n  Stretch Goals\n  We check smartphones 150 times a day, every day. But what if there was plainly easier way to capture those precious words?\nSenstone lets you record your thoughts quickly and conveniently. Senstone is a notepad size of a bottle cap. Imagine walking in the busy street or driving a car and taking those notes, reminders with the speed of thought.\nTap on the Senstone to start recording and speak. Tap again and it stops. All audio and text notes are synced into the Cloud seamlessly.\nSenstone saves you from getting distracted while reaching for your smartphone and looking for the necessary app. Especially when focusing is critical.\nIncrease your focus in everyday life\n  Senstone should be close when you speak \u2014 for best performance. You can hang it around your neck, clip it to your shirt collar or a jacket, or even wear it on your wrist.\n  Senstone is a standalone device so you can take notes and create lists when its not connected to your smartphone. It records for up to two and a half hours when offline. Then it automatically syncs your notes in the cloud when you are back in range.\nIts a standalone device -- record and save notes anytime\n  Being able to take notes on the go is critical \u2014 be it your personal goals, your breakthrough ideas or your travel journal. This is why the world\u2019s greatest writers, inventors, and visionaries kept notebooks to document their ideas. And today we offer a much more convenient and handy solution.\nFamous people record their ideas\n  Are you a food blogger discovering a new cafe and wanting to document your experience? Take notes in seconds with Senstone. It has been designed specifically to keep track of details in any situation. You can even capture an impromptu interview with someone at the cafe.\nNo typing\n    You can also use Senstone at night, but you don\u2019t need to wear it. It listens to you when you sleep and is just a finger snap away from recording the details of your dreams while you still remember them. There\u2019s no need to press any button. Thanks to our unique machine learning system we help you record your midnight thoughts and dreams with just a snap of your fingers. \nNB: Currently, the finger snap feature is only available when the gadget is charging on its dock.\nCapture midnight dreams\n  Senstone helps you stay focused, lets you organize your thoughts quickly and allows you to manage your life with confidence and style. Send reminders to other members of your team. Just say \u201cTom, I figured you didn\u2019t bring lunch today, so I ordered pizza\u201d and the message is sent.\nSenstone is your communication tool with others on the team. However, sometimes it is more convenient to have your thoughts laid out right in your favourite app. For these scenarios we are integrating with apps like Evernote, Trello and more.\n  Everyone has their own sense of style. People are wearing accessories to underline their personality, get attention and feel good. We tried to be timeless and original with this device. Senstone\u2019s design is pure and minimalist \u2014 it\u2019s something will match any style or look.\nInspired by Brain and Sound Waves.\n  Early mock-ups\n  Our fashion designer picked the best materials for Senstone to look and feel right. The casing is made of Chrome-plated brass and clear brass. We also offer a lighter, Aluminium version anodised in white gray and black. All models feature a scratch-proof tempered screen.\nSenstone product line\n  Senstone\u2019s screen consists of 17 white LEDs that inform you of key activities such as starting and ending a recording, synchronization, battery status, and charging. It\u2019s all displayed by flashing patterns and shapes with the LED array.\nGadget screen scenarios.\n    Senstone online demo:\nPLAY\n\n  We do care about environment, so we made the box that is indisposable and reusable. This is your stylish dock that is used for charging and a sole place to store and carry Senstone and its accessories. You can use it to hold the device itself as well as all your detachable backs.\nThe box is a charging station\n  Charging is fast and simple\n  Our line of interchangeable backs was developed by a fashion designer. You can clip it to your clothes, hang it from your neck, or wear it on your wrist, for the style that suits you best.\nLine of Detachable Backs.\n  Sizing details.\n  We developed our own firmware with the Protocol that works specifically with audio tracks (files). It optimised to record and transmit high quality audio without data loss and run them later through AI systems in the Cloud. We ensure encryption of our data so its highly protected during data transfer over the air.  Hardware is optimised for low energy consumption which gives  about 4 days of average use.\nThe reason we've chosen the components is multi layers, among them the size. We spent several months trying to fit components into a small casing and maintain good battery life at the same time by using BLE microprocessor.\nPrinted Circuit Board tech details.\nHere are some technical highlights of our device.  It includes Ultra-low Power Wireless Microcontroller with the following features:\n1) Multi-core system, 2) Support Over-the-Air Upgrade (OTA), 3) AES-128 Security Module, 4) Compatible with BLE 4.2.\nDigital MEMS Microphones with the following features: \n1) Three modes: Standard Performance, Low-Power and Ultrasonic Mode, 2) Frequency Range 0.01kHz - 80kHz.\nMemory with the following features: \n1) Minimum 100,000 recording cycles, 2) 20 years of data retention.\nLithium (LiPo) battery:\n1) 4.2 Voltage, 2) 80mAh capacity, 3) 4 days of average use.\nAs great as a simple and convenient tap could be, we are constantly looking for more natural ways to capture your thoughts. One of them is a snap. \nThe magic lies in the device machine learning system. The microphones are in active listening mode and when the captured sound matches the Snap pattern \u2014 it activates device. It works best in silent environments, and with the shipped device you will be able to switch to Snap or back to Tap mode depending on your preferences. See it here in action.\nPLAY\n\n  We bring a new level of intelligence to your voice notes.  The moment you start a recording, it\u2019s stored on your smartphone and backed up in Cloud, even if your app is in background. The Cloud software platform converts voice memos into text, extracts keywords, to-dos and analyses your speech patterns. \nIt's like having an AI to organise your notes. What is the topic of the note? What was your mood at the time? What was happening around you? Where were you? You can then find your notes by hashtags, their content or time and location to replay original audio, edit them or export to other apps.\nWith additional premium app subscription you\u2019ll be able to access more AI features, like automatic punctuation or noise analysis, get larger cloud storage for audio notes and more free speech-to-text transactions. The App also works in the background, notifying you on the progress and number of notes made. Once you open the app, all your voice memos and text notes are automatically synced to the \u0421loud.\nApp screens.\n  Integrates with Evernote and much more\n  App features.\n  Since both the audio recording and the converted text are available for each note, there are a lot we can do to improve your note-taking experience. You\u2019ll have a chance to vote on the upcoming features you want, like automatic punctuation, intonation analysis, productivity tips based on your previous performance, noise and context analysis, and integration with various software.\n                 Our plan\n  Senstone Inc. is an audio company that\u2019s on a mission to provide the best note-taking experience. We do it through voice analysis, text extraction and machine learning via deep audio analysis. Our company provides seamless and smart voice recording by combining well designed hardware and a cloud based software platform.\nOur team\n      For more questions, media inquiries or review unit requests please contact us at team@senstone.io.\nPress Kit is available here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed manufacturing design of the product and have produced about 20 working prototypes in 7 iterations total. \n\nWe also started negotiating with the mass production manufacturer to make sure that our device is produced and delivered to our first customers on time. But there's risk that mass production process may require different design decisions which may take more time to implement. We manage this risk by saving extra few weeks for this.\n\nOther risk is economical. As we're using third party engine for speech-to-text conversion, we need to pay for each transaction. This puts the limit on number of transactions you can take per month for free. Currently we assume a normal limit would be free 300 transactions per month, which wouldn't be noticeable for you on average use, and would still make sense to us economically. But it might end up being to few transactions for you, or still tight for us economically over time. We manage this risk by giving you free 3 months of (almost) unlimited transactions, then measure the average use and try to set limit just above this number. So it can be more or less than 300 per month. \n\nFor people who use Senstone more frequently we will offer premium app subscription with larger number of transactions. And you will still be able to make recordings even after the limit is reached.

The King Arthur Legend always made the list.  I have been inspired by this legend since I was a child and now I am excited to share this deck with you.   \nThe Arthur Legend is full of rich characters and a wide range of lore.  All this history makes it an ideal foundation for a playing card deck. Kings, Knights, Queens, Love, Betrayal, and Brotherhood are just a few of the themes that play out in this beloved story.  \nWhen I decided to capture the story of the Arthur Legend, I then picked an art style that has been attractive to me for years.  The art for this deck is a reflection of the Book of Kells.  The Book of Kells is a beautiful hand drawn and written illuminated manuscript that tells the story of the four Gospels of the Bible. This book was written around the same time as the origins of the King Arthur story.  This legend and art style are a perfect compliment to each other. \nFollow my Kickstarter for the next 30 days to watch this deck come to life.

Scribes worked meticulously to perfectly reproduce and record cultural, religious, and political records using expensive materials that were designed to last for centuries. So important was the veracity of these documents that in the unfortunate occasion of a mistake, the document would often be destroyed so as to not perpetuate any errors.\nOf equal importance to the accuracy of these artifacts was their care and protection. Therefore, it was common practice to invoke the wrath of gods and all manner of supernatural havoc upon any who would seek to edit, steal, or destroy any of these works. This protection took the form of what is now referred to as a Book Curse.\nHow delightful!\nThe Book Curse bookplates\nInspired by the idea of an 'Ex Libris' bookplate that doubled as dire warning for any potential book thieves, I set my poisoned pen to the illustration of a set of Book Curse bookplates!\nMark your precious books as your own with sexy, sexy bookplates that you can write your own protective curses upon. All tiers include the cost of shipping! Worldwide! Please note that beyond postage, all additional duties, fees, and tariffs are the responsibility of the International backers.\nNow make a pledge and be done with it already!\nThe most petty annoyance or eternity in a flesh-rending hell-- just write it in there yourself.\nWhat your support... supports\nAs a meticulous artist and painstaking craftsman, I've invested in my own printing and production equipment and have produced my own fine art prints for years. Supporting this project will help to defray the costs of upgrading my print equipment while allowing me to produce these bookplates for you!\nA percentage of the proceeds will also be earmarked for funding other crowdsourced projects. Learn more about Kicking It Forward at http://kickingitforward.org.\nHow are the bookplates made?\nFor the sake of the majority of readers, I opted for a self-adhesive solution instead of non-adhesive leafs that required a separate adhesive. Every 3.33\" x 4\" label is printed with Epson Durabrite pigmented inks and acid- and lignin-free self-adhesive papers. These bookplates are designed for permanent adhesion that will last for years without yellowing and a lifetime without fading. It is as close to an archival self-adhesive solution as is possible at the Maker level of production!\nThe Art of the Book Curse\nBefore and after, from rough to final.\nHere are the designs that I have planned for this first edition of the bookplates. The final printed artwork will be high resolution. I've posted concept sketches, as well as a couple of printed prototypes using the final artwork:\nMemento Mori (prototype, final artwork)\n  Trickster (prototype, final artwork)\n  Nevermore (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Cursed Roots (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Carrion, Wayward Son (concept sketch including a curse to test the available space for writing). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Doombag (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\nOriginal Artwork rewards\nA comparison of a bookplate (left), the original artwork (right) and a skull and some scissors. A pen, too.\nBetween the concept sketch and the production prototype, I draw all of the designs at 2X scale. I then scan them and reduce their size, sealing in all the juicy detailed goodness. All Original Artwork rewards will receive the actual full-scale drawings (signed and personalized with your name and a message of your choice), along with a supply of matching bookplates.\nThank you for considering this project!\nSincerely yours, Chris (and my lovely muse Janet).

You just need to practice, especially you Brett.\n$15,000 pledged: Home Library Circulation Kit\n\"Let's play library!\" - Me as a kid (full disclosure: last week too).\nAt $15,000 funding, every backer at the $12 level and above will receive a PDF download of my DIY papercraft Library Circulation Kit!\nI've heard it said that the old-fashioned library card is a small time-travel device. Marked as they are with names and dates, one can relive the journey that a book has taken over its life and recall those with whom you've shared its interior riches. As a child I would look at library cards with such interest, wondering who these other people were, or even delighting in the discovery of a friend's signature. Often enough, I'd then add my own name and continue the story of the book's life.\nThe kit will contain all you need to print your own library cards and card pockets with plenty of space for annotating who borrowed a book and when. The pockets and cards will be decorated with artwork from the bookplate project so everything can match!\nWith this PDF, some cardstock, a printer, scissors, and a bottle of mucilage (hehe... \"mucilaaaaaage\") or even a glue stick you'll be able to create an unlimited supply of your own circulation stock.

It does need a better shirt. The RS01 is that shirt.\nThe RS01 was engineered from the ground up to meet your work and active life. It is a shirt built for the transitions. During the day it passes for well-cut office wear. En route, it lights up like a STOP sign. The RS01 was ruthlessly developed through endless prototyping, creative destruction, and fastidious attention to minutiae to wring out the perfect fit, material, and closures for your modern life. The result is an office-formal shirt that works as well in the crouch on your bike as it does at your desk, a shirt with minimal, clean details and an extra-sharp silhouette. It is also a shirt which lights up via 3M retroreflective when on the street. The RS01 is passive*, minimal design at it best. \n*shouts when needed.\n    Retroreflective  \nWhile we love smart tech solutions, nothing beats the straightforward simplicity of passive design. No USB cables, battery recharging and malfunctioning electronics - wear the RS01 and be seen. \nWe worked with a specialty technical fabric mill to make a custom fabric which has retroreflective woven into the material. Other reflective garments often have reflectivity printed on top, wearing out quickly, cracking, peeling and losing its luster. In the RS01 fabric, the reflectivity is durable and bright. The reflective element is invisibly nestled into the Shepherd's Check pattern. It stays hidden during the day, and pops out on the street. \nPedestrian Visibility at Night\nActive Cut\nWe did backflips to develop our own pattern made specifically to stretch and twist. We reduced pattern pieces. We rethought sleeve construction. We tried, failed, and refined. The current construction is sleek and novel. It fits like a modern dress shirt and behaves like a second skin. \nBonded Edges\nKeep it tight and flat. We removed pattern pieces, and sharpened the silhouette by bonding instead of sewing key elements of the RS01. The cuffs, collar, and wind block are all super-flush (the anti-Puffy shirt). This innovative construction will keep you looking, literally, sharp. \nWind Block \nDesperate cyclists stuff newspapers down their shirts to block wind on chilly descents. No more. The RS01 integrates wind blocking panels directly into the shirt construction. We added sueded microfiber panels over the ribs to block just enough wind to keep out the chill. The back, armpits, and sleeves uncovered so you can dump heat as you warm up from the inside. \nRear Pocket\nThe cel phone hasn't yet been installed into your brain pan. Until then, easy access is the next best option. We installed a rear pocket into the seam with a snap-closure, so you can snag your cel in an instant. Keep your digital device easily at hand, balanced AND out of harm's way. (Yes, we designed the pocket to fit your 6\" phablet) \nLow-Profile Snaps  \nEverything about the RS01 is \"High Speed, Low Drag\". We edited, questioned, tested, and reduced every. little. detail. These snaps are flush to the body, tough as nails, hold well, and fasten quickly and easily.\nDrop Tail\nMost active transit options involve some degree of crouching, the cut of your garments should fit that posture. Keep your crack covered with a little extra. We've got your back.\n      The RS01 is tailored for a sharp, active fit with a modern silhouette. \nCheck your measurements and use the guide below to select your size. You don't need to answer when pledging - we'll ask for your size right before we begin shipping.\n      You can trust that when you back our project, you will receive your rewards. Together we have launched 4 other successful Kickstarter projects - all delivered. The fabric mill is waiting for our green light to begin producing our custom integrated reflective fabric.

During the day, I am a graphic designer at Pentagram Design in New York City. After hours and on weekends, I work on my own independent projects such as this.\n\u2014\nFive years ago my boss at Pentagram, Michael Bierut, handed me a composition book, and I've been fascinated by these utilitarian and ubiquitous notebooks ever since.\n\u2014\nThrough extensive research, I've learned that, interestingly enough, these notebooks haven't changed all that much since they came into being centuries ago. And that they have an 180+ year history of being produced using the most economical manufacturing methods available.\nWith all the new advances in the fields of papermaking, printing, and binding since the 1800s, I was interested in what it would be like to create a notebook that uses the new printing and binding technologies and the highest quality materials possible, while still maintaining the nostalgic pattern that we all know and love. \n\u2014\nThat's how 'comp' was born. An elegant, sophisticated, and long-lasting version of the classic composition notebook.\ncomp uses today's finest available processes, materials, and design\nFront cover with custom drawn pattern and redesigned offset label\nLayflat binding opens completely flat to reveal ultra white, smooth 120 gsm uncoated paper\nDetail of book spine made with beautiful Italian Cialux cloth and thick, durable 'boards on' covers\nLined version features optimized 3/8\" ruling and black interior feint lines\nThe interior of the unlined version of the notebook\nColor-through dyed black endsheets\n\u2014\n\"When you look at [comp], immediately it\u2019s recognizable. It reminds us of something that all of us have seen all our lives. And yet, it\u2019s taken all the characteristics of that object and made them the best they can be.\" \u2014Michael Bierut, Partner, Pentagram\n\u2014\nThe history\ncomp first started as a curiosity, then turned into a research project, and finally, (admittedly) into a bit of an obsession. I've spoken with many experts in fields such as paper marbling, book binding and design, have visited rare book libraries, and poured through many stationery catalogs trying to document the history of the composition notebook. \nBookbinder, Paul Vogel. Photo: Brian Kelley\nThe pattern on the composition notebook was an industrialized version of the traditional art of marbling, a process that was used to make decorative papers for book coverings and end papers. Paper marbling began thousands of years ago\u2013\u2013in the tenth century in China and later in Japan during the twelfth century.\nEbru pattern. Image: Terry Underwood Evans/Shutterstock.\nThe marbling process remains more or less the same today: It essentially involves dropping different colored pigments into a bath of water (typically with size added), and working them into a unique pattern with different instruments and brushes. Once you have the desired pattern, a piece of paper is rested on top and absorbs the pattern to create a marbled paper. Meanwhile, in the fifteenth century in Turkey, a different type of marbling was being developed called Ebru, which eventually made its way to Europe.\nExample of a pseudo-marbled agate pattern\nAround the early nineteenth century (1820s\u20131830s), a new industrialized type of paper marbling began in France and Germany. This 'pseudo-marbling' process, a term coined by marbling expert Richard J. Wolfe, aimed to create marbled patterns using industrial processes\u2013\u2013it was here that a new type of pattern was created in Germany, called the 'agate' pattern. Over time, these chemically made agate papers started to be used on more and more cheap blank notebooks, and the pattern evolved slightly into the printed composition notebook pattern we know and love today. \n\u2014\nThe evolution\nPseudo-marbled French composition notebook from 1860.

Image courtesy of Alwen Rambo/Belle Brocante\nPrinted American composition notebook, 1964\nPrinted composition notebook, 2016, Pennsylvania, USA\n\u2014\nA cultural icon\nThroughout the years, the composition notebook has become a sort of cultural icon. Its unique design has been imitated, reproduced, shared, and worshiped; making a name for itself inside the art and design community and beyond. Strangely there\u2019s no one producer of these notebooks since the pattern is not copyrighted and exists in many unique variations.\nOver the years, the composition notebook's black and white marbled pattern has inspired and been used by famous artists, writers, and designers, like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Ettorre Sottsaas Jr., Roy Lichtenstein, and Michael Bierut.  \n\u2014\nWhy recreate the composition notebook?\nComposition notebooks, as they are now, have become an important piece of American culture. That said, they fall into a category of objects created for utility, that focus less on longevity and more on economy.\nAs a graphic designer, printmaker, and bookbinder I wanted to create a notebook that uses today's finest available processes, materials, and design to create something that will be kept, cherished, and used for years to come. \n\u2014\nFeatures\nHere is a more detailed look into comp's features.\nAn exposed spine using the best quality Italian cialux cloth, instead of tape for added durability. \nCovers that are made of thick wrapped boards for added durability and rigidity. The cover shown left is a traditonal notebook cover. The cover shown at right is comp's thicker covers.\nLayflat binding allows the notebook to open completely flat, which makes for easier use. \nItalian micro-embossed cover paper, which is durable and feels much more premium than a traditional notebook cover. \n Color dyed black end sheets for clean inside and outside back covers.\nA beautiful, unique, custom marbled cover pattern, optimized to balance light and dark perfectly, with every shape in the pattern individually placed for a unified look throughout. \nA redesigned offset label that balances perfectly with the black binding at the left edge and allows you to write your name or other information you choose on the front cover. \nUltra white interior paper that is substantially thicker than a traditional composition notebook, allowing for less show through back to back between pages. These uncoated sheets work exceptionally well with all sorts of pens and pencils.\nBoth unlined as well as lined versions of the notebook. The lined version utilizes 3/8\u201d ruling in which the length of the lines have been optimized for the best writing experience. Thin black lines are also used instead of traditional blue lines for a more streamlined look.\nThe lined version also has unique header ruling that help provide hierarchy as well as a clear way to track page to page.\n\u2014\nTechnical specifications\n7.5\" x 9.75\" upright\n148 pages (74 leaves)\nCustom designed pattern\nOffset printed covers (with double hit of black ink for extra contrast)\n2mm wrapped hardcovers wrapped with fine micro-embossed cover paper\nBoards on, layflat binding\nSquare back with sewn and glued signatures \n120 gsm ultra white, smooth, uncoated interior paper 155 whiteness (CIE), 96% opacity, 122 brightness (ISO 2470/D65 %), 150 Roughness (Bendtsen, ml/min)\nColor-through dyed black endsheets\nSquare corners\nBlack Italian cialux cloth\nLined version printed offset with stochastic screening for fine reproduction of feint lines\nAll materials used are FSC certified\nPrinted and bound in Italy\nRewards\n\u2014\nOne book\nLined or unlined\n$19\n\u2014\nThree books\nAll lined or all unlined\nPlus free tote bag\n$57\n\u2014\nTen books \nAll lined or all unlined \nPlus free tote bag \n$170\nWhy Kickstarter? \nSince the composition notebook is such a ubiquitous object and has been used by so many different people in so many different communities, I thought Kickstarter would be a perfect place to bring comp to life and share it with as many people as possible.\nWith your help, I'll be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of comp, along with compensating all the different components that have helped bring this project to life.\nThe Kickstarter goal includes every single cost involved in making this project happen:\nLLC creation\nLegal fees\nPrinting\nBinding\nTote bag manufacturing \nLabel manufacturing\nShipping the books to the US fulfillment house\nPackaging\nPrototyping\nMedia Licensing\nPhotography\nVideo\nMusic\nCampaign management\nKickstarter fees\nPayment processing fees\n\u2014\nProject Credits\nCreated by\nAron Fay\naronfay.com\nCampaign Management \nVann Alexandra \nvannalexandra.com\nFilm\nBrandon Kuzma \nkuzmafilms.com\nMusic\nEdo Van Breemen\nedovan.com\nProduct Photography \nBrian Kelley\nbriankelley.nyc\nSpecial thanks to Michael Bierut, Caroline Weaver, Paul Vogel, Richard J.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become!

Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention.

Almost 6 years ago, we launched the Glif, a tripod mount for the iPhone 4, on Kickstarter. The response to our campaign was incredible, and it allowed us to build our company, Studio Neat. Since then, we have released several updates to the Glif, but we are back where we started, on Kickstarter, to launch the best version yet.\n      (Note: The Glif shown in all images and videos is a 3D printed prototype. The final production Glif will be a much nicer and smoother finish.)\nThe landscape for smartphone photography has changed dramatically since we launched the original Glif in 2010. With each successive smartphone, the camera is getting more and more incredible. The smartphone has become a legitimate tool, for photographers, filmmakers, and mobile journalists. So our goal is simple: to create the best tripod mount for smartphones, period. To do that, we are focusing on three areas.\n1: An innovative quick release mechanism.\nCurrent tripod mounts on the market today fall into one of two categories: screw, or spring. Screw mounts work like a vise; they allow for a secure grip, but are slow and cumbersome to operate every time you want to take your phone in and out of it. Conversely, spring mounts are quick to load and unload, but they have a flimsy grip and are not secure at all. We wanted to create a mount that is the best of both.\nThe solution we came up with took several rounds of iteration and engineering. The quick release lever, when opened, allows the jaws to move freely, making it easy to quickly load or remove your device. Here is the clever bit: when you close the lever, it automatically tightens around your device, resulting in a super secure connection. It's quick, and secure.\n  Cross section of the tightening mechanism.\n2: Portrait and Landscape \nVery few tripod mounts on the market today can support a device in both portrait and landscape orientations. With things like panoramic photos, Periscope streams, and Snapchat, smartphones have legitimized the once-smirked-at portrait orientation. The Glif has a side mounted tripod mount, which allows devices to be mounted directly in portrait orientation. \nAnd speaking of that side mounted tripod mount...\n3: Extendability\nWe want you to consider the Glif as the starting point, the base, of your mobile photography rig. We want it to be a flexible tool that caters to your needs. As such, the Glif has a total of 3 tripod mounts, one on the bottom, one on the side, and one on the top. These allow you to add additional accessories, like a microphone or light.\n  Speaking of accessories... we are introducing two!\nHand Grip\nNot every situation calls for mounting your smartphone on a stationary tripod, and the hand grip provides a much more comfortable way to shoot freehand, especially if you have additional accessories attached. The hand grip is lovely, milled from solid cherry hardwood. It has an additional tripod thread on the bottom as well.\nWrist Strap\nA wrist strap is crucial for that added bit of security when you are shooting freehand. Dan used a prototype when he went zip-lining in the jungles of Jamaica and it worked great. Attach the wrist strap to the bottom of the hand grip, or just attach it directly to the Glif, as a way to add a bit of security and comfort. It is made from durable paracord and leather. The Glif, hand grip, and wrist strap are all tough, robust, and built to last.\nWhat Devices Can the Glif Hold?\nThe Glif can hold devices roughly in width from 58 mm to 99 mm. This is essentially the range of a naked iPhone SE to an iPhone 6 Plus with a really thick case on it. In all likelihood, your device will fit. \nDesign Process\nWe have been working on and improving the Glif as a product for the past 6 years, and have been working on this version for the last several months. Through countless iterations, we are super happy with the design, and think you will love it too! \nSome of the many prototypes we made.\nWhy We're on Kickstarter\nAs usual with these types of products, there is a considerable upfront investment needed to create the multiple molds for injection molding. We have spoken with and received quotes from our manufacturer here in the US, and they are ready to start production if this campaign is a success. As with all of our other Kickstarter campaigns, we want to take you along on the journey of bringing a product into existence. We will be posting numerous update videos, which will document the manufacturing process, and we will be discussing everything in depth on our podcast, Thoroughly Considered.\nWe hope you will join us in this campaign to create the best tripod mount ever. We can't do it without your help, so please, hit the green button on the right to become a backer and help bring this into reality.\nThanks and have a great day!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo date, we have successfully funded and fulfilled 5 (!) Kickstarter projects. Each has brought their own challenges and obstacles, and we foresee the same for this one. We hope our track record proves we are capable of overcoming these inevitable challenges in order to bring the new Glif to market. Our manufacturer here in the US (in South Dakota) is already lined up and ready to go, and we have worked with them many times in the past, so we are confident moving forward if this project is funded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Glif", "descp": "New and improved!

To guard against this, material is put in a dryer and typically only takes a few hours to dry, but our material ended up taking a couple days due to its unusual composition. On top of that, while the levers were being molded one of the parts didn\u2019t eject, and as the mold closed it bent a pin, which needed to be repaired. Fun times!

They are estimating that orders will begin to ship to backers on Tuesday or Wednesday next week, and they estimate being able to ship about 500 orders a day. Which means getting all of the domestic orders shipped should take a little over a week.

You may remember from the last update we were waiting on one last material to try so we could make a final decision. This material look quite a bit longer to arrive and get molded, but we are happy to say the wait was worth it because it performs exactly as we hoped. For a bit of detail to those who care, the material is PC (Polycarbonate) with PTFE (Teflon) as an additive. What this gets us is a material that is durable and very resistant to wear over time, which is important when you are snapping and unsnapping the quick release lever hundreds of times over the life of the Glif.

As stated in the previous update, we decided to make a slight modification to the mold, which was slated to take about 4 weeks. This is on schedule, and we should be getting the modified mold back and tested in a week or so. For those curious, the modification has to do with the \"feet\" of the Glif, and where the rubbery bit is overmolded. We wanted to create more space so that the rubber had more room to compress, and this required a modification to the mold.

Toward the end of his presentation, Jobs excitedly introduced the first iPhone, and just like that he changed the world of photography as we know it.\niPhone 1 Introduction\nThe fact that the iPhone is part of our life 24/7, along with the most updated technology Apple engineers continuously pour into it, the ease with which superb images can be produced and its addictive sharing capabilities, have turned the iPhone into the most popular camera in the world. That's why it's not surprising to discover that more than 75% of all the photos taken in the world in 2015 were done by smartphones.\nIt's almost impossible today to find someone who doesn't take pictures with a Smartphone - from little kids who can hardly hold their parent's iPhone but love taking pictures, to seasoned pros who are not ashamed to pull out their iPhone 6S to capture a fleeting moment in the street or document a process on a professional mission. We are fortunate to witness history in the making...\nBut is everything really that perfect?\nThe iPhone camera, and the strong competitors from the East, have made meteoric progress since the first device was introduced with its modest 2 megapixel images. Today they offer photographic technology that matches the standards of professional cameras.\nThe problem is that these advanced cameras are packed inside a smartphone. The thin, sleek and slick device doesn't offer any secure external grip or controls with the characteristics of traditional DSLR cameras we've come to appreciate.\nThe iPhone's camera technology has made huge progress since first introduced - but we still take pictures in an uncomfortable and unsafe way - just like 9 years ago. It's time for a change\nAlong with the availability of the smartphone, we\u2019ve become accustomed to (or rather, we have compromised on) two matters of principle: First, we still use the smartphone's camera in the most awkward way, and pray it doesn't slip out of our fingers and fall to the ground (and indeed sometimes it doesn't); and secondly, most of us never utilize even a fraction of the iPhone camera's enormous potential, because no one has the time or patience to browse through endless internal menus.\nThe result? In most cases, we shoot in auto mode and compromise on picture quality. It's like coupling a Formula One engine with a steering wheel and gearbox of a golf cart - the engine's potential just cannot reach the road... no matter how skilled the driver is.\nPictar was born to help mobile-photographers to unleash the power of the iPhone\u2019s camera for much better pictures!\nFeels like real camera. Shoots like real camera.\nPictar was born to combine the benefits of advanced cameras - IE, full external control of all shooting functions as well as a stable and secure grip, with the advanced camera technology and ultimate availability of the iPhone. In other words - to unleash the full potential of iPhone's photographic capability in order to take much better pictures, time after time! It's pretty cool, but who is it designed for? Pictar is designed for people who are just starting out in photography and are looking to get more out of their iPhone, as well as serious amateur or professional photographers who want ultimate and uncompromising control over the iPhone's camera. No matter what's your level or experience - Pictar will help you get much more from your iPhone!\nWe invite you to dive in (and scroll down) to learn more about Pictar and what it can do for you and your iPhone:\nThe real thing - just like a pro DSLR!\nElectronically calibrated to provide maximum sensitivity, just like a traditional DSLR. Pictar\u2019s shutter button offers a \"half press\" mode to lock focus and exposure for easy tracking of a moving object or to create a desired composition, as well as full-press for immediate shutter release. The button is located right under the index finger to enable precise and intuitive shooting, with one hand.\nTip: if you're shooting in a cold environment, or taking pictures of extreme sports, you'll be happy to learn that with Pictar's shutter button you can now take pictures on an iPhone with your gloves!\n\nHalf-press to lock focus and exposure. Press to shoot - even with gloves.\n Zoom with only one hand.\nLocated right below the shutter release button, the rotating zoom ring does away with the need to touch the screen to pinch-and-zoom, and makes it easy for the user to zoom in and out with just one hand. The zoom ring can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs, such as the flash, white-balance, etc. if that's the case, zoom in or out will be done by \"pinching\" the iPhone's screen, like before.\n  Let the fun begin!\nClicking the zoom ring will switch between the iPhone's front and back camera for easy \"selfie\" shots. Like the rotation of the zoom ring, the button can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs and control other settings.\nTip: Changed to \"selfie\" mode? Shooting one-handed? You can use the zoom ring for perfect composition, and shoot pictures you'll love to share.  \n Control light like never before!\nStrategically located in the right corner is the exposure compensation wheel, which lets the user quickly and easily control brightness level even before shooting. And just like with an advanced camera, the exposure compensation wheel changes the exposure in steps of 1/3 aperture, and the clear display appears at the bottom of the iPhone screen.\nTip: In manual mode, the exposure compensation wheel changes its designation and allows control of ISO values.\n Fully customizable, the smart wheel allows users to control a variety of functions.\nBeginners will love the ease of control - in default mode the smart wheel controls 7 pre-set modes, which enable users to easily adjust the iPhone to any situation while focusing on actually taking the shot. Pre-set modes are:\nAuto mode\nPortrait mode\nLandscape mode\nSport mode\nSnow mode\nSelfie mode\nVideo mode\nAdvanced photographers will feel right at home: the smart wheel lets you choose between 3 advanced modes:\nShutter priority\nISO priority\nManual (iPhone manual = Shutter + ISO adjustments).\nThe Virtual Wheel is another great feature that allows the user to control different modes such as Flash modes, Shutter speed, ISO and more - simply by using his thumb. Switching between modes is done by using the Smart Wheel.\nFeel like you're holding a real camera\nThe iPhone is an amazing design icon, and we as designers are full of admiration for the people who brought it to the world - but let's face it: as a camera, it's nowhere near the comfort, safe feel and familiar grip of a traditional camera. So the second task we undertook - after developing advanced controls - was to design an ergonomic grip that would sit comfortably in one hand and let you take one-handed shots while holding it out the window of a speeding jeep. And we believe we did it! \nPictar's grip is coated with anti-slip material and gives you something solid to grasp on one hand, while being compact enough to provide what we love about smartphones - accessibility and ease of storage. Pictar lets you take one-handed shots, anywhere, without falling out of your grasp. It provides sharp images thanks to the steady grip. We think it also looks great, with its trendy retro design inspired by classic cameras we love. Your iPhone will love it.\nSaves time looking for your iPhone so you'll never miss a shot or have your precious phone fall. \nIt's rare to see a camera that isn't connected to a strap. So when we developed Pictar, we knew we wanted to design not one but two straps: a wrist strap to secure it against falling, and a neck strap for carrying. The classic Pictar kit offers a standard adjustable wrist strap with a fast connection clasp. The Pictar-Plus kit includes a neck strap too - which also connects to the same fast connection clasp.\nTip: You can easily change between them or disconnect them both.\nThe padded case will keep your PICTAR safe when not in use.\nEasily connect any tripod, for sharper than ever images\nThe mobile-camera revolution enables anyone to go out into the wild - jungle or city - armed with just an iPhone. There they discover that they sometimes lack a trusty buddy - a tripod. There are many ways to improvise, but you won't always find a convenient tree or flat rock to stabilize the iPhone when you really could use a tripod.\nThat's why it was important to us to incorporate a standard 1/4\" thread in Pictar, just like real cameras have.\nStable and reliable cold-shoe connector - for many camera accessory - not just iPhone oriented.\nThe market offers an endless choice of LED-based lighting devices which add a fascinating dimension of light to the creative process. The problem is that many of them - especially the professional ones - are designed to be connected to real cameras with a standard upper connection. So Pictar offers a reliable and stable cold-shoe connection to hook up anything you want - via Pictar - to your iPhone.\nNOTE:\nPICTAR's App does not support hand-held flash units.\nThe cold shoe mount can support lighting units weighs up to 300 gr. / 0,66 pounds.\nDue to the fact that while it attached to PICTAR, the iPhone's connecting jack is concealed - any device that is using the connecting jack must be disconnected before actual attachment to PICTAR.\nPictar's semi-open body allows connecting most \"clip-on\" lenses. We've tested it with olloclip lens, and it works great. \nMode shown: SPORT\nA powerful, dedicated app featuring patented high-frequency dual tone sound control.\nPictar is designed to communicate with iPhone via a dedicated camera app which unlocks key features inaccessible on the native app to iPhone users. Each of the physical controls found on Pictar drive a specific function or setting and does so using high-frequency dual tone sounds. \nEach physical control is assigned a specific tone, and with each turn of a dial, press of a button or turn of a wheel, Pictar emits a sound that \u2013 when detected by the app \u2013 generates a corresponding action. The high-frequency dual tone (18,500 \u2013 20,000 khz) is inaudible to the human ear and significantly increases battery life when compared to Bluetooth connectivity. \nHigh-frequency dual tone technology saves energy compared to \"Bluetooth\" systems.\nUsing a standard CR \u00bd AA battery, we estimates 4-6 months of use before the need to replace the power source is required.\nWe are offering two almost identical models who share the same features. PICTAR fits iPhone models 4 to 6S while PICTAR PLUS fits iPhone 6 PLUS and iPhone  6S PLUS.\nModels shown: 4s, 5s, 6s\nPerhaps one of the biggest challenges in the development process was how to let as many iPhone users benefit from Pictar, without making it too expensive by adding various adapters. The solution consists of two elements:\n1: Wireless connection between Pictar and the iPhone using high-frequency sound waves (see separate chapter);\n2: A modular mechanical connection to connect different model iPhones of different sizes. The result - Pictar fits most existing iPhone models, and is ready for future models. If any backer plans to upgrade one day to a new model iPhone - chances are that it will fit.\nTip: If you have numerous iPhones in the family, you can share Pictar without a problem by installing Pictar-Up (free) on all devices.\nCan I use my iPhone cover with Pictar?\nPictar\u2019s semi-open body design doesn't allow to connect a case while attaching the iPhone. \nThe only exception is the iPhone 6 / 6s that can be fitted with a silicon case - similar to Apple\u2019s original \u201cSilicon Case\u201d.\nAnd what about Pictar for Android?\nThe decision to develop Pictar for iPhone only was not easy, and it required a lot of thought and long discussions into the night. In the end we have our reasons:\n1. Development of app and operating system: Thanks to Apple's unified OS it was easier for us to develop software for iPhone than Android, so we decided to focus the project to avoid wasting resources and valuable time.\n 2. The physical size - the iPhone comes in a limited number of models. Android phones come in so many different shapes, sizes and thicknesses, it was easier for our designers to develop a body that fits most iPhone models then to tackle countless Android models.\n3. Focus! The Pictar project was extremely challenging - even for companies much bigger than miggo. So it was important for us to focus only on iPhones so we could come up with a production-ready prototype as quickly as possible - and make it as good as can be. Diversification on many platforms would have diverted us from our goal.\n                                                                                                                          From dream to reality\nEighteen months ago, Guy - one of the miggo partners - stole two hours of breathing space between meetings in New York to travel to the Ground Zero memorial site. Guy is an avid photographer but he left his DSLR in the office, so all he had on him to document the exciting site was his iPhone. The images he was able to shoot frustrated him to the point that he decided that the next miggo project will be an advanced grip-control for iPhone photographers.\nFast-forward 6 months: the miggo team prepare first sketches and begin to formulate designs. Very quickly we realized we were looking for a grip that will provide external control of the advanced and powerful iPhone camera. The process included searching for a suitable design concept of the Pictar body - one that resembled a camera without being too cumbersome.\nAt the same time we carried out a proper characterization of camera features which we would like to control externally: exposure, zoom, electronic shutter release, and more. Design took shape quite quickly - we knew from the start that it would look and feel like a classic camera. We examined a large number of sketches till we finally focused on the current direction. As you can see in the pictures, the process eventually led to the final result that we really love.\nSearching for the perfect shape\nThe next stage was the most difficult - how to make the external buttons operate the iPhone camera without a physical connection? The easiest solution - Bluetooth - was thrown out due to its tendency to \"hog\" power like there's no tomorrow, from both the iPhone itself and the grip.\nAdvanced 3D-printing models\nAlona and Dan\nA surprising solution came from an engineer who worked with us - using high-frequency sound waves of 18500-20000 kHz. The idea is that each external control emits a dual frequency when operated, that isn't detected by the human ear. Frequency duplication distinguishes between the frequencies produced by Pictar and similar frequencies that exist in the environment, thus avoiding false commands.\nThe specialized operating system we developed receives the frequencies and translates them into an order that results in an action. The great advantage of the system is its zero power consumption. A standard CR \u00bd AA battery in Pictar can last for up to 6 months, with reasonable use.\nThe picture above shows \"Albert\" - the experimental motherboard specially designed to simulate what Pictar knows how to do today. Clicking on each of the five buttons activating a high frequency which controlled the camera.\nWhile developing the voice system, we designed a dedicated app in collaboration with one of the best companies in the country. The app - free of course - offers even more control in terms of what the iPhone camera allows.\nWe also added straps and a padded pouch to keep everything nice and safe, and we were ready to go. So this is it - we are ready to manufacture and hope for the best. Looking back - this past year was exciting, challenging and especially intense for the development team, but the result is worth it all.\nYou may ask who we are and why are we here for the 3rd time?! Thanks for asking!\nFrankly, we believe in Kickstarter.\nWe believe the crowd funding is the best way for a small and ambitious company like us to quickly and efficiently reach the people for whom we work so hard to develop breakthrough products.\nWe like to listen.\nKickstarter is a wonderful place to hear exactly what people think about your product - long before it reaches the market. Just think about it - this is the best, largest and most professional focus group in the world! Your knowledge is invaluable and what's really cool is that people are happy to share their knowledge and experience - to help developers like us bring to market products that might not have been developed using the traditional way.\nThese are just some of the reasons we're here for the third time. This, and the adrenaline rush the campaign gives us, after so much hard work developing a product that we totally believe in.\nWe were here 2 years ago with our strap&wrap - the world's first camera strap that morphs into a compact protective carrier. The campaign raised 400% above target and our young company received a huge infusion of energy to continue developing innovative products.\nA year ago we were back again with agua - an ipx3 storm-proof quick-draw camera holster - this time we raised 800% of what we asked for, with only 2000 amazing backers.

Precisely because of this reason, we know that unexpected delays sometimes happen during manufacturing. To minimize risks, we have taken the following actions:\n\n1. We are assisted by a British engineering company which is a leader in its field in Europe. The company specializes in bringing products similar to Pictar to manufacturing stage, so we can ensure Pictar will enter production without a flaw.\n\n2. We secured an agreement with a leading European-owned manufacturer located in China, with a wealth of experience and a proven track record in the field of plastics, metal and delicate electronics.\n\n3. Our schedule takes into account unexpected delays, and the financial target we have set allows us to produce, pack and ship Pictar orders without any problems, so we are confident we can meet our commitments.\n\n4. In addition, this is the third time on Kickstarter and we have an impeccable reputation. In our two previous projects we successfully delivered to 100% of our backers - a total of over 3,500.

Then I published a post on my Medium account with the business\u2019 address and a little information about what they do and why I chose them. Whoever was following the project could go to that business in person and pick up the art for free, I just asked that in return they support that business in some way, like by buying something from them or posting about it online to help spread awareness. \nDiane Campbell, owner of The Candy Store, week #41\u2019s featured business, said, \u201cWe were so happy to be part of Vincent\u2019s amazing project, \u201852 Pick Up\u2019.

And it has indeed! I am forever grateful to have been asked to be a part of this and to see what comes from this gentleman.

From design options to shipping costs, I learned a great deal from self-publishing my last book and I want to take this book to the next level. My plan is to make another limited edition of 1000 museum quality books to celebrate and further benefit these independent shops. This 60+ page hardcover book will feature all 52 small businesses featured in the project, some interior design photography of the local shops, my experience throughout the year and all the original weekly pieces of art. Check out some of the prototype ideas below.\nMy plan after I satisfy all the Kickstarter backer rewards and deliver those books, is to distribute any remaining books amongst all 52 small businesses. They can keep 100% of the proceeds from their book sales.\nConcept Design Of Wood Book Cover\nPrototype Title Page\nPrototype Art Page\nPrototype Interior Page\nThe Backstory\nIn 2013, I gave away 365 pieces of my original art as a gift each day to the first person to ask for it, anywhere in the world. It was an amazing experience. Project 365 culminated in a 9x12-inch, 316-page, two time award winning book whose proceeds went to benefit the Children\u2019s Creativity Museum in San Francisco. \nProject 365 Book\nExample Finished Project 365 Books\nProject 365 Book: Example Interior Page\nProject 365 Book: Colored Head and Tail Bands\nThe Cost\nWhen I did the Project 365 book, I learned a great deal about what goes into producing a museum, high quality art book. I grossly underestimated my first Kickstarter campaign and estimated a goal of $11,000. I ended up using thicker, coated art paper, colored head and tail bands, hardcover stock, blind debossing the title into the cover, cloth bounding and running a special edition slipcase. My shipping charges were $60 per international book and I was selling the book on my campaign for $60 so that was a wash. And while it's mentioned in the fine print, I just didn't consider the 8% crowd funding fees which came off the top of my budget too. The quantity of books also play a big role and the per unit price will greatly depend on how many books are produced. I ended up with a total cost of roughly $20,000 to produce the book I wanted in both design and quantity. I was fortunate enough to raise $20,526 during my campaign, but the 8% of fees brought my total budget to $18,883.92.\nEven though the art was free, I'd never want to sacrifice quality in regard to the production of the books. It's important to me that the quality of the book lives up to the same standard so I personally covered any balance to make sure it was done right. After a year of hard work between my designer and I, the book was recognized and awarded \"Outstanding Book Of The Year: Best Book Arts Craftsmanship\" by the IPPY Awards and \"Best Art Book\" by the 2015 USA Best Book Awards. \nI'm really excited about this new book and being able to use all the past knowledge and experience to make it. I've determined this book will estimate at a cost of $20,354.00 which will cover all the design options, shipping charges and fees to produce. Of course, there could be minor design changes that will potentially shift this number up or down, but I will work with Global PSD to make sure it fits within budget. If the Kickstarter campaign goes beyond the funding goal, well, I'll just make an even higher quality book. :)\nThe Specs\nApproximately 60-70 pages. This is still under development as we're working out the final design. \nThe hardcover will be wood with the title burned into the cover, mimicking a vintage business sign. \nCloth spine with blind debossing\nDimensions approximately 9 x 9 inches \nSmythe swen book binding \nColored head and tail bands \n157 GSM art paper \nThe gicl\u00e9e prints are produced on an Epson 9900 utilizing the 11 color high dynamic range inkset, which results in a wide color gamut. Paper is conservation grade and acid free.\nThe Schedule\nA rough outline of the schedule looks like the following, although is subject to change based on any unforeseen production delays.\nKickstarter Campaign: April - May\nDesign: Layout and copy: June - July\nBook Production: July - September\nBulk Shipment to San Francisco: October\nPackaging and signing: November\nOut For Delivery: December\nThe Faces Behind the Window Sign\nI want to thank and give recognition to all 52 small business that were a part of 52 Pick Up!

White-Ti Oi now available\nTHE TALK\nTHE WHAT \nWe\u2019ve designed a bicycle bell, Oi. We think it\u2019s a bit different. We hope you like it. If you do, why not help us bring it to life?\nHello\nTHE WHY\nBike bells have been domed since they were invented in 1877. In which time we\u2019ve sent man to the moon, cloned a sheep, and created hundreds of different styles of beautiful bicycle, yet not reimagined this simple analogue device. What if it wasn\u2019t a dome? What if it didn\u2019t protrude from your handle bar like a blister?\nOh dear\nWe set out to design a totally new bell where form and function played an equal part. A bell with a beautiful tone, but also a remarkable style and choice of materials that embodies a rider\u2019s personality. We wanted to embrace a variety of riding genres, without compromising any.\nTHE WHO\nKnog is a bike accessory brand that is well know for its innovative design in bicycle lights and locks. Until now, we haven't focused on the humble bell. So what better way to test a revolutionary new product design than put it up on Kickstarter?\nSome Knog characters\nWe're designers first. A small team of hungry engineers and industrial & graphics creatives who like to challenge everything. Especially the basics. Especially the stuff that people don\u2019t think is worth changing. Yep, that\u2019s the stuff we like changing. \nTHE HOW \nThe Oi bell's shape originates from its home - the handle bar. Our design team explored hundreds of iterations in designing the style. Then tested and prototyped different widths, depths, materials, curvature, actuators, springs and more to get to the optimum design. \nStep 1: Scribbling\nStep 2: CADing (is that a word?)\nStep 3: Prototyping\nAs with all our designs that reach this stage, we have applied for patent and registered the design. //Design Registration applied for: No. 201610483 //Provisional Patent applied for: No. 2016900305\nTHE LOOK \nWhere bells usually protrude up or out, Oi doesn\u2019t. It appears to hover around the handle bars. In one sense, it's discreet. But in another, it stands out as unrecognisable.  \nYum\nSaucy\nTHE SOUND \nWe tested numerous prototypes to get the perfect pitch, length of ring, and volume. With a spring-loaded actuator built into the mount, the strike of the bell is firm and fast, allowing a good balance of volume and longevity of sound. Our bell actually has several pitch tones - one core and several supportive higher tones to ensure it's unmistakable and safely heard. To compare it to a musical instrument, where some bells play a single note, Oi plays a chord. Hear it here for yourself...\nPLAY\n\nThe bell-off...\nPLAY\n\nTHE FINISHES\nFrom left to right: Aluminium, Titanium, Brass, Copper, Black\nThere are five styles. The standard aluminium model comes in 4 finishes: brushed aluminium; brass-plated; copper-plated; and black. The top of the range, \"treat yourself\u201d model is made from titanium. \nTHE SIZE AND SPEC \nThe bells fit on almost all cylindrical bars. The SML Oi is for the common 22.2mm bar, and with the \"spacers\" that come in the pack, the LRG Oi is for all bar sizes up to 31.8mm. The Oi will also work on any aero bar with a 16mm cylindrical section (usually near the stem). \nDeets\nAfter you pledge, we'll be in touch to ask for your choice of size.\nTHE MOUNT \nWhat about the handle-bar cables? No worries. Built into the shape of the mount is a cable management system. So not only does it allow the bell to look and sound uninterrupted, it also helps gather your cables (for the organiser inside us all).\nWhat about getting it on the bar. Again, not a thing. Just pop it over, give it a quick tighten up, and you're good to go. No sliding down the handlebars, no dismantling and re-assembling.\nEasy on. No need to remove grips or cables.\nManage your cables\nTHE OI\nWE WILL CONTACT YOU AFTER THE CAMPAIGN (EARLY APRIL) TO REQUEST FOLLOWING INFO: \nSIZE\nFINISH \nENGRAVING TEXT (for \"Bells and Whistles\")\nDELIVERY ADDRESS \n---\nGALLERY\nThank you, backers.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\nProduction:\nWe\u2019re in the fortunate position of having many years of experience designing and manufacturing bike products.

The set of Ti-MQR is a 1/4\" shorter over all then the TK-MQR. It may not seem like much, but it is noticeable.  The Ti-MQR magnets are also a little weaker, however I haven't noticed it.\nCan I pledge for more than one Reward?\nI have introduced \"packs\" into the rewards, for this project please don't add on to your pledge like past projects. (Unless you are in the \"quick draw reward\")  The complexity on my end is already high, even tho it may not seem like it. We will have different color options which is hard to keep track of if adding on to your pledge.  I'm sorry if there isn't a Pack that suits your needs on this project.\nAren't your prices kind of high?\nWell, remember you are getting 2 (1 set). Lets look back to TiMaG, a 4 pack of para-cord mags were $56. Which translates to 2 sets of Ti-MQR for $36. So why is it $20 cheaper? It's cheaper because I know what I'm doing now, haha - no really. I have learned how to be more efficient.  I now have better equipment, etc.  So... I pass the savings on to you for supporting my project :) How often does that happen?\nWhat are the key rings you are using in the pictures?\nThey are the FREEkey accessory rings.  I originally included them with TK-MQR, however many people didn't care for them and used their own rings.  Currently no rings are included, but that may change as the project goes on.

I\u2019m a design engineer/maker/small business starter and I\u2019ve successfully completed 7 previous Kickstarter projects to date.\nI\u2019ve been able to create the Strong Like Bull Magnets brand and product line through multiple projects on Kickstarter. Magnets are cool and useful\u2026 and my previous projects have been well received. I\u2019m returning to Kickstarter to try to further broaden the SLB magnet lineup\u2026 this time with a smaller version I call TackMags.\nShaped like thumb tacks, TackMags are perfect for your refrigerator, whiteboard, or any steel surface you\u2019d like to \u2018tack\u2019 something to. \nI'm certainly not the first person ever to make a tack shaped magnet, but hopefully you'll like my unique version... a strong neodymium magnet coupled to a cool custom machined aluminum housing which as always sports the stamped Strong Like Bull logo (I still remember sketching the logo going on a few years ago now).\nDesigned to be not too small and not too large... TackMags utilize custom 8mm diameter high grade Neodymium Iron Boron magnets that have a respectable 'axially pull' specification of almost 6 lbs.  Axial pull specs are always a bit hard to visualize, so I like to describe magnet strength in terms of how many sheets of full size paper a single magnet will hold to a typical refrigerator... for TackMags, it's 21!  So for 'tacking' up a few envelopes, pictures, pizza coupons, or your kid's artwork... you're all set with these!\nWhile they\u2019re not the strongest magnets I've made, they still have a good amount of hold, much more than your average refrigerator magnet and the shape makes them easy to grasp and remove.\nI plan to deliver a certain portion of the rewards in December, for delivery prior to Christmas (timing requires this to be for US backers only). I've got machine shop time locked up already to make sure I can meet that goal.  If all of the limited quantity 'December delivery' rewards get pledged for, these 'overflow' rewards are scheduled for February fulfillment (along with any international backer rewards).\nTo keep things manageable, December TackMags are only being offered in a silver aluminum anodized finish.  If there ends up being 'overflow rewards' for February, I might add some anodize color options for those.\nTackMags will be packaged in clear 6-pack tubes making them super cool, super unique holiday gifts! Rewards are available from 1 to 5 individual six-pack tubes.  If you are looking for some awesome stocking stuffers, look no further!\nTackMags start with a custom machined aluminum magnet housing. I use my hobby lathe to make prototypes until I\u2019m happy with the design.\nIf the funding is successful, I will work with a professional machine shop to produce production quantities.  I can make some nice parts myself, but I'm pretty slow;)\nThe machined aluminum parts then go to a finishing shop to be anodized. Anodization is a hardcoat process to keep the magnets scratch free so they\u2019ll look good for a lifetime.  This time around, I'm going to have the machined parts sand blasted prior to anodize to get that textured, shimmery high-end look.\nNext comes the logo. I'm stamping after anodize this time around... this will save time and since I'm having these parts sandblasted, stamping afterwards will keep the logo crisp.  The big goal of my last project (Stick Magnets) was to fund the purchase of an \u2018impact stamp press\u2019 to allow for more precise and repeatable logo stamping.  \nThe impact press has been a great addition! Prior to having the press, I would stamp all the parts I made manually using a hand stamp and hammer (yes really!). The press works great and will be again utilized to mark the SLB logo on TackMags.\nThe last step is installing the high grade neodymium magnet. While I work with a machine shop to produce production quantity aluminum housing parts, I do all of the final assembly, inspection, packaging, and shipping myself. \nI stepped up packaging a bit on this project to make the magnets a bit more 'present-able'.  Cool, clear tubes, with an SLB logo cap.\nWhile I've managed to build Strong Like Bull Magnets into a small business, I still find it useful to test the waters on Kickstarter before committing to a new product addition.  Beyond gauging 'market interest', a successful Kickstarter provides me with scale... or the ability to order materials and components in large quantities to get prices to an attractive level. So if you're interested in some custom magnets, as always, I'd appreciate your support!\nAs noted above, I have lots of experience and a good track record on Kickstarter. Big thanks to Kickstarter for such a cool platform!\nLastly, you can keep track of me at these places...\nWebsite: StrongLikeBullMagnets.com or SLBmagnets.com\nBlog: SpokeDesignBlog.com\ntwitter:  @SLBmagnets\nInstagram: @stronglikebullmagnets\nFacebook: StrongLikeBullMagnets\nAlso... if you back for one on the 'December Delivery' reward tiers, please make sure you have your email & update notifications turned on for this project so you don't miss the Survey notice... timing is tight on this one, so if we fund, I'll need surveys done promptly:)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTackMags is my 10th Kickstarter project attempt (two did not fund).

Pulse plugs into your DSLR or Mirrorless camera's USB port, so whether you're shooting photos, time lapse, or video, you get complete creative freedom - remotely from your smartphone - with your current camera. \nISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed Control\nPulse's strength comes from its 100' bluetooth low energy radio, advanced USB control software, and a beautifully designed interface. We wanted a product that could handle your biggest project ideas - from day-long time lapses to your next backpacking trip. Because of its size you can take Pulse anywhere, and thanks to what it can do you'll never want to leave it behind. \nGet image thumbnails wirelessly on your phone.\nWith image preview you can view thumbnails on your phone right after you take a photo, at a range of up to 100 feet. Whether your camera is sticking out a 5th floor window or you're warming up while it braves the cold, Pulse has you covered so you can still get the perfect shot.\nPulse plugs into your camera's USB port and is compatible with just about any Canon or Nikon DSLR (and now the Panasonic GH4), and the Pulse app is free for both iPhone and Android devices. Want to confirm that your camera is compatible? Check the FAQ at the bottom of this page.\nWant Pulse to work with your Sony camera?! So do we! See the FAQ for the full explanation.\nGet group photos, without having to race back into the shot.\nWhether you're part of the shot, or not, there are a lot of times where it is just nice not to have to stand behind your camera. With Pulse, you can set up your camera and trigger it from anywhere in the room. Pulse's Bluetooth connection allows you to roam as you need to and gives you a range of up to 100 feet from your camera.\nGlacier Point, Yosemite\nShooting in low light requires you to keep your camera absolutely still. Pulse makes it easier than ever to get the shot you want, and allows you to leave your shutter open for up to several hours, or as little as a few seconds. In long exposure mode you can either lock the shutter down manually and then release it, or set the exposure to a timer and just let it count down until it is finished. Pulse also supports HDR capabilities for differing lighting conditions!\nGet epic star trails with Pulse's Long Exposure feature!\nAnd don't worry! The light on Pulse blinks before it takes a photo so that it won't mess up the lighting of your shot, and you can always turn it off or dim it if needed. \nWe've spent the last 4 years making the smartest time lapse products on the market. Pulse builds on all of our previous work, and makes time lapse easier than ever for first timers whilst expanding the features and level of control for experienced shooters. \nOne of the biggest issues with traditional triggers is the inability to know when things have gone wrong. With Pulse's USB control your camera will get every single frame, and the app will let you know about problems (like low battery or buffering time) before they ruin your shoot.\nMost remote triggers only let you do one thing - take photos. Because Pulse plugs into your camera's USB port and not the trigger port, it has the ability to let you control video as well. \nPulse allows you to control up to three Pulse-equipped cameras at once - all from the same smartphone. This is especially useful for independent film makers or really anyone who has more cameras than they have camera hands. With Pulse, you can be everywhere at once and make sure you get all the right angles for your shot, even if you are just a crew of one. \nTo add more than one Pulse to your order (up to 3), just add $74 to your pledge for each additional Pulse and your shipping cost will stay the same!\nPulse's Exposure Ramping features allows you to ramp your ISO and shutter speed so that you can capture day-to-night transitions (the \"Holy Grail\" of time lapses) without having to touch your camera. We've designed this feature specifically to work with LRTimelapse. \nUnlike shooting in Aperture or Shutter Priority, Exposure Ramping keeps your camera in manual so that your photo's EXIF-Data is written properly for LRTimelapse workflows.\nWhen we first got started we were inspired to make better tools for motion time lapse. From that inspiration we built Radian, Michron, and Radian 2 - and brought them all to life through Kickstarter. This last year we got excited about remote camera control and the kinds of shots that remote control allows you to get.\nNow we are back on Kickstarter to make Pulse. One of the big pieces of feedback that we got from our users and backers was that smartphone-enabled wireless camera control would not only make for better time lapses, but would open up a higher level of general photography to more people. We also wanted to make something that fit beautifully with your camera and felt like a natural extension of your camera's aesthetic and function. \nThanks to our work with Radian 2 we had a huge head start on the electronics. And while there was some PCB trickery (or fun as Steve calls it) to get it all to fit into our enclosure, we are really happy with where it's all at. \nInitial drawing brainstorm on the Pulse mechanical design\nA few of the early Pulse protos.\nWhy yes, there are 2 double sided PCBs in there - good eye!\nPress Kit \nFull resolution photos and videos can be found in the Dropbox Link above and on Vimeo below. \nFull Resolution Video\nWe are a team of friends with a love for taking photos (especially time lapses!) and building things.  It all started in 2012 when Kris had the need for a motion time lapse device and was disappointed with what was available. Kris teamed up with his friends and roommates Kevin, Marcus and Steve to create the first Radian Kickstarter campaign. After delivering on Kickstarter and running out of Radian stock, the team put Radian sales on pause as some of the team moved to other jobs to keep up with bills as others finished up school.\nIn 2013, Steve teamed up with Greg to test the idea of a new stationary time lapse device and launched Michron on Kickstarter. They successfully delivered 4500 Michrons two weeks ahead of schedule in early 2014. With renewed momentum, we started a new manufacturing run of Radians, brought Greg and Michron onto the team, and started tinkering with some new product ideas. This last spring we launched Radian 2, the most advanced motion time lapse device on the market. Now we are back on Kickstarter to build Pulse and we cannot wait to see what you do with it.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.

Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter campaign! With your help, we can bring the newest GoWorx\u00ae product to life. We did it last year with our best selling GoKnuckles, and we're excited to work with this community to do it again! Please enjoy, and help us share if you dig it.\nWe set out on a (product design) journey to change the way you mount and use your Smartphone to capture creatively. Today, we are ready to introduce you to FreeRide - a versatile and fully adjustable Smartphone Mount that enables you to simply and securely attach your Smartphone (with or without a case) to pretty much anything, anywhere! The FreeRide Smartphone Mount features both of the world's most popular camera mounting systems:\n(1) You're free to directly connect your Smartphone to any mount or accessory designed for GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras, including existing GoWorx products!\n(2) The included tripod adapter allows you to attach your Smartphone to any traditional camera mount (with universal \u00bc\u201d-20 threads).\n\nPictured with: (Top) GoPro\u00ae Suction Cup, (Bottom-left) GoPro\u00ae Handlebar Mount + Pole Mount, (Bottom-right) GoPro\u00ae Handlebar / Seatpost / Pole Mount\nFreeRide opens up a world of possibilities, whether you own a GoPro\u00ae HERO camera or not. We gave your Smartphone a secure connection to any mount that works with GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras. With thousands of different styles and purpose built mounts on the market, you've got creative control with your Smartphone. If you're already a GoPro enthusiast, now you've got another mountable camera to capture additional angles and take your film making to the next level! FreeRide also works great as a way to mount and control your phone when using the GoPro\u00ae App.\nPictured with: (Top) The Original Handle + GoPro\u00ae Handlebar / Seatpost / Pole Mount + GoPro\u00ae App, (Bottom-left) GoKnuckles, (Bottom-right) The Original Handle Pro + Aftermarket Lens System\nFreeRide is 100% compatible with all the existing mounts designed by us here at GoWorx. When hooked up with our GoKnuckles, you'll have an ultra-portable and super functional \"handsfree\" grip for your Smartphone! Paired with The Original Handle and GoPro's Handlebar mount, FreeRide allows you to use your Smartphone as a display to view and control the GoPro\u00ae App - so you can adjust settings, and frame your shots perfectly.\nPictured with: Professional and consumer tripod styles\nLeave your bulky DSLR camera at home. FreeRide lets you take the world's most popular camera (your Smartphone) and use it with traditional camera mounts and equipment like Tripods! Get ready to leverage your Smartphone's awesome camera features like Slow Motion and Time Lapse to their fullest extent.\nThis is our favorite part. We're finding exciting and unexpected applications for FreeRide every day! From simple solutions like mounting your Smartphone on your car dash - to the unexpected, like strapping your Smartphone to a 50mph RC car! We even sent our Smartphone to the skies on board a drone. We love the DIY (do-it-yourself) culture, which is why we love to design tools that empower you to be even more creative.\nWe designed FreeRide to ensure it'll stand up to your demands in any environment. The main body components are injection molded with a high-strength and impact resistant Polycarbonate. The hardware is precision machined from AISI 304 Stainless Steel and perfectly safe for use in fresh or salt water. The padding is a premium grade Urethane rubber with 100% recovery (will not deform) that securely and safely holds your Smartphone.\nAbout GoKnuckles: Hit the streets, surf, and snow with the most awesome way to mount and use your GoPro\u00ae HERO camera and Smartphone! GoKnuckles are an incredibly functional and ultra-portable \"handsfree\" mount.\nAbout The Original Handle: Leave your bulky camera gear at home and keep it simple with The Original Handle for your GoPro\u00ae HERO camera and Smartphone! Capture larger than life perspectives and stabilize your photos and videos with ease.\n   Our Timeline:\nHere's a snapshot of our timeline! Once we know we're well on our way to our funding goal, we can expedite our tooling phase, and hopefully get your FreeRide Smartphone Mounts shipped early! We've built in some extra time for fine tuning the first production samples so we can make sure we've refined every possible detail.\n                               Can my Smartphone take a FreeRide?\nFreeRide fits all Smartphones (with or without a case) between 56.5-86.5mm wide.

Sorry we missed you! Please send us a message or leave a note in the comments and we'll be happy to help.\nWe asked hundreds of photographers, cinematographers, and action-adventure enthusiasts about the cameras, mounts, and accessories in their bag(s). Here\u2019s what we learned:\nThe majority of GoPro\u00ae and DSLR camera users owned multiple camera mounts for different activities and shot requirements.\nEveryone's using their Smartphone to capture photos and video.\nFew had the tools necessary to securely attach their Smartphone to the mounts they already owned - but almost everyone wanted the ability to!\nSo, what if you could attach your Smartphone to pretty much anything, anywhere? Good question, right? We used our insights and questions as the basis of our design process. Realizing there's a camera mount designed for just about every purpose, we knew we had a compatibility issue. We quickly identified both of the world's most popular camera mounting systems - those designed for GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras, and those designed for traditional camera equipment like tripods. We researched, bought, and tested every product that had at least 1 similar function. What did we find? Too heavy, not secure enough, poorly designed, no versatility, etc. After 8 months, and 15 prototypes, we have developed a solution that meets the creative and performance demands of today's photographers, cinematographers, and action-adventure enthusiasts.\nGoWorx is a team of designers, entrepreneurs, photographers, filmmakers, and action-adventure enthusiasts based in Asheville, North Carolina. We joined together to create performance and lifestyle products fused with innovation, simplicity, originality, and style. We design and manufacture mounts and accessories for GoPro HERO\u00ae cameras - and now Smartphones! Our products have been adopted by photo/video enthusiasts, action sports athletes, and adventurers throughout the world seeking to capture and share their experiences more creatively. If you share our passions for high-quality media content and extraordinary products \u2013 we invite you to join us.\nJoin our Community!\nWe're fortunate to have an incredible network of fans and brand ambassadors around the world creating epic media content.

Come along for the ride; It's going to be EPIC :)\nYou will love the TUKK, I promise; there have been no dissatisfied backers in any of my projects.\nThe TUKK 100% USA Made, between Jess in Utah and me in Iowa!

Kickstarter gives the ability for a \"normal guy\" to do what he loves. (I suggest YOU do a project, I'll help you) I have set out to make things that you can ACTUALLY use. \nIt's true I don't have a fancy page, pay for photography, or video.  You are getting 100% me in these projects.  Many people have said my projects are very unique in that my heart is in these projects, it's not a money show for me.\nThere have been a crazy amount of \"keychains\" since I first launched my Bottle Grenade; that aren't actually usable/functional.  Kind of upsetting really, but no worries you are here now. So lets make this story together, as the project goes on :)\n---\nSince pictures don't really do the TUKK justice, I opted to make this project more about the video. So please watch this video if you are interested in seeing more about it and how to use it.\n---\nMy Goal (Thanks Jess Proctor)\nMy goal is $1000, that is for purchasing the Titanium in bulk. $50 is \"cheap\" for a Titanium Utility Knife. There have been a few larger versions (including my own TK-RZR) but nobody had really tackled the small and actually carriable (that's a word... right?) utility knife.  The hobby blade idea comes from Jess Proctor of the \"Gear-a-biner\"  so Jess is a part of this project, and he will be making the Brass button for the TUKK.  I'll make the Titanium cases, and if I happen to get behind, I'm sure he will pick up some of the slack, haha - Thanks Jess!\n---\nBecause the TUKK uses magnets, it's magnetic enough to hold itself on metal objects, perfect to keep it handy.\nSlightly Magnetic!

The parts were not tumbled to perfection. Many little details you may never notice, I notice :)\nProduction:\nAll parts will be made on a CNC mill, which means tolerances around .001\" (1 thousandths of an inch) - if it's it's not perfect, it goes in the recycle bin. All parts will be tumbled in a special media for up to 24 hours to be sure it's as smooth as a baby's... well.. you get the idea :)\nSo as you can see the Prototype is just that. I try very hard to make my Prototypes look like the Production units.

Anyone (Yes! That means you!) can be part of the Lost family, if you have an adventure to share - we want to see it! - go to lostquarterly.com to submit your work!\n\nEnvironmentalism Lost hopes to create and share products made through environmentally friendly/sustainably responsible practices. Our goal is to foster environmentalism and a deep appreciation for nature with our audience. We hope to find and partner with as many companies as possible that consider themselves aligned to this mission. In turn we will share our findings with our audience through our quarterly publication. \nFront Cover Shot by Sam Ciurdar @samciurdar\n Why Lost? It's been a long time goal of mine to create a space where artists can share their work, thoughts and ideas on travel and push for creating a better planet. We all experience wanderlust and the desire to be somewhere else and that is exactly where Lost takes you, it's an adventure in itself. On one page you'll be deep in the forests of Oregon and the next you'll be on the edge of a cliff in South Africa. Its a place where you can learn about brands and companies that are working to better the planet as well as admire some beautifully composed scenes at the same time and the artists behind them. It is something you can directly contribute to and be part of, something you can hold in your hands and a community you can be part of. If you make a submission we'll go over it and review how you can contribute to this growing community. \nPhoto by Rachel Claire @fieldnotes__\n Issue 1 - In the first issue of Lost Quarterly we explore Wales, Scotland, South Africa, North America, Canada and Australia with some talented individuals. Travel journals, small bios, Q&A's on life & editing images as well as one or two product reviews. \n\nWe've come up with different themes for future issues of Lost that you can be part of. Our next issue is story based and will consist of stories of adventures taking place right now, all over the world. Looking even further ahead we wanted to dedicate a whole issue to photographers' most meaningful and inspiring images and what it took to create them.\nphotos by Joel Bear\nphoto & artwork by Anelise Salvo\nphoto by Jeremy Roloff\nphotos by Tristan Austria\nphotos and text by Rebecca Lader\nshare your adventure #lostatlast\n\"LOST QUARTERLY helps us realize that more luxurious moments await us beyond the complexities of integrated native programming, yoga mats and whatever we think Apple will do next.\"  - Patrick Hanlon, Forbes contributor \nPartners \nOur amazing partners each aligning with our mission of adventure\nContributors -  \nYou - Join the Lost family! \nJoin us!

You might be thinking, there are tons of cleaning products out there, how is VERDAY different? We believe VERDAY outperforms them all... AND it is 100% green.\nINDUSTRIAL STRENGTH - BUT COMPLETELY SAFE\nOur products are tough enough to remove tar, paint, ink and adhesives, yet safe enough to clean children's toys and furniture. It's NSF certified to be safe when used around food and is pH-balanced, hypo-allergenic, VOC free, safe on skin and all surfaces. If you support safer products, an eco-friendly lifestyle, and are basically green freaks like us, please support us. It means the world to us, but more importantly it is good for the world.\n32 oz. Multi-Purpose Spray & 40 Count Dual-Textured Wet Scrubs\nGO GREEN. BE A GREEN FREAK LIKE US!\nOnce the people of the world experience firsthand how well VERDAY works, they will never buy or use toxic cleaning products again. That's our goal - to disrupt toxicity. This is a technology that is here to stay. All of the active components are plant-based and sustainable. Your donations empower us to build minimum inventory levels of our key form factors (wipes, spray, refills, concentrate). Producing small batches of the finished products is inefficient and makes the product difficult to distribute and more expensive. Your donations give us resources to buy raw materials in bulk to manufacture large batches and make ready-to-use finished goods in minimum quantities required by our contract manufacturers, which drives down costs substantially and these savings will be used to make the product more affordable to consumers. \nTed Cote and Zack Gorlick at 500 Startups\nTRUE ECO-FRIENDLY PACKAGING\nYour donations also enable us to utilize new Ecologic packaging that is made with 100% recycled newspaper and cardboard and 70% less plastic than normal containers.\nFuture packaging - outer shell is made of 100% cardboard and newspaper and the inner liner uses 70% less plastic than normal plastic containers\nWHERE WILL I BUY VERDAY?\nOnce we have inventory built from your help, you will be able to purchase VERDAY products ala carte and by subscription directly from www.verday.com and eventually through select retailers as demand grows.\nPLEDGE REWARD HIGHLIGHTS\nVERDAY Step-Mop System and Accessories\nSupport us and get an awesome VERDAY Rickshaw Bagworks Messenger Bag or Backpack - Made in SF - Choice of colors (Olive and Ranger)\nVERDAY Sutro Backpacks\nVERDAY Messenger Bag\nVERDAY Clean & Store (Caddie Stores in Bucket)\nVERDAY Sink Caddie\nVERDAY Green Freak Tote Bag\nVERDAY Green Freak Hoody\n\nJOIN THE FOUNDING TEAM IN COSTA RICA\nPlease consider joining the founders for a week in Costa Rica for our first annual Green Retreat where we plan our global expansion strategy and evaluate green technologies.

Since The Catalyst's debut on January 30th, 2014 at the Isla Vista Food Co-op (our farm-to-the-table grocery store), our passionate crew has put out four quarterly magazines and three launch events in Isla Vista. Every magazine launch manifests itself into a full-fledged art festival, with live bands, interactive art displays, spoken word performances and goods sold by local artisans.\nLaunch Event, Issue 4\nThe Catalyst was born in April of 2013 in a cramped but cozy UCSB office. Since then, the project has evolved so much that it truly embodies its name: Catalyst. It has become clear that our crowning accomplishment is not the product (the magazine), but the process (building and sharing the magazine). So many talented, beautiful and brilliant students and staff have carried this project issue after issue. The designers, artists and writers who participate in the creation of our magazine are passionate about what they do. We are bringing that same passion to this campaign.\nThe Catalyst is always evolving. Our printed magazines circulate at 1,000 copies, and we also offer a free online publication. With the content we publish, the events we put on, and the topics we discuss, we aim to continue as a catalytic publication. With your help, we can make this goal a reality by funding our printing costs for 2015 - 2016.\nThis spring, we handed out our fifth issue. We don\u2019t want it to be the last.\nWe are fighting. We are artists. We need to create.\nWe need your help.\nIssue 3 Launch Event\nEvery issue of The Catalyst has been funded by last-minute gestures of kindness from all corners of UCSB, from the English Department to Associated Students Finance Board.\nEvery printing sessions costs close to $5,000 dollars, meaning each individual magazine costs close to $5 to print. \nIt\u2019s been a wild ride, one that has been cherished and honored. But we need financial security so our artistic vision is not compromised because of a broken piggy bank. \nThe Catalyst was built from nothing, and in a short time, in an age where digital trumps print, this team has produced five magazines, four art festivals and countless connections between local creatives. Imagine what we could do with your support.\nThe Catalyst is, first and foremost, a magazine. The magazine is filled with submission-based poetry and prose. It\u2019s not journalistic. Poetry and prose get matched with an artist, who then produces an original piece of work in reaction to the words. \nThe words and art are arranged together with design that is equally creative to the artwork within, and an intimate, printed experience is formed. Each printing of 1,000 copies are distributed among the community, starting at our Catalyst launch events. \nOur content and design are produced almost entirely by students with the goal of creating a collection of works that represent the art community within Isla Vista. The Catalyst team has been scrounging up funds for its past five publications so that anyone can have free access to these artworks and words, either online or in print. \nAdam Reading His Published Poetry\nThe Catalyst launch event is put on with the release of every magazine issue. In collaboration with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative, the Catalyst puts on an arts festival, which showcases local artists, bands and craft vendors. \nLocated on the IV Food Co-op's patio, the festival is our way of celebrating the creative culture that has acted as the heart of IV. \nThe Isla Vista Food Cooperative, Sweet Alley and other local businesses have supported the Catalyst in the past. We hope to continue giving back to our community with the help of your support now.\nWhile the main focus of the event is to showcase our printed matter, getting the new magazine is just the tip of the creative iceberg. Upon entering one of these shindigs, you can expect to be embraced by the sound of music from local bands, interactive art installations, spoken word performances, artisan crafters, eats from the Co-op and a whole lotta dancing. \nIt\u2019s a celebration of art, music, words and the thread of locality sewn through everyone at UCSB, our home Isla Vista.\nThe team that puts the magazine and the launch party together is a mixture of painters, photographers, poets, aspiring novelists, designers, comic-book enthusiasts and musicians. Everyone involved in The Catalyst brings something to the table and fine tunes their craft in the process. The beauty of the collective is that it\u2019s a forum open for everyone and connecting all.\nOur base fundraising goal of $10,000 will cover a print run of 1,000 copies of our Fall 2015 issue, reward fulfillment and our launch event.\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing crowdfunding platform, meaning that if we do not reach our goal, we will not receive any of the pledges made by you, our generous backers. That is why we\u2019ve chosen to create \u201cstretch goals\u201d \u2013 goals beyond our base funding we must reach in order to continue publication throughout the whole year.\nAt $15,000, we\u2019ll be able to fund the printing of two issues and one event, along with fulfilling all rewards.\nAt $20,000, we\u2019ll cover two issues and two fantastic launch events.\nAt $25,000, we\u2019ll cover our launch and print costs for an entire year.\nReaching our full $25,000 goal will also allow us to jumpstart the Catalyst Store, a print-on-demand site where we will curate and sell select prints, unique shirts, mugs and other items based on contributor artwork. This means: the community gets even more great art to surround themselves with, artists will be paid for their work and we will continue to sustain our production costs.\nWe are thankful for all forms of your support.

Urban planners and politicians predicted that cycling would soon wither to nothing, and they did their level best to bring about this extinction by catering only for motorists. And then something strange happened \u2013 bicycling bounced back, first in America and then in Britain. Today's global bicycling boom \u2013 even the one in the Netherlands \u2013 has its roots in the early 1970s.\nAnd this is what I'd like to explore in Bike Boom, a book that will use history to shine a spotlight on the present, and demonstrate how bicycling in the future has the potential to grow even further, if the right measures are put in place by the politicians and planners of today and tomorrow.\nTARGET HIT \u2013 NOW FOR SOME STRETCH GOALS\nThanks to 320 backers \u2013 as of this second on 11th March \u2013  my project is safely over the funding target. This means I am now locked in to researching and writing Bike Boom. However, the campaign is still live and there's another 6 days available for people to bag rewards. With more funds I can add more stuff,\n\u00a39,000 \u2013 All backers of the posted rewards will get a Bike Boom bookmark.\n\u00a310,000 \u2013 The hardback and softback books will get a 24-page colour plate section.\n\u00a312,500 \u2013 All backers of the posted rewards will get a Bike Boom poster. This will feature a huge number of people on bicycles with a headline calling for more cycling facilities to be provided in order to cater for the growing demand. Backers can stick this up at home, or they could sneak in to a planner's office and stick it somewhere prominent ...\n\u00a315,000 \u2013 I'm only printing enough copies of the first edition to fulfil Kickstarter rewards. However, if I reach \u00a315,000 in pledges I'll print an extra 20 copies and send them, gift-wrapped, to individual planners, politicians or other powers-that-be. The recipient list will be up to you \u2013 I'll send out a poll to see who should get mailed with books. How about the US Secretary of Transportation or the UK's Transport Secretary? \nI'm Carlton Reid and I've been writing about bicycles for 30 years, starting with articles about bicycle travels in the Middle East in the 1980s. I'm the executive editor of trade magazine BikeBiz.com and am the author of nine books, two of which weren't about cycling (but both were written from the saddle of a mountain bike \u2013 the Berlitz Discover Guide to Israel, 1993, and Lebanon: A Travel Guide, 1995). \nBetween 1998 and 1999 I published the general interest On Your Bike magazine which catered to family cyclists and those thinking of starting or returning to cycling. This was for normal people in ordinary clothes, and I even had a Dutch journalist as an employee, who wrote features on Groningen.\nWhile I have a strong interest in cycling for transport (my everyday bike is an Xtracycle cargo bike, not the touring bike seen in the video above) the boom in cycling is much wider than this. Bike Boom will explore all aspects of the growth in cycling \u2013 from Hackney hipsters, to tall-bike jousting in Portland, Oregon, as well as the growth of track-cycling in the UK (count the velodromes we have today which we didn't have 20 years ago).\nBike Boom is a follow-up to Roads Were Not Built For Cars, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2013, and sent out to backers last year.\nBike Boom will be available in a Kickstarter-only limited print-run first edition and will also be available as an ePub file and for Kindle devices and apps, and there will be a multi-media iPad version, too.\nThe first print edition of Roads Were Not Built For Cars was sold out within days and such has been the demand for this quickly out-of-print book I've heard Twitter tales of offline meet-ups between strangers for the book to be borrowed. The iPad edition went to number one in the history category on iTunes. The Kindle edition made it to number one on Amazon.com, in the automotive category. \n#1 on Amazon.com (automotive category)\nRoads Were Not Built For Cars has also received rave reviews in the mainstream media, and on Amazon.com and iTunes (it's a 5-star book on both platforms). A purchaser on Amazon called it \"outstanding\". The Guardian said it was \u201c \u2026 closely argued, meticulously researched ...\" \nDr. Robert Davis, of the Road Danger Reduction Forum, wrote: \u201cThis book \u2026 fascinates with a steady stream of revelatory contemporary views on who roads were for. As such it is \u2026 a contribution to the debates we should be having now on transport policy.\u201d\nNick Clayton, one of the world's top cycle historians and founder of the International Cycle History Conference, wrote: \"\"This volume is the cycle history dissertation for our age \u2026 [with] fascinating snippets not noted elsewhere \u2026 None of the old cycling myths are regurgitated; the prose and proof-reading are beyond reproach \u2026 I cannot recommend this book more highly.\"\nTrials riding superstar Hans \"No Way\" Rey was brief but to the point: \u201cInteresting read \u2026 City councils should take note.\u201d\nI would like to think that Bike Boom would be just as well-received. It could also generate a great deal of interest in the mainstream, especially as bicycling is now rising up the political agenda, and the next generation of planners are being taught to plan for mass mobility for growing populations not just mobility for motor cars.\nRichard Ballantine's intro from the 1975 edition of Richard's Bicycle Book\nBike Boom will aim to dig down into historical sources to find out how the Netherlands built a world-class network of bicycle paths \u2013 and much of the rest of the world didn't. I'd also like to interview the bicycle advocates and planners of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (and those of today, too) to hear their stories, and learn from their successes and their mistakes.\nNew Scientist, 1981.\nREWARDS\nPlease consider this your invitation to become a backer of Bike Boom. You\u2019ll get a first edition book (or one of the digital versions) as a reward, and you\u2019ll also be along for the ride, helping me to take publishing decisions such as choosing cover artwork, suggesting avenues of research and giving me your opinions. \nYou'll also get backer-only previews of some of the book\u2019s findings and lots of other insider stuff not available in any other way. Depending on the pledge level you'll also get an invite to the book launch party.\nFront and back cover dummy, with spine (not final cover)\nI have some rough ideas about the book's eventual findings but, as I discovered with Roads Were Not Built For Cars, focussed historical research can uncover forgotten facts which can lead to new understandings. \nToday's boom is, in many places, not as dramatic as it's sometimes portrayed, witness the many media mentions of \"Cycling is the new golf.\" Nevertheless, cycling is in a very different place to where it was twenty years ago and it'll be very worthwhile to pin down the reasons for its recent growth, even if this growth, outside of the Netherlands, is in pockets rather than widespread. Can those pockets be joined up? What works best for increasing cycle use, infrastructure alone or a mix of infrastructure and other measures? How much of an impact does the societal status of cycling have on levels of cycle use? Does the use of language matter \u2013 is it cyclists or people on bicycles? Is there a link between unfettered motor-car use and levels of cycling? What worked in the Netherlands, big national campaigns or lots of smaller local ones? How have cycle touring holidays helped many localities stay afloat? Does a strong racing scene lead to more utility riding? Do die-ins and \"White bicycles\" lead to more or less safety for cyclists? What led to the success of events such as the Tweed Run and the increasing number of Eroica rides?\nIf you join me in this Kickstarter journey you'll be an integral part of finding the answers to these questions and many more.\nAmbassador Cycle Route 1981 - Ken Clarke, British Minister for Transport, riding while carrying a bike sign.\nREWARD LEVELS\nThe rewards consist of:\n\u00a31+ \u2013 no product shipped but you get a warm glow.\n\u00a38  \u2013 Kindle/ePub file\n\u00a317 \u2013 Hi-res Kindle file\n\u00a319 \u2013 iPad file\n\u00a319 plus postage \u2013 Softback book, mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a329 plus postage \u2013 Softback & Kindle/ePub file, book mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a331 plus postage \u2013 Softback & iPad version, book mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a332 plus postage \u2013 Hardback, mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a344 plus postage \u2013 Hardback & Kindle/ePub file, book mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a346 plus postage \u2013 Hardback &iPad version, book mailed to the UK or internationally.\n\u00a3107 \u2013 Patron level. 1 hardback sent to UK or internationally plus any digital file, plus name/logo to be placed at front of book.

I also have a great many libraries to visit, in real life and virtually. Next comes the interviewing. I have drawn up a list of people around the world I want to interview and will attempt to visit them face-to-face. I'm sure Kickstarter backers will suggest more.\nIt's likely the research phase will last at least seven months. I'll be writing chapters as I go along, but working solidly on the words for at least three full months. Copy editing and indexing will take about a month. My copy editor on Roads Were Not Built For Cars was former diplomat Martin Rickerd and my indexer was Nicola King \u2013 I will ask them both to team up on Bike Boom. \nPrinting takes another month. All told, that's roughly a year. Add on another month for good measure and that's how I determined the publication date being April 2016.\nWhat's the money for?\nI raised \u00a317,407 on Kickstarter for Roads Were Not Built For Cars. That sounds like a lot but not when you start to add up the costs. Kickstarter takes a cut, the copy editor has to eat and so has the indexer. For ethical and eco reasons the roads book was printed in Cornwall not China, and this is more expensive. Bike Boom will also be printed in the UK.\nMany of the archive illustrations in the roads book were out of copyright and required no payment but many were held by photo libraries and museums, and had to be paid for. The same will be the case for Bike Boom. I'll also be paying photographers for their work \u2013 for instance, the back cover shot of all those London cyclists in a less-than-ideal Advanced Stop Line box was taken by Toby Jacobs and he's going to be renumerated.\nThe cover you see on this page is highly unlikely to be the final one. It's probable I'll commission an artist to produce a different cover. The two elements of the cover for Roads Were Not Built For Cars (artwork and typographical logo) cost me \u00a31200. There's a breakdown of the costs for my previous book here.\nBut that's not the full breakdown, it doesn't include postage and packing. This is one of the biggest costs of the project after printing.\nCan I help in other ways?\nYes, please. It would be wonderful if you could share this Kickstarter project with everybody you know, on Twitter, Facebook, on forums, down the pub, on bike rides, and feel free to email it to friends and family.\nPress kit\nMedia folk can get more info, and downloadable hi-res pix, via the online press kit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt will take about a year to research and write Bike Boom. The interviews \u2013 for instance with members of Stop De Kindermoord (Stop the child murder) in the Netherlands, and with organisers of the original \"sportive\" rides \u2013 cannot be rushed. \n\nKickstarter backers of Roads Were Not Built For Cars received 72 emailed updates on the progress of the research. I was late with the publication of that book but backers were kept fully informed of the reasons for the delays and were wonderfully kind and supportive. \n\nI learnt a lot from the work on Roads Were Not Built For Cars and plan to use that experience in the workflow for Bike Boom. \n\nThe shipping of my first Kickstarter book was a much more difficult process than I'd imagined. I thought, with help from my kids, it would take a week. Nope. It took a month, and so much of it required my input (I signed lots of the books) I was able to farm out very little to my kids (which was to their financial detriment). This time around I have a much better idea of what's required and can plan accordingly. I'll still be signing books \u2013 for those who want this option \u2013 but I'll be using a fulfilment house.

I am not a clumsy guy, but when it comes to handling my smartphone, I totally feel like one. These devices got so small and fragile; it only takes one little unfortunate slip and\u2026 BAAM. Like many of you, I once broke my phone. Another time, I almost flushed it down the toilet! Uncool.\nSo I started thinking, what if there was a little leash on my phone, like on cameras and key sets? I started experimenting with duct tape and plastic parts, and soon came up with something that would prove to be very useful. With this gadget on her phone, my girlfriend was now able to walk out the door with her bag in one hand, scarf, keys and coffee in the other, and her phone to her wrist like a bracelet! As for me, when out on the town, I preferred the loop around my fingers. Soon enough, friends started asking for loops that matched their cases, which lead to case-matching improvements.\nAfter many tries and enhancements, I finally came up with a one-size-fits-all loop for hand-held devices: the petite loop! No more dropping your iPhone on your face while texting in bed, no more losing your Galaxy at the bottom of your bag, no more Nexus down the toilet\u2026 eew! With that petite loop on your phone, you can now reach, drag, find, and hold your phone without ever skipping a beat.\nJP Brousseau, Looper\nYes, we believe that fashion and technology are like peanut butter and jelly.

SnapShirt will serve as a tool for designers looking to start their own clothing companies or help the people who simply want to share their creativity with the world. It has potential to become the go-to platform for artists, entrepreneurs, families, and more.\nThe possibilities are endless, and this is only the beginning.\nBack in 2010, we started a clothing line called Let\u2019s Rage. Despite impressive growth, there were some intense challenges. \nOur main problem was the costly process of producing new designs. This nearly stopped us in our tracks, just as it stops most artists and entrepreneurs from doing what they love, which is creating. \nWe went on a worldwide hunt to find a manufacturer that believed in our idea. However, we were told NO over a 100 times and that our idea was impossible. \nWe were able to overcome this problem by teaming up with some amazing people, solidifying our own printing equipment, and mastering the art of dye-sublimation, also known as all-over printing. \nWe have committed our professional careers to working with some of the most amazing artists, photographers, and celebrities in giving them the ability to turn their dreams and visions into wearable merchandise.  \nNow, it\u2019s your turn.\nOnce an order is placed, SnapShirt will use our sophisticated algorithm to change your photo into a print-ready file. This will be sent to our production line, then manufactured, and lastly, shipped to you! Over the years while printing for RageOn.com, we have perfected our proprietary process of dye sublimation to produce un-matched, photo-realistic quality.\nOur apparel lasts forever or your money back! We work with some of the most skilled cut & sewers and manufacturers in the world. We use a precise combination of heat, pressure, and time to change each individual clothing fiber to make the most high quality, durable, and vibrant garments you will ever see! These incredibly soft garments wick away heat and moisture, for a cool, relaxed feel :)\nLet\u2019s get creative! We will be releasing 5 exclusive shirt designs as we hit milestones! Next, we have some incredible stretch goals for both custom & Rage On designs in even more options, like: zip-up hoodies, pillows, blankets, and more!\nYour support means the world to us.

We created an \u201cextended video\u201d that includes: more modeling scenes, a heartfelt moment of my brother and sister, both of which have since passed and whom I dedicate this app to, a sneak peak at what our party with celebrity guest reward might look like (actual party footage from one of our events), some new music, and more!\nSNAPSHIRT & MY INSPIRATION:\nOne quintessential detail of every large project I take on is that there is a greater purpose with what I\u2019m doing. For some people, it\u2019s money, for others it\u2019s success, for me, it\u2019s always been about something bigger.\nThe most substantial aspect of my motivation for creating SnapShirt is the ability to give something incredible for FREE to each and every person in this world, something that my brother, Jerry, and sister, Sarah who tragically passed would be proud of.\nOne might think that as the founder of Rage On, I would have the ability to make custom apparel. The truth is, I\u2019ve always had this ability\u2014 however, the process of making custom merchandise was extremely inefficient. Despite having hundreds of Rage On fans ask us for this feature every day, we still had to find a way to automate this system.\nI always figured there would come a time when I could make the process to create custom apparel easier for us and fans alike. Unfortunately, this time came too late and the passing of Jerry and Sarah showed me just how fragile life can be. This realization pushed me to finally build something I could give my family and friends so that they might capture the moments they spend together, while also creating a physical memento that will last a lifetime.\nThe tragic events of my personal life, the requests of Rage On fans around the world, and seeing the joy the ability to create something personalized brings to people are what continue to push me to build something revolutionary.\nSnapShirt is an app that is dedicated to everyone\u2014 every kid who dreams of starting a clothing company, every artist who dreams of making their artwork a reality, everyone who dreams of reliving a moment. Most importantly, I am dedicating SnapShirt to my brother and sister.\nMy heart, mind, and soul are committed to changing the future with SnapShirt. Thanks to this app, any funny, artsy, or cherished moment can instantly be made into virtually anything. Once SnapShirt is complete, you and I will never again have to wait to commemorate our visions\u2014 we will only need to pioneer them.\nI have been fortunate enough to work with some of the best people that I\u2019ve met in my entire life and am thankful to have these people help complete this project with me.

Many people also wanted a cable to charge their phone while driving in their car without all the unnecessary tangles and mess.\nEveryone gets a longer cable (1m) with their phone and we found out that adding this short 7 inch cable to a customer's arsenal made their phone charging tasks much easier.\nThe 7 Inch Bendy Cable is perfect for use with:\nPower Banks\nUSB outlet or charger in your car or truck\nLaptop or USB hub on desk\nUSB outlet or charger in the car\n  Power bank + iPhone\ndCables Lifetime Guarantee\nAll of the Bendy cables come with a 100% Lifetime Guarantee against manufacturing defects.\nMicro USB technical drawing\nTechnical Specifications\nEach Bendy Cable is 7 inches long from tip to tip.\nMFI Lightning is rated at 2.4 Amps\nMicro USB is rated at 2.4 Amps\nLightning compatibility:\nWorks with every Apple iPhone, iPad & iPod with a Lightning connector.

Kickstarter allows us to get great feedback from the community to improve the product and maybe even come up with an idea we hadn't thought of.  The Minimum Order Quantity for MFI Lightning cables is quite high. We need your help to cover the tooling costs, the minimum order requirements from our vendors and the preorder of Apple Certified Lightning Connectors.\nPackaging\nWe'll also ask for feedback about the packaging from any people who back the project.  Current plan is to use a cardboard backed hanging tab and we'll get user feedback on the graphic design of the package.\nShipping \nUSPS Shipping with Tracking # is included for all USA customers.  \nWe apologize to our overseas customers for the additional charge.  The extra charge reflects our aggregate estimated shipping costs, supplies, labor costs and shrinkage due to USPS international shipping.\nProduction Schedule\n*Micro USB cables will be ready to ship within 4 weeks of close of Kickstarter project, perhaps faster. \nLightning Cables:\nOct 1-  expect MFI approval and certification from Apple\n*Currently there is a 12 week wait to receive Apple Certified 8 pin Lightning Connectors due in part to the launch of the iPhone 6 and general supply and demand. We preordered 10,000 Lightning connectors in anticipation of this supply shortage.\nDec 15-  receive Lightning connectors and start the manufacturing process. Expected production lead time is 3 weeks.\nJan 15, 2015- receive all cables in our warehouse and start fulfillment to all Backers.\nJan 31, 2015- complete all shipments of cables to our Backers.\nLightning cable orders will be fulfilled in this order: CRAZY EARLY BIRD, NUTTY EARLY BIRD, EARLY BIRD, STILL LOVE IT, any and all Multi Packs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMFI Certification: We expect to receive MFI certification around October 1, 2014. Although the samples we have provided Apple for certification met Apple's strict guidelines in our internal tests, there is no guarantee of MFI approval. Additionally, given the unprecedented excitement surrounding the iPhone 6 launch there is a chance of delay in our final approval given the sheer quantity of items that Apple is currently testing. \n\nProduction delays: With the launch of the iPhone 6 the Apple Lightning connectors have become increasingly challenging to source. We believe we have accounted for these difficulties when we preordered 10,000 connectors in anticipation of this occurrence however there is always a risk of manufacturing delays due to component shortage.\n\nCustoms: Any time you have product delivered from overseas there are always risks of customs delays as the Department of Homeland Security searches shipments. These delays are infrequent and typically last from 3 days to 2 weeks, but could be longer.\n\nTransparency and honesty are very important to us so we promise to be upfront and forthcoming about any delays if they arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Flash Sale on Bendy Cables- $9.99 for 1 Apple or 2 Micro USB/Android", "update_content": "Thanks a lot for the reviews and I know a lot of you took advantage of the last sale on Amazon and PhoneRumble.\nWe're running a Flash sale for a limited time on Living Social.\nhttps://www.livingsocial.com/products/us/tag/electronics/132302-7-bendy-durable-usb-cable-for-apple-or-android?rui=199596254\n$9.99 for an Apple Bendy cable \n for TWO Micro USB/Android cables"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "THANK YOU + special discounts and a new 15 inch Bendy.

Sitting in a meeting, or on hold with the cable company, or listening to a conference call that has gone on past the point of being productive. As the brain starts to wander, the hands reach for a stack of yellow sticky notes. What a fantastic format! Small, square, disposable, and with a sticky strip on the back. In mere moments, a silly drawing or message appears, and can be immediately displayed on the wall, inside a book, on the edge of the computer monitor, or on the back of a friend's jacket as he sneaks by.\nIf you saw my first two Kickstarter projects, you already know I'm a teacher, as well as an artist. I'm one of those people who needs to keep his hands busy in order to stay focused, so I take a pack of Post-it\u00ae Notes with me every time I attend a meeting at the school. I've probably drawn hundreds of sticky note cartoons. Ducks, robots, giraffes, appliances, starfish, stereos, fire hydrants, and a few people. So I've already got an ongoing love affair with the ubiquitous yellow square.\nWhy?\nAs the new school year begins, I need a project to work on. It will be used to demonstrate to my students some very important aspects of art. I can show them commitment to a large-scale project that spans months of work. They will see me working daily, and understand the importance of regular, frequent, and rigorous practice. The students will (hopefully) see the effect of that practice, in the form of improved quality or evolving style. I will show them how an artist can make a living through hard work, determination, and commitment, and watch the project go from conception to completion, all over the course of one school year. I can also use examples from this project in lessons on composition, portrait drawing, pencil shading, crosshatching, etc.\nSo, in the interest of improving art education, inspiring young artists, pushing myself to practice, and bringing hand-made art to the masses... I've decided to begin a huge undertaking. I will draw hundreds of portraits on Post-it\u00ae Notes and compile them into one book. The final page count will depend on how many backers send me photos, but ideally, they would number in the hundreds.\nPORTRAITS\nEach portrait will be hand-drawn (by me) on a 3\u201d x 3\u201d Super Sticky Post-It\u00ae Note of my choosing. I like to use pencil, ink, marker, color pencil, chalk, and paint. But not all on the same drawing. Your portrait will be drawn using whichever materials I feel are most appropriate for the image. You can see from the drawings I've already completed, there is a range of media and style. Unfortunately, I am not able to take requests for materials or colors. Sorry!\nBOOK\nThe book will be a collection of hand-drawn portraits (originally on sticky notes), in varying styles and color. While I would like to make the book 3\u201d square, just like the drawings, I think the printing process will require a small border around the images. So I am left with two options: Make the book more like 3.25\u201d square, or lose part of every drawing to edge bleed and trimming. I'm looking at going with the former. So hopefully the book will be 3.35\u201d square, with full color gloss pages. The drawings will be as close to actual size as possible, and one portrait will be on each page. Since the book is so small, I will have to use a special binding method that will allow the pages to open fully.  Normal binding might prevent the book from opening flat, and we would not be able to see the part of the drawing closest to the spine.  I want to be able to see the entire image on every page...  So we are left with a very expensive method for binding.  The more backers buy a portrait, the more pages will go in the book. I'd like to have more than 250 images, but 200 will be the minimum.\nI'll be working with the same local printing company that produced The Heartless Machine Guide To Drawing, and 99 Ways to Die: a Coloring Book for Adults.  They make fantastic books, right here in Austin TX, and they consistently provide me with the service and quality I need.  I DO NOT have books made in China.  My products are always made in the USA.\nThe binding is very important to me.  I always strive for quality.  So with this book, it came down to two options.  There's a cheap way to do it, and a quality way to do it.  Look at the difference:\nOn the left, you will see a cheaply bound book, meant for mass-distribution. Notice how the spine is fully glued, and the damage sustained when opening the book.  See how the spine of the book is already falling apart, and I haven't even read the book!  This will not do.  When I am done reading it, I will put the book on the shelf, and the ugly spine creases will be all I see!\nOn the right, there is an extra step to binding this book.  The cover is glued separately, so the flexing of the pages and spine do not crease the cover.  It's so much better!  When I put this book back on the shelf (and I might not), the spine will look brand new.  This is the quality I provide to my backers!\nTIMELINE\nSEPTEMBER- After the Kickstarter deadline, I will send out a survey to those who pledged for a hand-drawn portrait. The survey will include information about how to submit your image. As the images come in, I will begin drawing.\nJANUARY- If I end up with 400 portraits (that's a lot!), and I draw 100 portraits each month (that's totally possible), I will finish drawing by the end of January.\nFEBRUARY- Scanning, cropping, color correcting, rotating, converting to PDF, and compiling for the printer.\nMARCH- Submit the files to the printer.\nAPRIL- It's quite possible to have the books ready for shipping in April.\n\nI've decided to give myself plenty of room in the timeline, though. So I've scheduled the rewards to be delivered by July, just to be safe. I prefer to be months ahead of schedule vs the opposite, and you can see in my previous two Kickstarter projects, everything went out at least on time, if not early. Besides not wanting to let down my backers, it's also very important to me that my students see this project completed. I'm very motivated to stay ahead of schedule.\nRULES\nPart of the point of this project is to show a wide variety of people and expressions in a constrained format. To that end, I am requesting that you do not send photos of children, pets, or the deceased. I am only interested in photos of consenting adults. That means you, not some guy off the street. You will need to confirm that the person in the photo is either you, or a consenting adult, and that you are allowing me to publish the drawing as part of my book.\nIt will be the backers' responsibility to contribute a well-lit and clearly defined photo for inclusion in this project, so please do your part! If you send me a bad photo, you can't expect a good drawing. If you don't send a photo at all, I will have nothing to draw.\nYou don't have to make a funny face, but these little portraits are a lot more fun if you do.\nIf you would like to see more examples, you can check my website, twitter, tumblr, and Facebook.\nPost-it\u00ae is a registered trademark of 3M.

No Problem.\nKeys have been used to open locks for centuries. But keys have the same problems today as they did back then. They are easy to lose, they can be stolen, they are a pain to share, and if you share them, you must get them back. Sharing combinations has its own set of issues.\nAt F\u016aZ Designs, we thought it was time to put those problems behind us, so we created Noke. By using Noke and your smartphone, you'll always have easy access to all the important things in your life. In addition, you'll be able to share access to your possessions easily, safely, and securely.\nHow It Works\nWe designed Noke to be the simplest electronic device you own. Once you've downloaded our iOS or Android app, Noke automatically finds and pairs to your Bluetooth 4.0 enabled smartphone. You can name your Noke and even give it a photo if you like. That's it. \nTo unlock Noke, simply press the shackle. Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Noke will instantly unlock so you can be on your way. No need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse.\nIf you have a specific reason to limit the range or turn off the auto-unlock feature, you can do this within the app. In order to unlock with the auto-unlock feature turned off, you can simply press unlock button in the app or use Quick-Click code. This will allow you to lock your phone in a locker or stand near your lock without fear of it being unlocked. You can also set up push notifications in the app if you'd like to know when Noke is being opened.\nOptional Cable and Bike Mount\nYou will probably want to use Noke on your bicycle, so we created a custom chain and bike mount to neatly and securely attach Noke to your seat post. Available for only $20.\nProtect Your Things\nOnce you start thinking of all the places you'll use the Noke, you'll be glad to know we have discounted pricing for multi-unit orders.\nSharing\nUsing our iOS, Android or Windows Phone app, Noke allows instant and secure sharing. You can choose permanent, one-time, or custom settings. Need to give Johny access to your locker while you're on vacation? With Noke, it's no problem. \n History\nNoke is great in an office environment. In addition to granting access on specific days and times, you can use the history function to track who is using your Noke and when.\nQuick Click Access\nWhat if you forget your phone or your battery dies? With Noke, it's no problem. Our patent-pending Quick-Click technology allows you to create a custom access code. If you're ever without your phone, simply key in those clicks and your Noke will instantly unlock for you. You'll never worry about being stranded again.\n  Design\n30 Parts All Come Together to Create the World's Most Advanced Padlock\nAttractive. We designed Noke to look as good as it functions with a body the same size as an ordinary padlock but with subtle curves and bevels to complement its aesthetic. The compact size allows Noke to be used anywhere you'd use a traditional padlock.\nStrong. While Noke is an incredibly attractive device, we also made it strong. Using hardened steel and boron, Noke will stand up to the toughest environments. Noke also uses the latest in anti-shim technology so you need not worry about thieves trying to use a shim to open your lock.\nWater Resistant. You're sure to use Noke in places where it may get wet, so we removed any external buttons and added four silicone gaskets to keep the water out.\nLong-Lasting Battery. All these features would be useless if you had to worry about the battery. So we packed Noke with a long-life battery that will last over a year of normal use. If you use Noke infrequently, it should last a few years. If you need to replace the battery, this can easily be done without the use of any tools. \nSecurity. Noke uses Bluetooth 4.0 which contains the highest level of security. Bluetooth 4.0 uses a 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm and we've added our own PKI technology and cryptographic key exchange protocol to ensure Noke keeps your valuables safe and secure.\nBattery\nLong before it's time to replace your Noke's battery, you will receive notifications through the app. To replace the battery, simply unlock Noke and twist off the back cover. It's easier than replacing the batteries on your remote control. \nIn the unlikely event you let the battery completely drain, we've added a simple way to \"jump-start\" your Noke with an external battery so you can unlock your Noke, open the back, and replace the battery. This ensures you'll never have to worry about being stranded with a dead battery. Take a look at the image below to see how we will allow you to jump start Noke. All you need to do is press the replacement battery against the contact points and it will allow you to open Noke and replace the battery. No tools, dongles, wires, or adapters to lose. The contacts will be covered with a silicone insert to protect the contacts from the elements.\nDevelopment\nWe spent months researching how existing locks work. We took several apart and learned what makes them strong, what makes them vulnerable, and how they could be improved. We used this knowledge to create the worlds's most advanced and secure padlock. It wasn't easy, but we think you'll love the results. A padlock that works as hard as you do that's also simple enough for anyone to use.\nRewards\n\nTimeline\nWe've already spent months developing, testing, tweaking, and retesting the hardware, firmware, and app for Noke. Now, we just need your help to make it to the finish line. We've already chosen a manufacturer we've worked with several times in the past. We will continue to improve the final elements of Noke and the iOS, Windows Phone, and Android apps. Tooling will follow shortly thereafter. \nWe will then send production samples of Noke out for external beta testing and torture testing for strength and water resistance. Once we feel 100% sure we've nailed everything, mass production will begin and we expect to deliver Noke to you in early 2015.\nSupported Devices\nCompatible with iOS devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and running iOS 7.0 or later (including iPhone 4s or newer, iPod Touch 5G or newer, iPad 3G or newer, iPad minis).\nCompatible with Android devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and  running the Jelly Bean (4.3) or Kit Kat (4.4) or higher versions of the Android operating system (including Samsung Galaxy S4 or newer, HTC One or newer, and several more).\nCompatible with Windows Phone devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and running Windows Phone 8.1 or newer.\n Dimensions\n  About Us\n    F\u016aZ Designs was founded by David Gengler and Cameron Gibbs to create exceptional products for today's electronic devices.

The samples you see in the photos and videos work great and look fantastic, so we won't need to waste time tweaking the design. \n\nHowever, every project carries with it certain risks. The most common risks are potential delays in tooling, obtaining raw materials, packaging, and shipping. While we feel like we have reduced these variables as much as possible, they can never be completely eliminated.\n\nWe feel our experience and familiarity with our manufacturer and the product development process gives us a unique skill set in handling unexpected problems.

Two earbuds that together function as one Bluetooth headphone; no cables, no attachments just magically small delivering high quality audio sound.\nEarin represents Olle Lind\u00e9n\u2019s vision which came to life in 2008 after seeing the intro of the movie \u2018Definitely Maybe\u2019, where the actor Ryan Reynolds walks down a crowded New York city street with just a pair of small earbuds without cables, listening to, as he says \u201cthe soundtrack of a perfect day\u201d. After seeing this movie, Olle was inspired to \u201ccreate a perfect wireless experience\u201d so his headphones were formed.\nAt that time, the technology to transmit stereo sound wirelessly was not available as I imagined, but 5 years later I assembled a team of former colleagues and we began our journey. Now we are proud to present a product that is easy to use, beautifully crafted, and creates a fantastic music experience. \nWhatever reasons you choose to listen to music, you want it to be a hassle-free experience. When starting our development our mission was to create a product that would be focused on simplicity, size and audio quality.\nNo unnecessary functionality has been added. No sensors, no lights and no microphone, that\u2019s right - no microphone! Not because we couldn\u2019t but because we wouldn\u2019t!\nEarin is for music lovers \u2013 and music lovers only.\nWe use balanced armature speakers, used in professional in-ear-monitors and hearing-aids to deliver the best possible sound and to keep power-consumption at its minimal. High-density rechargeable batteries are used to keep playback time up and size down.\n Our compact capsule design is perfect for storing your earbuds and will also easily fit in your pocket whatever you\u2019re wearing. To create more flexibility when you\u2019re on the go and to increase the playback time, the capsule also functions as a charger. Just place the earbuds in the capsule and they will be charged automatically \u2013 so they\u2019re ready when you are.\nWHAT'S INSIDE YOUR EARIN PACKAGE\nTECH SPECS - KEEPING IT SIMPLE\nDimensions, capsule: \u00d818mm x 62mm\nDimensions, earbuds: \u00d814mm x 20mm\nWeight, earbuds: 5 grams\nWeight, capsule: 25 grams\nPlay time: 2,5-3 hours (double this if charging in the capsule)\nEarbud/capsule battery: Rechargeable Li-Ion Button Cell\nBluetooth IC: BT CSR8670, BlueCore5 with aptX\nBluetooth@3.0 and Bluetooth@4.0 compatible  \nBalanced Armature Speaker: Knowles SR-Siren\nDesign for IP54 ingress protection\nKEEPING IT NOT SO SIMPLE  (for us nerds)\nAudio\nThe balanced armature speaker in Earin is a new design featuring extended response in the low end and vastly improved high frequency response.\nBalanced armature speaker is a high-precision design consisting of spring and magnetic force that removes a lot of the moving mass. This makes it possible to deliver fast attacks and a clear sound that lets you hear all the details in the music. At the same time the low mass makes it very energy efficient. It consumes only a fraction of comparable technologies, a key in making a hearing aid go for days on tiny batteries. These are also the qualities we were looking for to come up with this solution: sound quality and long playtime in a very small package.\nThe focus for audio is the end result of the total system. Having the electronics in the earbuds gives you the opportunity to optimise the acoustics and the electronics together in a way not possible with corded headphones. This is an even greater advantage when it comes to balanced armature which provides unique tuning capabilities, but have a somewhat strange load on the amplifier. Tuning them together bypasses this problem.\nWith the power of the AptX solution for digital audio Earin can secure an audio transfer that is optimised for instant real-time audio streaming. AptX has already earned a reputation for some of the highest audio quality, extremely low latency and strong resilience to bit errors, and has been proven in wireless, broadcast and professional live performance applications.\nElectronics\nTo be able to fit all components in such a small space we have chosen a chip with built-in functionality as shown below in the simplified block schematics of Earin.\nBluetooth as a technology has its limitations. A Bluetooth device is either a slave or a master. The slave receives information and the master sends it out. The Bluetooth is set by a common standard that all manufacturers have to follow.\nWe are using a chip that can do both and in actual terms each chip is divided into two parts, a master and a slave. This means that this chip bypasses the standard \u201cweakness\u201d in Bluetooth and can function as both receiving information and at the same time sending information.\n The picture above shows the Bluetooth flow in Earin.\nFor us it was extremely important to make Earin magically small in size and light weight. Small because we want people to be amazed when they see it and light weight because a heavy product will loose grip by its own weight when you move.\nBecause of the shape of Earin, we chose a Li-Ion coin cell battery from Varta Micro-battery and this battery is remarkable in many aspects.\nLow internal impedance\nOutput current that meets our requirements and charging within the hour\nRobust design which lowers risk of damaging at production assembly\nVery high density - 50mAh packed in a package of 12.1x5.4 mm and 1.6g\nMechanics\nThe architecture of the earbud is based on two main covers which are ultrasonically welded to create a water-tight seal, protecting the electrical components. The materials are carefully selected to withstand both climate and impact testing. As all project membershave extensive experience of creating similar consumer products, we know what works and what doesn\u00b4t.\n  Ergonomics is also a parameter that has been in focus since the project started. Various prototypes and competitor models have been tested and we\u2019ve concluded that the ergonomics, both in terms of comfort and secure fit, gains from minimising the volume and the weight. The earbuds\u2019 center of gravity should also be kept as closely to the body as possible. We\u2019ve managed this by angling the shape of the front cover, enabling close fit and to mimic the shape and direction of the human ear channel.\n For those of you who plan to use your Earin in more extreme use cases, including sports, we have developed a special \u2018Concha Wing\u2019 which will improve and secure the fit even further. The concha lock is made out of silicon for optimal comfort.\n In the video below we describe how we've optimized the fit of the Earin.\nPLAY\n\nHOW IT WORKS \u2013 AS EASY AS IT GETS\nYour earbuds are ready for action as soon as you remove them from the capsule, just follow the steps below and you are ready to go.\nWHERE WE\u2019RE AT\nWe have been working hard for the last year and a half preparing for our Kickstarter launch. What started as an idea has now resulted in an impressive technical solution, perfect for your eyes and ears.\nTo get where we're at today, we had to achieve some important milestones which are illustrated below:\nPROTOTYPE-TO-PRODUCTION PLAN\nJune 2014: Continue Alpha prototype testing & refinement\nJuly 2014: Update Beta schematics & PCB CAD, Beta HW order, DFM analysis.\nAugust 2014: Mech tool order.\nSeptember 2014: Arrival of Beta HW, Compliance testing & certification, Mech 3D update.\nDecember 2014: Begin manufacturing.\nJanuary 2015: Get Earin in your hands!\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #1                         \u00a3600 000\n\nStretch goal 1. Earin app for IOS, Android and Windows Phone\nExtended playtime, enabled by switching master and slave, balancing the power consumption.\nMono playtime. Use one earbud while charging the other. This gives you up to 10 hours continuous playtime.\nAudio settings\nSTRETCH GOAL #2                         \u00a3700 000\n \nStretch goal 2. Waterproof earbuds\nNo more worries about dropping your earbuds into water. You can even swim with them.

Together, they're often too much to carry around in your pocket, but less then needing a bag or purse for ...and simply too important to leave behind.\nA tool roll for the rest of us\nInspired by the versatility of the classic tool roll used by professional chefs & craftsmen, we developed a contemporary version, capable of hold just about anything you might need on an average day, durable but tailored, with plenty of attention to detail. We sized it to fit in comfortably in your hand and be compact enough to carry in a coat pocket or larger bag.\nIt's designed to go anywhere, any time and look at home on a conference table, a workbench, in a kitchen or out on the town - with the right balance between rugged and refined. \nIt's hand crafted from thick, full-grain leather, with an internal elastic web that can accommodate almost anything, anchored with heavy gauge nylon thread. There are 5 narrow sleeves (for pens, mascara, small tools) and 2 wider sleeves (for cables, a AA battery, action figures). \nThe 3mm DIA closure bungee holds everything in place when rolled up, providing positive tension with both small and large tool collections. It will even hold a complete set of wrenches through 1/2\"/14mm firmly in place - perfect for cyclists. The combination of leather construction, the internal elastic web and bungee closure assures heavier then usual objects stay put when in motion on the road.\nBike commuter? Designer? Super mom?

It's a deep, rich red - a great option!\n\"Anything worth doing is worth overdoing\" \n- Mick Jagger\nWe looked everywhere for clean, well-designed, high-quality stainless steel hardware to use for the closure - they simply don't exist, so we created our own. The closure hardware piece is precision machined from 304 stainless steel by our favorite 180 year old machine shop - the same team that produced Pucs. Gear-like precision for a simple button makes for a great detail\nThe elastic closure is a thick 3mm DIA fabric covered shock cord, stitched in place with nylon thread, with a metal pass-through eyelet for added durability:\nA simple, high quality wallet - a great companion piece\nDesigned as a matching companion piece for the Roll, the Ledr Wallet comes in both horizontal & vertical formats - each has their own merits; you will have the opportunity to weigh in on which format works best for you.\nOur Tuls project backers asked for a simple, well-made wallet for their new Tuls collection. We designed and produced a few prototypes to understand the process, see how they wore over time and made adjustments where needed. It helped us understand the fundamentals of leather production, how the assembly process works and what to design for. They are constructed with the same baseball mitt leather, tough but tailored; a perfect match to compliment the Roll.\nAmazing baseball glove leather in GREAT colors\nOur production partners at Abas Leather produce a great line of baseball gloves under their Insignia brand, along with luxury leather accessories for many well-know premium & luxury brands. They are a family-owned local business, with 50 years of expert leather crafting experience. \nFor their baseball glove line, they keep an inventory of some of the best quality, full-grain leather that can be found anywhere. This leather looks great, feels wonderful and is tough enough to last forever. Full grain means that it is thick and softens nicely over time.\nThere were several of color options, but we picked 4 of the best to get started with. We chose classic black leather / black stitching and chocolate brown leather / tan stitching. We also added an interesting glove orange leather / tan stitching + a white leather / red stitching ...and now RED with white stitching - all a 'hint' at the sports heritage that is a big part of this project:\nThe project\nOur vision for Ledr is to eventually create a full line of clever, well-crafted, forward thinking leather accessories, begining with the Roll and 2 simple Wallets. This project is meant to be a foundation with a range of product possibilities down the road. \nThe funds raised will cover prototyping, one-time tooling charges, will help us mature our supply chain relationship and learn what it takes to pack and ship this type of product successfully.\nWe love the crowd funding environment - not just for the backing that helps us get a new product off the ground, but for the community of enthusiastic and thoughtful supporters we meet with each new project.

We could make that happen with a GoPro camera mounted on a flying drone, such as the GoPro HERO3: Silver Edition Camera & Phantom Quadcopter with GoPro Mount Kit. We would also need--at lease initially--to hire an operator to make sure we captured what we desired and learned how to best use it.\nThe equipment could be shared amongst Co-Directors within certain limits and always under the watch of a trained operator. Watch the amazing things it can do here. What do you say? We have 2 days! Make it happen!!!\nStretch Goal #2!: 1000 Backers --In Progress!\nThink you can get 10 friends to donate $1? Or 20 friends? If we can reach 1000 Backers--at any pledge level, even $1.00 each--Metrofiets has offered to donate one of their beautiful bakfiets to a low-income family willing to try living car-lite or car-free. I will follow this family, camera in hand, and capture the story for inclusion in LESS CAR MORE GO! \nThis could not only transform a family life, but put a spotlight on the practical benefits of cargo bikes we all know so well. To get us started, Arleen McGlade will match the first $1000 to come in!! We have 3 days. We NEED 438 NEW BACKERS. GO!!!!!!!!!\nStretch Goal #1: $50,000 -- Achieved!\n$50,000 would enable us to capture a wider cross-section of the cargo bike movement while also completing LCMG sooner and in a more professional fashion. That's our best chance at catching the current wave and getting the mainstream to jump on for the ride! \nTo reward you for your love and support, if we hit $50,000, I will give ALL Backers backstage (online) access to uncut, uncensored interviews with cargo bike luminaries such as Ross Evans, Mikael Colville Andersen, George Bliss, Emily Finch, Ben Sarrazin, and yours truly--Liz Canning!\nLET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!\nThe Project:\nIn early 2011, almost three years before the Wall Street Journal dubbed cargo bikes \"the New Station Wagon,\" filmmaker Liz Canning began making LESS CAR MORE GO. The project is a crowdsourced documentary on the past, present and future of the cargo bike movement, co-directed by over 100 cargo cyclists. A rapidly growing online network of bike lovers from all over the world has shared hours of video footage capturing how cargo bikes change lives. The number, quality and content of submissions to LESS CAR MORE GO is a stunning testament to the power of bicycles, community and art. And we\u2019ve only just begun!\nBy interweaving Co-Directors\u2019 footage with interviews Liz has shot with riders, designers, shop owners, advocates and pioneers, LESS CAR MORE GO will tell the tale of the cargo bike, from the original bakfiets and rickshaws in Europe and Asia, to the birth of the Longtail in Australia and Nicaragua, through the year 2014 when sales are doubling and tripling annually, and the global cargo bike culture is exploding! \nFurthermore, the collectively illustrated story of the cargo bike boom will be framed by the parallel story of the synergistic LESS CAR MORE GO project. Our goal is to produce an authentic, collaborative document of a cultural revolution in progress: a tribute to the potential of teamwork, bikes and the internet.\nOver 100 riders showed up for the Eugene Roll Call. Thanks to Co-Directors Paul Adkins, Kate Carroll Burns and Shane MacRhodes, I was there to capture it!\nThe LESS CAR MORE GO trailer, produced in 2011 as a way to introduce the concept to potential Co-Directors:\nMy Story:\nI, Liz Canning, became a filmmaker while studying at Brown University's Department of Modern Culture and Media. After years of making and curating experimental films in San Francisco, I began a career as an editor (Bio/resume/previous work available here.)\nI have always loved bikes. Just never entirely grasped the car-as-rite-of-passage-into-adulthood thing; it was my bike that made me feel free, bold, and adventurous. This was surely inconvenient at times, but I didn\u2019t drive until I was almost 40! By that time I felt intimately familiar with the power of life on 2-wheels. I did not expect that mid-midlife crisis I would be Reborn as a new kind of cyclist: empowered and called to action--by new kind of a bicycle.\nI discovered cargo bikes when having twins threatened to end my bike-centric lifestyle.\nIt happened when my twins were about two. I was forced to admit that dragging the double bike trailer stuffed with fat toddlers up the very long steep hill to our house--though adventurous-- was not at all fun and becoming dangerous. So, defeated and bored, I resorted to the car, even for 2 mile-trips to preschool or the store.\nThe thought that kids--beings undeniably drawn to, and seemingly designed for transport via bicycle, whose future may depend on on our consuming less--the thought that they could actually force our family into a car just killed me. \nI began to wonder: might there be a bike out there that could happily and safely get us up and down that hill? I typed \u201ccarry kids on bike\u201d and hit \u201csearch.\u201d In a pivotal, life-changing moment I discovered what would become my lifestyle, my fellow filmmakers and my extended family. There it was: the beginnings of the cargo bike boom, manifested in blogs, groups, chats and tweets, buzzing with passion and decorated with the elated faces of families, commuters, messengers and business owners moving heavy things on giant, burly bicycles.\nThe passion of the online cargo bike community was palpable.\nA month or so later I was riding a beautiful blue front loader. Within a year, we\u2019d added an electric assist hub motor. The steep climb that once forced us into a car became irrelevant. What had previously been a chore--errand-running and carting kids--became an adventure. I began to pile things on: 2 kids plus their bikes, 4 kids and backpacks. I could ride farther, faster, with awesome acceleration and, frankly, more fun! I charged that battery about every three days and the car sat idle for weeks.\nA little squooshed & very happy!\nAt once I understood all the stories I was reading of regular folk--some who hadn\u2019t been on a bike in years, getting on a cargo bike and instantly becoming fanatic evangelical advocates, reaching out and befriending every cargo bike lover they could find. They can\u2019t contain their excitement and neither could I. I felt duty-bound to make the cargo bike experience accessible, to show people how easily it can be done, how much sense it makes, how completely ALIVE it makes you feel.\nBumper sticker designed by cargo bike blogger (and my personal inspiration) Sara Armstrong.\nIt was obvious that the rapidly growing network of cargo bike users heard the same call; what if I helped them connect and we tackled this project as a team? I had to try it. Given my knowledge and love of filmmaking, we had to make a film.\nSo, in the Spring of 2011 we started LESS CAR MORE GO (formerly know as (R)Evolutions per Minute) with a video trailer, a website and a Facebook Group. I bought a handful of mini-hard drives, a couple HD mini-cams, and two GoPros. Through our cargo bike network we began to share equipment, resources, and the skills of several like-minded professional shooters.\nSince then the 2 edits of LESS CAR MORE GO trailer have been viewed over 107,000 times and traveled the world as part of the Bicycle Film Festival. The very active Facebook group has over 1500 members. I\u2019ve been inundated with email. And Co-Directors just keep shooting. Some have hosted gatherings now called \u201cCargo Bike Roll Call\u201ds wherein cyclists bond, tell there story and go for a ride, all on video. Others have spent their summer vacation interviewing riders wherever they found them. Some started wearing a helmet-cam when running errands  At the same time Co-directors have flown, housed and fed me while I\u2019ve been shooting up and down the west coast.\nReactions to the trailer for LESS CAR MORE GO:\nThis is one of the most inspiring videos I've ever seen. Thank you!....Bo***ox to the car, I'm selling it in favor of an electric assist cargo bike and if I can do it here in the NorthWest Scottish Highlands then it should be possible anywhere...... I'm in!!!\nIt plays to people culturally outside of cycling's perceived core of radicals and racers, but who definitely connect the dots in terms of larger community benefits extending citywide and globally.\nThe cargo bike video is changing the way I view bikes, and I've never owned a car. She converted a convert, freaking awesome.\nI drive a big truck= 7 mpg. I am what you would call a conservative. Having said that...I feel inspired! If it wasn't 50+ miles to work, I would totally consider a bike commute. Maybe a change in employer or career in my future!\nA 100% promise to the world: My family will be living with one of these very soon!\nSince I rely on bikes for transportation, this beautiful video hits close to home....With a surprising emphasis on electric assist, it's all very hopeful and exciting -- the start of something new.\nLESS CAR MORE GO and the Hero\u2019s Quest:\nI\u2019ve been a filmmaker/ editor for 14 years or so, with a focus on documentary. I spent close to a year combining a huge variety of sources to form the Sundance award-winning film, American Blackout. So I was quite aware, from the beginning, that 100 testimonials from love-struck cargo cyclists would not a compelling story make! A successful 90-minute film requires a narrative spine, commonly provided by one character\u2019s quest.\n\nLucky for me, one of my first interviewees was Ross Evans, the Ted-Talk giving, big-idea-spouting, Geodesic dome-building CEO of Xtracycle. The meeting became a tipping point in the birth of LESS CAR MORE GO: suddenly I had a Hero, a Quest, and a Central question, all wrapped up in a charismatic, enthusiastic and media-savvy subject.\n\nRoss Evans works to make people feel ALIVE. Cargo Bikes are his tool of choice.\nRoss relayed his amazing story: At age 19, while collaborating with disabled veterans as part of a Bikes Not Bombs program in war-torn Nicaragua, he invented the Xtracycle cargo bike conversion kit.\n\nUpon returning to the US, he formed the Xtracycle company and created a community of hardcore cargo bike evangelists with whom he set out to transform American culture, initiating what would become the current cargo bike boom almost twenty years ago! Best part: he shot tons of photos and video! Here is a teaser, followed by a 22-minute preview of the Xtracycle story, Birth of an American Cargo Bike:\n\n\nLeaders are not, however, always winners, and often pay a price for being so far ahead of their time. By the time the cargo bike concept began to make sense to people, Xtracycle was battle-worn and weary from 10 years or so of beating their heads against a sport-focused bike industry and a car-loving population. There followed an onslaught of new competition, primarily in the form of the now ubiquitous Yuba Bicycles, founded by former close friend and early partner in Xtracycle, Ben Sarrazin.\n\n\nBen Sarrazin left Xtracycle to start his own cargo bike business, the fast-growing Yuba Bicycles..\nWhen I began following the Xtracycle story in 2011, the stakes for Ross were enormously high. He and his company were broke, beat and bitter. He had a new wife and son and faced losing his legacy; could he summon the wherewithal to save Xtracycle and take his rightful place as father of the American cargo bike? Here was a fascinating coming of age tale of dedication, betrayal and redemption, played out on the east and north sides of the San Francisco Bay. With plenty of \u201cimpassioned visionary vs. savvy businessman\u201d drama to spare. \nFurthermore, just when Ross was facing the challenge of his life, the bike industry and cargo bike advocates everywhere were looking around and asking: Is this it? Has the Era of the Cargo Bike arrived? \n\nAward-winning documentary editor and storytelling consultant Karen Everett writes: Like narrative films, documentaries are at their best when the protagonist\u2019s object of desire and the movie\u2019s central question are concrete and specific. Ross\u2019 fate and the success of the cargo bike movement are intimately tied and easily identified. So it makes beautiful sense that LESS CAR MORE GO will use Xtracycle\u2019s quest as the narrative train to take viewers through the past, present and future of the cargo bike movement, as captured by Co-Directors and me. \n\n\nReason #1:\nSo, modern bike advocacy was formed in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, by many of the same wise people behind the concurrent growth of environmentalism, right? But 50 years later, these movements have failed to appeal to the public at large and their great ideas have yet to truly sink into the mainstream consciousness. This is no surprise to urban mobility expert Mikael Colville-Andersen. In his interview for LESS CAR MORE GO he explained that the finger-pointing, guilt-tripping, and holier-than-thou tone typical of their messaging does not engage your average Joe, and instead encourages inherently exclusive subcultures of Avid Cyclists and Nature Lovers. (\u201cYou\u2019re not a real cyclist, on that cruiser, in that skirt and heels...\u201d)\nColville-Andersen goes on: \nOwnership of cycling--for almost an entire generation in some countries--has been claimed by the roadies, the Mountain Bikers, the recreationalists. But they don\u2019t own the Bike! ...And they have nothing to do with mainstreaming bicycles. Let them ride their bikes and let them love it--it\u2019s not about them anymore, it\u2019s about the 99% who could be riding bikes, who maybe want to ride a bike, if they are given the right inspiration.\nColville-Andersen is changing the image of cyclists with the Cycle Chic movement and creating space for bikes through Copenhagenize Design Co.\nFor these reasons, LESS CAR MORE GO will not be a sort of Inconvenient-Truth-on-two wheels; our message is urgent, to be sure, but cargo bikes are FUN! Our documentary will instead offer an accessible and exciting alternative to the lycra-clad, gear-obsessed archetype of the modern cyclist. The characters in the film are not showing off, competing or shaming anyone; they ride because it makes sense and it feels good. No scary climate-change messaging needed; all it takes is a test ride! \nWhen it was invented 125 years ago, the bicycle was meant for the common man and woman: it liberated women, it liberated the working classes, it impacted the gene pool positively...it was amazing stuff that happened, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening again!        --Mikael Colville-Andersen\nEmily Finch competes in the Portland Fiets of Parenhood event.\nReason #2:\nThe utility cycling explosion is, like this documentary, not about the bikes! Modern life is crazy-making, yes? Hyper-paced, high-tech, disempowering, overwhelming. The sort of cognitive dissonance created by living in a system we don\u2019t control or necessarily believe in can leave us feeling boxed-in, worn-out and disconnected.\nGet on a bike. Preferably one with the power to replace your car. Ideally carrying a passenger. Pedal. Breathe. Wave. Smell. Comment on the changing colors. Stop to chat. Sweat. Notice how your legs are moving two people where they need to go. Notice smiles. Smile back! Then smile to yourself. Congratulations, and welcome back. You are reconnecting; to your body, your community, your family and your environment. \nLike the first time you balanced on two-wheels, the freedom is intoxicating. Underlying all this is a calming awareness that you are simultaneously saving resources, money and (often) time, reducing traffic and emissions, and creating health and happiness. You are doing all these things, in public, everyday. We believe this is immensely powerful.\nJosef Bray-Ali rides and sells cargo bikes at Flying Pigeon LA. He said it best: The night I assembled my Workcycles bakfiets in the autumn of 2007 and rode it home, I cried tears of joy. For me, the bakfiets was a release from the obligation most parents feel to trap themselves in minivans, traffic, stress, and health and happiness goals that are \u2018unrealistic given our hectic schedule\u2019. It was a middle finger to the entire 20th century pattern of sprawl, urban ruin, and over-investment in a car-only lifestyle.\nOur Request:\nThus far the project been fueled by passion and funded by co-directors and myself. A successful Kickstarter campaign will sustain us through post-production and ensure that all this inspired work pays off. A documentary (especially a crowdsourced one) is really made in the editing. I will need time and some assistance to weave all these disparate elements into a coherent and exciting story.\nKickstarter funds will also pay for a handful of video equipment to be shared by co-directors, media storage drives, an assistant editor/producer, and travel to cargo bike hot spots in and possibly outside of the US. There will be other expenses like music and archival rights, motion graphics and color correction/finishing, DVD authoring and outreach, press and publicity.\n\nI\u2019m asking asking for $40,000 because I\u2019m accustomed to making films on a shoestring, but the more we raise, the more polished and professional our documentary will be! All Kickstarter funds will go into making LESS CAR MORE GO as powerful as possible!\n\nThe Rewards:\nBecause our goal is to grow the cargo bike community WHILE making this film, we\u2019ve continued the theme of crowdsourcing and collaboration with rewards that allow you to get involved and become part of the team. Plus, cargo-carrying donations from over 10 different companies! Thank for supporting LESS CAR MORE GO!\n                                                 These rewards are no longer available. Sorry!: \n  Click on this list to find out more about the LCMG Co-Directors!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLESS CAR MORE GO is a marathon of a project and will require patience and persistence. I've got to organize and edit a huge variety and amount of footage; I must constantly be in communication with many Co-Directors; I'll need to capture the right events in order to bring the film to a closing that convincingly demonstrates a real cultural shift. To make all this happen I will need not only to enlist committed Co-Directors, but also to find a great assistant editor/producer and summon a lot of focused energy. \n\nIt is easy to lose perspective when working on such an epic, long-term project, so I'll have to reach out to story consultants and documentary experts for feedback. My assistant editor/producer and I will have to be very organized and detail-driven as far as credit and rights issues. \n\nAs mentioned above, it is of the utmost importance that LESS CAR MORE GO avoid being pigeon-holed as a movie for cyclists. We'll have to work hard to be clear that we're talking about a lifestyle choice that makes sense on numerous levels and has the potential to bring health and happiness to millions!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "166 Minutes of MOTHERLOAD Bonus Materials Released", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Your MUCH Belated Reward is here ...

Brad is also, like Mike, a great friend, always willing to lend a helping hand!\nOur most recent virtual team member is Phillip Kauffman, who deserves a round of applause, and a big cheer, for the successful funding of his first Kickstarter project, the Screw Grabber!\nPhillip and i reached out to help each other's projects from a suggestion made by one of our Backers!\nIt was touch and go, but the Screw Grabber made it, with everyone pitching in!  Definitely, a Kickstarter community success story!\nAlong the way, Phillip found the time, in between full-on marketing, to enhance the Tiletto cover picture with a great graphic design, which was very thoughtful and greatly appreciated.  If you visit the Screw Grabber, you can see more of Phillip's great graphic design skills.\nPhillip has kindly offered to support our project with any additional graphic design work we may need, and potentially collaborating on future projects.\nOnce again, congratulations Phillip, and a big Thank You!\nAs we add additional team members from the Kickstarter community, we'll feature them here.\nIt takes a great team to conceive, create, and bring to closure products worthy of being called a reward!\nFunding, Production, and Fulfillment Schedule\nIn weeks, starting from the first week of April 2014:\nWeek 1: Project funding period ends, funding goal achieved, and initiation of funds transfer process.\nWeek 2 Funds - Funds transferred to Team Tiletto.\nWeek 3 - Tiletto cuts checks for raw titanium sheet stock, manufacturing supplies, and reserving machine time.\nWeek 4 - Titanium sheet stock and manufacturing supplies secured and manufacturing schedule planned for Reward Tier 1.\nWeeks 5-6 - Manufacturing cycle for Reward Tier 1 complete, along with QA / QC.\nWeek 7 - Finishing and fulfillment for Reward Tier 1 completes.\nWeeks 8 - 12 Manufacturing through fulfillment process completed for Reward Tier 2.\nWeeks 12 - 16 Manufacturing through fulfillment process completed for Reward Tier 3 and project concludes successfully.\nThis production schedule allows for any number of glitches and gremlins to pop up and be ground under foot along the way to fulfilling Backer rewards!\nFinal Tiletto prototype getting ready to be milled.\nDesign Changes\nWe're allowing for design changes to Tiletto during the project based on Backer feedback and our own judgement based on the multiple tradeoffs between function, form, marketability, and DFM, not to mention Kickstarter product design guidelines.

StickQuik\u2122 Bands come in two sizes, 0.50\u201d (1/2\") and 0.375\u201d (3/8\"), to accommodate most sizes of tools, utensils and implements. StickQuik\u2122 Bands are made of high consistency grade silicone that is embedded with neodymium magnets.\nSilicone was chosen for its durability and elasticity, unlike crude rubber used in elastic bands. Plus, silicone is a non-allergic and non-toxic material that is safe to use around food. Neodymium magnets were chosen, as these rare earth magnets are the strongest permanent magnets available.\nVery handy when you're working underneath your car.\nUses/Function:\nStickQuik\u2122 Bands can be used by professional and weekend mechanics, gardeners, RV enthusiasts, handy men/women, teachers, hobbyists, crafters, artists and anyone who cooks or uses any implement of any kind.\nIf you don\u2019t have anything metal to have the bands stick to, some of the rewards will have the option to get the bands with 1\u201d metal discs or 12\u201d metal strips that have adhesive tape on the back, so you can stick them anywhere.\nGreat for tooth brushes\n For those with peg boards for their tools, we will offer the metal strips with pegs that fit peg boards.\nHow StickQuik\u2122 Bands Began:  \nWe created StickQuik\u2122 Bands because we wanted to use one for ourselves. We searched high and low for something like it and found nothing close to them in the market.\nSo, we thought that if we wanted something like this, then others would too. There are some magnetic tool organizers on the market that come in the form of magnetic strips, trays, bowls and bars for toolboxes or walls. These products only serve the function of storage and don\u2019t address having a tool, utensil or implement handy as you work.\nNo need to set your tools on the ground\nStickQuik\u2122 Bands lets the user do both since it attaches to and stays with the tool. The two of us began work about 2 years ago. We thought up various ideas using different materials and magnets.\n We mocked up ideas into visual and working models to see what would work best. We researched many different magnets for size, strength and shapes.\nSilicone was researched for its stretching properties and injection mold temperatures. After all this research we paired the right magnets with the right silicone.\nWhen we felt we were ready for prototyping, we researched large silicone injection molding companies, domestic and abroad.\nAll of the companies responded that engineering a mold would be very difficult or impossible to pull off and bowed out. Undaunted, because we felt we had such a great product, we began looking locally for companies.\nAfter a short search we found a company that has 30+ years experience molding rubber, plastics and silicone. At our first meeting, after showing models and drawings to them, they understood what we wanted and assured us that they could manufacture our product. They worked closely with us as we further refined the design.\nAfter the refinements we went to a 3-D model and finalized it. We had a 2 cavity mold tooled for the prototypes.\nFrom those two cavities, we made the fully functional StickQuik\u2122 Bands that you see in this campaign.\nWhy kickstarter?\nWe are thrilled with Kickstarter! We love to see others who have great ideas that they want to bring to the public. We love the energy people put into their projects. We both feel this is the best model to launch a campaign for our simple yet useful product. The conventional retail model makes it hard for the \u201csmall guys\u201d to get their great ideas into the market. Plus, we don\u2019t have enough capital to launch StickQuik\u2122 Bands on our own. This is where we need your help. The two of us have self-funded this project and have taken it as far as we can. The $27,000 goal is for funding final cavity tooling costs, raw materials and initial production costs, allowing us to meet our minimum order quantities.\nProduction Timetable:\nFebruary 2014\n\u2022 We launch our campaign for Kickstarter.  \nMarch 2014\n\u2022 Our project funds on the 23rd.\nApril 2014\n\u2022 Funds clear.\n\u2022 Order final tooling for a multiple cavity injection mold.

It's a very simple design but it looks extremely effective.\nBikeRumor.com: \"Inspired by the replaceable blade system found on your common hacksaw, the Cogly is a cleaning tool that allows you to easily slip a rag between your cogs.\"\nIBikeDaily.com: \"The Cogly Bike Tool will remove any unwanted grit and grime, keeping your drivetrain cleaner and increasing the life of your components.\"\nWhy do I need Cogly?\nKeeping your bike's drivetrain cleaned and lubed will improve the longevity and ride quality of your bike more than anything else. You need to remove debris from the gears (especially the cassette, the rear set of gears). The problem is that existing methods are tedious, which is why it often simply doesn't get done.\nCogly allows you to use one hand to slip a cleaning rag between the gears, clear of the grimy parts, while the other hand rotates the pedals.\nWho are you?\nGear Gear: a venture by three people that are passionate about cycling and want to build bicycle accessories to keep the activity simple and enjoyable.\nBob Schultz: The chief member, currently trying to avoid an official title. Several thousand dollars into this little project, he has learned a ton (among other things, that he has a very accommodating spouse).\nThom Dieterich: Chief marketing-type guy, and something of a passionate nerd in the bicycle and internet computing flavors.\nKaren Schultz: Well, she puts up with the chief guy, and her next occupation (if all goes well with our campaign) is to handle logistics and keep Bob's head from getting too big. For now, let's call her Director of Operations.\nHow did you come up with the idea?\nWhat follows is a brief history of grime. The names have been changed to protect the innocent, or at least until we have permission to reveal their true identity.\nIt was a warm summer day (No, really! It's not cold in Minnesota year round) and Bob felt the need to clean the gears on his road bike, specifically the cassette (the rear set of gears). A common way of doing this is to run a strip of rag between all the gears to remove the grime that has built up. Having done this many times, Bob was reminded what a pain it can be. Sure someone must have a tool that could hold a rag taut so that one hand could be used to clean the cogs and the other to rotate the pedals, Bob searched for an existing tool, but nothing. An idea was born.\nAugust 2013\nBob collaborates with a friend (we'll call him \"Pat\") to get his ideas into drawings. \"Pat\" does a nice job. In fact, he solves the problem of attaching the strip of rag to the tool with a simple and effective idea: use a wing-nut.\nFirst concepts of Cogly\nSeptember 2013\nBob meets with CAD engineer (\"Tim\") at a local coffee shop and a design emerges in the form of a CAD model:\nOctober 2013\nBob finds a manufacturer in the Twin Cities area that specializes in prototypes to create the first ever Cogly in ABS plastic cut using CNC.\nFor those of you that care about such things, Bob is using the prototype on his road bike, built around an early model Cannondale Six13 frame.\nNote the orientation of the bolts on the first prototype. Fine tuning the design, Bob requests another CAD drawing that turns the bolts 90 degrees so that a strip of rag secured flat against the pads will now have an edge that can go straight between the gears when the tool is held naturally.\nAfter a patent search and subsequent provisional patent application by a patent firm (we'll refer to it as The Firm), the latest design is 3D printed.\nNew bolt pad design\nThis prototype provided a learning opportunity. Note the rough curve. It turns out you need to be careful when exporting a 3D model from one CAD file format to another.\nThe first in a series of quotes from manufacturers Cogly is collected.\nNovember 2013\nThe Firm completes the filing of the provisional patent application. Cogly is now \"patent pending.\"\nThere are a number of manufacturers near the Twin Cities, so second and third quotes to manufacture Cogly are collected. With reasonable quotes from nearby manufacturers, the costs of making Cogly a reality become clear.\nBetween quotes, the design of Cogly continues to evolve.\nBolt holes are made smaller and centered.\nDecember 2013\nWe form a new company, Twin Cities Cycling Products LLC. The name is a mouthful, so we intend to conduct business as a DBA.\nAnother very good CAD engineer (\"Rocky\") helps Bob evolve the design even further, and the final prototype is produced in the actual plastic and color we expect Cogly to be manufactured with.\nThe label is \"photoshopped\" in using Gimp -- you can blame Bob.\nJanuary 2014 \nWe decide on a DBA for the business, \"Gear Gear.\"\nFebruary 2014\nWe submit our campaign to Kickstarter. And here you are. Thank you for your support. We truly appreciate it.\nWhere do you plan on manufacturing it?\nWe've collected multiple quotes from manufactures around the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota), and we plan on having it manufactured right here in the U.S., most likely in the Twin Cities.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've already put in some of our own money, but we need help funding initial efforts to manufacture the Cogly tool and evaluate the consumer response to the product.\nTo make Cogly a real product, we need your help to have a mold built for the initial runs of the product, and to have packaging professionally designed and sourced.\nWhen can I get my own Cogly?\nIf our Kickstarter project is successful, we'll be able to start the process of getting to production right away.\nThe first step will be getting the injection mold created and packaging sourced. This will take approximately two months to complete, but once it's created production will start right away.\nOnce we have product, packaging and shipping should only take another 2 weeks. Kickstarter backers who opt for the Earlybird levels will get their Cogly from from the initial production runs. Later, late May or early June, we'll then be able to take delivery of the rest of our order and get them shipped out to the rest of our backers.\nThank you for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne risk is domestic production capacity.

So we decided we would make our own, and we need your help to make them a reality!\nThe Series-E2 was designed based not only on our years of experience in the lab, but on extensive feedback from engineers and scientists in the field. \nIt became apparent that current engineer notebooks are woefully inadequate in every parameter. Notably, lack of page numbers, flimsy see through paper, non-archival paper, flimsy board, low-end adhesive binding, pages that do not lay flat, binding that does not allow the book to lay open, no user data page, no index, and high cost. The Series-E2 addresses all of these parameters and more.\nWe began with refining the grid. It is the same 5x5 grid (0.2\" spacing), but we have optimized it to be far less distracting and more consistent across pages. We then added page numbers, which we view as an essential asset of any lab notebook. \nNext, we added a more comprehensive and organized user data page to make labeling and archiving your notebook easier. Finally, we added an index with listed page numbers, making indexing easier and more organized.\nUser data page; user index (page 1 or 4)\nThe Series-E2 utilizes flat back smyth sewn binding, the highest quality binding that is commercially available. A slow and costly process, but one that yields unparalleled results.\nThis is the most durable type of binding, meaning pages will not fall out, the cover will not disconnect from the book block, therefore, you will not lose your work.   \nThis technique also allows for the most lay-flat property of any book. Even on the first pages the book will lay flat and stay open, so you can easily stay focused on your work.\nAfter a few months of testing we found what we think is the perfect paper for lab work. Something that is a joy to write on and will not fall apart with extensive use.\nThe paper is substantially thicker, making it both more durable and higher opacity. The high opacity allows for very minimal ink bleed through with most pens. The paper is also acid-free so it will not deteriorate and yellow, as standard lab paper, after a few years. \nThe cover board is considerably thicker than standard board, making the book much more sturdy. Furthermore, the cover has a special coating that protects the book from spills and general wear and tear. \nWE LISTEN: feedback is pivotal in the design of every notebook we produce.\nLocal Production: Not only does this support local fair-wage workers and their families, it allows for a higher level of quality control.\nLow Cost & Functional: We develop notebooks that optimize both cost and functionality for our users.\nDiligent Design: We spend months in the lab writing in a single notebook, this is why we believe it absolutely essential that our notebooks are not only functional but feel considered, inviting, and personable. \nProducing notebooks in this way is slow and costly.  But, we feel this level of quality and attention to detail is definitely worth it. Your support will help us complete this project, allow us to make these notebooks available to more people faster, and even reduce the cost of these notebooks. We truly appreciate your time and consideration. \nThank you for reading, \n~VELA TEAM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have not produced the Series-E2 in its exact form, we have worked with very similar materials and processes over the past years.

We call it \"Ink\".\nClick here to see a separate slideshow\nPhilosophy\nWe wanted to create an heirloom quality, American designed and manufactured pen to help counteract the current trend of impersonal communication and disposable consumerism. Can a machined pen accomplish this goal? Maybe not, but it looks amazing while it tries.\nLife is fast-paced and disposable. We rarely take time to slow down, put thoughts to paper, and share those ideas with others around us. Do we want to be remembered for email, or for a hand written note that has character and a feeling of sincerity?\nCommunication has become too impersonal. Everything is disposable. We aim to change that.\nVersions\nInk can be either a fountain or rollerball pen, giving the user their own preferred writing experience. We completely designed Ink from scratch, using high quality parts and materials. The grip section of Ink comes in either aluminum, brass or copper. This gives Ink the look and feel of a high dollar, custom pen, but because we make the pen ourselves, we are able to offer it at a fraction of the price of other custom pens.\nThe fountain pen version of Ink features a #5,stainless steel, German made nib assembly and converter, Manufactured by Schmidt. The nib assembly works with international standard ink cartridges, or you can purchase bottled ink to use with the provided convertor. The colors available in bottled ink are almost limitless, so you aren't just limited to black, blue and red. And because you can refill your pen over and over, you are creating less waste than if you used regular, disposable pens.\nThe rollerball version uses an included capless rollerball refill, also manufactured by Schmidt (p8126, black, .6mm), that is guaranteed to not dry out, even if the cap is left off of the pen for a year. This refill offers an incredibly smooth writing experience and is currently used by several other manufacturers for this reason. You can also use a standard Parker ballpoint compatible refill, including the Fisher Space Pen refill, if you so choose.\nWhy Aluminum, Copper and Brass?\nWe chose these three different materials to use for the grip section of the Ink for several reasons. First, we wanted to be able to offer a different aesthetic for each pen and allowing the user to choose a color and a material means the pen will be very unique. Second, for the fountain pen version of the Ink, using copper and brass grip section will allow for using more caustic inks that can potentially harm aluminum if submerged for filling (using cartridges shouldn't make any difference). Third, by choosing the copper or brass grip section instead of the aluminum, one can change the weight distribution of the pen slightly for those who like a slightly heavier pen. And finally, we think the different options just look really, really cool and we have the capability to offer all three materials, so we did.\nStats\nBecause Ink is machined from T-6061 aircraft aluminum, then anodized, it is lightweight as well as durable. Traditionally, more expensive pens are made from plastics or hard rubber, and, while very beautiful, can break if handled roughly or accidentally dropped. Ink can be tossed into a bag or pocket without the fear of breakage. Even if accidentally dropped, your Ink may show a little mark or ding, but it will survive and will have a visual story to tell about its life.The clip and screws on Ink are stainless steel and are designed to last a lifetime.The stainless #5 nib (FH241 fine) is manufactured in Germany and is a quality, well made unit. The included converter is also made by Schmidt and it very high quality. Weight and dimensions for each version are listed below:\nInk Capped\nInk Fountain Pen- 1.4 ounces for aluminum grip section, 1.6 ounces for copper and brass, including converter (no ink).\nInk Rollerball Pen- 1.4 ounces for aluminum grip section, 1.7 ounces for copper and brass, including refill.\nWhy fountain pens?\nFountain pens work and feel differently than other pens. Ink flows onto the paper and lubricates the nib, allowing it to glide across the paper smoothly as you write. Only a light pressure is needed to put ink to paper, no pushing to get it to write like you do with ballpoint. This allows you to write in a clean and fluid manner, especially if you are writing in script (cursive). If you are pushing hard, you may damage the nib and your pen will not perform as it should.\nFountain pens are still a mystery to many folks, something they remember seeing in cartoons as a kid or something only old people used to use. We can assure you, they are very much still around and can be used everyday just like any other pen. The fine folks over at Goulet Pen Company have an excellent primer on fountain pens if you would like to learn more. They are helpful and very knowledgeable about all things fountain pen, so check them out (we are not associated with Goulet in any way, we just think they are awesome).\nWe realize that fountain pens may not be for everyone, which is why we are also offering a rollerball version of our pen. The .6mm capless rollerball refill included with the pen is extremely smooth and is one of the best that we have used.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur new clip design requires a new manufacturing process we don't currently use in production. We can machine the parts for the pen bodies here in the shop, but we need to locally outsource some cutting and polishing to get the clips dialed in. By pledging toward our Ink project you can help us reach our financial goal so that we can afford to machine and purchase the parts we need to make the Ink a reality. Plus, by doing so, you get to own a really cool, American made pen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we design and manufacture all of our own products here in the USA, we have complete control over the manufacturing process.

It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story?

This enormous and brilliant work of art will live for one year in front of Palo Alto City Hall. Our installation date is November 16, 2013. We are raising money to make improvements, customize, weatherize, and install Aurora, as well as develop a mobile interface for visitors to interact with Aurora.\nAurora is a complex and robust piece of electronic art. She is 30 feet tall and has over 40,000 LEDS, and 4,200 shimmering, hand-beaten leaves.  Originally made for Burning Man, now Aurora is coming to Palo Alto City Hall Plaza.\nPalo Alto is reclaiming the old-time Town Square with high-tech flare. Aurora is a 21st Century \u201cEl Palo Alto\u201d (the namesake tree for this city). She creates a place for people of all ages and all walks of life to gather, meet, talk and break down barriers through her unique combination of technology with sustainable energy and public art. The application of technology makes Aurora interactive and accessible. Anyone with a finger and web access can \u201cpaint\u201d in light using Aurora as their canvas. High-efficiency LED lights powered by zero-emission electricity compel onlookers to consider their own energy and water consumption.\nAurora at Burning Man (Photo by Camaelon)\nHow Two Kids Brought Aurora to Palo Alto\nTwo Palo Alto kids, Sam and Julia, saw a photo of Aurora at Burning Man and decided it would be really cool to have Aurora in Palo Alto. They wanted to learn just what it takes to get a public art project from concept to achievement. They jumped in with both feet!\nFirst, they got Palo Alto citizens to sign a petition for the project. Then they went to a meeting of the Palo Arts Commission. The Art Commission agreed to allow Sam and Julia to present the project at one of their public meetings. Sam and Julia stood up at the microphone in front of the dais before the Art Commissioners and staff and presented Aurora. The Palo Alto Art Commission unanimously approved Aurora pending fundraising and engineering validation.  Sam observed shortly afterwards, \u201cIt took us one year and we got half a \u2018Yes\u2019!\u201d\nUndaunted, Sam and Julia gathered support throughout the Palo Alto community. They created a group of Aurora Kids - leaf makers and shakers, public speakers, and fundraisers - who made many of the leafs that you see on Aurora.\nJulia making a leaf at The Maker Faire (photo by Jason Chinn)\nNow, the Aurora Kids have raised some of the money required, but not enough. Meanwhile, the rest of the departments at the City of Palo Alto have added their support by issuing building and planning permits, special event permits, traffic closure plans, engineering sign-offs, landscaping and electrical work, and much more.\nSupporters\nThe City of Palo Alto supports this project.  The mayor of Palo Alto supports this Aurora. The Palo Alto Downtown Business Association supports this project. The  Black Rock Arts Foundation supports this project. Now it is YOUR turn to support Aurora!\nAurora is in the home stretch. Sam, Julia and the Aurora Kids have now gained skills, experience and confidence that they can be part of the civic process. They have communicated personally with Larry Harvey and the Palo Alto Mayor. They have made leafs, recruited supporters, spoken before large groups, presented to businesses and learned how to engage in the political process for positive change.\nPlease consider supporting Sam, Julia and all the Aurora Kids so that they can fundraise the amount needed for installing and maintaining LED interactive art in Palo Alto, the heart of Silicon Valley.\nAbout the Artist\nCharles Gadeken makes monumental artwork that thus far has incorporated mixed metals, interactive and kinetic elements, and special effects such as fire, light, and electricity. His artistic practice seeks to realize the potential for unexpected magic and serendipity in everyday life. His work instills a sense of play in the environment, remaking the mundane into magical items existing as real life portals into our imaginations.\nAurora was made by Charles and a community of forty artists, engineers, metalworkers and volunteers. \nhttp://www.charlesgadeken.com\nWhy you should support us\nAurora is a stunning and spectacular interactive LED installation that is just really really cool. Aurora will illuminate the area around City Hall, and invigorate the civic heart of Palo Alto.\nKickstarter Goals and Budget\nOur kickstarter campaign is set to be funded at $35,000. However, our goal is actually $50,000. We will set Kickstarter \"stretch\" goals as we get closer. Anything raised beyond this will go toward enhancements to Aurora\u2019s interactivity such as a touch-screen kiosk and upgrades to her LED\u2019s and electronics and power grid.\nWhy do we need $50,000?\nThe biggest question we get tasked is why we need so much money to install a piece of art. The answer is: big art costs big money. Your money will go towards adapting the structure to the more demanding requirements for public display over a long period of time.\nWe are rebuilding from scratch the LED wiring and electronics to make them weatherproof and more robust so that she\u2019ll operate continuously and unattended no matter what happens throughout the year. We are making Aurora interactive and aware of her surroundings through a mobile interface.\nWe are customizing her to fit inside the former fountain turned planter on the plaza and upgrading the structure to meet wind and seismic building codes. We are proud to say the engineering is complete and is approved by Palo Alto\u2019s Building, Planning and Public Works Departments. This has been tough, we only make it look easy.\nBudget\nStructural Rebuild (new i-beam base & certified welds): $10,000\nRe-Painting and : $6,000 LED new wiring harness & connectors: $3,000 \nInstallation (5 person crew, 4 days each): $5,000\nTear Down (In one year: 5 person crew, 4 days each): $5,000\nNew computer brain, power supplies and waterproof enclosures: $4,000\nLandscaping and irrigation for native grasses around Aurora\u2019s base: $3,000\nPayroll:  $25,000\nTOTAL: $55,000 (not including kickstarter costs)\nWhy hasn\u2019t the City funded this project?\nWhen the Palo Alto Arts Commission first approved this project, they made it clear that we would have to raise the money on our own. However, the entire City of Palo Alto has bent over backwards to help us. The City has removed many barriers to this installation that could have cost thousands of dollars. The City has waived all permit costs, upgraded the power at City Hall to support Aurora's needs and facilitated the permitting process.\nAurora at Dusk (photo by Dust to Ashes)\nWe thank all City officials for their energy, commitment and dedication to getting this project to its November 16th install date. Without the support of the City we would not be able to commit to this install date.\nThank You!\nThank you for watching our kickstarter campaign. We think this is a great project for you to support.

This kind of device is called an intervalometer. Michron is special because it has no buttons or screens; instead the user interface is the Michron App on your smart phone (Android or iPhone). \nOnce you\u2019ve created your settings in the app, upload them by plugging your phone into Michron with the programming cable. After you have uploaded your settings, you can disconnect your phone. Michron will perform completely on its own. Once Michron is plugged into the trigger port, it will tell your camera to take photos according to your settings. And don't worry, Michron's battery has a life of over 2500 hours, meaning you will probably never have to replace it (and if you do, it's easy to replace).\nWhat is a timelapse?\nA timelapse is a collection of photos taken over a period of time that are then compiled together to create a video that expresses time in a way not normally seen. Timelapse photography gives you the freedom to visualize the passage of time as you want, allowing for infinite creativity. To see one of the many videos that got us inspired by timelapse photography, check out http://vimeo.com/23237102\nWhich cameras does Michron work with?\nMichron works with any camera with an external trigger port. This includes almost all DSLR's and a growing number of point and shoot cameras (to see the full list, please see our FAQ). We will confirm your camera make and model when we send out our survey to ensure that you get the appropriate cable for your camera. \nHow do you turn the photos into a video?\nMichron tells your camera to take photos at the interval you designate in the app. After you are done collecting the photos you can open them into any one of a handful of free or purchased programs (Timelapse Assembler, Lightroom, etc) which will quickly turn your photos into the final video. Although it is straightforward, we will also provide a short video showing how to use these programs as part of our manual.\nTutorials:\nWe will provide a few tutorial videos to help you get started taking timelapses. In these videos we will show you how to use each individual feature of Michron as well as share some tips and tricks that we have learned from our experience on how to take better timelapses.\nMade In America\nMichron will be manufactured and assembled in the United States, although certain items such as accessory cables and electronics components may be sourced through non-domestic channels since many of these items are not made in the United States. \nFeatures\nMichron is programmed by your Android or iOS device (If you don't have one of these, check our out FAQ for some more information), allowing us to program in some cool features not feasible on a device sporting an LCD screen and a few buttons. \nAutoTimelapse\u2122:\nIf you are completely new to photography or timelapse this optional feature is for you! Put your camera in Landscape mode (or Portrait, Night Scene, etc) and pick a pre-made setting on Michron: People, Clouds, Landscape, Cityscape, Stars. From these presets, Michron creates all the settings for you and works with your camera as it shoots in Auto.\nIntervalometers typically require the photographer to shoot in Manual (meaning the user adjusts the camera exposure) but many people do not know how to do this. AutoTimelapse fixes this problem and makes timelapse accessible to all photographers.\nInterval Ramping:\nInterval ramping allows users to change the interval between shots during the timelapse. For example: most timelapses are taken at a fixed interval, such as one photo every 30 seconds for 2 hours. With interval ramping, you can start at 30 seconds, then speed up to every 5 seconds at the one hour mark, and then slow down again to every 60 seconds for the last 15 minutes of the timelapse. (See the clock shot in the video!)\nBulb Ramping:\nBulb ramping allows you to make smooth light transitions. Michron will continually adjust the shutter speed of the camera according to your settings. This feature is extremely useful in shots with dynamic lighting such as a sunset or sunrise. Michron is designed to work with or without a PC Sync cable. \nHDR Bracketing*:\nThis feature allows you to make multiple exposures for every photo you take in your timelapse. Instead of taking a single photo after each interval, your camera takes a set of three closely-spaced photos, each at a different exposure. You can then later edit each batch of three photos into an HDR image in your photo software of choice and compile an HDR timelapse.\n*HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, meaning an image that has very dark parts and very bright parts. Bracketing means taking multiple photos of the same image at different exposures.\nExternal Trigger:\nThis is an awesome little feature. For new photographers, this is something you want to have. For experienced photographers, it will be nice to know you have an extra one in your camera bag. This feature allows you to take a photo on your camera by triggering it through your phone, from a distance of about two feet. This eliminates camera shake, allowing you to take sharper images (no blur!).\nPortable:\nWe've made Michron as small as possible, so that you can take it wherever you go without even realizing it's there. And, since it's designed to sit in your camera's hotshoe, it will stay out of the way when in use. \nStretch Goal!\n 2500 Backers- Photo Booth:\nThis feature will allow you to take easy group or self portraits, even when your camera is far away from what is being shot. Many cameras already have a self timer feature for taking photos such as this, but typically the delay is only for 10 seconds and does not let you control how many photos are taken. This was a big complaint of Steve\u2019s after spending 20 minutes trying to get a group shot on top of a rock (there was lots of running involved) so we\u2019d love to add it into Michron.\nGoofy Poses Optional\nWith the Photobooth feature, you can set how long the delay is, how many photos to take, and how long between each photo. That way, you have plenty of time to get into position and take all the photos you want. Basically, Photobooth is everything you wish you camera self timer could do.\nNot just for timelapse:\nMichron was designed to be as flexible as possible because we know what creative people can do with a tool like this. Because Michron is, at the heart of it, taking numerous still photos at a set interval, it can be used for a few other things as well, although we are sure you will think of many more:\nEasily take multiple photos for self portrait and group shots\nStop motion and claymation\nPhoto stitching\nThe Project:\nWe have been working on this project for several months now and are ready to launch. We have finished our R&D and have a refined prototype that is sourced and ready to manufacture. However, manufacturing and delivering a physical product is not cheap, which is why we are really excited to be here on Kickstarter asking for your support. This money will fund the first production run of the Michron. The money raised here will go to the following: \nUp-front, one-time manufacturing costs\nPer unit manufacturing cost and accessory cables\nShipping \nThe App:\nThe Michron App is a licensed and adapted version of the Android- and iPhone-compatible smartphone interface originally developed by Alpine Labs for Radian. The app is free and will be available for download through the Google and Apple app stores. The app is compatible with all Android devices newer than 2.3 (aka Gingerbread), and all iOS devices running iOS 5.0 or newer.\nHow Michron Got Here\nMichron has come a long way from Steve's first sketches drawn in the back of a taxi in China. \nUtilizing 3D printing, both on a home printer and using commercial services, we were able to rapidly iterate the mechanical design, to create a package that is both compact and functional. In addition, we have worked extensively with the company that will be producing our injection molded parts to ensure that the Michron enclosure can be made to our specifications.\nIn addition to the mechanical design and iteration (the visible parts) significant work went into miniaturizing the printed circuit boards to help us shrink the housing even further. Fortunately, the first PCB we designed worked great, and shrinking it down went smoothly as well. We've since moved the ports around to improve fit for our V3 boards, which are in the mail. \nOnce the printed circuit boards were working happily, we had to nail down the firmware (the code that runs on Michron) so that it plays well with the smartphone app, and could execute all of our advanced features. Ultimately the Michron to phone interface went smoothly, thanks to Steve's past experience with Radian, but it still took a good deal of time, and we are still adding and altering some small features as we continue to get feedback from our users. \nTimeline\nAs soon as we reach our funding goal we will order the molds for Michron's housing (this is one of the slowest steps in manufacturing). This will allow us to start a major part of the manufacturing process before the campaign ends, enabling us to deliver the Michron to you even faster. Barring any unforeseen manufacturing issues (explained under \"Risks and Challenges\"), we expect to package and ship your Michron in March.\nAccountability\nWe will email our backers with regular updates regarding the production process as well as provide behind the scenes footage from the manufacturing floor.

We're passionate about creating products combining both uniqueness and impeccable design with quality and craftsmanship.  \nDevelopment and Manufacturing\nDesign - Our design team have been working on the development of this product for the last 6 months.  From the form and function of the Gumstick\u2122 to the finish and colors, the team have taken all aspects of the design into consideration before prototyping the product.\nManufacturing - We have the all the plant machinery in place and have an established relationship with the factory who will be manufacturing the final production run. \nProcess - The team has spent a great deal of time optimizing the manufacturing process and we have now have our production cycle and timelines confirmed.\nCosts - With our background in mobile stands we have been able to negotiate the best costs with our production partners, ensuring that the Gumstick\u2122 can be offered to end consumers at an accessible retail. You get a lot of functionality for your buck!\nWorking Prototypes - We have our initial prototypes approved and have finalized the design.  Once we meet our funding requirement we will be in a position to finish the final tooling on the molds and be prepped and ready to start production.\nWe are looking to continuously grow our product range and firmly establish ourselves as a lifestyle brand with in the consumer electronics accessories market and beyond. \nOur inspirational outlook and cool, clean, modern brand identity represent our approach to business. We are collectively forward, futuristic thinkers. \nThe team at work in the UK office\nMeet the Team!\nPatrick Mathews - Founder and Resident Head Honcho              \nPatrick spent many years working in a management role within investment banking and IT.  As we all know 'management role' is a very fluffy term and really means that Patrick was not really very important at all in his last job.  He just thought he was. Fortunately; however, he has decided to follow his passion for all things tech and beautiful looking and founded Breffo in 2009.  Being the CEO, Patrick now holds a very senior role yet he's confident that he is still generally just 'not very important at all'. Consistency is key!  A creative at heart and a true entrepreneur he lives day to day in the thick of creativity and thank goodness for it, as the output yields some pretty cool stuff!  Patrick now lives in the UK with his family and very happily 'acts' like he manages the UK, European and International operations', though we all know he just makes a lot of coffee!  As seems to be the case with all entrepreneurs, outside of work Patrick wonders if there actually is an 'outside of work' life. \nChris Facey - Vice President of Product Development \nChris is an experienced product designer with a wealth of knowledge in designing and manufacturing consumer products. In 2006 Chris teamed up with Daniel Ashman (now Vice President of Design at Breffo) to start a product design consultancy, together they successfully ran the business for over 6 years. As a consultant Chris worked on design development for a number of large global organizations including Sharp, Microsoft and Belkin.  In 2009 the consultancy was approached by Patrick to help develop his idea, the Spiderpodium and later the Spiderpodium Tablet. Three years later in 2012 Chris left the consultancy to work for Breffo full time as Product Development Vice President and oversee's all global production for the brand.  Chris lives in Cardiff with his wife Siobhan. Outside of work he enjoys playing golf (although not very well), going for the occasional run (very occasional) and enjoying a nice cold beer in the local pub after a hard day's work (not that he works very hard...).\nDaniel Ashman - Vice President of Design\nPrior to Breffo Dan managed a product design consultancy start up with fellow colleague Chris Facey.  The team quickly established themselves as a serious players in the industry winning major global clients and a number of product design and business awards.  Dan officially joined Breffo in 2012 overseeing all design as well as managing business development in Europe, Scandinavia and Asia. Dan has been known to take extremely bad medical advice from his US Breffo colleagues when not feeling well.  An example of which would be to swallow a dissolvable vitamin C tablet while sitting on top of the Stratosphere roller coaster in Las Vegas (this all transpired during CES 2012) which resulted in a foamy gas bursting out of his nose uncontrollably (to everyone else's amusement). Dan lives with his girlfriend Lauren in Cardiff who is very understanding considering Dan is a workaholic and eats, sleeps and breathes Breffo!\nSara McMahon - General Merchandise Manager North America     \nSara has worked in a licensee capacity with global brands such as Levi's, Docker\u2019s and Nautica and also has national retail experience as the Head of Buying for Gift and Hard Goods with retailer Papyrus.  She met Patrick in 2000 when they and their partners (now spouses) were living it up in San Francisco, CA (where Patrick was pretending to be important in Finance). Fast forward 2 weddings, 4 kids (between them), a transatlantic move (him) and 13 years of friendship - Patrick coerced Sara into leaving her corporate career for the excitement of a start up!  She joined the Breffo team in 2011 and was instrumental in the opening of the US headquarters and is responsible for all marketing and distribution of Breffo products within North America. When she's not spending time with her family you can catch her at the yoga studio or indulging in her love of exorbitantly priced designer footwear.  She is also actively involved in volunteering within the Portland metro area with organizations such as Living Yoga and the Junior League.                \nHow We Get it Done\nAlthough still at start up level, we have successfully launched and distributed several other products prior to the Gumstick\u2122.  Our most success being the Spiderpodium Original  which has won numerous design awards including the CES Design and Engineering Award in 2011.\nWe manufacture our products exclusively in the United Kingdom (UK), renowned for their quality manufacturing.  Our UK base manages all facets of development and production allowing for better quality assurance as we regularly conduct inline quality inspection to guarantee we are providing the highest level of product to our customers. Our Portland, OR based office oversees North American distribution and will serve as the hub for our Kickstarter project.  The Portland team is responsible for all facets of the campaign and will be the lead team managing the distribution and shipping of all Kickstarter rewards.\nHow Your Pledges Will Help\nDespite rapid growth, like all start ups we are experiencing the growing pains of taking our brand and company to the next level, bringing products to market is one of the most difficult challenges a new company faces.  Here are some of the areas your pledges will support.  Helping to make this concept reality.\nTooling & Development - Fundamental to the project and one of the largest early stage expenses.\nProduction - The actual production cost of the product, materials, running the tools and manufacturing the final product.\nQuality Assurance & Packaging - Presenting long lasting quality products to customers in a beautiful way.

We have three goals for this project:  \n1- Make Available New Materials with Continued Innovation  \nConsumer grade 3D printing is fast growing and material selection is a bottleneck for continued expansion into more demanding applications. PLA and ABS are the two most available materials, but they have some serious drawbacks like low softening temperature for PLA and low stiffness for ABS. \nWith this project we want to make available new materials that address some of these issues without sacrificing printability or affordability. After our initial offering of materials we will re-invest in R&D and continue to innovate.   \n2- Material Evaluation  \nCurrently, suppliers of filament do not give much information about what the material is and what the properties are. It is either labeled as PLA or ABS, and you often do not know what brand or grade of material it is. If you are able to find that out, the only material properties available are for the bulk resin, not of the printed part.\nAll of our materials have datasheets (available on the Proto-Pasta website) giving the exact material or compound and average test results of actual printed parts. It will be the first time users can compare actual mechanical properties of parts printed with different materials using empirical data.\nMaterial properties are based on testing using a printed test sample that is 60mm X 10mm X 3mm.  Datasheets include the Heat Deflection Temperature, Impact Resistance, Stiffness, Flexural Strength, and information on printability of the material.\n-Heat Deflection Temperature is the temperature at which the material softens enough to reach a specified strain at a specified stress. In our case the test sample is put into 3-point bending with a 0.62N force. The sample and test fixture is placed into oil and heated until the sample deflects 1mm.\nHeat Deflection Temperature Test Setup\n-Impact resistance is tested by placing the sample in a vise and hitting the cantilevered end with a pendulum of known mass.  When the pendulum is dropped without a sample it swings to a measured height, and when it breaks a sample it swings to a lower height.  The energy taken to break the sample is calculated from the difference between these two heights.\nImpact Resistance Test Setup\n-Flexural strength is the stress at which the material breaks in 3-point bending.  Flexural stiffness, or modulus, is the ratio of stress to strain in bending.  More simply put it is the resistance of a material to bend, or how rigid or stiff the material is.  Both properties are determined in the same test.  The test is completed in a computer controlled machine that measures force and displacement as the sample is broken at a controlled feed rate.  The slope of the linear portion of the chart is the stiffness, and the strength is calculated from the maximum force reached to break the sample. \nFlexural Stiffness and Strength Test Setup\nChart of Force VS Displacement for Carbon Fiber Reinforced PLA\n3- Shipping Sweet Spot  \nWith a wide variety of materials to try, it could get expensive buying 1KG spools and paying for shipping on each. We have decided to offer our materials in 1/4kg coils and ship them using the US Postal Service First Class Mail. This will get you a coil of material anywhere in the US in 2-5 days for $3. Each coil will ship in a heat sealed bag with desiccant so your filament arrives dry and ready to go.\nRewards\nThe reward structure for Prota-Pasta is relatively simple and consists of combinations of three new materials, a reusable folding spool, and T-shirts.  Each is explained in detail below.\n-Carbon Fiber Reinforced PLA\nClick here for complete Datasheet\nProto-Pasta Carbon Fiber reinforced PLA is made from NatureWorks 4043D PLA Resin compounded with 15% by weight Tenax short chopped Carbon Fibers.  It is designed to be stiff, or to resist bending.  It is the stiffest material we offer and makes parts with an incredibly solid feel. When printed, this material is a dark glossy black that glitters slightly in direct light from the fine chopped fibers reflecting the light. \nCarbon Fiber Reinforced PLA does not require a heated bed and prints much like unreinforced PLA filament.  The main difference is that it is brittle and care must be taken when handling the filament and loading the printer.\nWe have had good results printing at 190C-210C using a .5mm nozzle and direct-drive spring loaded pinch-roll style extrusion head.  Layer adhesion is excellent and the material has low warpage.\nMaterial Properties Comparison\nPrint Incredibly stiff carbon fiber reinforced parts!\n -High Temperature PLA\nClick here for complete Datasheet\nProto-Pasta High Temperature PLA is made from a custom compound consisting of mineral filled impact modified PLA with a nucleating agent to help promote crystallization.  Crystallization after printing is what gives this material added heat resistance.  To fully realize this advantage, parts must be soaked in hot water or an oven after printing at 60C-80C for 3-5 minutes.  This crystallizes the material and makes it much more heat resistant. It does not require a heated bed to print well, but this may help crystallize the material after printing and make oven soaking unnecessary for some parts. High Temperature PLA is a glossy off white, or very light gray.  Printed parts look good and have slightly more texture than standard PLA.  This material is not translucent like standard PLA.  \nWe have had good results printing at 190C-210C using a .5mm nozzle and direct-drive spring loaded pinch-roll style extrusion head.\nLayer adhesion is good and the material has low warpage.\nMaterial Properties Comparison\n  Your PLA parts will no longer wilt in the sun!\n-Polycarbonate - ABS Alloy\nClick here for complete Datasheet\nProto-Pasta Polycarbonate-ABS (PC-ABS) Alloy is an incredibly tough material designed for strong, resilient parts. When printed, PC-ABS is bright glossy white.\nProto-Pasta PC-ABS Alloy can print well.  It is very moisture sensitive and even if stored bagged with desiccant, drying in an oven for ~ 1hr at 85C-95C may be required for bubble free high strength prints.  Layer adhesion can be an issue if the part is large or the temperature is too low.  We have had good success printing parts ~60mm long at 260C-280C using a .5mm nozzle and direct-drive spring loaded pinch-roll style extrusion head.  A heated bed may help warpage and layer adhesion on larger/thicker parts.\nMaterial Properties Comparison\nPrint Incredibly tough parts with PC-ABS Alloy\n-Spools\nOur folding spools let you change materials without any disassembly, just fold in 2 of the forks and slide into the material coil.  They look great and are an easy way to print with Proto-Pasta coils.\nFold Spool Forks and Insert into Coils\nFold Out Forks\nAnd You are Ready to Print!\n-T-Shirts\nHigh quality, screen printed Proto-Pasta T's!\nWhere will Proto-Pasta be Made?\nProto-Pasta will be manufactured here at ProtoPlant INC. headquarters in Vancouver WA USA on manufacturing equipment that we designed and built.  If demand is high enough we may invest in some commercially made equipment but we will keep all manufacturing in-house and in the US. Below are a few images of the factory setup.\nExtrusion Nozzle and Conveyor Belt\nDiameter Measurement\nDrive Rollers\nControl Panel\nWho We Are  \nWe are Aaron Cram and Dustin Cram; brothers who periodically work together on fun and interesting projects. Aaron is a computer scientist with tons of experience designing electronics hardware, software, and firmware. Dustin is a Mechanical Engineer with an aerospace background who gets to design and build a wide variety of interesting stuff at his design and fabrication company ProtoPlant Inc.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThousands have already been invested in material samples and manufacturing hardware. We are choosing Kickstarter to launch Proto-Pasta because it is a great way to introduce our product to a vibrant community and we need additional start-up capital to purchase raw materials at a reasonable price and further automate our factory. We set our funding goal at a point where we can successfully get Proto-Pasta launched by purchasing large quantities of materials and refining our manufacturing processes.

Perhaps most importantly, the Silly Pink Bunny and murals that grace the walls at Haight and Laguna symbolize years of neighbor and community efforts to activate the Haight Street corridor through culturally relevant and iconic street art. \nTHE THREAT:   Today, development plans for the site include removing the Silly Pink Bunny and walls along Laguna and Haight to make way for new rental housing.\nTHE SOLUTION:   Fortunately, the developer of the site has agreed to work with the community and artist to find a permanent home for a new, bronzed Silly Pink Bunny and the murals.   And the Haight Street Art Center has already secured half of the funding that will be needed to make this effort a reality.\nTHE PROJECT:    But we need your help to raise the other half!  Join us and Bronze the Bunny!  Once we reach our funding goal, the artist will Bronze the Bunny and we'll send out the goodies to those who supported the effort!  The new, bronzed Silly Pink Bunny will get placed in its final location near the corner of Laguna and Haight in about 12-18 months, depending on the pace of construction at the site and subject to final location approval from the San Francisco Planning Department.  In the meantime, the bunny will get bronzed and will get placed in a temporary home until the Haight & Laguna location is ready.\nCheck out the Rewards! ------------------>>>\nScenes from the Bunny Funeral (courtesy of Haighteration.com)\nTHE STORY:\nBack in 2010, when we made a call out to local artists to turn a tagged and blighted wall on Haight and Laguna into a gateway to the Lower Haight, we didn't have any funds to do it; just the permission of UC Berkeley to put a temporary mural in the space, and a dream.\nFour months later, Ursula Young and Sonya Genel flanked the corner, while MarsOne, Doze Green, and David Choong Lee collaborated on a stunning piece that took up half of the Haight Street side of the mural.  Hugh Leeman's iconic homeless man in a baseball cap adorned the Laguna side, along with an Octopus woman in purples and browns by Dee Jae Paeste.\nUrsula Young and Ericailcane, Photo by Andrew Dudley\nThe corner, however, was still empty. Another local artist had asked us to reserve it, and we, knowing the artist's work well from his years at Lower Haight store Upper Playground, happily agreed.\nA month later, in time for our celebration of the Love in the Lower Haight art project,  Jeremy Fish mounted his Silly Pink Bunny, a giant pink statue with a figure he'd been drawing since beginning his career as an artist, a friendly yet frightening bunny with a skull in his mouth.\nSilly Pink Bunny by Jeremy Fish, photo by Andrew Dudley\nAll the artists knew that this was a temporary installation and still gave their time, their talent, and, in Jeremy's case, his statue, to this community project.\nPeople from around the world came to photograph the mural and to take a picture with the creepy and cute Silly Pink Bunny. The corner went from being a place to get your car broken into to a place to hang out and take videos and pictures of iconic and artistic San Francisco.\nThe murals have morphed over time, too tagged or ragged to continue. New artists take the place of the original. The community continues to repaint Ursula's corner mural when it gets tagged and to use anti-grafitti paint on others. The Silly Pink Bunny had a makeover just a month back, and gained a patch over his ripped eye, and a pirate background to match his sporting new look.\nPhoto by Horus Tolson\nThe time has come to say goodbye to the existing Love in the Lower Haight Art installation.  The walls and Silly Pink Bunny will be demolished, starting on Friday the 13th---two and a half years after the art started going up.  We invite you to join the funeral and a wake and to celebrate the new beginning--a BRONZED permanent Silly Pink Bunny.\nThe not-for-profit Haight Street Art Center, which will be housed inside the Woods Hall Annex on the Haight Street side of the development, has provided an initial pledge of $25,000!  If we can raise another $25,000, then Jeremy Fish will BRONZE the Silly Pink Bunny and it will become a permanent addition to the Lower Haight to welcome visitors to our neighborhood, and to make us smile just a little bit as we take the 71 up the hill or walk or drive by.\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, the Haight Street Art Center has also set up an independent bank account to isolate funds contributed to the Silly Pink Bunny Project.  If funds generated through this campaign exceed our goal, we will use excess funds to further the goal of public art at the site.\nPlease help us add public art to San Francisco, preserve a piece of Lower Haight art and keep Laguna and Haight a gateway to the Lower Haight. You'll be helping your neighborhood and yourself (check out the one of a kind art that is being given away as part of this project!)\nTHANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe new, bronzed Silly Pink Bunny will get placed in its final location near the corner of Laguna and Haight in about 12-18 months, depending on the pace of construction at the site and subject to final location approval from the San Francisco Planning Department.

It is the process where layer by layer of molten plastic is extruded through a heated nozzle in a computer controlled manner to build a 3 dimensional object from computer data.\nWhat can it be used for? The possibilities are basically limitless...break something around the house?...print it!  Design a new invention...print it!  Demonstrate a mechanical device or concept for education...print it!  If you can dream it you can print it!\nWhat makes us different? The One Up and Two Up can produce results rivaling the best print quality of virtually every printer on the market at a price less than an XBOX!  By leveraging our supply chains and machining components in house in our industrial machine shop we can pass the savings on to you.  The One Up and Two Up use all industry standard components albeit at a quality substantially higher than most kits available.  This allows very precise movement enabling extremely high print quality with the minimum of 'fuss'.\nHow did the OneUp and TwoUp come about? Through the development of our all metal, precision machined 3D printers we had always talked about a low cost, entry level unit to allow virtually anyone to get into the exciting field of 3D printing. We had all these amazing quality components for linear motion and precise movement 'laying around' from our other printers so what we really needed was a low cost frame. Really we repurposed the components that we were already using into a no frills 3D printer. We chose Melamine coated MDF as a dimensionally stable, rigid, low cost alternative to our all metal printers AND it could be cut on our huge CNC laser. We stripped off all the extra bits that we could to reduce the cost as much as possible without sacrificing quality of prints; you can acheive some really world class prints at 60mm/s. We integrated the stepper drivers into the electronics board and we machined up a low cost hot end using proven concepts for printing strictly in PLA. We wanted to create a world class printer with the only sacrifice relative to much more costly 3D printers being the build area at a price that anyone can afford. It's cheaper than an X-Box!\nThe entire Melamine coated MDF frame can be cut in less than 10 minutes on our 150w CO2 laser. Due to the cutting envelope of the laser we can nest 30 of the OneUp's frames on one 48\"x96\" panel, click cut and let it go. This allows huge throughput with minimal human interaction. All the frame pieces were drawn up in Solidworks and we will be releasing a PDF, EPS and DXF version so replacement, mods and copies can be produced on anyone's laser...isn't Open Source great!?\nFull Laser Cut Frame of All Nested Parts\nThe Arduino based electronics that we are using are referenced off the Open Source Printrboard electronics. They include 4 integrated Allegro 4983 stepper drivers. There are two MOSFETS onboard as well that power the extruder and at a later time a heated bed for printing in materials other than PLA. There is an SD card slot to allow computer free printing. The printer is powered by a universal 60w laptop power supply which provides the needed power for the extruder and stepper motors.\nOneUp Arduino Powered Electronics based on Printrboard\nThe extruder is called the Anubis and is based off an industry standard PEEK barrel with a groove mount with a PTFE liner which is used as a lubricious insulator. It is fed into a machined brass barrel that is heated with a machined aluminum heater core that houses the heating element and thermistor for temperature control. The extruded filament exits through a machined brass nozzle with a .40mm orifice. The extruder is designed for 1.75mm PLA filament which gives off a sweet smell and is non-toxic and biodegradeable.\nAssembled Anubis Hot End\nAnubis Hot End Components\nQU-BD One Up / Two Up Specs:\nMinimum Layer Height: 50 Microns (Lower is Better)\nFrame Material: Black Melamine MDF\nMax Travel: Approximately 100x100x125mm / 175x175x125mm\nMaximum Travel Speed: 150mm/s\nMaximum Print Speed: 100mm/s\nBed Material: Acrylic (or Basalt ...

While they are already under process to meet our Holiday deadline, we did commit to purchasing a LOT of them over the coming months! We have a 9600 square foot warehouse that we do the machining of all the components. We are working with another company that shares a warehouse with us to handle the packaging and shipping of the kits in order to bolster up our fairly lean work force.  All total there will be approximately 10 people helping to package and ship out the printers.  Based on the initial time trials we expect to be able to package and ship everything in one business week from the time all the electronics are received and tested.  While we are waiting for the electronics to arrive, we will begin to prepackage all of the kits. Additionally we are working on a video tutorial for assembly and calibration to make it as easy as possible to begin printing.  We are intentionally limiting the amount of kits for the Holidays in order to make SURE that we can fulfill the timeline, we know many will be sold as Holiday gifts, so delivering on time is critical.

The motor shafts are induction hardened and require a lot of force to actually couple the pulleys to them.  We have sent out quite a few units that use a different technique, a brass insert.

The vivid and colorful light created by the Sebbo lasts for hours on a single charge. It was invented by Sebastian Asvarksh (hence the name \"Sebbo\") and further developed into a professionally designed product by Erick Calderon. \nTake a Sebbo with you to any night time activity whether it be as a safety device or an extra bright fashion accessory. Bring a Sebbo to a sporting event programmed with your favorite team's colors! \nStrap a Sebbo onto your bike for increased visibility or keep it on your wrist for an evening run. Sebbos are great for music events, especially large music festivals! Or for the light artists out there the Sebbo can be used to take gorgeous long exposure photos.\nDesigned with aesthetics in mind.\nFrom the very first prototype, we designed the Sebbo to be an aesthetically driven product that is not just another generic \"light toy\". The Sebbo looks good both when illuminated as well as with the power off, and unlike a glow stick, the light intensity remains constant for the entire life of the battery.\nThe Enclosure   \nOne of the most complicated parts of developing the Sebbo was creating an enclosure for it that was both durable and easy to clean. The original hand made Sebbos were sealed in food saver bags and enclosed in spandex.\nNeedless to say they were filthy by the end of an action filled night. We experimented with many ideas, including the ability to remove the enclosure to allow for washing, but in the end we realized that taking the electronics in and out of the enclosure was cumbersome and rough on the circuitry. So after a troubling few months trying to find a suitable enclosure, we bit the bullet and hired Design Edge, a professional industrial design firm in Austin, TX, to help us come up with a solution. The results were enlightening. \nDesign Edge created a multi-layered enclosure consisting of black neoprene on the underside where the wristband contacts your skin and a special silicone backed rip-stop nylon fabric layer on the surface to diffuse the light. The result is a durable and light weight wristband that is easy to clean and maximizes light output.\nWe are super excited about this enclosure and think you will appreciate how comfortable it feels on your wrist.    \nThe Electronics\nLike circuits? Pledge at the $15 level and get an original signed and numbered screen print of the Sebbo circuitry!\nAlthough the final electronic component design of the Sebbo has been refined through collaboration with TenX, a professional electronic engineering firm in Austin, TX, the basic components have not changed from the original prototype. \nSebastian's original sketch of the Sebbo from our Arduino class.\nHere's how the original Sebbo prototype came together:\nAfter a few revisions, TenX took our bulky design and condensed it all onto a single flexible circuit, eliminating various unnecessary wires and soldering while creating this more reliable and efficient final design:\nThe Battery\nThe Sebbo uses an 800mAh Lithium Polymer battery for power. We've incorporated features that ensure safe operation including a protective case and safety circuit. Lithium Polymer batteries, however, can be dangerous if handled incorrectly. For this reason we're suggesting the Sebbo for ages 12 and up unless supervised by an adult. \nThe Firmware \nThe Sebbo is completely open source and Arduino compatible. Each Sebbo will come out of the box pre-programmed with the classic color cycle pattern like what you see in the videos plus various other patterns including an easy to use color picker mode.\nHere's a video that shows how the button works to switch banks and also to add and select colors in colorpicker mode: \nFor those of you that want to customize their Sebbo you'll be happy to know that you can upload your own Arduino sketches to the Sebbo through the standard Arduino interface.\nThe Sebbo Lights Kickstarter Launch\nWe have spent many hours and a fair amount of capital on every little detail of the design of the Sebbo. Now we just want them in our hands and we want them really bad. This Kickstarter campaign is going to allow us to put together a sizable enough initial order quantity to make the Sebbo viable for full scale production. We need to produce at least 1,000 units for any factory to even consider taking our order and we need your support to raise enough money to do that! Check out the rewards below to see how you can help us reach our goal.\nThe Rewards\nThe Party  \nIf you end up snagging a ticket, the Sebbo launch party will be an unforgettable experience that we think might even change the way we look at event lighting. For a long time Sebastian and I have toyed with the idea of a party where the only lighting comes from the guests. But the problem is that making enough prototypes for this idea to happen is cost and time prohibitive. So our Sebbo launch party will be a dream come true. We'll throw a warehouse-style party and every guest will receive a fully charged Sebbo as they walk through the door. \nOur vision is that the Sebbos on everyone's wrists will light up the entire room in a way that has not been done before encouraging an epic dance party! Of course a party is not complete without great music so you can count on us bringing in some great talent to keep the Sebbos in the air all night! Afterwards everyone will get to take their Sebbo home with them and they will be the first people to get their Sebbo. \nManufacturing Plan\nPart of making a project a success is having a solid manufacturing plan in place. The Sebbo will be manufactured in a few stages. \nWe've established a relationship with a shop in China that will make our circuits turnkey. They have been a valuable resource because not only are they printing the flex circuits but they are also sourcing all of the components and assembling the dozens of tiny pieces in the circuit in house. \nFrom there the Sebbo circuits will be air mailed to the USA where the battery will be soldered on and the firmware will be uploaded to the processor. We have secured quotes from local shops in Houston to do the work. Each unit will take approximately 2 minutes to solder, upload the code, and test to make sure the lights are working properly. \nThe last major stage in production is the assembly of the enclosure. We are working with a soft goods shop in Matamoros, Mexico for fabric related production of the Sebbo. They have been involved in the industrial design process and have given input so that we'll be able to make a smooth transition when it comes time to wrap up the circuits. They are also a turnkey shop so they will be sourcing the fabrics, magnetic enclosures, and silicone diffusion layer after which they'll assemble the finished product. We intend to provide them with the finished packaging so that by the time we get the units back from the shop they're ready to send. \nTimeline \nIf we secure backing for between 1,000 and 10,000 units:\nThe initial assembly of the circuit will take 8 weeks on the low side and 12 weeks on the high side depending on number of units. The circuit manufacturer has inquired into the lead time of each of the individual components on the board and has given us that estimate based on the tougher to source components. Shipping those circuits will take 1-2 weeks and the soft goods shop has offered to assemble up to 10,000 units in three weeks. \nIf we secure backing for 10,000+ units:\nWe would fulfill as many Sebbos as possible on the promised delivery schedule then start promising subsequent backers slightly extended delivery dates to accommodate the increased demand. This extra month would enable the circuit manufacturer a little extra time to locate components and allow the component manufacturers a little extra time to manufacture the individual components given that the demand is higher than their production capabilities. Even up to the 100,000 unit mark (that's 1.8 million LEDs, 900,000 shift registers) we are not requiring more components than manufacturer's monthly supply capabilities.\nThe Team\nSpecial Thanks\nRamping up for this Kickstarter Campaign has been a ton of fun and it would not be possible to be where we are without the help of a few key people! So I wanted to take a minute and send out a special thanks to a few people.\nI want to thank Bryan Lozano for his extreme patience and constant enthusiasm in filming and editing our Kickstarter video. It was a daunting task and he made it seem all too easy. Pete Molick was also a part of this process and I'm super grateful for the time he took to both help out with the filming as well as being part of the video!\nThen there are all the people that took time out of their busy days to participate in the Kickstarter video. Emma Vaudeville, from Lazuli Productions, spent an entire evening dancing with the Sebbo on the top of a parking garage. I think her part in the intro does a fantastic job showing what the Sebbo is all about. \nOur awesome video soundtrack came from the incredible guys in Raceway (www.soundcloud.com/raceway)! Check them out I think their track \"Constants are Changing\" really made the video come together!\nBesides Emma I want to thank Jeff Ewin, Lindsey Paulson, Tarah Henderson, Jamil Madni, and Jen Burk for their cameos in the video!\nDaniel Shchaeffer really put together a sweet initial firmware for the Sebbo. He added a ton of functionality that would definitely not had been there without his help and patience. \nAnd then there's Kit Morris and Chris Owens from Design Edge in Austin, TX for their awesome collaboration throughout the entire industrial design process. Also Daraius Hathiram and Andrew Polcik from TenX Precicion in Austin, TX for their awesome work on the circuitry. I would recommend both companies to anyone looking for professional assistance making their ideas become reality.\nAnd last but not least I would like to thank my amazing fiance Mara McCumber and my family for their undying support over the last few months preparing for this Kickstarter campaign. Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy putting this much time and effort into an LED wristband, but they constantly remind me to stay on track and keep moving forward because if I believe in something this much it must be worth it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPart of our investment into the professional electronic and industrial design of the product consisted of securing our suppliers and streamlining the process of manufacturing these pieces of light candy. So we've already established and secured our production channels and are confident we should be able to follow through with our expected delivery date. Of course, dealing with multiple suppliers in various parts of the world can lead to unexpected surprises, but we've gone out of our way to ensure a smooth initial production of the Sebbo.\n\nHaving been in the importing business for over 10 years, I have a firm grasp of the potential hiccups that can happen when working with foreign suppliers. I am very well aware of the likelihood for delays and production bottlenecks and have for that reason given a delivery date that provides me with some extra padding in case things go wrong. It is likely that you will all receive Sebbos before the promised ship date, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI have agreements in place with suppliers for different production quantities, each with a specified lead time, and have discussed the roadmap with suppliers for each production quantity. In the event that this campaign is so successful that we exceed those projected quantities we will begin to add reward levels with extended delivery time promises. This will help us (and the suppliers) accommodate a higher than expected demand. \n\nI've been in business for myself for ten years now. You can imagine I've dealt with just about anything under the sun. Of course there are going to be surprises, but you can count on my experience, problem solving abilities, work ethic, and determination to resolve any issues and get these little pieces of light candy onto your wrists as soon as possible!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Almost.

For years, we have grown accustomed to using shovels that make us sore, they make our muscles hurt and leave our backs strained.  The simple thought was, \"there's gotta be a better way to do this.\"  And thus, an idea was born - an ergonomically redesigned shovel.\nFeatured on CBS KCAL 9!\n Featured in Entrepreneur Magazine!\nEntrepreneur Magazine - October Issue\nAlso featured in the Wall Street Journal\n\"Stephen Walden was digging in his parents' garden when the pain in his back ignited a spark of inspiration -- a design for a new ergonomic shovel.\"\nFor a full list of press, media coverage, and even a celebrity endorsement, please scroll to the bottom of the campaign. A big thanks to all writers, authors, bloggers, and everyone else who covered Bosse Tools!\nOur Story: The 21st Century Shovel\nBosse Tools is an ergonomic tool company that is hoping to reinvent the traditional shovels that we have used for thousands of years. Our goal is to help you get more done in less time - while preventing you from getting injured. Whether it is for the job-site or your tool shed...this is your shovel...reinvented.\nA Testimonial from Farmer, Will Terry\nAbout the Founder\nStephen Walden, the founder of Bosse Tools, is a 24 year old entrepreneur who is changing the way we think about a shovel and traditional tools.  While working in his parents backyard, he labored through hours of strain on his back and arms and thought there had to be a better way.  He combined the traditional tool with the ease of use found in a hedge trimmer and took the idea to Loyola Marymount University's entrepreneurship program where it was quickly validated.  After winning the school wide \"new venture creation\" competition, he went on to win a competition at San Diego State University and also place in competitions at Chapman University, University of North Dakota, and even Harvard University. After graduating, Stephen formed Bosse Tools, and is here seeking your help to reach success!\nAbout the Team\nBosse Tools is made up of a team of entrepreneurs with a wide array of backgrounds. The founder, Stephen Walden, recently graduated from the LMU Business School with his MBA. He grew up working with his mom in the garden and remodeling homes with his dad, Stephen says \"I am no stranger to the shovel!\"\nBryson Ishii, head of manufacturing, graduated from LMU in 2009 and now works as the VP of Operations at a Manufacturing firm in LA.  Bryson is in charge of the manufacturing specifications, including sourcing raw materials, packaging, assembly, and shipping.\nAlex McCloskey is 29 with a degree in materials engineering and currently works as a Advanced Materials and Processes Development analyst for Northrup Grumman.  Alex is in charge of deciding specific materials used to create the handles.\nDave Green runs a design/engineering firm in southern California, DG Engineering, and has been in the field of manufacturng for 22 years.  Dave is in charge of creating the 3D models and manufacturing designs.\nThe entire team consulted with WAGIC, based in northern California, which specializes in product innovation and design. Together, Stephen, Bryson, Alex, Dave, and Wagic have put their heads together to bring you Bosse Tools, the ergonomic tool company!\nSo, explain this shovel\n\"In a Category of It's Own\"\nThe problem that exists today is that many individuals finish a day of shoveling with sore backs, wrists, and arms from twisting and tweaking in unnatural positions \u2013 ultimately resulting in lost labor, time, and capital. Our shovels utilize the body's strongest muscles to alleviate these issues by returning you to a more natural position. Bosse Tools provides an ergonomic benefit for its users.\n\"The Bosse Benefits\"\nTo be more specific, these shovels improve posture to reduce back strain, they relieve wrist pain by taking the wrist out of a pronated position, and they minimize shoulder injury by making sure lifting tasks are two-handed and in front of the body, which evenly distributes the loads across the shoulders and chest.\n\"Revolutionary Rotating Center Handle\"\nThe center handle rotates, allowing you to customize your hand position for any job or task. Imagine shoveling snow out of a driveway or filling a wheel barrow with dirt. By angling the handle towards the place where you will pitch the snow or dirt, you can do your job in one single motion - dig, scoop, and pitch - all in one.\n\"U-Shaped Foothold for Ultimate Utility\" (If we reach our Stretch Goal of $120,000)\nSpecific to spade shovels, we have designed a foot stomp that allows for added force to be applied by the foot through the center of the tool. Current shovels force your foot to one side of the tool, but this innovation lets you dig through the center of the shovel head.  This feature will only be included if we reach our stretch goal.\nProudly Made in America\nAt Bosse Tools, we are committed to being Made in America. As American entrepreneurs, we are building tools for the American working man. By manufacturing and assembling our tools right here on our own soil, we feel a deep sense of patriotism. This ultimately adds a level of unmatched quality to our products, and of course, a deep sense of pride as well.\nWhere Are We Today?\nPrototypes \"Design Validation Models (DVM)\"\nWe have been working on these shovels since the founder, Stephen Walden, came up with the idea in the summer of 2011. We have developed 6 DVM's - 1 plastic model prototype and 5 working prototypes. In 2012, we took these prototypes to construction workers, farmers, grounds crews, gardeners, and homeowners, asking for feedback - ultimately helping us finalize the red prototype you saw in the video.\nPrototypes Give Life to Design\nTaking the prototypes above, we built one fully functional spade shovel prototype, complete with 2 handles, rotating center piece, and u-shaped foot hold.  Based on the basic designs of the tools above, and the functional red model below, we will be producing flat head shovels, spade shovels, and snow shovels - all which include the double handle, rotational components.\n(building the prototype)\nThe First Spade - Winners at Chapman Investor Fast-Pitch Competition\nWe are \"A Family of Tools\"\nWe started with just one shovel, then we realized that ergonomics can apply to all shovels, not just regular pointed ones.  Therefore, we decided to create an entire line of tools!\nNow, we are ready to move forward with the production of an entire line of shovels.\nSpade Shovel - (the one you see above)\nFlat Head Shovel\nSnow Shovel\nErgonomics\nWhat is it?\nErgonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population. Effective and successful \"fits\" assure high productivity, avoidance of illness and injury risks, and increased satisfaction among the workforce. This is according to OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nOSHA says that undesirable working conditions presenting multiple risk factors will have a higher probability of causing a musculoskeletal problem. Running the risk of not operating with ergonomics can cause regulation that could result in economic loss.\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor\nOver 50% of construction injuries come from back and muscle strain.\nOver 600,000 back injuries occur in the US yearly.\n$50 billion is the amount of lost labor and workers compensation paid yearly.\nAccording the American Journal of Emergency Medicine\n11,500 people were hospitalized last year from shoveling snow.\n\"Reinventing the Shovel - not just your 'tool shed' shovel anymore\"\nBosse tools has reinvented the shovel. Ergonomic practices can prevent injury and increase productivity. By implementing ergonomics into these tools, you can immediately feel the difference between Bosse Tools shovels and your traditional, old-school shovel.\nAlas, An Ergonomic Shovel\nTherefore the solution is to ensure the following.\nLifting task that are two-handed, smooth, in front of the body, hands are at the same height or level, moderate-width loads.\nThe load is evenly distributed between both hands.\nMaterial handling equipment should be easy to move, with handles that can be easily grasped in an upright posture.\nAs you now see, Bosse Tools has implemented a solution that enables these principles - making shovels safer for you and everyone around you.\nWhat we need to make these shovels?\nMachinery, Molds, and Manufacturing\nWe have secured a manufacturer and they have been hard at work on new prototypes. We need your help in funding this project so we can move forward with manufacturing.  There are 3 different processes involved in creating these tools, and each one is vitally important - additive manufacturing, hardware manufacturing, and die-cast molding. We are capable of fulfilling your contributions because we are working with companies right here in the US for the best quality and support!\nMachinery used to manufacture handles\n1. The handles are manufactured by a company in Southern California, specializing in additive manufacturing services.\n2. The shafts and the shovel heads are manufactured and assembled by a hardware tool company here as well that already has the machinery to create tool heads and reinforced fiberglass shafts. \n3. If we reach our stretch goal, we will manufacture the custom shovel head using a company specializing in die-cast metals here in California.\nThe Steps\nWhat We've Done:\nPrototype design, development, and refinement - using SLS models and hand constructed models that we made in-house\nField Testing\nConsumer reviews\nWhat's Ahead?\nBuilding the molds for the center and top handle\nSetting up the tooling to produce the units\nBuilding pre-production units for final inspection\nLoad testing the assembled units for quality control\nDistribution to you!\nGoals and Stretch Goals\nSeptember 2013\nLaunch Campaign \nOctober 2013\nEnd Campaign and raise $60,000\nReach Stretch Goal and raise $120,000 - manufacture U-Shaped Foothold\nMake tooling and machinery investments\nDecember 2013\nFulfill Contributions\n2014\nBegin full-scale production and sales\nMy Inspiration\nBops\nMy grandpa \"Bops\" can be described as an inventor, a creator, and an imaginative person. He is my inspiration for thinking outside the box, for coming up with creative solutions, and doing things that nobody else has ever thought to do. When I was little, I always had fun seeing all of the crazy things my grandpa would come up with around the house.\nEleven years ago, Bops died of cancer, but left behind an inspiration. He inspired me to think freely, create and design without walls or boundaries on my imagination. I know he would be proud of me and I am proud to say he is the inspiration for my wild ideas. With this, I am determined to turn my imagination into a reality, in honor of Bops, making him proud!\nMy Grandpa \"Bops\" and me (age 13)\n\nThank You!\nThank you for your support of Stephen and the entire Bosse Tools team.

Thank you again.\nRespectfully,\nStephen Walden\nCelebrity Endorsements\nSean Astin (famous from Rudy and Lord of the Rings) is a proud backer of Bosse Tools! This picture is our 21st century interpretation of 'American Gothic.'\nPress & Media Coverage\nCBS KCAL 9\n\"A 24-year-old Manhattan Beach man has come up with a new twist on a very old tool.\"\nFast Company Design\n\"with a literal twist on the design of the common shovel that he hopes will revolutionize the science of shoveling.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\"Stephen Walden was digging in his parents' garden when the pain in his back ignited a spark of inspiration -- a design for a new ergonomic shovel.\"\nGizmag\n\"When it comes to defining what technology is, you may have heard people say \"Heck, even the shovel is an example of technology.\" That may be true, but it's also an example of technology that has hasn't changed much in a long time.\"\nHuffington Post (Op-ed piece by Stephen)\n\"Whether it's ergonomic trainings, midday yoga classes, or simply the proper tools, our nation's manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries can benefit substantially by instituting [ergonomic] policies. A healthy workspace shouldn't be constrained to the office any longer.\"\nThis is Why I'm Broke\n\"You can\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but you can redesign the shovel as seen with the ergonomic shovel. This revolutionary shovel design was built with proper body mechanics in mind, so you can shovel easier and suffer less back pain afterwards.\"\nHella Wella\n\"Even the fittest of us can suffer from back pain after shoveling snow that has caked our driveways and stairs. Well, one inventor is pretty close to giving your aching muscles a bit of relief this winter.\"\nAEC Business\n\"You\u2019d think that centuries-old tools would be perfected by now. However, there are inventors and designers who are able to improve or make radical changes to familiar implements.\"\nGear Hungry\n\"The shovel as we know it remains largely unchanged for upwards of a century, resulting in inefficient follow through and propensity for injury. Bosse Tools aims to shake up convention with their Ergonomic Shovel.\"\nInventor Spot\n\"Thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, one man, Stephen Walden, plans to change all of this with his Ergonomic Shovel.\"\nCNC Kingdom\n\"the need for this is SO OBVIOUS yet nobody ever thought of it!\"\nGear Culture\n\"They'll make a Hulk out of you out in the garden.\"\nCool Pile\n\"The shovel is one of those tools that was not really touched by all the technical advancements from the past century. Well, that was until now!\"\nBusiness Bee\n\"Using groundbreaking design, Bosse Tools has effectively reinvented one of the world\u2019s oldest tools: the shovel.\"\nGadget Review\n\"Bosse Tools wants to provide you with ergonomic tools and their 21st Century Shovel has been reinvented to make it easier to use.\"\nCool Things\n\"Bosse Tools recreates the shovel by injecting it with a more ergonomic design.\"\nStill Made in USA\n\"Just in time for the autumn yard cleanup, and the planting of perennials, a new start-up company is working to bring American-made yard tools to the market.\"\nDude I Want That\n\"Bosse Tools creator Stephen Walden has designed a set of shovels he hopes will make tasks requiring intense physical labor feel less like intense physical wear, grinding, and pain.\"\nHi Consumption\n\"Product designer Stephen Walden is looking to change the way people get their digging projects done with his ergonomic line of Bosse Tools shovels.\"\nConcrete Construction Magazine\n\"There hasn\u2019t been a lot of innovation in shovels for, say, a few centuries\u2014until now.\"\nDaily 5 Remodel\n\"Who ever thought to design a better shovel? Nobody, it appears, and that centuries-long oversight is one reason more than half of construction injuries come from back and muscle strain \u2014 and also why Stephen Walden's radically redesigned approach to shovels and other tools is worth watching.\"\nStudio Clues\n\"It\u2019s rare to such forward thinking innovation in the outdoor hand tool category, but Bosse Tools brings it.\"\nHome Centrl\n\"I also happen to love the spirit and enthusiasm that goes into creating a new product and company such as Bosse Tools. The entrepreneurial spirit continues!\"\nLMU College of Business\n\"A graduate student at Loyola Marymount University\u2019s College of Business Administration, Walden has turned that idea into Bosse Tools, a start-up company with a future.\"\nLMU Magazine\n\"Stephen Walden \u201912, M.B.A. \u201913 put a new twist on a tool that humans have used for thousands of years\"\nNational Retail Hardware Association\nUniversity Times San Diego\nBless This Stuff\nMaterialicious\nEngineer vs. Designer\nLoyola Marymount University LA Loyolan\nThe Awesomer\nDaily Paul", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge is creating a quality that can hold up to a hard day's work and withstand a thorough beating.

Loud patented the ball point pen. He was a leather tanner and probably made bags.\nIn 2007, Brad Dowdy started a blog, The Pen Addict. It was a place where he could share his obsession with pens in a healthier way than hoarding them and building a small cabin in the North Georgian hills from empty pen barrels and cartridges. He posted about the good, the bad, and the ridiculous. His passion for pens was stymied by the lack of an appropriate vessel to carry his collection through the dark alleys of the stationery world.\nJeffrey Bruckwicki, of J. Bruckwicki P+D, started sewing back in the pilgrims year of 2008 under the moniker of Gnome Bags. His understanding of bags only grew as he moved from the Michigan ice flats to the lush forests of Georgia. The higher temperature required rethinking the idea of a bag. He focused on designing around contents not just designing silhouettes. In 2012, with the brand Alter MFG, Jeffrey sewed the first Mod.02 pen(cil) case and sent it to Brad. It was almost a year later that their two obsessions found a platform to join, Nock Co.\nOur Kickstarter Launch Products:\nThe Chimneytop - Our Pop-Up Zip Case\nA single piece of zipper adds the structure to this case which allows for easy visibility and access to whatever you are hoarding.  When zipped closed it flattens out nicely to fit in a bag or back pocket. Our mini pop-up is enough to hold your favorite 6 or 7 pens/pencils, erasers, headphones, etc. This case is unlined but still made with 1000D Nylon exterior, with a DWR coating. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA.\nThe Maryapple - Our Two Memo Book Bi-Fold\nPens, pens, pens, always the pens. Not anymore. We know you need to carry items to write on, not just write with, so we crafted the Two Memo Bi-Fold. Hold two memo pads, notebooks or whatever is approximately 3.5\" * 5.5\" in size and relatively flat. I've put two notebooks, a memo pad, and a few pens just for good measure. Made with 1000D Nylon exterior and a light pack cloth liner, both with a DWR coating, you're sure to keep light spills away from your precious documents. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA. Dimensions: 8\"w * 6.75\"\nField Notes not included. :)\nThe Lookout - Our Three Pen Holster\nToo good for a zip-lock baggy huh? Of course you are and so are all of your implements of wordsmithery. Our three pen holster is made to keep your utensils of alliteration safe while your mind tries to hold on to the current ephemeral thought. Created with a heavy, DWR coated, nylon exterior and durable pack cloth liner this pen case is resistant to rocks and resistant to wet. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA. Dimensions: 3.5\"w * 5 - 6.5\"\nThe Hightower - Our Three + One Bi-Fold Case\nWho needs two cases - one for pens, one for notebooks? This product was made for people like us, people that need to have all things good in one place. There are three pen slots with a flap to keep them in during your active life. The notepad side is deep enough to keep your self meditations safe. The exterior is a heavy nylon with DWR coating and the liner is a smooth pack cloth. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA. Dimensions: 8\"w * 6.75\"\nThe Sassafras - Our Five Pen Bi-Fold Case\nNeed storage for more than one pen but the open abyss of a pouch won't cut it? This guy is for you. We call it our five pen because that how many slots it has...it fits more. Brad hates clips touching so we threw some flaps on each side of the bi-fold and BOOM, clips-no-touch. It's still made of tough 1000D nylon for the exterior and a tear-resistant pack cloth liner. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA. Dimensions: 8\"w * 6.75\"\nThe Brasstown - Our Zippered Roll Case\nThere was once this idea: pen roll, pencil case ... COMBINE THEM! Our zippered roll case give you the best of both worlds. The case itself is large enough to throw in your lead, eraser, ruler, gum, digital recorder, dum-dum and more. If you want to protect your special tools of wonderment then unroll the tongue and expose the well protected goodness. With the six divided sleeves you can rate your pens from favorite to most detested (as long it falls on a scale of 1-6, 6 being favorite). The extra fabric on the far end of the roll allows for no-clip-touch through the rolling and storing process. A tough 1000D nylon exterior with smooth pack cloth liner give you the protection and durability you expect. Handcrafted in Georgia, USA. Dimensions: 8\"w * 6.75\"\nLimited Edition Kickstarter Only Case - Peacock Blue Hightower\nThe same specs as The Hightower listed above but in a special KICKSTARTER ONLY color way. This Peacock exterior with Midnight interior will only ever be available during this project.\nOur Kickstarter Launch Colors\nFrom left to right: Steel exterior/Blue Jay interior, Mandarin exterior/Mango interior, Midnight exterior/Foliage interior.\nFrom Sketch To Prototype To Reality\nProduct sketches and notes from our first meeting.\nNock Co. was born from a several hour, caffeine fueled brainstorming session. We tossed around designs, materials, colors, pricing, logos - anything and everything we could think of. Early sketches turned into prototypes. Bad prototypes turned into good prototypes. Several rounds of changes and improvements turned into the project you see us launching today.\nFirst round of prototypes. Only a few of these made the cut.\nPrototypes looking better. Time for some field testing!\nTesting out one of our final color combinations.\nGetting It Made\nProduction planning is well underway so we are ready to begin manufacturing as soon as the campaign ends. Our fabric, thread, binding, zippers, and labels have all been sourced, if not already ordered. Once funded, we will finalize the fabric order and begin cutting and sewing as soon as it arrives.\nLaying out the cut pattern digitally.\nJeffrey will be leading the manufacturing process from start to finish. Our patterns are digitally created and then transferred to a Gerber Technology CNC machine for precise cutting. Once the fabric is cut, Jeffrey will begin the sewing process which right now is slated for production of approximately 250 pieces per week. If production needs to exceed that rate we have experienced seamsters on standby that we will contract with to help us meet our shipping goals.\nPutting the pieces together.\nYou can see the actual cutting and sewing machines we will be using for production in the video at the top of the page. Many other prototype pictures and descriptions have been posted on the Nock Co. blog.\nOrder fulfillment, packaging, and shipping will be handled personally by Brad.

In the two years since we completed that film, we have pondered the question many audiences asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next!? \nWe aim to answer that question with our follow-up effort. \"Maker\" is a feature-length documentary that looks into the current maker movement in America \u2013 a new wave of Do-It-Yourself and Do-It-Together fueled by passion and powered by the advent of new technologies. \nThe \u201cMaker Movement\u201d, sometimes called the \"Third Industrial Revolution,\" subverts traditional manufacturing by building on innovative concepts such as open source, local manufacturing, crowd funding, and digital fabrication. Breaking the hobbyist movement stereotype, \"Maker\" delves deep into this ecosystem of design and manufacturing in the Internet era. The film explores the ideas, tools, and personalities that are driving the Maker Movement \u2013 and returns with a timely snapshot of one of the transforming influences of the current age. \nWe have conducted extensive interviews of key figures behind headline-making projects, daily practitioners, and observers of the movement, in our effort to piece together what this ecosystem looks like, and present insights on how it can impact society, culture and the economy in the U.S., and the world.\nAbout the team\nProducers: Yu-Hsiu Yang / Iris Lai \nDirected & shot by Mu-Ming Tsai \nAdditional Photography: Bianca Yeh \nEditor: Mu-Ming Tsai / Iris Lai\nMarketing: Sin Wang \nAdvisor: Navi Radjou / Melissa Huang \nKickstarter trailer music by Jacob Montague\nInterviewees (in alphabetical order)\nAlec Foege: Author of \"The Tinkerers\" \nA.

Through our own savings we have finished shooting in San Francisco, Arizona and New York; gathering a wealth of informative interviews and interesting footage. Currently we have finished the initial production phase and are moving on to post-production. \nOur initial funds been able to get us a little over halfway to the final product, but at this point we still have to do editing, scoring, sound mixing, color correction, and graphics in order to finish the film. Then we will need to move into the distribution phase where promotion and marketing expenses will also require a significant amount of funds. \nYour support will help cover these expenses and increase the production value of the final product; ultimately assisting in spreading the exciting and inspiring ideas of the maker movement to as many as possible.\nOur Backer Map\nWe will be marking the countries/areas of our supportive backers, to show the world which countries are involved in supporting our project.\nFor our Backers with no countries listed, do not fret!

I'm really excited and I hope you are too! I've spent my life designing and making things because that's what I love to do. You might know me from my last project: the Prometheus Writes Alpha Executive Pen. \nOn the other hand, many of you are familiar with my core business, making high-end Alpha LED flashlights. Alpha lights are, in a word, boss: designed to be the ultimate blend of power, technology, form, and function. However, they are not for everyone...in the same way that not everyone wants to own (or pay to own) a race car. My lights start at $225 for the most basic, and climb to over $600 for a one-off bespoke creation. \n       The latest from Prometheus Lights: The Beta-QR\nThis tiny and functional light retains all of the core qualities of a custom Prometheus light: the aesthetic appeal, thoughtful design, and superior beam quality. The Beta-QR was conceived with a simple goal: be the best keychain flashlight on earth.\nThe Beta-QR has something for everyone, and it's designed to be there when you need it and disappear when you don't.\nThis concept came to me through observation, research, and conversation. I tried carrying other keychain lights. They were handy to have around, but always got ditched from my key ring...because when I need light I don't want it stuck to a wad of keys. Keychain lights just don't work like I need or want them to, so I came up with something that does. \nTwo things separate the Beta-QR from the pack:\n1) It's a (patent-pending) Quick-Release Flashlight: Normally a keychain-light is a compromise: close at hand, but often useless and frustrating because the light is shackled to your keys. The Beta-QR is a \"real\" flashlight that hangs out on your keychain till duty calls. \nThe Quick Release is a tried and true design and an elegant solution to the problem. The QR lets you use the light how you naturally want to use it, you don't have to fight with it. It's so simple, that it's awesome.\n2) (Below) The state of the art Nichia 219 High CRI LED: The 219 is a bit of semiconductor magic that turns the idea of \"bad quality LED light\" on its head. People hate LEDs for the same reason people used to hate fluorescent bulbs...the light they produce is absolutely horrible. Fluorescent lights have changed, and so have LEDs. It's time to stop living in the dark ages. Yes, that was a flashlight pun.\nWhat is \"Color Rendering\" and why do I care? \nA High Color Rendering Index (High CRI) LED is designed specifically to work in concert with the human visual system, providing the maximum possible color accuracy when compared to sunlight. For example, daylight scores a perfect 100. The Nichia 219 used in the Beta-QR is typically 90+ CRI. It's currently the highest CRI per lumen in the industry...and the light quality is stunning. \nHonestly it's hard to \"talk\" about the difference in something you \"see,\" it just doesn't make sense. The photos below will give you a good idea of what to expect, but in person, High-CRI is mind blowing. Once you experience High-CRI you won't be able to go back to the ugly, flat, washed-out, blueish light you normally find in LED flashlights.\nThe bottom line is that you can see better with High CRI than with low CRI. Just ask yourself the question, \"do you want a flashlight that will help you see better...or worse?\"\nI'm offering 3 aluminum finishes and one solid copper light for this campaign: \nPeople will ask about stainless, titanium, and other materials :) I love them too, but they will not be offered on this project. I'd like to be 100% shipped in time for Christmas, and increasing the number of options will limit my ability to achieve that goal. \n*** Please Note: ALL flashlights come with a BRASS quick release as depticted in the photographs. The images above are just graphic representations, so the QR will NOT be color coded to the finish of the light ***\n*** Current run-time figures are estimated. Lumen output, beam distance, and beam intensity have been measured or calculated using ANSI FL1 standards. ***\nSome notes on available reward tiers\nAll lights feature the same Nichia 219 LED\nNickel, Black, and KS Green lights are identical, except for the finish\nThe Copper light has a unique 3 mode driver that is not offered in the other finishes. This light features an extra-low mode called \"moonlight\" in the flashlight industry. It also features an extra-high mode that is about 40% brighter than the high mode of the other lights. \nYou really need a Keychain Flashlight...even if you don't know it yet. \nSure, that's self promotional, but hear me out. To be honest, I wasn't into flashlights until I started making them. I was in the dark, along with everyone else. Since then, I've realized the world is a dark place 50% of the time and I've spent a lot of time fumbling around in the dark when I didn't have to. \nIf not for you, then for someone else: \nI use my lights daily. More often than not, I use a light to help out someone else. It might be a little thing like finding someone's earring on the floor...or a big thing, like changing a tire on a bus full of 60 people in the middle of the night, in Southeast Asia, 20 miles from the nearest town, when the next best light source is a mostly empty Bic lighter. Ask me about it some time :) \nA light is useful if you live in a city: \nIf only for this ONE reason: my personal favorite use in the city is for hailing a cab. It works AMAZINGLY well. Sure you can try to whistle. You can wave like the 5 other people standing next to you. Or you can just give a little flick of the wrist and have cabs at your feet like the doorman of a fancy hotel. \nGot kids? \nNo one with kids should be without a flashlight. Whether you are looking for a toy under the car seat, trying to tell if those are actually little white bumps on the tonsils, or just peeking in the room at night...you really need a flashlight. The \"low\" mode is really low and perfect for checking on a sleeping baby...or a midnight fridge run. Shhh, I won't tell. \nStill not convinced? Okay, I bet you know someone that is in need of a gift!\nSeriously, aren't you bored of gifts yet? One reason I love Kickstarter is that it keeps my gift pool from looking like everyone elses. It's a win win!\nStiiiiiill not convinced?! \nCheck out this link to the CandlePower forums thread named, \"What did you use your flashlight for today?\" for (at present count) 3,330 different reasons! \nThe Challenge: Making a lot of Beta-QR lights\nAt this point I make lights on a limited production basis: 20-30 at a time. I do the work, with my own hands, in my own shop. I use CNC machining centers but have to do a ton of manual machining, hand-finishing, hand-fitting, and assembly. Time is money and this makes my lights expensive and limited in availability. My goal is to bring all of you an awesome light at a reasonable price! \nI manufacture most of my own products. This time I'm not, so just to be clear: \nI've been working with a well established flashlight company in China for the last 11 months, and they will handle the volume manufacturing of my design. This relationship enables me to bring this light to a large audience like Kickstarter, which would be entirely impossible to accomplish on my own. \nThe factory only makes flashlights, so they know what they are doing. During production, I'll be visiting the factory in person, and working with a good friend that lives in China full-time (he runs a manufacturing consulting company) to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.\nDelivery! \nMy goal is to deliver (at least) 1000 lights BEFORE CHRISTMAS! My current time line has delivery starting in mid -November. I will work with utmost diligence to deliver ALL rewards before Christmas, but if this goes really crazy, that will get quite difficult. \nTwo factors are in play: manufacturing (how fast can we make lights) and fulfillment (how fast can I ship out orders). I have less control over the first factor because I don't know the final number of lights. 3000 lights takes a lot longer to make than 1000. Assuming I can get all of the lights manufactured on-schedule, it also takes a lot longer to ship 3000 lights than 1000. However, I can (and will) enlist the help of a fulfillment company to do a giant shipment really fast, if that's what it comes down to :) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat happens if you get \"over funded?\"\n\nThat's been happening a lot on Kickstarter! Amazing, right? Fortunately I've thought about that and the factory won't have any problems filling the order (barring some unforeseen catastrophe.) The light is finished in terms of design and engineering. All we need to do is flip the switch on production. \n\nYou are still fulfilling your first KS project, can you handle another one? \n\nRight now I'm on track to finish fulfillment on the Alpha pens before the Beta-QC project will end. Since I'm having the Beta-QC manufactured, I just need to make sure the manufacturing stays on schedule (I already have a ticket booked to China to visit the factory) and start shipping as soon as they are ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Check out my latest campaign: Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen :-)", "update_content": "Good day previous backers!\nIn case you're not following me on social or thru the newsletter I wanted to let you know about my most recent campaign for this Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen.

Thanks for checking out our project. We are back with our new mochibag. It looks and functions better than ever before.  Once again, we hope you support our mochibag project and help this idea come to life!\nMochibag is a reinvented drawstring backpack that features our patented Channel-Anchored Drawstrings\u2122 and Easy Pull-Open Handles\u2122\nHere is our story.\nWe love drawstring backpacks, but they are not perfect.\nWe love drawstring backpacks.They are compact, lightweight, versatile, simple to use, and reusable. However, with repeated use, the lengths of the cords that form the shoulder loops become uneven and unbalanced. Also, there is not an easy way to open a closed bag. You have to dig-in your fingers to pull apart a closed bag.\nSo, we set out to solve these problems others ignored.\nWe were able to keep the cords to stay even and balanced by moving the anchor points away from the bottom corners, and by forcing even motions when opening and closing the bag. The lengths of our cords that form the shoulder loops will always stay even and balanced, 100% of the time, even after repeated opening and closing.\nWell, we became experts on drawstring backpacks.\nWe learned about types of cords, ropes, and drawstrings. We learned about which kinds of cords and types of cord materials glide well thru which types of canvas or fabric, in order to create the most effortless opening and secure closing feel. We learned about balancing the weight and the thickness of our fabric vs. ease of opening and closing, and the shapes they would create when cinched at the top. Our list goes on and on. We needed to rethink the whole drawstring backpack from top to bottom. We made 31 prototypes of our bag to get to our last project. We made 39 more prototypes to get to where we are today.\nWe created something totally new.\nWe created something totally different.\nYes, we did. We created premium drawstring backpacks.\nOur mission is simple.  Make the best drawstring backpacks.

Join us!\nSourcing and Manufacturing\nDuring the past couple of years of searching and testing different materials and components for our bags, we have worked with various vendors and now we have streamlined our relationship to a few outstanding U.S. suppliers and have chosen extremely capable local custom sewing manufacturer in Chicago, IL \u2013 USA, with decades of experience in delivering quality products. We will make sure our bags are manufactured to the highest standards.\nWe have made pre-production prototype bags with our manufacturer. We have featured our prototypes and near final versions of our bags in our photos and videos. We have completed our finishing touches around the zipper and we have finalized our tried-and-true production specifications.  Final mochibags will feature zippers that match the color of the bags and will zip down for closure for added security.  Our funding will be used to trigger purchasing of materials and mass production run. We are ready to mass produce!\nShipping\nWe have carefully chosen our local manufacturer for their craftsmanship as well as for their ability to meet our production volume demands and fulfillment requirements. After final assembly and inspection from the manufacturing facility, the final products will be inspected again and packaged by me and my team. We wanted this final leg in the fulfillment process to be under our control and watch. Every shipment to the backers will be processed in our care.\nWe have set an aggressive time frame to produce and begin shipping by late summer of 2013. We will start producing as soon as the funding goal is met and start shipping as soon as the pledging concludes. We will take the necessary steps to expedite sourcing and production whenever feasible to meet the estimated ship time frames.\nTimeline\nWe plan to end our campaign by August.\nAs soon as our funding targets are met, with pledging continuing, we plan to expedite sourcing and manufacturing.\nWe have secured all the materials needed for Sep shipments (1st Lot).\nWe plan to manufacture Sep shipments (1st Lot) by the 2nd week of September.\nWe plan to ship Sep shipments (1st Lot) by the 3rd week of September.\nWe plan to source all the materials needed for Oct shipments (2nd Lot) by September.\nWe plan to manufacture Oct shipments (2nd Lot) thru the 2nd week of October.\nWe plan to ship Oct shipments (2nd Lot) thru the 3rd week of October.\nWe plan to ramp up our production during the months of Sep, and Oct, and also Nov if needed. We will be able to ship 2000+ units thru the end of October.\nIn case we are above and beyond our estimates, our manufacturer has committed to provide additional production capacities at a sister plant during the next few months to meet our high volume requirements. Even with approximately 5000+ units, we are targeting to finish all shipments by November.\nThanks for your interest and support!\n\u00a9 2013 Chila LLC.  All rights reserved.

As development progressed we knew we had stumbled onto a material that had general purpose application far beyond 3D Printers and had unique potential within the various creative collectives.\nWith many, many days and nights of hard work and determination we are finally ready to put the call out for any and all adventurers willing to help us bring a battery-free and versatile, EL Wire alternative to the world.\nThis small elastic cord emits a beautiful bioluminescent blue light all night and is powered only by ambient light collected and stored throughout the day.\nPhoto taken at 1:30 AM. The intensity seen here is comparable to eyes having had a couple of minutes time to adjust after leaving a well lit interior. Last exposed light was during dusk at 7:30 PM.\nThe standard burnout intensity is detectable for more than a day and clearly visible all night given only minimal access to low level light during the day. In this way you can be creative, safe, and seen all week without ever plugging in or turning on.\nYou want to be more than seen? Brief exposure to intense light from sources like the sun, standard fluorescents or black-light generates a brilliant long lasting discharge before gradually returning to its standard strength over the course of a couple of hours. The intensity is impressive even in daytime shade and nothing short of astonishing at night.\nUnaltered image taken with a cell phone camera after 10 seconds exposure to direct sunlight.\nFor those that attend the annual Burning Man festival, we'll be making your night-time romps even brighter by partnering with multiple camps to place black-light charging stations strategically throughout Black Rock City. Just a few seconds charging is all it takes. Having too much fun to juice up? No matter, you'll still be seen from the light picked up during the day.\nThe material is non-toxic, waterproof, and can be cut, woven or braided like ordinary string.\nFreedom from batteries, wires and reactive chemicals means more expression and less waste. Juice your creative lobe like never before.\nTry hooking batteries up to that!\nWe are so excited to have finally made this material beta-test ready but we need your help for the final hurdle.\nThis is an unaltered cell phone photo of a coil of Lumi-Cord in the workshop after being exposed to the sun for less than a minute.\nWe absolutely love working with this material and we think you will to. \nYou can help us never stop improving by being a part of our beta/stress test. Your feedback and creative applications will guide our decisions in the last leg of development.\nAdditionally, your pledges will help us move through the beta stage of this project by helping fund additional materials, equipment. A successful campaign will allow us to leverage our remaining assets and materials so we can get it into the hands of creators. \nAs this materials development was driven specifically from our time spent at creative festivals like Burning Man, we can't think of a better place or group of people to help us explore and create than Black Rock City and You. Not attending the Burning Man festival? You can still be a part of our beta by pledging to THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRE which will ship to you in the beginning of September.

We tasked ourselves with distilling your average clunker bell into a smaller, more potent, and more streamlined form\u2014befitting even a peleton-crushing road bike. To do so forced us to reconsider every design aspect and engineer to a higher standard.\nFORM:  We set out to design a compact, well-integrated component.

We pursued the best form by way of the cleanest execution, encompassing both modern and classic aesthetics. It\u2019s a bell that\u2019s just the right size, tidy not tiny. Streamlined and effective.\nMOUNT: Even a bell of the right size and shape flows best if it can be reoriented and positioned to match the bike's form. Our mount was engineered around adjustability. A single fastener is visible through the top of the dome, and that\u2019s the only bolt needed to secure the entire assembly. This thru-bolt design allows the overall form to stay super clean but fits a broad (22-32mm) range of diameters. That means you can mount it near the brake of your flat-bar commuter or near the stem of your oversize road handlebar. \nACTUATION: Our unibody wire lever is a powerfully simple design. Utilizing the wire's natural torsional springiness, we can deliver proper ergonomics and modulation while maximizing aesthetic simplicity and functional reliability. \nWe wanted an actuation that doesn't require much reach, just a flick of your thumb without repositioning or stretching the width of your hand. Moreover, modulation is key: from a light courtesy \"ding\" while passing another rider to an alarming \"DING-DING-DING\" to grab a driver's attention. \nBetter still, our bell doesn't rattle or ring when it isn't supposed to, over rough road or potholes. In fact, we've raced mountain bikes with our bell, which made not a sound until we needed to pass.\nSOUND: We didn't work on a beautiful bell and ignore the critical function of a bell. It's got to be loud enough to alert other riders and drivers. Of course, it's nicer if the sound is effective without losing its pleasant tone. That's why we've chosen to work with Bevin Brothers\u2014a company that's been making bells since the Industrial Revolution\u2014and why we've chosen alloys that make an inherently better sound. After all, if you just want to annoy people, you can always buy a horn.\nMATERIAL: To make the highest quality bell, you need premium materials. We've chosen metals that will never rust: stainless steel, aluminum, and brass. No plastic. No junk \"pot metal\". No shortcuts. \nDome size: \u230030mm x 20.5mm Total bell weight: 42g\nFunding\nWe've spent hundreds of hours designing and working out production. The next part is relatively simple. We need money to buy enough bells to make factory production feasible. We have quotes to produce only a few hundred bells and quotes to produce several thousand. We've set our goal at just $20k, because that's the minimum we need to get started down our path and deliver a limited batch of bells into the hands of our supporters. \nTimeline\nWe're lucky. We've found some great partners with whom to collaborate on our bell design & production. We have our GripRings Kickstarter project experience to draw on. It allows us to timeline this project with confidence.\nAUGUST: Finalize production design & successfully fund Kickstarter project. \nSEPTEMBER/OCTOBER: Work around the clock to hand craft and assemble the best bells you've ever seen. \nNOVEMBER: Ship. \nPledge for RAW or BLACK. Or both.\nLimited Kickstarter POLISHED edition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe used Kickstarter to launch GripRings last year, funding our compression tooling which helped us deliver to 252 happy backers and\u2014as of March 2013\u2014to distributors in Australia, Holland, Italy, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, and of course to several domestically. We're very familiar with the challenges of design, production, shipping and communication. \n\nIn the last 8 months, we've made many (many) versions of our bell. We've hacked a few materials in our own workshop. We've 3D printed them in durable plastics. We've even \"printed\" a few metal domes to help us refine the geometry of this critical bell component. We have Bevin Brothers and Peridot (an amazing facility in nearby Pleasanton, CA) awaiting our cue. We've already met with them dozens of times and will be on-site during our initial phases of production. The risks are as minimal as they get going into a project like this. \n\nThat said, to make more than a couple bells, we need to establish proper manufacturing and assembly fixtures, so that we can work much more quickly and ensure a high level of consistency. This will take a wad of cash, some ingenuity, and likely some period of trial until we get everything just right. \n\nA distant concern is with regard to mass production costs. We'd like to be able to offer these high quality bells at a price point that isn't out of reach for the average rider. Lucky for anyone that backs this project, you're sure to get the highest quality materials and construction at a known pledge level.

It's a warm copper with that knurled top that I'm crazy about. Nice, snug clip that won't snap off. Pure goodness.\"\nFrom the Pen Cup- \"Karas Kustoms' design aesthetic and build quality speak for themselves, without the pens saying a single word. So clean, so cool.\"\nOffice Supply Geek- \"The Retrakt Aluminum \"Click\" Pen is clearly a superior product with its construction, great looking design, well thought out functionality, and flexibility in terms of the refills that it takes.\"\nVouch Mag- \"Not all pens are the same, especially when made by a trendsetting brand like this one.\"\nThe Well Appointed Desk- \"My favorite part is the absolutely whisper-quiet retracting mechanism. Just click, click, click through a whole meeting without annoying your co-workers.\"\nHello Kickstarter!\nWe are proud to introduce to you to our latest project, a product we are really exited about- the RETRAKT. The RETRAKT is a machined pen body that works with several popular pen refills, so you can have the look of a custom pen and still maintain the feel of your favorite refill. We designed the RETRAKT to work primarily with the Pilot G2 refills, but it also works with any Parker compatible refills, including the Fisher PR style Space Pen refill. Because we design and manufacture the RETRAKT, we have complete control over the product. No waiting on some company overseas to send us the latest sample. If we need to see the latest version, we make it, ourselves, here in the shop. And, we provide video and photos of the process as we go, bringing you along for the ride. You get to see your pen being born.\nEach RETRAKT is ready to accept the Pilot G2 refill, just use the provided spring, and you're ready to go. If you want to run a Parker compatible refill instead, just drop the provided machined spacer into the upper half of the barrel (the part with the clip) and assemble as usual. Now you can easily find a refill at any office supply store if you run out of your favorite ink and can't wait.\nThe RETRAKT has many design elements that make it stand out as a unique, quality pen. Each pen body starts out as a solid piece of material and we machine all the individual parts ourselves. Don't worry, we take all the excess material from the machining process and recycle it. The high-quality knock mechanism on the pen is imported from a manufacturer in Germany. This all metal \"click\" mechanism works smoothly and nearly silently, so now you can fiddle with your pen during meetings without annoying your boss. And, because the knock mechanism contains no plastic parts whatsoever, it will last virtually forever. The clip is a custom design stamped from .050\" spring stainless steel and is attached using two stainless socket head bolts. It's not going anywhere.\nAnd knurling, don't forget about knurling.\nVERSIONS\nRETRAKT ALUMINUM\nThe aluminum version of the RETRAKT is machined from 6061 aluminum and will feature an anodized finish to help protect the aluminum body from damage, keeping the pen looking fantastic for years to come.\nRETRAKT BRASS\nRETRAKT COPPER\nThe copper and brass versions of the RETRAKT come in a hand-finished state and will develop a beautiful aged finish with time and use. Or, if you prefer, you can maintain a high polish on the pen to enjoy the look of the raw material. Because each of our copper and brass pens are machined from solid material, there is no need to worry about wearing through an applied finish over time.\nSTATS\nEach pen is a little over 5-1/2\" long and 7/16\" in diameter (minus the clip). The aluminum pen weighs slightly less than 1 oz while the brass and copper versions weigh in at just under 2.5 oz. This is our lightest pen yet! One of the best features of the RETRAKT? No logos anywhere! This is your pen, not a billboard, so we don't advertise on something you own. Just do us a favor, when someone asks about your pen, and they will, tell them it was made by an American company, employing American workers called Karas Kustoms.\nREFILLS\nAfter careful consideration, we have decided to not ship the RETRAKT with any refills included. Because there are so many different brands and types of refill that will work with the RETRAKT, we didn't want to ship a refill that may get tossed out because it was the wrong size/type/color. After all, isn't the point of a re-useable pen body to help reduce waste? This also makes the pen less expensive, allowing you to purchase more of your favorite refills with the savings.\nREWARDS\nWHY WE NEED YOU\nOkay Kickstarters, this is where YOU come in. We can machine the parts for the pen bodies here in the shop, but we need to order the metal \"click\" mechanisms from Germany. By pledging toward our RETRAKT project you can help us reach our financial goal so that we can afford to machine and purchase the parts we need to make the RETRAKT a reality. Plus, by doing so, you get to own a really cool, American made pen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we design, and manufacture, all of our own products ourselves here in the USA, we have complete control over the manufacturing process.

Ti is used in cars, planes, hiking gear, medical implants and spaceships, because it's light as plastic, with the strength of steel!!!!  \nSo why do you need a Titanium guitar pick?\nThe high strength to weight ratio makes the EpicGrip a great general purpose pick, and when you need to do high speed precision picking, THIS should be the pick you reach for.\n\"For all you rock stars out there, time to step up your guitar picks to titanium with EpicGrip. EpicGrip is designed to keep the jam sessions rocking.\" - The Crowdfund Mafia\nA few years ago I custom laser-cut a batch of these picks, but they still needed finishing. I took a pick to my friend Michael's workshop, rounded the edges and sanded it smooth. The resulting pick felt nice and produced a rich full sound. It immediately became my favorite pick. \nBecause it doesn't slip, the EpicGrip feels like an extension of your hand...  Sound-wise, Ti picks have a stronger attack if you hold them loosely, and a tighter grip softens the tone. It gives me an extra bit of dynamic range when I'm playing. Some rock guitarists in the 80's used to boil their strings to achieve a custom sound--now you can tweak your sound mid-riff, just by using the EpicGrip pick.  Check out the sound in the video below.\nContinuing with the story...  Late last year I bought a grinder and improved my polishing technique. I gifted a few of these picks to friends and family with spectacular response, but the laborious process of grinding and polishing each pick was hugely time consuming.  In the back of my mind I wanted to come up with a more efficient way of producing them for less, but I could not envision a reliable process to combine a high quality product with a reasonable price... and I'd probably still be stumping about it if not for a casual conversation last Christmas.\nEnter my good friend Andrew, who used to run the R&D department for The Sharper Image. Andrew liked the pick I had, and offered to share his expertise and manufacturing connections to help get the per-pick cost down to an affordable level. I jumped at the chance to make this dream a reality. \nSo here's where we stand now... \nWe've nailed down a manufacturer and, after sorting through the details, and some minor tweaking, we've finalized the design.  \nBelow is the Rounding/Polishing test photo from the manufacturer. The thin lines in the cut-out design have been thickened slightly to improve durability in subsequent versions (see last image for current design).\nProduction Rounding/Polishing Test\nThat's the story up until now, and I am excited to invite you to the next phase of production, and to be able to offer this awesome pick at a reasonable price.\nIf you make it into the first tier, you can pick up one shiny polished pick at a insanely low price!  If the first batch is snapped up, you're still going to get a pick at less than the final selling price.  The point is, I want to get these puppies out into the hands of musicians where they can sing. Enough about me though. Here are the Options:\nHere is the single pick TITANIUM EpicGrip.\nOne Pick\nOr get two TITANIUM EpicGrips.  Save a little on shipping and get two picks for cheaper than the same tier per-pick price.\nTwo Picks\nThree Picks\nNew Reward Tier Added... Four EpicGrip Picks!\nAs a Stretch Goal, if we pass the $6500 mark,  I will add free SOLID COLOR electric anodizing as an option for EVERYONE'S picks. The color options will be SOLID Blue, SOLID Purple or SOLID Gold.\nIf we pass the $7000 mark,  I will add free GRADIENT anodizing as an option (shown below). So tell all your guitarist friends to hop on board to get this train a-rolling. EpicGrips also make awesome necklaces or ear-rings for a lady friend. Just sayin'...\nGradient Anodized\nThe photo above shows the range of available colors. If we get to the anodizing phase, I'll update with a list of what colors everyone is choosing.\nThe finalized design: \nFinal Design\nClean round outer edges, super polished face, bigger cut-out gaps and slightly thicker bits between the gap-edges makes for a for a better grip, a stronger pick and a more balanced look and feel.\nPraise for the EpicGrip:\n\"It's a great pick, easy to hold on to, and the bevel, which is missing from most non-traditional picks is really great!\"\n- Dale Bodmer\n\"Looks great, plays great, and is ****ing indestructible\"\n-JP Strom\n\"...so cool!

For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Trained as an architect, Pablo's recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. His work has appeared on FastCompany/Co.Design, io9, ArtInfo, ThisIsColossal, Gizmodo, Make, The Creators Project and many others. Previously, Pablo has taught at Carnegie Mellon, Parsons, University of Michigan, and Princeton. From 2004-2007, he also worked as an architect and designer for Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nGolan Levin (@golan) is Associate Professor of Computation Arts at Carnegie Mellon University; a member of the Free Art and Technology artist collective; and an enthusiastic Kickstarter supporter. At CMU, he also directs the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for anti-disciplinary research across the arts, sciences, technology, and culture. A two-time TED speaker, Golan has been called one of \"50 Designers Shaping the Future\" by Fast Company Magazine, an \"A-OK guy\" by Bruce Sterling, and a lot of other things. \nWe're also greatly indebted to our tireless research assistant Sarah Keeling, who has spent long nights communicating with Chinese vendors; to our expert mechanical engineer, Greg Baltus, of StandardRobot; to Benji Welmond, a talented filmmaker who has assisted with our videography, and to the staff of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, who have supported our research in numerous other ways. \nOpen Source.\nThe NeoLucida will be wholly Open Source Hardware (OSHW), and will be released with documentation (including all CAD files) according to the definitions, standards and recommendations of the Open Source Hardware Association.\nQuestions?\nAsk away!

We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world. We are counting on that experience to provide both solid logistical planning and readiness to solve problems as they occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL: One week in, and new Rewards to help students draw!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL is here!", "update_content": "The Mid-2014 NeoLucida Pre-Order: through May 31\nIt's back!

If you want to contact us directly please email us @ info@bravestar.com \nWhat's so special about selvage denim?\nWhat makes selvage denim unique and more expensive than regular denim is the fact that it is made on traditional shuttle looms rather than modern projectile looms. These old shuttle looms produced lots of defects and unevenness in the weave. The irregularities in yarn tensions and lack of precision in controlling the weft yarn spacing created a unique appearance in denim as compared to the consistency produced by modern looms today. The old looms also weave denim very slowly and produce a narrow width denim - 28 - 31 inches wide versus 48 - 60 inches for modern looms - this means it takes twice the amount of fabric to make a pair of jeans using selvage denim woven on an old loom. As a shuttleloom works to weave the denim in one continuous thread, it eventually reaches the end the fabric. In finishing this end, the loom creates the self-edge or selvage of the denim.\nSelvage Denim weave\nFor decades, shuttle looms were the primary tool for making jeans in America, until the popularity of denim clothing exploded in the 1950s. To meet demand, manufacturers switched to projectile looms, which were much faster and used less fabric per pair of pants. It was not until the 1980s that Japanese designers saw a niche for selvage denim.  Since that time, selvage denim, and the old shuttle loom weaving methods, have regained popularity, and enjoy high demand despite their expensive prices.\nOld style shuttle loom\nAre you for real?\nI launched my namesake brand SERFONTAINE with my wife and business partner in 2000 and sold into some of the worlds most exclusive department stores - Barneys New York, Saks 5th Ave, Fred Segal & Isetan Tokyo. We have been featured in many of the major industry and fashion magazines such as Vogue, ELLE, In Style, WWD & Sportswear International. We successfully sold SERFONTAINE in 2009 to the TAL Group, one of the largest apparel companies in Asia.\nDesigners Mik & Maria Serfontaine\nSelvage Since \u201804, Made in Los Angeles. \nBrave Star Selvage was started as a showcase brand for the Cone Mills White Oak collection that debuted in 2004.

We were stocked @ Fred Segal, Glory Sales & Service, American Classics in London as well as stores in Japan, Germany & Italy. Brave Star was sold along with SERFONTAINE in 2009 but favorable circumstances enabled us to purchase it back in 2012. \nWhen can i expect my jeans to be delivered?\nPlan on the first deliveries hitting about 4 weeks after the campaign closes, as promised though we will keep you in the loop every step of the way.\nFAQ:\n\nYou make some pretty bold claims about your reputation and what you\u2019ve done, how can I verify who you are?\nPlease Google Serfontaine and find out about us and our brand(s).\n\nDo you ship Internationally?\nYes, for an additional shipping cost (listed in each pledge reward).\n\nCan I add a core pair to my Limited Edition pledge and vice versa?\nYes, but these will be 2 separate transactions with 2 separate payments.

We've spent countless hours making sure that the 2 pens function well and stay true to our clean design aesthetic.\nTi-Click Pro & Ti-Click RTS\nFunctioning Prototypes\n2 Titanium Click Pens\nThis project started with a vision to create 2 truly amazing titanium click pens from the ground-up. It has been a big challenge and a project that we have been working towards for over a year now. We can't even begin to tell you how many times we have been emailed and had requests to make a click pen version of our solid titanium pen + stylus. So, we listened and made what we felt are 2 of the most refill-friendly and versatile click pens ever.\nTi-Click PRO & Ti Click RTS\nOur Ti-Click PRO is a pen that accepts a lot of the same popular refills that our Solid Titanium Pen + Stylus takes. You can see the full list of compatible refills further down the page. We will continue to update the list throughout the project.\nOur Ti Click RTS is a slightly shorter pen that accepts the much requested Fisher space pen refill along with other Parker-Style refills. You can see the full list of compatible refills further down the page. We will continue to update the list throughout the project.\nThe Body and Tip Design\nThe body is a sleek, unbranded, and timeless design that will hold it's own for generations to come. The tip has our signature 3 ring finger detail to add some style and prevent your fingers from sliding down.\nTi-Click Pen Tips\nSleek Titanium Pocket Clip Without Obtrusive Screws\nTi Pocket Clip\nOne of the most challenging components to integrate was the titanium pocket clip. For most people the clip is an afterthought that's solved by buying an aftermarket clip, fastening 2 screws into the body and calling it a day. That's clearly not our style. We wanted the clip to purposefully flow into the overall pen design and not be interrupted by additional hardware and obtrusive screw heads. Easy, right? :) Not so much.\nWe spent around 2 months testing the strongest way to integrate the clip into the pen to find the perfect placement for balance, length, and tension. Not to mention, working out how all the internal moving parts could co-exist together in harmony. The seemingly effortless appearance is very deceiving of how much time and attention to detail has gone into making the the pen and clip look so simple and function well.\nWorry-Free Tension Spring & Internal Mechanisms\nWe don't like to worry about or keep up with the springs and inside parts that usually fall out and get lost when you take most click pens apart. That's why we designed all our inside parts, including the spring to securely stay in place at all times. Changing refills has never been easier.\nNo more lost parts. The spring and internal parts are secured inside the pens to make your life easier.\nPen Colors\n\u2022 Bead-blasted matte black (DLC - Diamond Like Carbon Coating)\n\u2022 Bead-blasted matte silver (PVD Coating - Physical Vapor Deposition)\n\u2022 High-polished & chrome coated\n\u2022 Raw \"stonewashed\" finish (See update #5)\nCustom Designed & Engineered Internal Mechanism\nThe internal click mechanism used in the pen is our own unique and custom design that we are going to have tooled. The mechanism will be make from an industry time-tested and high-strength ABS for smooth and reliable performance. We prefer to custom make our own parts because it allows us to ensure that every part being used fit perfectly, functions properly,  and provides the best audible \"click\" sound for years to come.\nSpring-Loaded Stylus Tip\nWe've spring-loaded the back plunger so the stylus stays upright and can be used at all times. It also eliminates any noise or plunger rattle that most traditional click pens have when the pen is engaged.\nConductive Silicone Stylus Tip\nThe stylus tips are the same responsive tips that we used on our previous titanium pens. They are 8mm tips and can be quickly replaced in a few seconds if you ever wear it out or if it gets damaged. They also are Red, Blue, & Black so you quickly see what color ink you have inside or just add some color to your pen.\nWhat refills fit inside?\nMore than any other click pens that we've ever seen. Feel free to check out Update #2 to see how the refills look inside the 2 pens.\n_________________________________________________________\nTi Click PRO Pen is Compatible with the following 45+ refills\n\u2022Avant Pen Refills (0.5mm)\n\u2022Cross Gel Rolling Ball Refill (0.7mm)\n\u2022Cross Porous-Point Refill (Fine)\n\u2022Dong-A Fine Tech RT Pen (GRC-43 refill)\n\u2022Duke Rollerball Refill (Medium)\n\u2022Faber-Castell Ceramic Rollerball Refill (0.5mm)\n\u2022Foray (Office Depot\u2019s Brand-USA) Replacement Refills\n\u2022Hauser 777 Rollerball Refills\n\u2022Mont Blanc Fineliner Refills\n\u2022Mont Blanc Rollerball Pen Refills  (M) & (F)\n\u2022Monteverde Rollerball Refill (Mont Blanc Style Replacements)\n\u2022MUJI 0.5mm Refill\n\u2022Ohto Ceramic Rollerball Refill (C-305P, C-307P)\n\u2022Ohto Gel Ink Refill 0.7mm Needle Point (G-307NP)\n\u2022Pentel ENERGEL BLN105 pen (LRN5 & LRN7)\n\u2022Pentel HyperG Retractable KL257 Series (LR7 & KLR7)\n\u2022Pilot Frixion Ball pen BLS-FR5 (LFBK-23EF-B refill)\n\u2022Pilot G2 (America\u2019s #1 selling ink gel pen, 0.38, 0.5, 0.7, &1.0mm)\n\u2022Pilot G2 Pro\n\u2022Pilot G6\n\u2022Pilot Hi-Tec-C \"Cavalier\" Refill 0.3 & 0.4mm (PILOT LHRF-15C3)\n\u2022Pilot Juice Gel Ink Refill (LP2RF, .05mm)\n\u2022Pilot Precise V5 RT/V7 RT, named Hi-tecpoint V5 RT/V7 RT in Europe\n\u2022Pilot Q7 Needle Point Refill 0.7mm (BLS-GCK-7 / LHKRF-8C7)\n\u2022Pilot V ball RT (BLS-VB5RT)\n\u2022Pelikan Roller Refill 338 Rollerball\n\u2022Sheaffer Roller Ball Refill \u2161\n\u2022Schneider Topball 850\n\u2022Staples Classic Grip Pen 0.7mm Gel (#31581)\n\u2022TUL GL1 Gel Pen Retractable Needle Point Fine 0.5mm\n\u2022Uniball Impact RT 1.0mm Bold (Signo UMR-80)\n\u2022Uniball Signo RT Gel 0.38mm & 0.5mm (UMN-138)\n\u2022Uniball Signo (UMN-152)\n\u2022Uniball Signo 207 Gel Refill 0.7mm (UMR-87, UMR-85)\n\u2022Uniball Jetstream 0.7mm (SXR-7) & 1mm (SXR-C1)\n\u2022Visconti Rolling Ceramic 0.7mm (AA40)\n\u2022Zebra JF Gel Ink (JJ2; JJ15; JJZ15; JJ21; RJF5 Refills)\n_________________________________________________________\n\nTi Click RTS Pen is compatible with the following 35+ refills:\n\u2022Faber-Castell Ballpoint Pen Refill (Parker Style Medium & Bold tip)\n\u2022Fisher Space Pen Refill (#PR4 with plastic adapter)\n\u2022Foray Gel Ink Refill (For Parker Ballpoint Pens)\n\u2022Moleskine Roller Pen Gel Ink Refill 0.5mm\n\u2022Monteverde Ballpoint Refill (For Parker Style Ballpoint Pens)\n\u2022Monteverde P42 Ceramic Gel Capless Refill (For Parker Style Ballpoint Pens)\n\u2022Monteverde Soft Roll P13 Ballpoint Pen Refill\n\u2022Monteverde Soft Roll P15 Super Broad Refill\n\u2022OHTO Needlepoint Ballpoint Pen Refill (P80-07NP)\n\u2022OHTO Extra-Fine 0.5mm Ballpoint Pen Refill (PS-205NP)\n\u2022Parafernalia Ballpoint Pen Refill\n\u2022Parker Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad)\n\u2022Parker Gel Ink Quink Refills (Medium)\n\u2022Parker Quinkflow Ballpoint Pen Refill (Fine)\n\u2022Parker Quinkflow Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\n\u2022Pelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Broad)\n\u2022Pelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Fine)\n\u2022Pelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Medium)\n\u2022Penatia Ballpoint Pen (Medium)\n\u2022Pentel Ballpoint Pen Refill (KFLT8)\n\u2022Schmidt 9000M EasyFlow Pen Refill\n\u2022Schmidt P8900 Super Bowl Refill (Fine)\n\u2022Schmidt P900 B Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad)\n\u2022Schmidt P900 F Ballpoint Pen Refill (Fine)\n\u2022Schmidt P900 M Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\n\u2022Schmidt P950 Megaline Pressurized Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\n\u2022Schneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Broad)\n\u2022Schneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Fine)\n\u2022Schneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Medium)\n\u2022Schneider Slider 755 Pen Refill Hybrid Ink (Extra-Broad)\n\u2022Schneider Slider 755 Pen Refill ViscoGlide Ink (Medium)\n\u2022Sheaffer T Ballpoint Refill\n\u2022Stabilo Ballpoint Refill\n\u2022Tombow BR-ZLM Ballpoint Pen Refill\n\u2022Visconti Ballpoint Pen Refill (AA49 1.4 Broad)\n\u2022Visconti Gel Refill AA38B 1.0 Broad\n\u2022Visconti Gel Refill AA38F 0.5 Fine\n\u2022Visconti Gel Refill AA38M 0.7 Medium\n\u2022Yafa Gel Refills to fit Parker Ballpoint Pens\n(The listed refills above are sometimes re-named or re-numbered in different parts of the world by pen refill companies.

We have been working for months to ensure everything is lined up to get started once we have the necessary funding in place. Making something new always requires creative thinking once production issues surface. This is why we will be working with the same time-tested and trust-worthy network of people that we have been with all of our other pen projects and prototypes. We enjoy sharing exclusive info, images, and news about the projects to keep everyone involved in the production process and share what it takes to make the pens from scratch.\nIt's so nice to meet you too...\nWant to know a little bit more about us?

The first edition print version of the book, available in the summer, will be individually-numbered and produced in limited numbers: copies could very well become highly collectible. In the winter of 2013 I'll release a free PDF of Roads Were Not Built For Cars. This will be available via the blog-of-the-book and, being free, will make sure the book's message reaches as many people as possible. Supporting this project with one of the options on the right helps me with the wider campaign to resurrect the important role cyclists played in improving roads for all.\nNot that the book is only about cyclists. It will also contains lots of automotive history because many automobile pioneers were cyclists before becoming motorists. A surprising number of the first car manufacturers were also cyclists, including Henry Ford. Some carried on cycling right through until the 1940s. One famous motor manufacturing pioneer was a racing tricycle rider to his dying day. Literally. He was killed after being hit...by a motorcar.\nThe free PDF version of the book will go live on the site in winter 2013; the first edition print, Kindle and iPad versions will be produced in August or shortly thereafter. Kickstarters therefore get a head-start and they also get lavishly-illustrated editions. The print, Kindle and iPad versions will be packed with pix; the PDF will be text-only (i.e. academic- and Googlebot-friendly). The iPad version will also have videos and interactive graphics; the free PDF won't. The print version will be about 350-pages long and will be available in full-colour and mono versions. \nWhat's in the publication?\nLots of meaty stuff. There will be chapters on:\nCycling's contribution to automotive history. It's far more extensive than you may think: from Henry Ford in the US to Charles Rolls in the UK, and more.\nAn in-depth look at the Cyclist Touring Club's Roads Improvement Association founded in 1885 and the Good Roads movement of the League of American Wheelmen of the same period.\nThe history of roads: animal tracks, Romans, turnpikes, the longer-than-realised use of asphalt, and more.\nFrom sidepaths to cycleways: the history of separate tracks for cyclists, including New York's Coney Island bike path and the 1930s cycle tracks in London, right through to the Dutch-style cycle infrastructure of Stevenage in the UK.\nTracking the political influence of cyclists: for instance, in the 1896 Presidential election campaign, the League of American Wheelmen was the only organisation to have its own room in the campaign HQ of the Republican party.  \nProfiles of highway governance pioneers such as Horatio Earle of the US and Rees Jeffreys of the UK. They are best known today as arch-motorists but they both learned their craft as officials in bicycle advocacy organisations in the 1890s. They pushed for better road surfaces long before they became motorists. Both went on to become very influential proponents of motoring but neither forgot the critical role played by cyclists.\nCycling and class: how did cycling go from an activity for the upper and middle classes to 'poor man's transport'?\nRoads in the future: currently, roads are dominated by cars just as they were dominated by trams in the 1940s. Could automobiles go the way of trams?  \n\nAiming for publication in August\nIf you've been following the progress of the book on Roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com, you'll know that Roads Were Not Built For Cars has been two years in the making. The research phase is nearly over (one more day in the CTC archives at Warwick University and one more day in the British Library in London) and soon all the threads can be brought together to finish the text. I'm also busy securing rights to the book's many illustrations (the full-colour ones ain't cheap and won't be in the free PDF).\nTwo or perhaps three launch parties\nThere will be a launch party in a bike-friendly venue in my hometown of Newcastle in August. There will also be a launch party in Surrey in September. This will be a mobile launch party, a bike ride from Woking to the 1890s \"Mecca of all cyclists\", Ripley. The ride will be led by me and accompanied by special guests. We'll stop off at historic locations en route and - weather-permitting - finish at either the Anchor Inn in Ripley (epicentre of English cycling in the 1880s and 1890s) or find a scenic spot for an al fresco picnic. I'm aiming to ride in period costume and on an 1890s bicycle but won't be forcing anybody else to do likewise. Mind you, it would look great wouldn't it? A rolling recreation of part of the 25 mile ride from London that was world-famous in the 1890s. If that's not your cup of Earl Grey, there are also plans for a launch party in Coventry, home city of the British bicycle industry.\nDownload the music from the video\nWhen I found some long-forgotten sheet music for Scorcher, an 1897 bicycle-themed piano piece, I wanted to hear what it sounded like so I asked musician Greg Johnston to interpret it for me. His up-tempo version can be heard on the video at the top of the page or by clicking below. Maybe click play and listen to it while reading the rest of this page? (MP3-playing widget isn't visible to those visiting this page with an iPhone or iPad.)\nAs an early Kickstarter reward, please feel free to download the track from my Dropbox.

I was there researching a rather large yet woefully little known petition: the petition that paved America. It was paid for and organised by cycle manufacturer Albert Pope, founder of the US bicycle industry and sugar-daddy of the League of American Wheelmen's Good Roads movement. Wheeled in to the US Senate in 1892 the over-size petition was signed by 150,000 individuals, including the US Chief Justice, State Governors and a future President. It was also endorsed by banks, large corporations, boards of trade, and labour organisations. \nThe petition, wound around its two wooden bobbins, is seven foot tall, weighs six hundred pounds, and is stored deep in the vaults of the National Archives.\nI was granted a rare look at the petition. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t normally let people into the vaults, but we can\u2019t easily move the petition,\u201d archivist Jessie Kratz told me.\nWhile I was in Washington DC there was a Rally for Roads, a promotional campaign supported by organisations in the roads lobby such as the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.\nARTBA was founded in 1902 by...a cyclist. According to ARTBA, the organization was created to \u201carticulate the need for a federally-built network of Interstate highways.\u201d\nARTBA was founded by Horatio Earle, a former chief consul of the League of American Wheelmen. He became known as \u201cthe father of good roads\u201d for his work on America\u2019s highways, work he started when he was a cyclist.\nThe history of the Good Roads activists of the 1890s is largely hidden from view, obscured by similar campaigns in the 1920s and 1930s by the motor lobby.\nIn his 1929 autobiography Earle wrote:\n\u201cI often hear now-a-days, the automobile instigated good roads; that the automobile is the parent of good roads. Well, the truth is, the bicycle is the father of the good roads movement in this country.\u201d\nThe local and national legislative structures put in place by cyclists in America and in Britain were later used to great effect by motorists, many of whom had been cyclists long before they were automobilists.\nHad influential figures, such as Pope and Earle and many others, not spent many years lobbying for good roads when they were cyclists, they would not have been as well equipped when it came to lobbying on behalf of the automobile.\nPioneer motorists knew how to push for good roads. They knew this because they had been cyclists first. \nWith your help, Roads Were Not Built For Cars will resurrect this lost history.

Our solution is to get rid of the lower 2/3 of the cord and replace it with a bluetooth unit clipped to your clothing.\nWearable technology is becoming an important new form factor in consumer electronics.  We're taking what would otherwise be a dull clip-on bluetooth unit and transforming it into something that becomes a piece of electronic jewelry.  Weighing about as much as two US quarters, you'll easily forget you're wearing Elroy.\nA Home for Your Earbuds\nElroy gives your earbuds a place to live.  Elroy's patent pending magnetic docking points give a convenient and secure location to keep your earbuds untangled and quickly available when you need them. \nThese docking points are also electronically activated to perform useful functions.  If you have an incoming call, merely removing an earbud answers the call.  Replacing the earbuds terminates a call.  If you're listening to music, placing the earbuds on the docks will pause your music.  Removing them again will restart the last song where it left off.\nHow many devices do you have?\nToday, bluetooth audio devices need to be capable of serving all the devices in your personal electronic arsenal.  Elroy comes equipped with Multipoint and can serve up to 7 devices.  Watching a movie on your iPad when a phone call comes in on your iPhone?  No problem. Just click and answer.  Maybe you have to carry two phones, one for yourself and one for work.  No problem.  Elroy is connected to both at the same time ready to take a call.\nOther Benefits\nEasily answer your phone when it's docked into a speaker system\nCan be used with any earbud or headset that uses a 3.5mm jack\nGets rid of the annoying cord when running or exercising \nControl volume, advance tracks remotely when your phone is docked to a speaker system\nAnd, Yes, Elroy will work with Siri.  Just push and hold the answer button.\n\nConfigurations\nWe find it a little boring when there is little selection in a product mix.  Just doing a few colors doesn't cut it.  We want this product to have variety regardless of the level of funding.  This is why we are applying a production method called \"late point differentiation\" to create 6 different variations of Elroy.  (You can view all the configurations at the MeetElroy website.)\n\nEngineering Elroy\nTo keep development simple and fast we are using a fully developed bluetooth module from Bluegiga.  This system is targeted specifically for high quality audio and phone applications. Bluegiga's WT32 audio module is built so that we can easily customize it, on an ongoing basis, to accomplish all the tasks Elroy requires. We currently have the bluetooth module up and running, performing expected tasks for Elroy.\nBy selecting Bluegiga, we ensure our primary goal of getting a quality product to our Kickstarter backers in the most timely manner possible.  Bluegiga gives us simplicity of development while still offering a powerful bluetooth solution.  \nTechnical Specs\nBluetooth 2.1 + EDR standard (See FAQ below for BT 2.1 vs 4.0)\n  - Nominal output power +5 dBm \n  - Nominal sensitivity -87 dBm \nClass 2 - range up to 30 meters\nTransmit power 7dBm, receiver sensitivity -87dBm\ntemperature range from -30C to +85C\nApt-X Audio Enhancement\nIntegrated 16-bit stereo codec\nHigh Quality -95dB audio DAC\nFully differential analog audio inputs and outputs\nMultipoint: Supports up to 7 devices\nLow power consumption\n>5 hours talk time\n>100 hours standby\nSupported Bluetooth profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP (v.1.5), SPP, OBEX OPP and HID\nElroy dimensions: 50mm X 20mm X 8mm (1.9\" X 0.8\" X 0.3\")\nBase unit weight: 12 grams\nEarbud weight: 1.9 grams/each\n\nFunding Goals\nWe've set a funding goal of $30,000.  That will be enough money to bring Elroy to market.  At this funding level, we include a standard set of high quality shorty cord earbuds from our Chinese supplier, based on an existing design.\nIf we are funded over $100,000 we will tool up and produce our own custom earbuds, designed specifically for Elroy.  \nGeneral use of funds will be for tooling up the external case, finalizing the PCB engineering, and testing Elroy across all platforms.\nUS Manufacturing\nAs mentioned in the video, I founded a company called Timbuk2.  I have over 20 years experience in a wide variety of manufacturing areas, both domestic and off shore.  The most important work I've done, as well as the work I most enjoy, has been in domestic manufacturing.  I love making stuff!\nAt Timbuk2, I applied Lean manufacturing techniques (as developed by Toyota) to sewn goods.  I was the first to marry those production techniques to mass customization concepts, as described in Joe Pine's book Mass Customization, in soft goods, and then the first to present that on the internet through a product customizer on the Timbuk2 website. With that system we were able to customize product, out of millions of potential combinations, and ship the product within 24 hours. That work became the inspiration for the NIKE iD program and a wide range of other online customization sites.  In 2008 and 2009 I also manufactured mass customized bags for the TED Conference through Rickshaw Bagworks.\nI know how to manufacture efficiently and cost effectively in the US and that's the plan with Elroy.  I understand manufacturing on a visceral level, having spent well more than 10,000 hours doing actual line production myself.  I'm very enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my manufacturing skills to Elroy. I believe domestic Lean manufacturing has tremendous untapped potential in the consumer electronics market.\nThese manufacturing methods are also effective for mitigation of CO2 emissions to address global climate change through elimination of transportation waste. This is a subject I've written articles on which you can read about here.\n[Note:  I am no longer affiliated with Timbuk2, having sold the business to a venture capital firm in 2005.]\nElroy T-Shirt\nAvailable in S, M, L, XL and XXL.

This project will be a challenge to accomplish if we just barely break our funding goal, but even at that, we believe this project can be completed in a timely manner. \n\nWe will be doing all the final assembly and packaging here in the US. The longest lead time process will likely be the tooling and molding of the external case. This would be the most likely point where we would expect delays.\n\nThis product will require extensive testing across platforms and configurations, but that should not affect lead times too much, since fixes will merely be firmware updates. We expect to have most all those issues resolved well before delivering product. Worst case we'll be sending out a firmware updates after product delivery.\n\nKey to managing customer expectations is communication. As the project proceeds we will post updates every Monday.

Most of those focused on exotic materials, unique actions or other features, all of which typically drive higher costs.  I like a tricked out pen as much as the next person.  However, I wanted to create a simple custom pen that was affordable and cool, custom machined in the USA and utilizing Bic\u00ae pen parts which can be readily found everywhere.\nFor everyday use... BAUX is your pen.\nMany will ask how I arrived at BAUX (pronounced BOX).... Bauxite is aluminum ore, which is mined to make Aluminum. So it seemed natural... the BAUX Pen.\nMaking BAUX\nUsing a hobbyist lathe, I have made numerous prototypes of the BAUX pen.  Tweaking the look, and tweaking the grooves to get the feel just right.  For production, a professional machine shop will be contracted to make the pens per the specifications I have developed.\nOPTIONS\nThere are three option choices for each BAUX Pen.  These will be selected in the survey (assuming funding is achieved) at the conclusion of this project.\nFirst, choose between the \"GROOVED\" version (red & black pictured below) or the \"SMOOTH\" version (blue & gun metal pictured below).  \nSecond, choose your BAUX Pen color.  Natural Aluminum, as pictured above or Anodized Red, Anodized Black, Anodized Blue or Anodized Gun Metal  as pictured below.\nAnd finally, choose... black or blue ink.\nEvery BAUX Pen will be \"hand stamped\" with the \"BAUX-USA\" logo by yours truly, right here in South Carolina, USA.  One cool Stamping Tool!\nCustomize!\nA great thing about the Baux Pen is that it is infinitely customizable using the Bic\u00ae Stick pens you likely already own.\nBic\u00ae pens come in many collar, cap, and plug colors\u2026 so use those parts to change it up and make a truly unique Baux Pen.  The ink and collars typically pull out of the front of a Bic\u00ae pen without much of a struggle.  The end plug tends to be a bit more stubborn.  With each shipment, we\u2019ll include a 6\u201d plastic rod that works great in popping out the end plugs from the barrel.  From now on, any time you run across a Bic\u00ae pen\u2026 think \u2018free refill\u2019 or \u2018spare cap\u2019!\nREWARDS\nAdd Ons\nAny backer interested in additional BAUX Pens can  simply \"manage your pledge\" to increase by $9 for each additional pen you would like.\nTHANKS FOR CHECKING OUT BAUX!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe BAUX Pen design has been extensively prototyped. The prototype process has allowed me to select the machine shop and anodize shop that will be doing the work to produce the pens if the project funds. These US suppliers are reasonably local to me, so I have the ability to visit to assure work is completed on time and per specification. Additionally, I have already acquired the BAUX-USA stamping tool and have spent some time developing a nice fixture to allow for consistent pen housing marking.

It seems as if it's a never ending cycle of tie and untie.  How about those of us that double knot, that makes for some fun challenges sometimes doesn't it?  Usually it's my kids shoes.  Shoelaces also have a mind of their own, coming undone at some of the most inconvenient times possible.  It's fun to know that you can cheat the system of tying your shoes and never have them come undone again.  You may be thinking I can just tie a knot and slip my foot in and out without untying my shoes every time, while this is true, you won't have the same consistent solid fitting shoe day after day that Lace Anchors 2.0 provides!\nPlain and simple, bow knots are eyesores.  Why do you think retail stores don't display their shoes with them?  They hide them by tucking them inside the shoes.  Unfortunately the bow knot has been around for WAY to long and we just feel like it's time to eliminate them!  If you currently tie knots behind your tongue or shove the laces inside your shoes to hide the bow knot, you will love what Lace Anchors 2.0 will do for you!  Simplicity, comfort, and style all in one!\nIt seems to Never fail.  Just when you get warmed up and your going strong, it happens, your shoe comes untied!  I may have put on a few pounds over the winter so far, but I'm a fairly frequent runner.   I have put over 250 miles on a pair of my running shoes with Lace Anchors installed and the results are FLAWLESS. Your shoes always have the same consistent fit and your laces never come undone! Laces that shift during exercise becoming tighter or looser on the bridge of your foot is uncomfortable and can lead to tendonitis.  Not joking!\nSomething that has always bothered me was my pants getting hung up or caught on the bows of my shoelaces.  Seems like every time I go to stand up I have to adjust my pants to eliminate this.  I have some OCD tendencies, but this one is up at the top of the charts.  Even if nobody buys Lace Anchors 2.0, at least my OCD issue can lay at rest!\nKids and Laces, need I say more?\nI have always been intrigued by simple effective designs.  Some of the simplest designs that we use today have been around FOREVER!  What I'm really excited about is the fact that Lace Anchors will be utilized by individuals every time they put their shoes on, not only when they actually slip them on, but the entire time they have their shoes on!  This means the Lace Anchors 2.0 is actually in physical use doing it's job with every step you take, not to many products can claim this!  \nInstallation is so easy!  Our packets will include step by step instructions with pictures on the back, or to make it even EASIER just watch the video below!  Make sure to install the Lace Anchors 2.0 with your foot in your shoe as shown in the video, that will allow you to find the perfect fit that your looking for. This is the type of product that you will use not even realizing how simple and comfortable they make everyday life with your shoes, until you go without them.  Once you use them in one pair of shoes, you'll be hooked! \nSo what did I learn from this?  I learned that Lace Anchors 2.0's are crazy strong especially for their size and this is proof that they definitely hold your laces perfectly in place.  I also learned that it's time to hit the gym again because that felt really heavy!  Unfortunately this project has taken up all my running and gym time.  \nLets face it, if you have kids shoelaces can be a pain.  Not only for the kids but for the parents as well.  Kids love independence, they feel big when they can put their shoes on without your help.  I have a 4 year old boy and a 6 year old girl that would constantly be running around with laces coming undone. Kids get so involved in what they are doing, they'll just leave their laces untied which can lead to potentially dangerous situations.  The morning rush to get to the car for school is so much easier now because they just simply slip their own shoes on and off we go, no more tying!  It's also nice to know that we are helping the teachers out by allowing them to actually teach instead of running a shoelace tying factory!  Untied laces in the classroom is never-ending, just ask a teacher.  We recommend using Lace Anchors 2.0 on kids shoe sizes 2 youth and up. \nIn 2012 we managed to land deals with some of the most Amazing athletes on the planet.  These Mountain Bike athletes compete in some of the most prestigious invite only events in the Mountain Bike world!  It's awesome to know our product is doing it's job with every push of the pedal.  Not once did our team have any issues with their Lace Anchors the entire season!\nhttp://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Video/Brendan-Howey-first-run-from-Red-Bull-Rampage-2012-Finals-021243269346120\nThe above link shows footage of our 2012 Team Rider Brendan Howey from the Prestigious event Redbull Rampage.  The biggest and best dare to conquer these trails.  It's awesome to know we kept his shoes in place!  Mountain bike Riders love our product because not only do we keep their shoes secure, we also eliminate the bows and knots from their shoes that could potentially come undone or/and get tangled in pedals and chains.\nhttp://www.pinkbike.com/video/272922/\nThe above link is some awesome footage of our 2012 Team Rider Jack Fogelquist doing an insane trick in competition.  You can see Jack Throw his feet around without hesitation.  Looks like we did our job!\nEVERYTHING Starts somewhere. Sometimes the simplest things get looked past because we are looking for the bigger things. Sometimes big things can happen from simple things. My kids managed to negotiate a trip to Chuck E Cheese's in exchange for the blocks!\nSome samples that were cut from a water jet for testing. The product and material was a FAIL. Next!\nFresh out of the mold from one of the very first runs of the ORIGINAL design that I came up with. This is basically what we will be producing but in the new Lace Anchors 2.0 version. As you can see the bottom slot has changed significantly with the new Lace Anchors 2.0 allowing nearly every shoelace out there to fit and stay snuggly in place. The dimensions and spacing between the holes and slot have changed and the outside edges are more rounded making the new unit smaller in size (sometimes smaller is better!) ultimately making the Lace Anchors 2.0 a flawless design in my book!\nTesting, Testing, and more Testing. I have hundreds of these bags from different tests myself, my father and others have performed on Lace Anchors. Something so simple yet with so many shoes and laces out there, things can get complicated quickly.\nJust a FEW of the MANY different designs that were tested while creating the Lace Anchors 2.0. It may seem like it would be simple but we needed the product to work with nearly every single shoelace out there, along with enabling a simple installation. We hit the nail on the head with the Lace Anchors 2.0. It's an extremely simple but functional design. It came down to thousandths of an inch to make our product perfect. By the way, everywhere I say we, that includes me, my wife, my kids, my mother, and the other person putting heart and soul into this project, my father. The Lace Anchors Team.\nThis is what I saw today when I opened my garage door and I thought what a great shot. You think my family uses Lace Anchors? No bow knots around here!\nDisclaimer:  There were no endorsements by any Brands for this project. All shoes used in the pictures or videos were paid for and are my personal property.  Although our product is used in all of the shoes in these pictures and/or videos, the shoes work perfect in their natural state without Lace Anchors 2.0.  Our product simply gives the user an optional way to keep their shoes secure.\nF.A.Q.\n1. When will I Receive my Lace Anchors 2.0?\nWe could possible begin shipping as early as Late March if all goes perfect, if we see our funding goal is going to be met without any doubts, we will get a head start where we can.\n2. Do Lace Anchors work with \"All\" Shoes?\nThere are so many shoes it's impossible to test on all of them.  If you have eyelets and shoelaces, odd's are that they will work great.  They won't work on work boots or high tops that are laced up to the base of your calves.  \n3. Can I run with Lace Anchors 2.0 installed?\nAbsolutely, I ran 2-4 miles everyday for 2 months straight with my Lace Anchors 2.0 installed.  For those of you that have struggled with heel slippage problems throughout your life, watch the \"another option\" video in the above section.\n4. Are Lace Anchors 2.0 adjustable?\nLace Anchors 2.0 allow you to find the sweet spot when installing.  This means you will be able to find the fit you desire and how tight or loose you decide to make your slip-ons.  For my regular everyday use, I like my shoes to slip on and off extremely easy, for my running shoes I prefer a snug fit.\n 5. Are Lace Anchors 2.0 adjustable after I Trim the Laces?\nabsolutely, although it may require a little more effort than your initial install.\n6. Do I need any special laces?\nNo, That is what is great about this product.  You do not need any special laces or crazy looking  devices hanging off the top of your shoes.  This product allows you to use the laces that come with your shoes.\n7. Do they work on kids shoes?\nI have them in my 6 year old daughters shoes and my 4 year old sons.  I would say they work best in children's size 2 Youth and up.  My kids love not having to worry about tying their shoes.\n8. Can you ship international?\nYes.  We will ship ANYWHERE in the world and there is no additional cost!\n9. Can I pledge multiple rewards?\nYou can multiply any reward you would like.  Just multiply the pledge amount by the number of rewards you would like.  If you want 18 packs, just double the pledge amount for the 9 Packs reward.\n10. What if my credit card is expiring before the funding date?\nIf your pledge was declined, just log into Kickstarter and click the \u201cAction Needed\u201d system message on the top of your screen. It will redirect you to Amazon, where you can change your payment method.

I have bought nearly every pen I've seen in search of the ultimate writing experience. When I discovered the Montblanc Starwalker (with Fineliner cartridge) I lost interest in searching for the ultimate pen...because I thought I'd found it. \nI used to think of a pen as one item, \"a pen,\" but after looking at Montblanc prices I realized a pen was really two pieces, a cartridge ($7) and a holder ($320-$15,000). I was really in love with the cartridge, and realized wanted to make my own pen to hold it. \nI love to make things. I've machined a few pens for myself over the years, but people are always trying to sneak off with them. I've always wanted to make more so that I can share the awesome...and now I'm finally getting around to it! I might even get to keep one for myself. \nBacker Rewards! \nChoose between Nickel Plated Aluminum (left) and Pure Titanium (right)\nOption 1: Electroless Nickel Plated, 6061T6 Aluminum (left)\nThis is the same finish I use on my custom flashlights. The only way I can describe it is lustrous! It looks awesome and feels even better in the hand. The coating is super-hard and...unlike anodize...covers every inch, inside and out. The nickel will develop a patina over time, to reflect the individual owner. It can be removed with any silver polish if you want to bring back the original shine. \nEarly Bird = $65\nSecond Chance = $75\nLate to the Game = $90\nFUTURE RETAIL PRICE = $130\n\nOption 2: Commercially Pure Grade 2 (CP2) Titanium (right)\nThis is 99% pure elemental titanium  You know, like from the periodic table. Ti is heavier than aluminum, but it's not too heavy. It's heavy like a boss. Titanium is also hypoallergenic and impervious to oxidation. I mean, it's titanium, do you really need to know more than that? Vibratory tumbling provides a satin finish. \nEarly Bird = $100\nSecond Chance = $120\nLate to the Game = $150\nFUTURE RETAIL PRICE = $200\nReally, another pen project? \nIf you really love pens (and also love awesome) just take two minutes and keep reading. I'll appreciate it, and I'm sure you will too. You might find my approach is a little different than what you've seen before:\nDesigned from the ground up to complement only the Montblanc Fineliner cartridge (epic) or the Montblanc Rollerball cartridge (great). This means no extra parts to lose, no fiddly springs, a thread-in cartridge, and a body that fits the cartridge like a German car door. \nMade right here in California, by me. I like to support people that take pride in their work, people who do a job the right way because that's the only way it should be done. When you back an Alpha Pen it makes a real difference to me and the vendors I use. It pays the power bill, puts food on the table, and keeps us looking forward to the day's work. \nPrecision that's not marketing hype. I don't deal in hype. I machine precision parts for a living and you can (and should) expect world-class craftsmanship. If you are buying a pen that is machined, you are going to feel the difference when it's designed and manufactured by a machinist! \nI know it's not cheap to back this pen...and that's because you get what you pay for...just like your dad told you. It represents the real cost of manufacturing quality goods, in small volume, right here in the USA. The Alpha won't be for everyone, but if you know quality and demand the best (right down to the screws) you're my backer! \n\nAbout me:\nI have spent most of my career as product designer and eventually got tired of carpal tunnel from sitting in front of the computer. I set out to learn how to make the things I was designing and wound up in trade school for machining and welding. I've worked as the lead fabricator at a Hollywood special effects house and ran my own prototype and custom fabrication shop. After years of making other people's ideas real, I decided to put everything on the line and actually start manufacturing my own products. \nFor the last couple of years I've been designing and manufacturing the world's finest LED flashlights in my own shop here in Mountain View, CA. I love to take an idea, apply it to some raw material, and create something that looks amazing and functions even better. I love technology, I love old school, and I also love putting them together. Feel free to check out my work at www.darksucks.com\nFAQ:\nWhy the 3-piece design? \nBecause the 3-piece executive is a classic. Because I love the ceremony of the screw cap. Because they just feel like a pen should. No gimmicks, no tricks, just simple and purposeful. It's like drawing a sword, and you know what they say about pens and swords. \nFor me, the writing experience is about feel. The feel of the pen in hand and the stroke on paper. Period. I love the way a Montblanc writes (I do actually have one) but I don't carry it around because I like to fly under the radar. So, it sits in a pouch on my desk, which is sad. I like to own things that I actually use, otherwise why own them? \nWhy the Montblanc Fineliner Cartridge? \nWriting with a Montblanc Fineliner...it's like the Matrix, it cannot be explained, it must be experienced. However, Montblanc's entry level pen is $325 and goes up to $15,000. That brand premium is so high most people have never had the opportunity to try one. I want to share the Montblanc experience. \nThe Fineliner cartridge ($7) sports a fiber tip, but it's very firm and doesn't break down over time like a marker. The fiber tip allows differing pressure and angle to vary the stroke weight. It writes a lot like a fountain pen, but without all the hassle. It's phenomenally smooth. I make a lot of people try my pen, just to see their reaction, and people are blown away. When's the last time you were blown away by a pen? \nThe Montblanc Rollerball (if ball-point is how you roll) is the exact same price and size as the Fineliner so you can choose that if you like. It's a great cartridge too, but it won't freak your mind. \nI'm a lefty, how fast does the Fineliner ink dry? \nThe Fineliner dries wicked fast...depending on the paper of course. On \"normal\" paper (printer, notebook, etc.) it dries as fast as a Sharpie. I've received the \"thumbs up of approval\" from several southpaw testers. If you are trying to write on something glossy, it will smear, just like most other pens. Can't have it all right? \nCan the Alpha accept other cartridges like the Hi-Tec C or Fisher Space Pen? \nAbsolutely not. Versatility equals compromise. Like a Swiss Army Knife, \"it's good for some and great for none,\" as a friend once said. You might need to read that again if you didn't get it the first time :) I think it's hilarious...and completely spot on.\nThe Alpha experience is the expression of a single purpose: be the best. This means the Alpha won't be the pen for everyone, but I'm okay with that. \nIs a Montblanc cartridge included with the pen? \nCartridges are not currently included as part of the reward. I'd like to provide cartridges, but at this time, I don't have a source to purchase them wholesale. That's okay though, because you can get them all over the internet. I'm going to keep looking for a supplier, because I think it's annoying when \"the batteries aren't included.\" If I find a wholesaler after the campaign launches, you'll be able to get a cartridge by modifying your initial pledge. \nWhat are the weight and dimensions of the Alpha pen? \nWhat is Your Production Plan?\nAs with my custom flashlights, I have only one standard for quality, the highest, and that's what my work is known for.  \nThe bodies will be machined in my own shop, by me, right here in Mountain View, CA. There is a time and place for foreign manufacturing, but this isn't one of those times. The Alpha will be machined from solid bar stock and is one of the things that makes it more expensive. No flimsy tubing, no \"mass production\" techniques to reduce cost. \nHow serious am I? \nI've already made a down payment on a new CNC lathe (Computer Numeric Control). Help me make sure that's a good decision and back my project! :) Why invest in a lathe instead of \"shopping it out\" to a CNC shop? Because I believe there is value in me making things for you, not just acting as a middle man and collecting a check. \nI'm just a one-man shop so I can't actually manufacture everything. The pocket clips will be cut at a local waterjet shop from domestic 6Al4V titanium alloy and formed by the vendor that makes all of my flashlight pocket clips. Working with local vendors also means I can keep on top of the manufacturing and minimize delays and errors. \nWhat is Your Delivery Schedule? \nBuying a lathe means delivery will take a little bit longer because it takes about 8 weeks for them to make a machine, just for me. Don't worry though, as an experienced CNC machinist, it won't take me long to start cutting parts.\nOnce the campaign is funded and the lathe is on my shop floor, my estimate is 8-12 weeks to get the CNC programming dialed in, clips manufactured, pens machined, finished, assembled, packaged, and then shipped out. \nYou can expect regular progress reports and transparency regarding any problems or delays. I know problems happen. I know you know it, so I'm not going to try and pretend otherwise. \nWhat is the Status of Engineering and Design?\n-- Finalized -- I've made a few pens over the years. When I got a Kickstarter project in my head I started making prototypes to refine the engineering and design. I've considered everything from diameter, to weight and balance, to how many turns the cap takes to remove. \nAs the campaign progresses, I'll be transferring the measurements from my prototypes into technical drawings used for programming the CNC control. This might involve some minor tweaks for performance and manufacturability, but what you see here is 99% what you should expect to receive. At this point I'm ready to start manufacturing!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk Management: \n\nDesign, manufacturing, and fabrication is what I do for a living, so this kind of project is bread and butter. \n\nYou can expect to receive what was promised in a timely fashion. If problems arise I guarantee clear and transparent communication. That's what I've built my flashlight company on and that's just how I do business. No matter how simple a project is, something goes off the rails at some point; I have the experience to deal with those problems. \n\nManufacturing locally also goes a long (long) way to manage risk. I'll be working with vendors I have established relationships with so I won't waste time trying to find the right shop to do the work. \n\nChallenges: \n\n1) Purchasing a CNC Lathe- I've already had several conversations with my local sales rep and they are standing by with my order. By the time you read this I will have already made a deposit. Delivery lead-time is \"normally\" 60 days.\n\n2) Programming the parts - I run a CNC mill on a daily basis. I've had formal training on both CNC mills and lathes. It's been a while since I've run a lathe, but it's more or less the same thing. I don't expect any issues, but I'm just being transparent here. It will take me a while to get up to speed, but I've attempted to budget that into the time lines I've already discussed. \n\n3) Shipping - I have no idea how many backers there will be (hopefully a lot), but I already have commercial shipping accounts and equipment that I use for my current business. If this goes crazy, I'll need to hire some people to stuff envelopes and get pens out the door as fast as possible. \n\n4) Assembly & Packaging - both take time and cost money. I've designed the pen for easy assembly. It often takes more time to assemble the fancy packaging than the product--and that costs money--so we are going to skip fancy packaging, focus on the product, and go with simple packaging. Less busy work means you'll get your pen sooner, and I prefer to put all of the money into the product instead of the land-fill. I know fancy things are \"supposed\" to come in fancy packages, but I don't actually believe that. \n\n5) Quality Control - I already manufacture CNC-machined products and making the pens in-house means I can inspect the parts as they come off of the machine, not after some vendor has already made 1000 of them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Check out my latest campaign: Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen :-)", "update_content": "Good day previous backers! \nIn case you're not following me on social or thru the newsletter I wanted to let you know about my most recent campaign for this Alpha Bamboo Fountain Pen.

It takes biodegradable PLA plastic filament, melts it into thin layers onto a surface, moves up and prints another layer. After layer upon layer, you are left with a physical object. You can use 3D modeling software such as Solidworks, the free google sketch up program, or go to thingiverse.com, download free things that people have already created, and print them out in your own home or office or classroom.\nWhat is RoBo 3D? \nRoBo 3D is the ultimate 3D printer everyone has been waiting for. We combined the best minds from the open source community, the best hardware we believe can give the best prints, and our own ideas based on our experience working with 3D printers. The open-source design is made so people like us can go online and find all the documents that show the ins and outs of how to make a RoBo 3D. In true rep-rap fashion, RoBo 3D has been made so that it can print out its own parts. Once in your hands, print out another for a friend! Come experience it and together, lets create something great.\nWho is RoBo 3D for?\nArchitects- print out model homes and buildings for clients. Change and print out again without hassle.\nDesigners- Have an idea that you want to bring to life? Print out your designs and see if they were everything you imagined. If not, change it and print out the next idea.\nHobbyists/DIY- Easily create your projects in the comfort of your own home. \nSmall Business owners- Manufacture your own products at the office!\nStudents- Senior engineering project coming up? Use RoBo 3D to proint the parts you need to get the job done done.\nHome owners- Replace broken household items for next to nothing!\nWhat can you create with RoBo 3D?\nThe amount of things you can print out with our 3D printer are only limited by your imagination. The list goes on and on but some examples are iphone cases, prototypes, household items, replacement/spare parts, and more! There are plenty of free 3D modeling software out there such as; google sketchup, tinkercad.com. \n3D Printer Beginners: Go to thingiverse.com, check out all the different designs people have created. When you see something you like, It's as easy as plugging RoBo 3D into the wall, plugging it into your computer via usb, downloading that design, and then let the printer do the work! \nWhy RoBo 3D is Great!\n**Open Source 3D Printer that anyone can use\nRoBo 3D was created for ease of use. Buying the fully assembled printer will allow you to plug it in, download an open source software like Google Sketchup, and start printing within minutes. You do not have to create anything yourself before you begin prints. Like we said, you can go to thingiverse.com, find something cool that has already been designed by other 3D printer artists, download it into Sketchup, and press print! Simple as that. \n**Low Cost Without Sacrificing Quality\nWe wanted to create RoBo 3D to not break the bank in the Consumer 3D Printing Industry. For just around $520, we are not only one of the cheapest, but one of the most precise printers out there...Which brings us to our next topic:\n*Precise and high detail printing\nWe had to make sure that our printer was extremely precise and as detailed as possible when printing. Still in the works, but these are some of the prints we have currently done! We will upload more as the crowd-funding continues.\nSummary of Rewards\nAll RoBo3D assembled and disassembled kits will include plastic filament so you can get started from the minute you plug it in.

PLA only\nRoBo 3D printer with installed heat bed for ABS\nManufacturing Pipeline: From Start to Finish\nProduct Development:\nAfter tinkering with other DIY 3D printers,such as Printrbot and Prusa, we decided to take our favorite components of each, and combine them into one awesome, easy to use 3d printer. Starting from scratch, we made 3D renders to see how our product would look on our desk. After agreeing on the right printer design, we set out to create it. Using mainly wood and our existing knowledge of key components, we made a mockup of our finished product. Our satisfaction of this mockup led us to further seek a manufacturing partnership. Using outsourcing websites and communicating with dozens of plastics manufacturers, we found a company to produce our 3D CAD engineered prototype.  We based our encasing around the idea and concept that people can build into it.  The holes are pre-cut, and pre-sized to fit the different screws, rods, etc in. The encasing will allow even the most beginner builder to make a RoBo 3D Printer.  While working on manufacturing the right encasing, we simultaneously sought out manufacturers for different components such as motors, rods, bearings, wires, hot end, build platforms, and the open source community for different parts. We found the best tactics, what not to do, and how to build an effective and efficient 3D printer inside our encasing.  \nProduction and fulfillment plans:\nWe will use a large part of the money to work together with our plastics manufacturer to create a mold for mass manufacturing so we can lower the cost per encasing in order to reduce our retail 3D printer price. This manufacturer has already successfully built us a prototype, has the 3D CAD engineered files and is ready to go once funds are provided.  \nWhile we are getting the mold manufactured, we will be simultaneously obtaining the other key components like motors, pulleys, etc which we already have developed the relationship with manufacturers for.  We have gotten this to a point where we just need the funds to fulfill the orders for parts.  For parts we can print, we will be running a RoBo 3D Farm that will allow us to print multiple parts at once that we can use to build Backer models.  All this will be done in a timely fashion and we will make sure we are as efficient as possible when it comes to compiling and fulfilling rewards. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the risks and challenges throughout the production of RoBo 3D are:\n\n1) Overcoming great leaps when determining print quality- Everything in a 3D printer has to be tuned very fine in order for everything to work perfect. We know it will be a challenge and we challenge ourselves to create this product so that when it is fully assembled, it can be calibrated and in perfect working order very easily and efficiently. We know that that is the basis of a successful printer and we will strive throughout the funding stages to make sure that is our main focus. \n\n2) Manufacturing the printer encasing- A large portion of the investment will go to creating a mold for mass manufacturing allowing us to produce the encasing for a much cheaper price in the future. Essentially, we will then be able to lower our printer retail price. \n\n3) Delivering products in a timely manner according to our strict quality guidelines we impose on ourselves- we are almost fully done working on fine tuning the development of the encasing and all the components successfully working within the encasing so people can build RoBo 3D in their own homes if they wish to purchase the disassembled version. As the funding progresses and at this moment, that is something we are tackling and working directly with our manufacturer and CAD engineer on. It will be perfected and tuned properly and successfully. We also understand that in order to complete all the orders in a timely manner, we will need a way to build pieces quicker and consistently. Our solution to this problem is to build a RoBo 3D Farm with multiple printers all printing parts simultaneously. \n\n4) The founders all have their own individual work schedules outside of RoBo3D therefore matching time and time committing has made the process getting here take a little longer. We have all spoken in regards to this and have all agreed that we are getting closer to a stage where we want to be doing this full time because we enjoy it so much. We just need that push to the next stage. Taking it one step at a time and trying to put out the best product possible to you all is our first concern. \n\nAnother topic we want to address here is that we will assure questions and concerns by backers will be responded to promptly and taken very serious. We want to succeed and we have been following many different past projects on kickstarter and we know that the only way to build success from this point is to make sure that the backers are our #1 priority during this campaign outside of perfecting our actual product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "BATCH OF PRINTERS ARRIVED!
