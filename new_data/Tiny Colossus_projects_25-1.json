[{"backer": "Tiny Colossus", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We can't even begin to express how humbled and joyful we are about these last weeks. You have allowed us to make The Wagadu Chronicles even better that we thought it ever could be.\nThank you SO MUCH!\nYou can continue following the development of the game and books through our website and our social media: twitter, instagram & youtube.\nAnd you are most welcome to join our lovely discord!\nSee you in-game <3 !\n We believe that role-playing isn't always just about about grinding and growing stats. It's the embodying of a role; the presence of a backstory and all of the quirks and details that define your unique character.\nMany of us have experienced old-school role-play around a table with pencils and a bunch of dice. We know how immersive it is to speak like our characters and to be surrounded by other players who are making decisions based on their characters profiles. Role-play truly submerses you in another world, more powerfully than any NPC  quest could.\nImagine a videogame where everyone around you is role-playing. The noble Emere with whom you are travelling does not want to desecrate any tombs and ignores the loot; the Swala hunter you just met chants a ritual prayer before every hunt and the Asiman merchant never attacks or kills anyone because she believes her goddess wants peace to rule in Wagadu.\n\n\n For the first time in gaming history we are building an online game 100% tailored to role-players, from lore to mechanics.\nThese are some of the community features that we are implementing to create this unique environment:\nContinuous releases of free lore material.\n In-character role-play as a default for all players when in Wagadu's servers.\nOff-world lobbies where players can get technical support or any role-playing tips on how to act out their character before returning to the actual game world.\nRewards for groups of players that engage in interesting and well thought role-playing.\nWe intend to keep the space safe from harassment and trolls who want to disrupt other people's story and the role-play environment - we are spending a lot of energy on this and will have a number of moderation tools that we and the community can use.\n We have already started building our community on Discord! We chat about the setting, role-playing games and even have a Wagadu role-play coffee-house channel <3 Join our Discord!\npre-alpha footage\n\n The tabletop RPG books of Wagadu are crucial to this project because they flesh out the lore in a way that a videogame can't. If you want to truly experience and understand role-play in Wagadu, you'll have to take a look at the lore that is in the books. If you decide to focus only on tabletop role-play, your input and user generated content will affect the development of the MMO.\nWagadu is an ecosystem of tabletop and videogame, which can be experienced in different ways depending on personal taste.\nExcerpts from our free teaser 5E lore book\nWagadu is a strange place where different types of people fall from another world and have to fight to adapt and survive. Behind the scenes a lot has been done to create this world. We believe that role-playing thrives when the setting is well fleshed out and interesting.\nThe approach taken to create this fantasy world was: \"What if Tolkien were black?\". Just as Tolkien did, a lot of time was spent researching the mythologies and traditions of people, but in this case across the African continent. The result is seven \"lineages\", which are similar to fantasy \"races\" but more nuanced, with overlapping cultures and more fluid identities.\n\nMany of the lore elements, including some crucial elements of the setting such as the conflict of lineages with slavery or the \"Dwen\" spirit-children, are inspired by diasporic experiences of black people both in the Americas and in Europe.\nTo make this fantasy world more authentic we have been in contact with experts such an Africa biologists for the various biomes and  African elders for village lore.\nWe are sharing a free 300 page guide to the world of Wagadu, that be can directly downloaded here: \n\nWagadu's role-play and immersion are so important for us that we built the MMORPG mechanics in tandem with the lore. In the Wagadu Chronicles, world-building and gameplay strengthen each other.\n We are building something that has never been seen before in any MMO, a special cinematic mode called \"Dialogue Mode\". This is a mode that can be triggered when two or more people chat with each other. It allows for close ups and the use of many animations (from emotions to little show-off spells) you can basically create your own little live show with friends or strangers as you explore and role-play your character's story.\npre-alpha footage\n The 5E setting adapts the usual class system to Wagadu, the MMO takes a freer approach.  You have skill \"presets\" that look like traditional \"classes\" but you can freely break away from that and build your own warrior-oracle or farmer-chef, nothing stops you.\nYour character is made up of skills that go from 1 (beginner) to 5 (master), every level unlocks more advanced uses of that skill.\nThere are dozens of skills to choose from, we have many of them nailed down already but we will be looking for feedback (especially from our backers) on what additional skills to add during alpha and beta. Some examples from the current skill set are cartography, divination, archery and animal husbandry.\nEvery day, every player receives a free bundle of experience points (called \"Memories\") to invest in skills. No grind required, so you're not penalised if you decide to become a travelling merchant, a coffee-brewer or a tailor: you'll level up just like your mercenary friend.\nA special feature of The Wagadu Chronicles are \"ancestral blessings\". Throughout Wagadu, Ancestors leave skills for players to pick them up, these skills last from a few minutes to an hour and unlock some random power anywhere in the skill tree (and sometimes even completely unique powers that belong to NPC Ancestors). So your Daa'ima bodyguard character may well be able to breathe underwater for an hour or to heal everyone for 15 minutes!\npre-alpha footage\n Just as in other sandbox MMOs, we will leave the economy in the hands of the players. If there are only a few Fire Asimans in the game who can craft fire potions, these will become rare and expensive and people will have to travel more to find where to buy them.\nMost items in the game can only be crafted by other players, loot and NPCs will provide only a few basics.\nMany items, from pots to clothes, to weapons, can be customized by in-game editors if you have the right skills. No two robes are the same in The Wagadu Chronicles! You can sign your creations and even become a famous in-game designer (and ask higher prices). \nAdditionally, every item can be lost or stolen when you get slain - be careful!\n\n\n\n Surviving Wagadu requires interaction with Spirits and Ancestors of all types. Obtaining wood in Wagadu for instance, usually requires interaction with a Tree Spirit. You can convince it to give you some wood by making the right offering but also by behaving in ways the Spirit likes: if in the last few days you have planted and watered seeds in the farm, the Tree Spirit might be more generous to you. If instead you are holding an axe, the outcome might even be a battle. Navigating Spirit requests is made even trickier by the fact that different resource Spirits have conflicting requests and things that they love/hate.\nIn Wagadu, NPCs remember what you do and act accordingly. Your actions matter.\nAnother little peculiarity of The Wagadu Chronicles is that your character has a couple of \"hidden background\" traits: these are features that you inherited from an ancestor (such as descending from an Elephant-Spirit) and that are hiddenly assigned randomly at character creation. Spirits might react upon them, and discovering your hidden backgrounds can be an exciting role-play story and create unexpected bounds with other players.\npre-alpha footage\n\nTotems are central to every player's game, since they:\nact as spawn point.\nprovide healing & safety.\nbestow perks (e.g. farming bonus).\nallow to place player housing.\n  Groups of players can turn an unclaimed  wilderness Totem into a Village Totem by giving it recurrent offerings. This allows players to place housing around it. The type of offerings the Totem asks for varies based on its personality: one might request  30 calves to be born, another Totem might just ask for money.\nThe Totem requests vary slightly every week and a Totem's personality affects the village's players' gameplay and goals.\nPlayers can make offerings to additional wilderness Totems to add them to their \"Totem Pantheon\" and get their perks. When two different villages compete for the same Totem, a \"Spiritual Challenge\" ensues in which the highest bidder wins.\nSheer strength does not always mean victory. A Totem might request that the whole village never goes hunting, so that Lionblood village might give it a pass and let it be claimed by the peaceful clan of farming players that live in the next island.\n\n The Music of Wagadu is heavily inspired by a combination of African traditional instruments and with western RPG tunes. We aren't just building a refreshingly new soundtrack, we are also creating new associations based on African traditions, such as playing Ghana's bamboo-flute funeral dirge for death-related gameplay and Mali's Dogon bull-roarer for spiritual and ancestral summoning.\n We are collaborating with established traditional Ghanaian musicians such as Dela Botri and professors of the Department of Music of the University of Accra in order to make Wagadu sound truly authentic.\nFor the voiced parts of the game, we will be collaborating with black voice-actors, such as the iconic, Abubakar Salim (\"Bayek\" in Assassin's creed Origins) whose amazing voice features in our Kickstarter trailer.\nRecording sessions at Kay Boni's Cafe Abajo in Accra, Ghana\n\nTwin Drums is made up of a team of established game developers. We have worked for some of the biggest franchises and gaming companies out there. We have experience of working on different platforms and we are bringing all of these different perspectives into our game development. And yes, we are half black and a third queer: that\u2019s our secret super-power.\nTo make sure that The Wagadu Chronicles gets all the support it needs, we have partnered with League of Legends developer Riot Games - they have been amazing with us and we are very excited about this collaboration.\n\n We have some funding and support from a big developer. The Wagadu Chronicles is happening. The reason why we are here is because your support can help us improve the game by increasing our development budget and by joining us in this development journey with your feedback and participation.\nBeing able to see how many of you care about role-playing and afrofantasy and getting your support will help us make The Wagadu Chronicles the best game that it can possibly be!\n Please note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros since Twin Drums is based in Europe. Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nBear in mind that shipping costs have not been included in the pledges and will have to be paid subsequently. \nWe are currently collecting data and negotiating with our suppliers in order to get the best deal for most countries and we will be able to provide exact shipping charges closer to shipment!\nSome pledges provide multiple versions of  in-game items as a rewards. This is very special because all items in Wagadu can normally be lost or stolen at death (\"full loot\") but these backer reward items are \"bound to your soul\", they cannot be looted. Since we will not be producing them anymore by game release, their value will constantly increase and they will become very rare, expensive and recognisable in the game. It's your choice if to keep them, sell them or gift them to your closest friend.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that we are a small team making a relatively big game. If the game is very successful we could end up struggling with our server infrastructure or to produce enough 3D content. This is how we are tackling it:\n- We have partnered with a developer, Riot Games, that understands both online infrastructure and how to produce content for big player populations.\n- Where possible we are relying on proven architectures and tools like Amazon Web Services and Unity 3D.\n- We have different internal 3D art production scenarios, with the possibility of getting freelancer and outsourcing help in the most demanding scenarios.\n- We are here crowdfunding not just for useful additional resources but also to get a better understanding of the size of audience; this will allow us to plan accordingly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac4 or more", "title": "Access to Backer Updates & Our Thanks!", "descp": "Thank you so much for supporting us!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcdc Team Updates for backers\n\ud83d\udd37 Discord Role\n\u2764\ufe0f Our gratitude!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["234 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Exclusive", "descp": "Get both The Wagadu Chronicles MMO and 5E setting \"The 7th Era\" at half price!

Have you ever wondered who you would be in the Letters universe? Hop on over to our quiz and find out with our new personality test!\n https://www.letters-game.com/quiz \n\nFollow our progress! Connect with us on social media:\n\nHi, friends! We are three game designers from Switzerland working on an adventure game about friendship, growing up, and finding your place in life. It's a nostalgic adventure of a girl named Sarah, where you can use the power of words to solve riddles, make decisions and change the world around you.\nLetters - a written adventure has currently been in development for the past year and a half. During that time, we exhibited our game all over Europe, and people really enjoyed playing it! But we still have a lot to do. To make Letters as amazing as we want it to be, we need more money for production and as much feedback as we can get. That\u2019s why we want you to be part of our journey. You can help make Sarah's story the best it can be.\nLetters is a puzzle adventure in English, with a branching storyline and a word-based game mechanic. It\u2019s a single-player game for your computer with around 3 hours of playtime for one playthrough.\nIn Letters you travel back in time to the 90s and 2000s and move through the pen pal letters and chat messages of Sarah, a shy girl from Switzerland.\nFollow her life through all the ups and downs of growing up and make decisions that will change what kind of person she\u2019ll become.\n\nQUICK FACTS: \ngenre: puzzle adventure \nmode: offline, single-player \nlanguage: English \nplaytime: approx. 3 hours (1 playthrough)\nplatform: PC / Mac \nrelease date: early 2021 \n\ninnovative word-based riddle mechanic \ncharming coming of age story inspired by real-life\nrelatable female protagonist \n branching storyline where your decisions matter\nbeautifully hand-drawn visuals & pixel art evolving with Sarah\u2019s age\n comfy, playful & casual game that anyone can enjoy\ngood for practicing English in a fun way  \nIn Letters you follow the life of Sarah through letters and chat messages she sends to her Russian friend Katya. You use your keyboard or gamepad to run and jump through her messages, solving riddles along the way.\nIn a world made from paper and computers, words matter. So use their power to change drawings that block your way, help friendly characters and interact with images of Sarah's friends and family.\nPick up words from the text and throw it at a drawing or image to change it. But choose your words wisely - only the correct words will let you progress in the game. But don't worry, there is often more than one solution so feel free to experiment.\nLike in real life, finding the right words is hard. That's why in Letters you can create new words by breaking apart the existing ones. Think outside the box and play with words in a new and fun way.\nSo put your English skills to the test, solve clever word-based riddles and use the power of words to change the game world.\nLetters is the story of Sarah, a Swiss girl who loves to draw, play games and read comic books. Meet her friends and family and watch her grow up from a child into a young adult trying to find her way in life, navigating school, friendship and everything in between.\nBut that's not all... In Letters, you can make decisions for Sarah that will change what kind of person she'll become. So take revenge on your sister, play video games all day and fall in love. Every action has a consequence, so be careful.\n...Or don't! Just play the game again and rewrite Sarah's story. You'll discover new possibilities with every playthrough. \nThe first chapter of the game is set in Sarah\u2019s childhood, 1998. The levels are warm, joyful and innocent, which is how most of us feel when looking back at our favorite childhood memories. Prepare yourself for a big dose of cozy nostalgia, especially if you are a 90\u2019s kid.\nAs Sarah gets older, her letters and drawings evolve with her, making way for a more mature style. Also, you can enjoy cute pixel art and early 2000's internet as Sarah goes digital and on her brand new computer! Share cat videos on social media and put your computer at risk by downloading music from questionable sources.\nDive into a colorful universe full of fun characters and enjoy our charming hand-drawn paper universe as well as our beautiful pixel world.\nLike the art in our game, the music also evolves with Sarah\u2019s age and your decisions throughout the game. We are working with Michel Barengo, an established music composer from Switzerland.\nListen to some of Michel's creations:\nLetters is inspired by the branching storyline of Life is Strange, the personal feel of A Normal Lost Phone, the nostalgia of Emily is Away Too and our own experiences growing up.\nAll of us love unique game mechanics, authentic female characters and casual, comfy games without unnecessary violence. We think that words matter, but they often get overlooked in video games. By borrowing elements from traditional word-games like Scrabble and combining them with a wonderful story, beautiful art, and charming characters, we want to show everyone that words are fun. \n ! 1 CHF is approximately 1,01 US-Dollars !\nAnd please remember that the shipping costs are not included.\nHere you can see what our rewards will look like. Check them out and choose your favorite!\nWe appreciate your support and hope you like the rewards we picked out for you. Please remember that we also have limited tiers with special rewards and early-bird rewards.\nThe three of us - Martina, Selina & Aleksandra - met during our game design studies at the Zurich University of the Arts. First, we became friends, then a development team and a year ago, a game development company.\nIn the last five years, we learned a lot about making games, running a business and working together as a team. The idea for Letters was born in 2017. One year later we decided to bring our vision to life. The project kept evolving and improving as we did. We talked to players, devs, and experts, implementing helpful feedback, new discoveries and cool concepts we came upon. After years of work, we are ready for the last phase.\nMartina, Selina & Aleksandra\nMartina is responsible for writing, level design, and sound design. She loves cute things, good stories, food, cosplay, and pen-and-paper role-playing games. Her mind is often caught up in fantasy or sci-fi worlds like Lord of the Rings and Star Trek. (DS9 is the best one!)\nSelina is our artist, creating all the visual assets and animations for Letters. Besides drawing stuff, she loves to watch and play D&D (huge fan of Critical Role), read a good book or build houses in The Sims 4. She's also a cat person.\nAleksandra is our programmer and the great mind that the original idea for the game came from. She is originally from Russia and spent some years living as a street musician in Moscow. She now lives in Zurich with her husband and 8-year-old son.\nWe might be a weird little bunch but we welcome you to be a part of it. There is a little bit of each of us in Letters and we want to share it with all of you!\nRight from the start, we tried to show Letters to as many people as possible. We love the game but we don\u2019t just make it for us. We want you to be a part of it, get feedback from you and make sure that we create something you really like.\nIt\u2019s important for us to stay independent because we want to make games that we truly care about. With your support, we can stay autonomous and create something unique.\nLetters is now around 70% complete, and we need your help through Kickstarter to give it its final push. We can\u2019t wait to release it and show you what we worked on so hard for the last years!\nIf you don\u2019t have the means to support us financially but still want to help, share this campaign or our Steam page with your friends and family. This would mean a lot to us!\nWe\u2019ve won three grants with which we financed production so far. The additional money of the Kickstarter campaign allows us to continue production at this high quality level and assures that the game will be finished and released in early 2021. \nInspired by your feedback and input, we will finish production in mid-2020. Then it will be all about polishing, testing and adding the finishing touches to the game so we can release it in early 2021. Letters will be available on Steam and itch.io for PC and Mac.\nThank you for making it that far into the text! That means you must like words, right? Whether that applies to you or not, we think that words matter and that they can be a lot of fun! Try our demo and see for yourself.\nLet us know should you have any questions, comments, concerns or feedback, we'll get back to you as soon as possible.\nSo if you like casual, non-violent games, beautiful hand-drawn or pixel art, wacky characters, bad puns, relatable protagonists, branching storylines and playing with words, you should join us! Let's make Letters - a written adventure a reality!\nIf you want to connect with us or need more info about the game, make sure to follow us on social media!\nFor more information visit www.letters-game.com and subscribe to our newsletter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are two natural enemies of indie devs. Money and time. We are Swiss so we know how to handle our money. Our budget is small but it\u2019s enough to get Letters done.

Robin Baumgarten, Gregory Kogos and Guillermo Federico Heinze for their art. \nA huge thank you to every member of the many A MAZE. teams from 2008 until now.\nEspecially to the people who formed our amazing and unique festival experience with their knowledge, passion and character over the many years. Please scroll down for a complete list of all those amazing people. Thank you! \nA long story short.\n A MAZE. is a festival - not a trade show. \nA MAZE. is an inclusive, forward thinking place where the present is lived and the future is prepared. A future where you play and interact with art and people on a meaningful and respectful level. We would really love to continue our work inspiring the games culture around the world.\nA MAZE. mixes all amazing and positive ingredients together: flame throwers, masterclasses, delighting talks, hands-on workshops, #hypertalks, dream tents, live concerts, DJ sets,  performances, human craziness, playful intelligence, beautiful minds, arthouse games, immersive art, playful media, and interactive installations. \nA MAZE. / Berlin is also since 2011 the international games and playful media festival and art experience of the #gamesweekberlin .\nExplore the A MAZE. / Berlin programme and award nominees (2018 and 2019)\n Festival programme 2019 \n Festival programme 2018 \n Award Nominees 2019 \n Award Nominees 2018  \nWe recorded most of the amazing talks by all our guest artists from 2012-2018 in Berlin and in Johannesburg. Very rare and inspiring talks on our A MAZE. YouTube channel.\nWE ARE PUNKS OF THE DIGITAL AGE! \n Also a big shout out to our worldwide community, our partners, and the funders we've worked with to build A MAZE. into what it means to all of us now. Since 2008 we\u2019ve all done a great job shaping the game culture and industry to be better.  Without festivals like A MAZE., there wouldn't be a safe and inclusive space distinct from products, big game conventions, and overpriced conferences. Additionally, much of the artful and thought-provoking interactive, immersive, and playful content/stories wouldn't find the recognition of an audience. It is necessary to make this content visible and discoverable. There are many players out there who seek more than entertainment. Players want to be challenged and inspired. A MAZE. is a home for those works, and those players.    \nSimply not enough money to continue.\nEvery year, getting the festival budget together is always the trickiest part. Especially if you don't want to sell out and desire to retain your uniqueness. We cannot take every sponsor!\nOur main focus isn't on business. Our core is art, experimentation, hot shit, and inspiration. A MAZE. is an experience. A full body-mind experience. We don't want to sell out! We also don't want to raise the ticket prices for participants. 70\u20ac for students, regular 90\u20ac (early bird), and 130\u20ac (regular) are totally fair for the 3.5 days programme we're preparing. \nThis year, A MAZE. asked for additional funding with the goal of more long term planning security, team development, and structure for A MAZE. and its Berlin festival. \nWe're not only talking about the festival production! We want to focus on creating a \"steady team\" who works together in building a prosperous future for the festivals and projects we do! There isn't, at the moment, any planning security and no stability. This could burn A MAZE. if there is any change coming. This kind of longer term funding would also enable us to commission works, and curate the programme and the exhibition with external curators based on themes. Well, to make it short, our applications weren't chosen by the juries, and that's why we are here now. It\u2019s important for us to keep the quality of the festival experience high, the programme fresh, and the exhibition diverse. To do that, we need a motivated and fairly compensated team.\nLet's look together into an amazing future.\nWith the success of this campaign we will continue, highly motivated, to bring A MAZE. to the next level and move forward. The next level for us means structure and team development that guarantees a sustainable foundation of A MAZE. as a platform. This includes A MAZE. / Berlin, the production of A MAZE. / Nairobi, and the creation of an arthouse games network that will support authors and creators around the globe. \nThe little breakdown of the first 50K: \nWhat is our plan with the first 50K.\nIf we exceed the 50K, here are our plans. Upon overtaking the goal of 60K we want to bring back one issue of the A MAZE. Magazine. At the 85K we will bring into motion a book on arthouse/auteur games and the connected history of A MAZE. If we reach the stars and go beyond 150K, some money could cover the first production steps of A MAZE. / Nairobi in 2020. \nAmazing rewards for every supporter.\nAll supporters will be list on the supporter website. We will also make a campaign banner for 2020 which shows every supporter at all our events we do.\nEvery supporter gets one #amazenotdead pin at A MAZE. / Berlin 2020 by Nomi. Just pick one!\n1.

Scroll up otherwise you die!\nA MAZE. was established in 2008 in Berlin and is celebrating, for the 10th year, the convergence of games, art, and other dimensions. A MAZE. also explores alternative movements in games, culture, and digital art around the world. With our unique, open minded, and lowbrow festival vibe, some have called it the \"Burning Man of Game Festivals\". The 9th edition of A MAZE. / Berlin in 2020 will be a real experience for different thinking creatives who are coming to share, work, network, and party a lot.\nA MAZE creates #PositiveChaos that mirrors the digital world, and the narratives we are living in, to create answers made of meaningful and artistic content in games and VR creation.  We achieve this with our forward-thinking direction of curating an art exhibition of contemporary games and experimental playful media works, delightful talks and workshops, presenting the international A MAZE. Awards in 7 categories, and mixing mind bending performances from different music scenes.\nSince 2012 we have built and expanded our events and collaborations into an international artgames community of passionate punks of the digital age. A community of people who believe not only in monetary success, but idealistic and artistic expression. For example, A MAZE. / Johannesburg (2012-2017) was the annual Sub-Saharan Africa hotspot supporting local game developers, African digital artists, communities, and institutions. A MAZE. / Johannesburg enabled them to build their own connections, get inspired, gain international visibility, and build a two way bridge between European and African A MAZE. communities. \nSome of our works (2008-now) : \nA MAZE.

We are very experienced in the production of A MAZE. . Everything new like the commission works or theme curated parts of the festival programme are motivating and will give freshness to the next A MAZE. / Berlin. We are excited!\n\nBut it's our first Kickstarter. We have hoodies, t-shirts, and very rare art works to deliver worldwide. But we are very confident we will manage it as we do everything else. As punk of the digital age we learn a lot from making things happen - sometimes it doesn\u2019t work as we want, but you won't realize that beforehand. We are very confident that you will be fine and the rewards will come as promised.\n\nAt the moment we are still looking for a new location, which is since the start of A MAZE. an annual challenge. We already found interesting and affordable venues which would fit our festival. I'm sure we'll confirm the location during the Kickstarter ! The festival will definitely take place in Berlin between April 15 and April 25, 2020.\n\nYour support will boost us! E.g. drawing on a very successful Kickstarter would give us a good budget for the first A MAZE. / Nairobi in 2020. We are already working on and making first contact with partners and the local community. Important: We are still trying to get additional funding like from Musicboard, Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg and as well from the cultural department of the city of Berlin and sponsors. The goal is to build a healthy and financial sustainable setting and this Kickstarter will finally give us air to breathe and create more sustainability.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac3 or more", "title": "Punk of the Digital Age", "descp": "YEAH!

In order to get back home you'll need to explore the island and talk to its inhabitants. Sadly, no one speaks your language! You'll have to learn words one at a time to decipher what these strange creatures are saying.\nThe demo is available for Windows/Mac and Linux.\nThe final game will have a huge handcrafted city to explore, filled with hundreds of opportunities to speak to the city's inhabitants. You'll be able to learn one of at least a dozen languages. \nThe game is currently translated in the following languages: Basque, Bengali, Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\nMost of these translations are only partially complete, so the demo might be very short, depending on which language you chose. It should be enough for you to get a taste though!\nThere is no voice over in the game at the moment, that's one of the reasons I need this Kickstarter. If the Kickstarter succeeds voice overs will replace the synthesised audio in the demo.\nThe full version of the game will have these community translations and I'll ensure that Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Japanese, Spanish, German and French will be completely translated. Apart from teaching people who can speak English other languages, you'll also be able to learn English in each of the chosen languages.\n     Want to know more? You can keep up to date with twitter, facebook and the mailing list. There's also a discord.\n If this goal is reached, mod support will be added to the game. Users will be able to add their own their dioramas, or even entire cities to the game. You'll then conceivably be able to learn any word in any language. This will work with an easy to use interface that makes the sky the limit!\n- Create your own dioramas or cities\n- Use either existing artwork or import your own 3d models\n- Add new objects you can click on to learn the word\n- Write new dialogue and add entire new story lines\n- Create new translations\nThere are a few ways to learn words in the game\nYou can click on objects in the environment to learn the word for them.\nWhenever you talk to one of the city's inhabitants you'll be able to learn a word by guessing it from a list or by solving a riddle.\nThe city's inhabitants will also comment on the weather as you walk past. So if you want to learn how to say \"It's snowing\" (for example), then this is the way to go.\nBy clicking on a tree, the player learns the word for it.\n  The pictures give you clues to guess the word in red. In this case, \"bird\".\nWords you know will appear purple when talking to people in the game. By moving your mouse over these words you'll be able to see its translation. The more words you know, the more you'll understand and begin to feel at home in this strange city.\nThe words you know are purple and can be translated\nBy being continuously confronted with the language you'll also internalise the word order and keep the words you know fresh in your memory. The game can display both the romanised version of languages with different scripts as well as the native scripts.\n Three of the five planned city districts are currently in a near final state. They all have a unique look and their own words to teach you. The size of the city in the final version of the game also depends on the Kickstarter, some pledges will result in new buildings or areas.\nIf fifty people back the Animal Lover reward, a zoo will be added to the game. You'll be able to learn the words for dozens of animals by clicking on them.\nIf fifty people back the Paying Respect reward, a graveyard will be added to the game. Statues of the deceased will teach you adjectives, i.e \"Here lies Alexander the great\".\nIf twenty five people back the Parent reward, kindergartens will be added to the city, children will use see-saws and swings and liven up the city with their playful ways.\nFinally, if 1 backer is found for the Royalty reward, a palace will be added to the city. You'll be able to explore the palace from the inside and learn many new words.\nAll the backers listed above and those who back as Citizens or Founding Citizens will have access to the game following the Kickstarter and leading up to the game's release (which is currently scheduled for August 2018). Several new versions of the game will be available to you per month. You'll be able to watch the city grow and evolve as I work on the game and constructions sites will gradually make way for finished buildings.\nA little peak of the various districts\n Throughout the city, various street musicians will beguile you with their songs. This was my solution to play music in the game, they'll often be near important characters, luring you to their location\nSome of the talented musicians you'll be able to meet.\n  I often feel bad for playing video games. They can take dozens of hours to complete and that's time I could've spent learning a valuable skill.\nI also believe that games can be a great way to teach people various skills. I loathed the time I had to spend learning in school and would have been tremendously excited at the prospect of playing a game like Lingotopia.\nI began searching for a game that allows me to learn a language while playing, thereby absolving my guilty conscience. To my surprise there were no games out there like Lingotopia. So I set out to create my own language learning game. A game set in a beautiful city, with an uplifting story, many unique characters to meet and hundreds of words to learn.\nI've been developing the game in my spare time throughout 2017. As the demo proves, it is in a very functional state. You can explore part of the city and learn several dozen words in over a dozen languages. But I'd love to be able to work on the game full time and give it the attention it deserves.\nThis involves adding much more content to the game: Expanding the city and creating many more characters to talk to. You'll then be able to learn hundreds of words by exploring a huge city (with a working public transport system). I'll also need to get more translations and audio recordings.\nThe voice overs required in order to make this game a truly great language learning tool are also something I need your support for.\n  My name is Tristan and I'm the developer of Lingotopia. Apart from some help with the art direction at the beginning of the project and with the music, I've been developing the game all on my own.\nMy career in game development has been short and sweet so far. I started out as an intern on the wonderful Expedition simulator, \"The Curious Expedition\". While working on the puzzle game \"Slayaway Camp\", I began making my own, smaller, more experimental games, like \"One Show Only\" and \"Tumbling Home\". Lingotopia is my first foray into language learning and I'd love to keep going in this direction, as long as the game is well received of course.\nMusic for the game has so far been provided by my dear friend Tobias Junge and wonderful wife Mariella Ziegenhagen. As more bands join the city's ensemble cast of musicians more songs by these two and potentially by others will be added to the game.\nArt direction for the game has also been provided by Ludovicus Gees Aryo Herwastho, who played a huge role in establishing Lingotopia's unique look\nI am also tremendously thankful to the wonderful people that have added translations to the game so far! Without them, the game wouldn't have made it this far <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe current demo should serve of prove of the fact that I'm able to make this game.

Moved by its own curiosity, it then finds this light, which grants it the blessing and powers that will be needed to venture forth toward the unknown in order to break the Samsara.\nThe Deities\nOn the journey, the player shall meet wise deities who will give spiritual help so that he may find the necessary strength to carry on his epic journey.These deities are Jupiter, Saturn and Venus.\nSaturn & Venus\nThe Samsara\nSa\u1e43s\u0101ra is the repeating cycle of birth, life, death, and reincarnation. During the course of each life, the quality of the actions (karma) performed determine the future of each person. There is no beginning to this cycle but that it can be ended through perceiving reality which is nirvana (liberation).\nIn the game, Samsara is presented in the form of a Tower.\nThe Tower of Samsara\nThe game will be divided into 6 realms. Each realm is a planet, that from bottom to top, represents a lower karmic state ascending to a higher karmic state, in the form of a tower - The tower of Samsara\n1 - Pluto - Realm of Matter\nPluto is where the journey begins. Being a formless being, when you agree to begin your journey by playing the game, the god Jupiter sees your effort and grants you a chance to grow higher and walk the path of the Samsara. In Pluto, language is born - from raw matter to counsciouness. In this cold binary planet, matter bind forms into life that has to thrive constant hunger over the cold wastelands and caverns.\n2 - Mars - Realm of Mind\nFull of machinery and pollution, Mars is where egotistical minds, war, anxiety and fear dwell. There, Reason is God and Matter is faith. Trapped in their own illusions, all these minds can see is separation and disunion, their excessive reason have killed their empathy toward their own and have turned the planet to a fearful place.\n3 - Earth - Realm of Nature\nLife blooms in this place like nowhere else. Will to live is what guides the animals and plants that live in Earth. These life forms learn from adaptation and self protection - the ecosystems work as chaotic enviroments that teach and force changes upon every being.\n4 - Mercury - Realm of Mirrors\nBy entering this realm, you will be forced to look inside yourself - into the stream of subcounsciousness. In this place the true path unfolds and any deviation from it is confronted.\n5 - Maldek - Realm of Asura\nMaldek is where the Asura (demi gods) dwell. With a higher karmic state, they can perceive reality better than animals and other life forms in our solar system. It is rumored that the Maldekians couldn't handle their higher knowledge and vibration - they lost control over themselves and went sick - their energies got polarized and they became vicious.\n6 - Logos - Realm of Forms\nLogos is the universal reason, the place beyong time acessed only by those with highest karmic state. Its the mind of the Universe, the whole that contains everything.\nThe Meditative State\nThe player seeking guidance will find powers to manifest the light of Apollo, a lamp that will be a valuable tool for your journey. It has the form of the Vesica Piscis, which represent the first move of the spirit.\nThe lamp will aid the player in various ways: Helping defeat enemies, solving puzzles, finding hidden paths, warding off ghosts, locating objects, reading messages and more.\nThe Akheron\nThe akheron is the vessel that carries the spirits to another worlds, harvesting from different realms of existance and guiding evolution. It is a giant castle-like structure that floats on space and its conducted by Saturn. It is located near the moons of Pluto, in the far corner of our Universe and its a keyplace to the game which it allows the champion to use it as a transporter to the another planets, but also to be a place of resting and peace. Exactly like the \u2018ship\u2019 that is meant to be.\nThe Akheron - Near the Wormhole Generator Device\nEnemies and Karma\nEnemies are lost souls and forms that will sense and try to steal your inner light. Each planet also has a stronger enemy at the end: a boss.\nYou can overcome enemies either by battling and killing or by stunning them and sparing. These actions will influence your karmic state and thus influence the outcome of the game.\n The Hungry Ghosts - Pluto\nThe Men - Mars\nBearer of Reason - Pluto (Boss)\nThe Relics\nTraveling through the worlds, you'll be able to retrieve relics from ancient times. The relics are resignified objects of past times who got lost in the planets of the tower. They work as collectibles in the game.\nThere will be 2 classes of relics:\nRequired Collectable Relics\nYou will need these relics to advance as you play the game.\nKeys: These relics open certain paths of the game.  \nBoss: These are relics you get after a boss. You use these relics to power up the akheron and travel to other places.\nOptional Collectable Relics\nThese are optional and great for the game completionist.\nHidden: These are relics that hidden in the scenario, are harder to find and have puzzles or enemy groups protecting them.\nUHF Crystal box - Relic\nRelics - The Message System\nRelics also work as a time-space breaking device to deliver messages to other players in the online message system. Players will be able to write a three-line poem (called haiku) to other players with advices, inspiration or even lies.\n Message System Reading Example\nWe are Thrilled to announce that Chris Christodoulou, the composer of the amazing Risk of Rain OST joined our team and will compose the entire OST of the game!\nListen to the first track of the OST:\nKickstarter Trailer Track \nThis section describes the rewards goodies in detail. For prices and goodies-per-tiers please refer to the Kickstarter default's Reward section on the column to the right.\n** In the event of Nintendo failing to provide support for indie developers on the new console (which is unlikely), backers will vote to choose another Nintendo platform to publish the game.\nBudget Breakdown\n We are Martelo Nero\u2122\nGabriele Marchi - 27 years old - Italian\nGame Logic Programming, Physics Programming, Marketing, Social Media\nGabriele has 8 years of game programming experience and 3 years of work in the game industry as a programmer, producing games for Trento MUSE museum. He's also the most good looking guy in the team.\nDanilo Ganzella - 27 years old - Brazilian\nGame Design, Team Management, Tools Programming, Particles, Marketing\nDanilo started on the Video Game industry when he was 19, working on enterprises such as Kidguru which launched Freekscape - the first Brazillian game on the PSN. Danilo also has a Degree in Computer Science and another in Media and Communication Studies.\nGuilherme Gaspar - 28 years old - Brazilian\nCreation, Art Direction, Ambient Design, Character Animation, Concept, Storytelling\nGuilherme has been making art his whole life, working professionally with visuals since his early 20's. Guilherme also has a degree in Visual Arts. Portfolio: www.behance.net/ggaspar\nChris Christodoulou - Omnitemporal - Greek\nMusic Composing\nChris has studied music composition and has a masters in film music. He's written stand-alone pieces and scores for short films, but found his true calling in video game music. His first game score was for The Sea Will Claim Everything in 2012. Since then he has produced several OSTs encompassing a variety of genres including the soundtrack for Risk of Rain and Deadbolt.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTower of Samsara depends heavily on assets.\n\nAnd most of them are visuals. Only on the very first map of the game, we have about 30 particle systems and about 300 sprites.\n\n-- In the last 10 months we made a good amount of progress developing the game aesthethics and core components, which are already almost done and user-tested.\n\nThat means that we can focus on making content instead of be fiddling too much with core gameplay adjustments. This happened because our game benefits greatly from others awesome platform games like Super Metroid or Fez, where we can scavenge lots of successfull platform-related mechanics.\n\nFurthermore. the game will be divided in planets, which will help we keep the development modulated and get feedback from backers, correcting bugs, making designs adjustments, balancing difficulty, etc.\n\nSo our biggest challenge will be keeping up with the schedule while not giving up the visual details or compromising the game length. Although its the first project of this team, we are a group of three guys with a lot of experience in game development, and we'll do everything we can to stick to our deadlines and deliver the immersiveness and deepness we've promised in this presentation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Martelo Nero\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nWe are Martelo Nero Team.

We think that modern games lack the deployment of Artificial Intelligence, therefore we decided to change the situation and create a truly smart opponent who will be able to: \nLearn by himself \nStudy the player\u2019s tactics\nUndertake counter-actions\nRemember the player\u2019s decisions\nMake plans\nThe mysterious and unpredictable game plot will make it fun trying to unveil the secrets of the game.\n    You\u2019ll have to move in to a new house with a quite normal looking neighbor. But appearances can be deceiving!\nWelcome to a small world where you\u2019ll be able to try and save somebody\u2026or yourself! The game is set in a small village which you\u2019ve recently moved to. You are an ordinary resident... aren't you?\nYou have a neighbor living across the road. Who is he? You don\u2019t know. Why has he nailed up the basement door? Is he holding someone prisoner? Maybe a monster? Or maybe the door was just annoying? Anyway, it\u2019s not your business! At least, your Neighbor thinks so. \nYour goal is to clear up the mystery no matter what! During the game the Neighbor studies the player\u2019s tactics and tries to predict it. He\u2019ll go to all lengths to keep his secrets. \nYour opponent is attentive and curious. Don\u2019t let him catch you! Be careful: he learns from your mistakes!\nYou can explore: your own house, the local area and your Neighbour\u2019s house. Your house is your private territory. You are safe there. The Neighbor\u2019s house is quite the opposite. Firstly, his house is bigger than yours. Much bigger! Secondly, the Neighbor will not let you walk around his house and certainly not enter. And it\u2019s out of question to see over the WHOLE manor!\nThe basement is the Neighbor\u2019s biggest secret! You\u2019ll win as soon as you get into it! But\u2026 It doesn\u2019t look like an easy victory! We are creating the best secret keeper \u2013 and he is able to solve any task! And the main question\u2026\nWill you be able to reveal the secret and put your own intelligence up against the artificial one?\nThere are many objects in the game map. Everything you see can be used. The only limitation is your imagination and creativity. You can carry, throw, turn on and off any item. You can do anything you want. The outside world will become your tool to counteract the Artificial Intelligence.The main thing is that you can use these items as intended as well. You can catapult with a slingshot, boil up a kettle and freeze something in a fridge.\nOur biggest pride and your biggest challenge is the Neighbor. We tried to create a truly smart A.I. that can learn during the game. He can see, hear and he remembers everything.\nHis main goal is to protect his secrets. And he\u2019ll do his best to do that.\nThe Neighbor doesn\u2019t only study your tactics; he can build up his \u201ccastle\u201d. He\u2019ll try to secure his territory protecting the most vulnerable spots - those he has less control over. As mentioned above, you can use any item around. The Neighbor can as well!\nThe opponent can apply everything he \u201cvirtually\u201d sees against you. Be sure \u2013 he\u2019ll do that! The Neighbor can make traps out of the stuff around. He\u2019ll find a way to prevent you from using your favourite tactics. Any of your wrong decisions will turn against you in the future!\nThe longer you play \u2013 the smarter and more experienced the Neighbor becomes. And the more difficult it is to win\u2026 He keeps an eye on you!\n                   We are creating this game for you and with the help of you. We\u2019d much appreciate any assistance from your side to help the game see the light of day next year. Here is a list of rewards we\u2019ve prepared for you. PLEASE NOTE: Pledge rewards contain ALL of the rewards of lower level pledges.\nWe are asking you for 100 000 USD as a base goal. Of course, it\u2019s not enough for our team to work on the project for a year. However, we\u2019ve already managed to collect some money to start the project and have done a lot of things such as basic coding, lots of art materials and we are working on a playable prototype right now.\nWe are looking ahead to what we can do if you back this project. At the base goal, 100K USD, we'll create the base game where a player will counteract the Neighbor\u2019s AI one-on-one. The more backers we have, the greater and the more interesting the game will become. We\u2019ll add a multiplayer mode, more items and interactive opportunities, and random generation of the house at the start of the game so that each player can have a unique house! Those players who have PS4 and Xbox One will also be able to enjoy Hello, Neighbor! on their consoles! Moreover, players will also be able to craft their own tools using all the items around if we manage to reach all the goals!\nWe\u2019re an independent and young at heart team of game developers and we create games for kids and kidults. We like to experiment and sometimes from our keyboards, mouses and wacom quills we put out something more hardcore.\nWe started in 2004 as green graduates, and turned into highly skilled professionals who have released more than 50 mobile games. Our games have awards and leading positions in mobile stores; we've participated in partnership projects with ZeptoLab (My Om Nom), Disney (Chip and Dale), and Qualcomm (Goal Defense Multiplayer) to name just a few.\nBeing a pioneer of free-to-play mobile games, we realize that such games are losing their soul and keep harvesting their users. We have the experience and a huge desire to go further and create a PC project for quite different players, rather than just the casual mobile audience.\nNow we have beards and battle scars and are more than ready to create a really big and original project such as \"Hello, Neighbor!\", a PC suspense action puzzler with a smart A.I. opponent that learns as you play.  \nWith fire in our hearts, we are working on the game that will give players a sort of freedom and a relevant reaction to all their actions.

Each one has its own peculiar abilities and strengths, making for epic and ever-changing battles. You'll learn to hate those bosses and then eventually beat them.\nInteract with the world: With a system similar to the message in a bottle, you'll be able to communicate with the other players that populate this endless and huge dungeon; we plan to give the player the chance to affect the world in many ways and this is just one of those.\nIt\u2019s been long forgotten when the Tower started eating the lands, unstoppable, inevitable. Every creature, human or monster and their belongings became part of the walking monolith, everything was eventually restored and imprisoned inside, but not quite like it was originally.\nWhere there was a city, now is none.\n Inside the tower every soul materializes as their inner nature, a man can turn into a beast if it fits him, and the opposite can happen too. Everyone is forever imprisoned and forced to roam aimlessly inside the insatiable pillar.\nWe took inspiration from classics like Chocobo Mistery Dungeon, Shiren the Wanderer, etc. and we added a twist: a gameplay style that feels strategic and dynamic, something that can\u2019t really be achieved with the turn based approach, and that players into dungeon crawlers will enjoy without the fear of \u201cmore of the same\u201d.\nAs the Tower travels it will collect more locations for the player to explore; every location will be populated by unique creatures, so far we\u2019ve planned about 20-25 characters, each one with a special unique passive skill that will impact its play style greatly.\nGetting deeper in the dungeon does not only bring stronger foes, it will also reveal part of the backstory behind the colossal creature that annihilated the world as it was, and other features that lead to rare soul cores and equipment.\nCrafting the resources from the different lands will also lead to more exotic equipment, and the character the player picks may let him reach certain areas precluded to others species, so multiple trespasses of the same dungeon can lead to different results.\nUnlocking a new Soul Core brings not only different statistic for the player, as the skills are completely customizable on any character, a special unique skill also adds depth to the strategy to apply during the dungeon traversal, and sometimes certain quests could ask to play exactly as that character.\nThe game started as a 2D retro styled roguelike dungeon crawler, we were familiar to the genre from our previous experiences and while writing down the game design we started thinking \"You know what? This could really benefit by adding another dimension!\"\nWe moved to Unreal 4, and we will never regret this decision: the engine is amazing and it gave us an incredible boost in development speed. Surely everything was different and more complex at the beginning, but with the hard work of 4 months, we had the first working prototype of the game.  \nOnce we release the Early Access version this summer, we will keep adding more content that will be community driven, the game will offer the chance to cast a vote to 4 possible features through the idols of the elemental deities, which will reward the player with different prizes.  \nThe game has been greenlit in 10 days, and we estimate the early access version to go live this summer.\nEverything we've done has been self funded, but we wanted to step up our game and offer more compelling experiences, and get our games to a broader audience. As the game gets bigger the development costs rise and we reached a point where we will be forced to slow down massively the development to cover the living expenses.\nWe did our best to manage our resources as a three men team, and got quite far with the little savings we had, but to make this game the dungeon crawler we envisioned we need your help.  \nOur goal may seem not that high looking at other projects, but for us it sincerely means a lot, and it would allow us to release the early access version of the game with a good number of the listed features and perhaps help us keep developing it until perfection!\nWe are 3 guys from separated backgrounds in the indiesphere that met during a Global Game Jam, the good feedback we received and how we positively felt as a team kickstarted our wondrous adventure on making games by ourselves. After a time of selling mostly flash games, we felt confident to step up our IPs on PC and hopefully Consoles. We've been working in our spare time for a year before deciding that we wanted to move to one place together and become a proper company, so in August 2014 we started a new life and moved to Scotland and founded our own company: Alcapa Games Ltd.\nAlcapa Games is also recently helped by the almighty Social & PR Overlord Lukas Gomula.\nYugenstudio is a crazy talented long term friend of us, for anything that's audio related he is a pro, and has worked already on many games and popular franchises providing themes and sound effects.\nHope you like our project! \nConnect to our socials to stay in touch!\nFind us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter\nwww.alcapagames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is hard, but we're committed to this project and we have invested all our personal savings and money towards Reikon Dungeon.\nWe have previously worked on roguelikes and, thanks to our experience, we're pretty confident that we will be able to deliver our promises.

Your tale begins shortly after the Dread-Pirate Fatbeard launches his last raid. Known across the waters for his greed and excess, he ignored the crew\u2019s concerns about attacking so far from their own territory, and put them all at risk. Believing they were doomed, his crew took matters into their own hands and mutinied against him, overthrowing the Captain, and giving them one last chance at survival!\nYou have to survive a number of enemy territories in order to get home, but the path you take is up to you. Will you travel through the tame waters of the South, where the pirate clans are disorganised and weak? Or venture to the Northern seas, where conditions are harsh and the mighty Ironbeard clan rules with fearsome tactics?\nMutiny features fast-paced combat for 1-16 players, where you and your friends fight rival pirates to keep your ship afloat while trying to collect more treasure than each other.\nYour must escape through the enemy waters where Fatbeard left you and return home to your island stronghold. On the way you\u2019ll settle the dispute of who is the greatest pirate by gathering more riches than the rest of the crew, proving once and for all that you deserve to be the new Captain permanently.\nRiches are acquired by defeating enemies so they drop their loot, or stealing from their ship directly, but you\u2019ll be fighting with your crewmates over more than just gold, since there\u2019s weapons, items, and the prized Captain\u2019s hat to argue over too!\nYou\u2019ll have to work together in order to survive though, as you face enemy ships full of pirates from whichever clan controls the area, who will steal your hard-earned loot and sink your ship if you give them the chance. If your ship gets sunk its game over and everyone loses.\nAs you clear each territory the player with the most gold in the round will be rewarded, and whoever has looted the most gold by the time you reach home will be the winner.\nAs you battle your way through enemy waters to get home, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time fighting, both with enemies and each other, and how far you get will often be decided by you\u2019ve got in your hand. There\u2019s a wide variety of weapons in Mutiny that you can find in barrels, chests, and in the hands of your enemies!\nThey all act differently, and fall into 4 categories: Melee, Ranged, Explosive, and Special.\nMelee weapons are the standard weapons you\u2019ll see in Mutiny: Swords, Oars, Planks, Anchors... whatever\u2019s nearby to batter someone over the head with.\nRanged weapons are rarer and offer users some amount of safety as they can deal devastation from afar.\nExplosive weapons are.. hazardous. Bombs are great for taking out large groups of enemies all at once, but will also damage your ship, so be careful!\nSpecial weapons are extremely rare, and have a variety of extra effects that may or may not be desired by the user!\nAll weapons deal different amounts of damage, but some also deal out a knockback force, and some even have combos to master, which deal EXTRA damage AND knockback AND make you look all fancy! \nThe spoils of war! Downed enemies will drop their gold, but if you die you\u2019ll drop yours too. Try to recover it when you respawn before your friends grab it all!\nYour ship has a treasure chest that you can use to keep your gold safe in case of death, but any gold you decide to deposit will be shared with the rest of the crew when the round ends. If you\u2019re the only one using it then you\u2019ll be giving your gold away, but its fine if everyone else is using it too, maybe you\u2019ll even get out more than you put in! The ship\u2019s chest prevents you losing gold when you die, but can still be targetted by invading enemies, and must be protected.\nWhen you escape a territory the ship\u2019s gold is split equally, and then divvied up based on any awards players earned during the round, but the Captain always takes the biggest cut.\nYour ship is the basic combat arena, where the majority of fighting will take place, but thanks to the motion of the ocean and attacking enemy ships, the arena is always changing.\nIn fact, half the time the arena is trying to blow you up, since ship-to-ship combat is a major part of the game. Enemy ships don\u2019t just sail alongside you, they\u2019ll ram you and use cannonfire to try and sink you too. You have to stay on top of repairs to make sure this doesn't happen, and sink them before they sink you!\nIf you get rammed, your ship will change orientation, and stuff will roll around on deck as the chaos unfolds, but you can also board enemy ships and take the fight to them directly. This makes for an dangerous and dynamic combat arena, but try not to be on board if your crewmates manage to sink the enemy, if you go down with the ship you\u2019ll have to swim back through shark infested waters.\n Your ship is equipped with a number of interactive elements:\nCannons are your main method of attack for ship-to-ship combat, and are the best way to cause hull damage to your enemies and sink them.\nRopes are used to get around your ship quickly, and board enemy ships, but they move differently depending on the ocean waves, so let go at the wrong time and you\u2019ll end up in the drink!\nBelow Decks is where you respawn from when you die, but is also a target for invaders to steal from you, so keep it guarded!\nLife preservers can be thrown out to help people escape from sharks more quickly\n...and more will be added as development progresses!\nIf your ship takes too much hull damage and you don't repair it quickly your ship will sink, and that means game over for everyone and restarting the round from scratch.\nThe best way to survive as a team is to have a Captain on deck, because they are bigger, stronger, and generally more awesome than the rest of the crew. They add much needed strength to your team, and the best way to survive as a player is the BE the Captain. Unfortunately everyone else knows this, so you\u2019ll have a bit of competition!\nBeing Captain is the goal of every player, because it comes with lots of perks. You get a special weapon that will lay waste to enemies with ease (so you get more gold!), you can beat up your own crew while being immune to damage in return, AND you get the biggest share of the ship\u2019s gold at the end of the round.\nBUT! getting hold of the coveted Captain\u2019s Hat is hard, and holding onto it is even harder. You\u2019ll be tougher as a Captain, but you\u2019ll also be a MASSIVE TARGET. Not only will enemies attack you first, but the rest of the crew will be gunning for you too!\nMUTINY is the name of the game and if you\u2019re Captain then you ARE the game!\nAs soon as you become Captain the Mutiny Meter will start to fill up, and when it\u2019s full a Mutiny will trigger, and the rest of your so-called friends will try to kill you.\nThe balance of the Mutiny Meter is affected by what everyone is doing. Some actions will give you authority points as Captain to reduce the meter and prevent a Mutiny, for example killing an enemy, or repairing the ship. Some actions however will lose you authority points and increase the meter, like attacking a crewman, or dropping a bomb on your own deck, potentially maxing out the meter and triggering a Mutiny.\nWhen a Mutiny is triggered, the crew get a limited time to take down the Captain and steal the hat, claiming Captaincy for themselves! The Captain is strong, so it will take a good amount of the crew to take them out, if you\u2019re the only one who dares attack the Captain you\u2019re likely to get knocked into next week.\nOf course, a Mutiny can happen when the ship is overrun by enemies, or you\u2019re on the verge of sinking, so you need to decide as a team whether its worth hunting the Captain down, or whether you need to concentrate on keeping the ship afloat. Its up to you!\nMutiny Mobile is the companion app we\u2019ll be releasing for phones and tablets. You\u2019ll be able to play simple games with your \u2018ship in a bottle\u2019 like a regular app, but you\u2019ll also be able to connect with the main game over wifi, and use your device to control the game directly.\nYour device will be turned into a virtual controller so up to 16 of you can play without a need for extra control pads, and as long as you have your phone with you, you\u2019ll always be ready to jump into the action!\nWhen you connect your device your screen will be used to unleash a whole pile of features, like viewing maps that show where enemies are attacking from, cannonballs are going to land, and where on your ship needs repaired. You could enter a first person view when you use a cannon to aim precisely, or use it to reveal which enemies will drop the most gold. The possibilities are endless, and we\u2019re really excited to find out what else we could do with this technology.\nWhen you\u2019re not playing the main game you can play minigames and even create characters on your device that you can use the in main game, whether you\u2019re at home or a friends house, AND when you play elsewhere, any rewards you earn will be saved onto your device so you can take them home again and use them there.\nThe idea of Mutiny Mobile is to create something which you\u2019ll find fun to use whether you\u2019re connected or not, and open up what the future of gaming could look like. You\u2019ll wonder how you ever played without a companion app!\nHidden Armada are an indie studio with 3 founders specialising in art, code, and design, with a whole host of other talents. (kind of a requirement in a team of 3!)\nWe have worked with each other in the past which has allowed us to make great strides in a short time, and we also have industry experience on our side.\n                         As you've no doubt seen in the sidebar, we have some positively priceless pirate prizes to plunder!\nWe'd like to thank our friends at Lefay Engraving for allowing us to offer you lucky backers a chance at these gorgeous custom engraved glasses! They're limited so grab them while you can!\nWe\u2019re asking for [\u00a325000 / $40600 / \u20ac31400] to fund the development of Mutiny.\nWe have ambitious goals in delivering this game, as we want it to look as good as any \u2018big\u2019 studio title, and the technology will allow us to do things with local multiplayer that have never been done before. Our expenses are minimal: food, shelter, internet... that\u2019s about it! All the funds that get to us translate directly into time spent on building the game, where we need it most.\nSubject to change depending on how the campaign goes, but this is what we\u2019re aiming for.\nDo people still even write these sections?? Because Kickstarter is freaking amazing, that\u2019s why! \nBringing Mutiny to Kickstarter has been the plan since day 1, as we always knew we couldn\u2019t do this alone. Hidden Armada have so far been completely self-funded, living off our own small savings, and as great as living the indie dream is, its also pretty hard watching our savings dwindle down to nothing. We have resisted hooking up with publishers so far, because we would rather deliver something directly to you, the players, and get your feedback about what you\u2019d like to see. We NEED funds in order to continue developing, but we WANT the contact with backers, in order to make the game the best it can be, to the people who care the most about it, and for that Kickstarter is unrivalled.\nWe 3 at Hidden Armada worked together in the past, and have been itching to combine our powers again for some time. Now we\u2019ve taken the plunge and formed our own studio, we\u2019ve spent the last 9 months building up a solid core for the game to demo, and making sure the tech was viable, because we didn't want you to be backing pure hopes and dreams, we wanted you to believe in the game, we wanted you to believe in US, and now we\u2019re here, doing this, we hope you\u2019re convinced of our skill and commitment to deliver.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first game we\u2019ve made together in company of our own and we want to make as big a splash as we can. We have 12 years combined industry experience, and are used to working to deadlines. We have a highly skilled team that\u2019s itching for the chance to deliver the first of what we hope to be many amazing games.\n\nWe\u2019ve deliberately focused on the core gameplay of Mutiny first, to be playable as soon as possible, and tested the tech for Mutiny Mobile so we know our plans are within scope. The budget accounts for reward fulfillment and shipping a solid game, although if we get overfunded this may have some impact on delivery date of the finished game.\n\nBut as many of you no doubt know, making games is a risky business, and we\u2019ve seen it first hand from our time in the industry. New, exciting ideas come up, existing features take longer to complete than expected, people get sick (which in a tiny indie team can mean going without an entire department), and ultimately release dates can slip. Luckily, we\u2019ve been through the mill and we\u2019re pretty good at factoring in contingency time to our estimates, and we know how to manage our priorities when it comes to feature creep. \n\nThe biggest risk we face as a studio is lack of EXPOSURE. As a small team we have limited reach in terms of people we know, as a young studio we haven\u2019t had time to get a following already, and we aren\u2019t trading on past successes. This Kickstarter is the first time we\u2019ve really tried to push Mutiny out there, and we\u2019d be hugely appreciative if you could help us overcome this by sharing the page with others, regardless of whether you back us or not.\n\nWe believe Mutiny is an amazing game in its own right, the device sync technology could be a key step in the future of mobile gaming, and that these risks are nothing in the face of what we could achieve with your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Hidden Armada\nFirst created \u00b7 17 backed\nHidden Armada is a small games studio based in Scotland.

We are really trying to write a love letter to the Fighting Game Community with this game.\nWithin features a groundbreaking character customization system inspired by games such as Magic:The Gathering which uses Trading Cards to alter characters and attacks.\nDon't just pick your character. Build your deck.\nIt's not just a matter of which character will you pick, what your match ups are and what is your play style. \nThe same character with two different deck of cards can play radically different. \nWill you build an all-out offensive deck that relies on hitting that long, damaging combo or will you build a turtle deck that grants your character extra health, armor and invincibility to attacks?\nThe Emotion System.\nThere are five type of emotions in Within. Each character in Within has one or more emotions attached to them. \nThe emotions are:\nSorrow\nAnger\nFear\nPride\nHope\nA character can use cards that require the same kind of emotion he generates or neutral cards (gray).\nDuring a match, a character can generate Emotion Points by hitting the opponent.\nEach character has a maximum amount of Emotion Points that it can have at the same time during a match.\nThere are three types of cards in Within:\nCharacter Boosters\nAttack Boosters\nInstant Attack Boosters\nCharacter Boosters and Attack Boosters subtract their cost from the maximum number of Emotion Points a character can have at the same time.\n\nInstant Attack Boosters require Emotion Points generated during a match and they can be activated at will by the player.\nCharacter Boosters\nCharacter Boosters are cards that alter the properties of your character for the whole duration of a match. They are always active and their cost is subtracted from the maximum amount of Emotion Points that your character can have at the same time during a match.\nEndurance grants 10% more Health. Military Training grants 3% increased damage.\nCharacter Boosters can alter:\nGlobal Damage\nDamage Scaling\nHealth\nNormal/Special/Super Damage\nThrow Damage\nDamage Reduction\nMovement Speed\nDash Length\nChip Damage\nMeter Gain Increase\nStarting Emotion Points\nCost of Instant Attack Boosters\nEffects of Instant Attack Boosters\nand more....\nAttack Boosters and Instant Attack Boosters\nAttack Boosters and Instant Attack Boosters are cards that alter the properties of an attack. Attack Boosters and Instant Attack Boosters can be assigned to any attack a character has.\nIrish Strength grants super-armour for 6 frames. From Another Angle Makes an attack cancelable into any Normal Attack.\nAttack Boosters are automatically activated as soon as the corresponding attack starts and their cost is subtracted from the maximum amount of Emotion Points that your character can have at the same time during a match.\nAn Attack Booster has been assigned to Low Fierce and makes it super armored.\nInstant Attack Boosters are activated at will by the player while the corresponding attack is active. They subract their cost from the current amount of Emotion Points that the character has.\nAn Instant Attack Booster is used to cancel Fierce into Roundhouse and continue the blockstring.\nAttack Boosters and Instant Attack Boosters can alter:\nDamage\nDamage Scaling\nDamage Scaling Reset\nNormal/Special/Super/Dash/Jump Cancelability\nMeter Gain\nAdd Wallbounce / Ground Bounce\nLife Steal\nHeal\nArmor / Super Armor\nInvincibility\nPushback\nJuggling Cost\nJuggling Points Reset\nProjectile Breaking\nand more....\nSupers & Meter Management\nSupers, which will be cinematic, devastating attacks, will also cost Emotion Points. \nThis forces the player to find the proper balance with Character Boosters, Attack Boosters and the amount of Emotion Points he can generate during a match for Instant Attack Boosters and Supers.\nPotentially, a player can lock himself out of using Supers and Instant Attack Boosters to favor a strategy that uses more flat bonuses provided by Character Boosters and Attack Boosters or do the opposite and use Instant Attack Boosters more frequently and in chain with one another or just use his super more frequently.\nWithin was born on tablet and was built around a revolutionary control system that it's both powerful and precise.\nMovement, Normal Attacks, Specials and Supers are done with one, two or three finger taps or gestures while always retaining the precision of a button.\nSet in present time, Within follows the story of many troubled and deep characters on a quest for personal rebirth and redemption. \nAt the beginning of their quest, the characters are at the lowest point in their lives. Broken, on the verge of suicide, they get approached by mysterious individuals who, willingly or unwillingly, give them tattoos.\nThese tattoos say something about these characters that nobody else knows, revealing secrets and casting light on shadows of their past. These tattoos also unleash the power of their souls, granting them extraordinary abilities.\nAlice is gonna be the main villain for Season 01\nThe story will be told in an episodic form that will debut with the Pilot Episode that will ship with the game. Each episode will focus on one or more character as a story of pain, conspiracy and redemption unravels before your eyes.\nWe think fighting games are ready to move beyond stereotypical characters and tackle more mature subjects. Our dream is for players to choose their character based on their story and not their ranking on a tier list.\nLiam's tattoo reveals a dark past.\nThe game will ship with 8 characters, with more coming after the release of the game. We want each character to have a meaningful place in the story as well as carry a very strong theme and moral lesson.\nStay tuned for character bios\nLiam O'Brennan: May 20th\nAlexandra: May 22th\nAlice: May 27th\n????: May 29th\nWithin is a very innovative game. It brings the depth of a competitive fighting game to a platform mostly known for casual games. It adds a new layer of strategy on top of a very established genre by introducing character customization.\nWe think we succeeded in creating a competitive fighter, now we want to prove it. Everybody will be able to experience Within for free at the pace that they want. \nCharacter and Cards will be obtainable in-game without requiring any real money or they can be obtained right away with a small amount of money.\nNot pay to win.\nThe Character Customization System was designed around the idea that even if you have a better deck than your opponent on paper, you still have to fight your way to the victory. \nCharacter Cards and Attack Boosters are designed in a way that rewards the player only if he manages to hit his opponent. \nCards are designed to add a new layer of strategy to the game, without lowering the skill requirements of the game.\nWithin has been in development for a year and a half and it has been completely self-funded. We spent this time creating the engine and the tools needed to easily develop the rest of the game.\nSo much has already been done, now it's time to fill the game with more characters, cards and stages.\nThe hardest part of development is behind us but we need your help to finish what we started.\nA small indie studio.\nSo far Within has been funded out of our own pockets. We were forced to work on other projects as well to keep development going. Now it's time for us to take the project to the next level and ship it the way we imagined it.\nOur goal is relatively small but at the same time it represents the future of the project. \nWe need to succeed to ship the game, there's no way around it. Within is in many ways a labour of love. A love letter to the Fighting Game Community. Don't let it go unheard.\nWe tailored rewards to be a great head start into the game.\nGet every launch character for cheap or access to the beta right away.\nDo you feel like we missed something? Let us know!\niOS and Android Beta\nDue to the limitations by Apple on the number of devices that can access the Beta, we can only allow 60 people from Kickstarter into the iOS Closed Beta. \nOn the other hand, Android is a weird and diverse place where anything goes, so we'll try to allow as many people as possible into the Android Beta. \nThe natural evolution for this project would be a PC & Mac Version.\nWe'd absolutely love to bring Within to these and other platforms but we think that the mobile version has to happen first. \nIf we'll approach our goal of 28.000$ we'll announce more stretch goals, including a PC and Mac version.\nAbout Us\nWe are an independent game development studio based in Ravenna, Italy. We are a passionate group of independent professionals, talented newcomers and experienced individuals from all over the world, carefully put together to create the best products possible.\nSix people are currently working on the project and the game has the support of a number of professional fighting game players and members of the Fighting Game Community.\nThe Team\nGian Paolo Vernocchi - Creative Director & Co-Founder\nSimone Daminato - Technical Director & Co-Founder\nFrancisco Rico Torres - Concept Artist\nDmitriy Rabochiy - 3D Character Artist\nMark Ahyee - Environment Artist\nSimone Cicconi - Composer & Sound Designer\nWe also have the assistance of a great publisher on our side to help us with feedback, testing, and multi-platform releases.

They all have a special ability and they will provide you the Coinz you need to keep your business going.\nYou will have to hire your own Staff in order to compose a solid Team. Staff Cards represent the people you can hire in your Team in order to complete your game. There are four Skills they can master: Game Design(GD), Art(ART), Programming(CODE) and Marketing(MKT). The sum of these Skills allows your studio to complete Features and develop a game. Some Staff cards might also have special abilities that you can use in your advantage.\nBusiness Development is something crucial if you want to be able to release your game, learn how to use your assets properly and how to manage your studio.

Here is the story\u2026\nBack in march when the campaign was close to its end we have been approached by a German publisher, probably one of the biggest and most important publishers in the tabletop games industry worldwide (we can\u2019t name it for legal reasons but most of you would know them for sure), and they were interested in the exclusive rights of distribution in Germany. At that time we told them that we didn\u2019t define any distribution terms yet, but it was something we could have talked about as soon as the campaign was over; we then sent them an Exclusive Prototype and we agreed to get back in touch in a couple of weeks.\nI don\u2019t know what happened but at the end of the campaign they mailed us very excited and they even raised their offer: they told us they loved the game and they were interested in the worldwide rights for publishing and distribution. Wow we said, isn\u2019t that awesome?! It\u2019s just like a dream come true for a startup! Well, is wasn\u2019t that much of a dream but we didn\u2019t know it yet, and from that moment on we started one of the longest mails exchange I ever had in my life! At the beginning they told us they loved the game but there were a few details they wanted to change in order to improve the game. \u201cOk!\u201d we said, \u201cwe can do it!\u201d. Then they started to ask for more features and mechanics to be added to the game, they told us they knew the market and it was for the better! We were not very happy with it, but \u201cif they say so, yeah we could probably trust them\u201d. It was just the beginning of the end since they soon asked us to add new card types and to basically redesign the game around their guidelines. We tried to do it, but Game Developerz was no longer the same game. At that point we realized what was going on and we denied the offer concluding the deal before it was too late. We suspect that they were basically trying to change the game in order to acquire rights on its ownership, so that if in the future the game would have sold they could have said that it would for sure have been thanks to their improvements. Such a thing would not have been respectful towards our backers nor the game itself! All this thing got us stuck into it and took about a good 2 months and half of our working time and life.\nOf course it was not something we could have shared with you at the beginning, we got mailed by several companies and people and we couldn\u2019t update you on everything without bothering you to death! Nor it was something we could have shared along the way, as we had an NDA with that company; and by the way sharing such things is not something you want to do in general, until a deal is officially signed."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "THE LONG AWAITED UPDATE!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nour minions are now working very hard for all of you!\nWe recently created what we called The Backers' Den, a page on our website created for you to download the digital versions of your rewards. \nYou can find The Backer's Den here: http://www.gamedeveloperz.com/#!backers-den/c9pj"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "The Backers' Den", "update_content": "Hi guys!\nWe are writing today to thank you all and to share with you what's coming up next with Game Developerz.\nThis weekend we were attending to a games fair in Italy and we had the chance to meet with some backers, some fans and some publishers and distributors as well.

We were so incredibly inspired by the atmosphere, tools, and assets available to us that we just had to continue the momentum and finish what we started. We want our game to inspire folks to learn more about science, space, and engineering and most importantly, have fun doing so!\nThe B.R.O.V.E.R team is a diverse group united by our passion for this game:\nAngelo Yazar - Programmer/Game Developer\nLita Yazar - Game Developer\nYekta Yazar - Game Designer\nJose Mayo - 3D Modeler\nChelsea Barackman - Game Producer, Aerospace Engineer\nNick Dominikovic - Consultant, Aerospace Engineer\n\nUnique game play: B.R.O.V.E.R is a physics-based space simulation puzzle game where you plan and execute a mission to accomplish the level requirements .  You design and build a rover part-by-part and program its movements but remember, your field of view and actions available are determined by what you place on your Rover.   \nDesign Rover\nChoose parts that together would fulfill the requirements.  You pick the parts, you pick the placement. It\u2019s all completely personalized. Some example parts to choose from:\n                         - Power Subsystem (Solar Panels & Batteries) \n                         - Communications Subsystem\n                         - Command & Data Handling Subsystem\n                         - Scientific Instruments Payload              \nView of the Rover Design Lab from the prototype\nDeploy Rover\nProgram rover: plan sampling and movement while keeping an eye on your energy budget.

If the rover encounters a problem, attempt to find a way out of your situation using only the parts and instruments you included during design. For example: if you have a sample collector you can test the soil and send that data back to earth. Unless you didn't add a solar panel and run out of power...\n\nView of Mission Control from the prototype\n\nBack to the drawing board.\nAs you execute your mission, you will encounter critical mission events that will force you to adapt, reassess, and change the approach or scrap the mission entirely. \n\nWe tried to model the game play after the engineering iterative process.  Learn and understand how real engineers design and solve the tough problems in space exploration and maybe even help them in turn!\n\nIn our current prototype, players can build their own custom rovers and deploy them to the moon. Once on the moon you can issue short programs to the rover, and use the data streaming from the rover to navigate the lunar surface.\nWhile the demo is playable there is still a lot needed in order to make a complete game.

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

We'll only be displaying the latest updates here.\nFOR OUR NEW BACKERS: Early on in the campaign we changed the prizes so that anyone who pledges $50 and up will receive all three parts of the trilogy: the full game! It's our thanks for helping us achieve our goal so quickly.\nApril 20th, 4 hours left in the campaign: KABOOM. 700%. You did it. We didn't believe it could be done. We are in awe. Keep an eye out, we'll be sending out an update when the campaign officially ends exclusive to our incredible backers!\nIn the last three days of the campaign, we've put together a final video with a some pretty important news... plus we're hiring! Please take a look and get the full description in Update #9.\n\n\"The Banner Saga looks to take everything that was great about the heyday of animated motion pictures and crams it into a strategy game that looks almost too good to be true.\" - Gamezebo\n\"...the art speaks for itself. The developers describe it as \"painstakingly hand-animated,\" and it shows. The colors are lush, and the stylized scenes and characters as crisp and vivid as in any animated film, perhaps more so.\" - Kotaku\n\"It's a beautifully hand-drawn, animated adventure with turn-based tactical strategy set in a post-apocalyptic Viking world. If you didn't start throwing your money at the screen six words into that last sentence, then you're either completely dead inside, or else you enjoy things that are different from the things that I enjoy, in which case you are dead to me.\" - Cracked\n\"We got a few glimpses of that hand drawn artwork when the Banner Saga site went live recently, but it looks even better in motion. The turn based combat in particular looks livelier for that hand-drawn touch. Lovely stuff.\" - PC Gamer\nWHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT BANNERS AND SAGAS?\nThe Banner Saga is a role-playing game merged with turn-based strategy, wrapped into an adventure mini-series about vikings.\nTravel through stunning landscapes straight out of an animated film. Battle painstakingly hand-animated foes in strategic, turn-based combat harkening back to the classic \"Tactics\" days of gaming. Make decisions with consequences in conversations with people you'll truly care about.\nAnd throughout the whole thing record the history of your people on your banner where it will be remembered, because soon there might not be anything left.\nThe Banner Saga is a mature game aimed at gamers who appreciate art, story and strategy.\n\nTHE GAME\nOur first priority has always been to make a role-playing game that feels and looks fresh, and plays like the classic tactical strategy games of our childhood. It's not about defeating the villain and saving the day. It's not about grinding to get past the next fight. The Banner Saga throws you into the end of the world and asks \"how do you deal with this\"?\nDRM-Free, and available on PC and Mac\nNot another generic fantasy: Drawing heavily from Norse culture while creating its own identity and mythology, The Banner Saga takes a low-fantasy approach to viking themes. Giants: yes. Horned helmets: no.\nStrategic combat: Recruit a large roster of unique characters throughout the story, each with different abilities that interact in combat in a deeply tactical way and personalities of their own. The Banner Saga harkens back to classic turn-based gameplay with a strong emphasis on tactics over brute force and endless grinding.\nTravel across gorgeous landscapes: The choices you make as events arise have a huge affect on how the story plays out- who survives, who dies, and what's worth saving. Add people to your caravan as you travel, or lose them when tough decisions arise. You're not just fighting to save nameless strangers, you're fighting for your neighbors, your family and your way of life. We want you to care what happens to them.\nAn emphasis on story: Your choices in dialogue and throughout the game truly affect the story and the people around you. A mature story for adults means forming relationships and making tough decisions; not sex, violence and swearing.\nPlay online: Though the single-player campaign is our focus, The Banner Saga provides a deep multiplayer game; build a unique party of characters and battle friends and enemies in multiplayer combat. Upgrade your party over time and devise new strategies.\nRisk in gameplay: A lot of modern games play it safe- you know you'll defeat the evil and save the day. In The Banner Saga you can't take anything for granted. We want it to feel like a good tv mini-series; the world doesn't revolve around you, it's about how you deal with change.\nWhat does \"Chapter 1\" of the full game mean? We've added an explanation in the faq below.\nDON'T YOU NEED MILLIONS TO MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS?\nWith 30 years experience between us in the games industry, and after working as leads on The Old Republic; one of the biggest projects in gaming history, we know what it takes to make a top-tier game.\nWhen we decided to go independent we knew it would mean making some hard compromises, but it was never our goal to make something small and casual. We designed a game that, at its very minimum, would cost us $100,000 while still focusing on our top priorities - story and strategic combat - at the highest possible level of quality.\nOur promise to you is that all the support we receive goes right back into the game to make it the best it can be. Your donations don't just let us tack on more stuff, they let us return to the full scope of the game we've always wanted to make.\nAdditional funding allows us to give you:\nA bigger, richer world. More characters in combat, more animation, more diverse landscapes, more music, engaging animated cutscenes, and more multiplayer options. We have a huge story we want to tell and this will let us deliver it in the most compelling, meaningful way.\nPorting to more devices. Our first release will be on PC and Mac, but funding would allow us to convert the game to iOS, the Kindle Fire, consoles like XBLA and PSN and maybe even portable gaming devices like the Vita.\nLocalization (translation) in more places. Viking culture is huge in Europe and turn based strategy is big in Japan. We'd love to bring The Banner Saga to both of those places and anywhere else we find significant interest.\nThe game the way we think it should be. By crowdfunding this project we won't be tied to publishers telling us to change the giants to orcs or dumbing the story down for children. We think this means a better game for everyone.\n\nBEHOLD, THE PRIZES\nWe're absolutely over the moon to be able to offer prizes not just for a game, but as an art project. Scroll down to see everything we have to offer!\nThe Wallpaper\nA sleek, stylized background for any size computer or portable device. Get it with or without the game logo. Obviously we can't show it here, but it's exclusive to Kickstarter backers and never seen before.\n\nThe Guild Crest\nThis is your chance to get in the game. In both single player and multiplayer, when the player starts the game they choose a crest to represent their family or guild. We'll give you a template, and you give us whatever symbol you want to see in the game. It could be your family crest, your guild emblem, or a drawing of your dog. It's not just for you, though; everyone who plays the game will be able to see your design. If you donate at this level be sure to check out the FAQ for some simple guidelines. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Game Poster\nA full-sized 24 x 36 inch movie-style poster featuring official artwork for the game and featured on the cover of Indie Game Magazine. Each poster is personally signed by the team at Stoic! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe T-shirt\nA t-shirt designed exclusively for the Kickstarter campaign and only for backers. Carved into the horn is the history of the world. Once the campaign is over they'll never be seen again! We'll be making the t-shirt available in all the major sizes (s, m, l, xl and xxl) and both genders. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Button\nAll prizes at the $80 and up level come with a free pin based on the brooch worn by a key character the game, which can be seen in the animation cel below. Use it to hold together your sheep-skin cloak in the icy winds! Show off your viking spirit in public! Or whatever! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Score (Special music promotion)\nAustin Wintory, composer of the hit game \"Journey\", will be providing limited edition physical copies of the soundtrack, hand-signed by the composer himself. Different from the official soundtrack, once the campaign ends these special edition CDs won't be available again. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\nThe Animation Cel\nThis is a throwback to the golden age of animation. A cel is a single frame of animation on a transparent sheet that is laid on top of a painted image. If you're a huge classic animation nerd like we are, you can own a signed and numbered 8.5 x 14 inch animation cel from the game the way they used to do it in the good old days of Disney and Don Bluth. Includes all previous rewards. Pick one of two pivotal characters below:\n\nThe Signature (Special music promotion)\nGet an autographed copy of the performance parts from the recording sessions; the SHEET MUSIC used by the actual musicians who play on the score. Needless to say, this prize will be a limited run. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score for the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Landscape\nWe're thrilled to offer our take on works of art inspired by the incredible paintings of the American master Eyvind Earle. This is an image that defines The Banner Saga's art style. Get this framed 36 x 12 inch lithograph with no logos, no gimmicks, signed and numbered by the artist in limited supply. Your friends won't even know it's from a game unless you decide to tell them. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Relic\nImmortalize something meaningful to you in The Banner Saga that other players will find on their own adventures. Send us a photo of your own heirloom, memento or just something you'd like to show your friends and we'll turn it into a relic of value and power. We'll work with you to come up with a unique name and description that could include anything from a mysterious inscription to giving off a certain aura. You'll personalize it and make a coveted piece of gameplay by choosing from a list of rarities and in-game bonuses it provides. Doesn't look very viking-themed you say? That's ok, the marketplaces trade in items pillaged from all over the world. Check the FAQ for more info. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Shadowbox\nWe'll be creating a piece of art with true depth that replicates the way the game parallaxes and overlaps. It comes in a 2-inch deep glass-paned frame at a hefty 20 x 16 inches. Below is an example image by the artist who will be creating the shadowbox (not the actual image!). Rest assured that we'll be doing something special for this piece. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Transcendence\nBECOME A VIKING GOD in the game itself. The gods may be dead but that doesn't mean they're not an important part of The Banner Saga. We'll work with you to create a unique deity with your likeness which will be seen all over the game in various forms of effigy and as an integral part of the lore, all in strong Norse themes. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Performance (Special music promotion)\nYou are invited to personally ATTEND the music's recording sessions in Los Angeles or elsewhere later this year. This will include a day of hanging out with all of us at the recording studio, and lunch (on us). You will also receive a signed, leather-bound book compiling all of the game's music (produced as a one-off and therefore never commercially for sale) and earn a Music Associate Producer credit in the game and on the album. Not enough? Austin will personally compose an original 30-second ringtone, just for you! As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game recorded in a live studio! Please note: this is a special case prize. While it does include the signed CD and the sheet music, it does not include any of the previous rewards. This one's for serious music fans. You must be able to travel to the Los Angeles area or elsewhere. If you're interested in this prize you must contact us to make arrangements before the end of the Kickstarter campaign: stoic@stoicstudio.com.\n\nThe Motion Shoot\nCome on over to our high-tech motion capture studio and we'll put YOU (yes, physically you) in the game, doing an animation for an attack or special skill. Think you'll look silly? Don't worry, by the time we're done you'll look a bad-ass viking warrior. After the shoot we'll take you out to lunch and chat about the game. Male or female, no problem; we've got plenty of characters to choose from. We can honestly say there will probably never be another chance like this. Must live locally or be able to travel to the Austin, TX area. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Executive\nWe have so many prizes now we had to compile them all into one final, huge mega-prize. The Executive gives you every prize we have to offer (except for the rotoscope shoot), including the viking god and attending the recording session. On top of that, you will be given an Executive Music Producer credit in the game and on the album. Lastly, receive a framed copy of the Banner Saga main theme, each note inscribed by hand by Austin Wintory, who will also be kind enough to sign his work. Has anything like this even been done before? Please contact us before donating at this tier.\n\nAnything else?\nThat's not enough? If you have any questions about the prizes or are interested in making some kind of arrangements for a private donation, please feel free to contact us at stoic@stoicstudio.com\n\nWHO ARE YOU, TO PROMISE SUCH THINGS?\nStoic is made up of three industry veterans with over a decade of experience each, and from all walks of development. We're overwhelmingly confident that, with your help, we can create something meaningful and beautiful.\nArnie Jorgensen started off working on comics such as Justice League America for DC. Eventually he got into games, putting his abilities to work on Star Wars: Galaxies and The Old Republic as the lead concept artist. Now instead of making art just for concepts it goes right into the game.\nAlex Thomas got into the industry early and has done everything from 3D characters and environments to 2D animation, illustration, screenplay writing, game design and cinematics for games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Shadowbane.\nJohn Watson has been programming since he was 6. After doing some work on the Hubble at NASA he decided to apply his vast abilities in the games industry, eventually bringing his experience as lead combat programmer on The Old Republic to Stoic.\nTHANK YOU\nWe're honored and humbled to have this opportunity, and we're beyond lucky to be in this position at this time. We'll do everything we can to make the kind of game that we're proud of sharing and talking about with gamers and, hopefully, create something that's meaningful to you. We're in this for the long haul. Keep in touch with us at thebannersaga.com or write to us directly at stoic@stoicstudio.com.\nAnd of course, a huge thanks to our families and friends who have supported us every step of the way.

Auditorium 2: Duet is the sequel to Auditorium, the award-winning game that launched our company. If you're not familiar with Cipher Prime or our first game, play the original Auditorium demo, watch some gameplay videos, or check it out on Steam!\nDuet will build faithfully on all the essential elements of the beloved original; players will still be creating music by bending dazzling rivers of light and color through brain-twisting puzzles. But it\u2019s also going to be so much more. The last time around we invited you into our Auditorium. Now we want you all to come back and play together!\nSo What's the Sequel All About?\nMore Cooperation!\nAuditorium 2: Duet will be a cooperative experience. To solve puzzles, you will need to coordinate with a partner to guide luminous motes to their proper destinations. \nThere will still be a single player mode, but the magic will take place in cooperative mode. \nIt\u2019s going to be a thoughtful and intense experience where you must lean on each other\u2019s intuition and planning to create a vividly pulsing colorscape. You\u2019ll work together to overcome all the challenges we throw at you.\nNew Geometry & Controls!\nAuditorium 2: Duet will feature multiple interactive playing fields. The addition of a partner is going to be accompanied by an expansion of the game space, meaning several interlinked playing fields. You control your own field, but your actions will affect your partner\u2019s display. The real heart of the game will be found in managing these interactions harmoniously.\nNetworked Play!\nAuditorium 2: Duet will allow for local and networked play. Aside from a separate single player campaign, we want you to be able to play locally with other people on the same network, as well as over the internet with friends from all over the world!\nHow Are You Going to Make the Game? \nAuditorium was originally built in Flash, and was meant to be played in a web browser. This was awesome for getting lots of people everywhere to play our game, but Flash comes with its own set of performance limitations.\nAuditorium Duet is going to be designed from the ground up as a standalone PC/Mac game, and we're building it with a powerful development tool called Unity. Rolling out a robust multiplayer game is going to take a lot of time and effort, and it\u2019s more ambitious than any project we\u2019ve worked on before. Where we go from there will depend on the game's final hardware requirements, the ease and speed with which we can make the game playable on other platforms, and user interest.\nWhat Do You Need?\nWe are asking for $60,000, which will start a development period for Auditorium 2: Duet that will take a minimum of six months.\nThis will allow our studio of four people to work day and night on Auditorium 2: Duet for three to four months. If we can get that, we can cover the remainder of the development costs. We are jack-of-all-trades developers. We have to juggle marketing, accounting, legal issues, and customer support. If we're still awake afterward, we get to make games. That's all we really want to do--make awesome games for you. \nA successful Kickstarter will primarily help us cover development of the game and overhead expenses for the company. This is our first multiplayer game, meaning there will be more complex development and testing than usual. We'll need the proper hardware, software tools, and software licenses necessary to make sure that the game looks and sounds incredible, and runs smoothly on different machines.\nDonations will also help cover the sundry costs of running a company. We normally do all the design and music for our games in house, but being able to hire outside expertise if needed will free up our resources and really jumpstart the development process. \nWe are essentially asking for our fans and backers to give us the opportunity to focus entirely on a game that we all want, without needing to worry about whether our company can stay afloat. Anything we get above our target will go right back into the game--more game depth, more platforms, more creative flourishes.\nHow This Kickstarter Makes Duet Possible\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Kickstarter, this website is a fundraising platform for creative projects. Developers describe what they want to create, set a monetary goal, decide on a deadline for the fundraiser, and offer rewards for certain levels of donations. No money is actually transferred unless the monetary goal is met and the fundraising period has ended.\nWe are a small independent game company. The only reason we exist today is because when we were developing Auditorium, we put a Donations button on our website, and people were generous enough to support it.\nAfter Auditorium, we relied on publishers' advances and contract work to keep the company running. We also made Pulse and Fractal, but it's been a rocky road, especially without guaranteed income. But we know we can be doing so much more for our fans. This time we want to cut out the middlemen and take the development process straight from the fans to our company and back. \nThank You Everyone!\nAuditorium 2: Duet is a dream game for us, and we hope that our past record of polish and creativity in games gives you reason to believe in its potential as well. We want to throw everything we have into this game, but we need this Kickstarter to ensure that we can keep everything together in the process.\nFinally, we just want to thank all the Cipher Prime fans, both present and future. Whether or not this Kickstarter pans out, just know that your support and your kind words over the past few years have really made running this company an incredible experience for us. We know you all will keep being awesome, and you can be sure we'll keep making games!\nBut it would be totally awesome if Kickstarter started this party, so be sure talk about Auditorium Duet! Tell your friends about it! Tweet! Update your Facebook status! Sing from the rooftops! Every word helps us out more than you can imagine. We love you!\nAnd because we think that Brian Fargo's Kicking It Forward movement is awesome idea, we want to make the Kicking It Forward pledge! We solemnly pledge 5% of the profits from the finished product back to the Kickstarter community to help fund other people's dreams!

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

We have reached our goal!\nWe still have hours left and extra pre-orders and pledges help a ton since we are putting $5k personally on top of what we reached to get this game manufactured and shipped to the shores of California! So every little boost will help! By no means do you need to shout upon mountaintops any longer but a celebratory gesture and aquiet murmur into a friend's ear is always encouraged! ~ Shelby & Kenny\nThe Story\nIn the far future while the known empires attempt universal dominance, a pyramid craft that can tilt the scales of power has emerged: the Zoneplex! As a group of warrior monks, you must battle otherworldly creatures while exploring a highly advanced mystic pyramid at the edge of space and time. Face your fears and collect the essence of the Zoneplex's energy while controlling key zones within the structure to become worthy of controlling the Zoneplex itself! This adventure will take tactics, guile, The Fates and perhaps even deceit to emerge victorious.\n\nReal Quick... How does it work?!\nYou know that one about \"How many warrior monks does it take to control an alien pyramid?\"!?!?!\nIn Zoneplex, each player is a warrior monk vying control of the Zoneplex pyramid. The monks strategically explore the Zoneplex and encounter monsters, known as \u201cFears\u201d, which they need to capture in order to be worthy to enter The Eye or survive the cataclysm when final scoring occurs. Players must also place spirit stones in spirit chambers to maintain Influence in the Zoneplex. Additionally Players receive Relic cards after defeating Fears or entering Reliquaries which give them an upper hand.\n\"It takes only 1!\"\nAt the end of the game the player with the most influence points wins.\nThe game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.\nIn phase 1 players strategically lay 1-3 tiles and move 1-3 spaces during their turn determined by drawing an Action Card. Players build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid while being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins since these cards determine which Zones give the player bonus influence points. \n(sacred symbol cards)\nWhile building strategically, players also confront creatures (which lie in the Action Card deck) within the pyramid that they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye (top tile of the pyramid - the apex) and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board in a Spirit Chamber tile (see tile below). They gain bonus Influence by placing Spirit Stones on their Sacred Symbol which is determined by their Sacred Symbol Card. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed (sacrificed) to gain bonuses in combat. \nInfluence points are not static as they move up and down determined by how many Spirit Stones a player has on the board. So the game is about managing risk while maintaining control.\nIn phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter \"The Eye of The Zoneplex\" to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.\nRulebook\n\nDownload The Rulebook (this file will be updated as we make edits, etc...)\n\nZoneplex Rules Videos\nA summary of Zoneplex rules below...\n\nAn Extensive Walkthrough Of Zoneplex\n\nEvidence for the Zoneplex!\nTo be viewed here in \"Mysteries Of The Zoneplex\"...(Part 3 below.

It came to me after diving deep into the world of board games in order to combat the isolating and dark Nordic winter. It was one of my passions that took a pause the last decade while touring heavily in bands and focusing on sonic adventures. The culmination of my 1980s obsessions of devising my own AD&D adventures and a sketchbook filled with ideas finally came together during my gaming forays under the pale moon of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. I began by making modifications of Carcassonne and filling my mind with different games, but something else dawned on me.  I thought of Johannes Kepler\u2026 and his Mysterium Cosmographicum.  I started jotting down numbers, connecting lines, math and shapes\u2026 Before I knew it I had a rough idea of what would later become Zoneplex.\n\nAfter extensive game-testing the game began to grow tentacles. I knew I couldn't do this alone. Through a friend I met Kenny Jakobsson, a graduate in game design. He was willing undertake with me the daunting task of creating a game and system that worked and was ultimately really fun.\nMany influences came into play\u2014 wanting to make a game that brought together my favorite elements of the games I had been exploring such as a building/tile-laying mechanic from Carcassonne, a collaborative battle-system \u00e0 la Munchkin, a Dungeon Crawl that brings to mind the little-known Swedish game Drakborgen and a bit of area-control oddly akin to 1960: The Making of The President. All of this through a mash-up of German-style meets American-style board gaming that puts the human element at the forefront. In a way, it represents a microcosm of humanity itself: how we can throw anything for a loop with our strategies, alliances, jealousies and greed.\nVisually and thematically I wanted a game that didn't feel like any of the other games out there. I tapped the growing sci-fi universe of my electronic-music persona, Triobelisk, and the long-standing work-in-progress sci-fi novel that I have been collaborating on with my friend Gabriel Baldessin. Influences such as space-opera imagery akin to the epic novels of Iain M. Banks, Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune, Ancient Alien Theories and even Daft Punk came together. This was all thrown into a simmering cauldron with Alejandro Jodorowsky's L'Incal and H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s images of otherworldly abominations!\n\nFrom there I tapped Peter Lazarski, who had also worked on Wizards Of The Coast's AD&D Players Strategy Guide and Paizo's Bestiary 2. He completely understood where I was coming from and hopped on board with concept sketches of creatures while we were game-testing. I also contacted Niklas \u00c5kerblad, a friendly bearded gnome I met while in Sweden via my staunch gaming comrade Erik Sved\u00e4ng who made my Triobelisk iPad game last year. Niklas' art wowed me in his games Kometen (iOS) and Colloseum (X-Box) and I knew he was the one to be \"The Keeper of the Reliquary.\" He hopped aboard to illustrate that specific part of the game.\n\nAnd now the team is all in place! Zoneplex is on the verge of its own event horizon, existing as an actual board game! We pulled strings from photographer buddies and designers with nice black tables to put our video together, and we are finally here. It was incredible to watch beta-testers play it for the first time, enjoying it and interacting with each other. It was a completely different feeling from making a record.  It was like watching a creation\u2026 a system... a tiny world... a story\u2026 work on its own! It really felt like a moon-landing for Kenny and me. It's something I always wanted to delve into and I feel extremely lucky to have even gotten this far, along with friends new and old who helped make this happen. I dream to see stacks of our creation flood our living spaces like a tribble infestation. We have $5000 we are putting down on top of the goal of $12,000 we wish to reach and this is where you come in!\nWe've created a bunch of different packages that include lots of exclusive treasures and items that won't be available when the game is out in the retail wild. Every bit helps, and everybody that joins this adventure will have access to our Backers Only updates, including a .PDF of rules and updates on our progress as everything comes together. Thank you for coming this far!

Kickstarter will allow us to hire a proficient, dedicated, and passionate programmer to not only, help complete and maintain our vision, but to become part of a great team, well, at least we think so!\nFine Tuning. Lastly, the funds gained from our Kickstarter campaign will afford us time to refine our vision, from a delicious cake, to a decadent dessert. From so-so to SO-AWESOME!\nYour support boils down to these three points. We need money for a new graphical engine, a programmer to handle that engine and the time to refine everything. Tools, Labour and Time.\nThe Curse of Kullvaria is a twin stick, pirate themed shooter for the mobile platform. It stars none other than the infamous Captain Hugo \u2018Cannon\u2019 Tredder, a man on a mission to eradicate the plague of bad luck that has haunted him since childhood. His adventures will take him across the Lost Oceans, and through the mythical island of Kullvaria.\nVersion One will ship with the first Survival Mode mission, Assault on Tartarus, as well as 30+ Achievements and High Scores via Game Center. Subsiquent versions will introduce the Story Mode, which will take you along Hugo\u2019s adventures. Every Story Mode level will be accompanied by a Survival Mode level, for those High Score junkies! We know you are out there! Furthermore, after version one has shipped we will be adding more enemies, more weapons, more achievements, and, basically, more everything. And, for the stat tracking maniacs, Kullvaria will host a bevy of detailed statistics on everything from the number of shots fired, to your current kill count!\nAs the player, you will begin your journey under assault, on your ship, the Tartarus. Having just laid anchor outside the island, you must defend your crew and your ship from the Bramblemen, while your crew finishes preparing a skiff for your approach to Kullvaria.\nAfter landing on the islands Diamond Beaches you will slowly work your way through the island, following hints and clues that will eventually lead you to your treasure. You\u2019ll straggle through the Timber Shades, traverse the Shimmering Tarn, amble up the Tremor Cliffs, and delve in to the Void of Cinders to battle the islands mysterious overlord.\nCaptain Hugo \u2018Cannon\u2019 Tredder, is the son of the legendary pirate Lords, Isaac \u2018The Eye\u2019 and Katherine \u2018The Tankard\u2019 Tredder. Shortly after his birth, Hugo\u2019s grandfather, Alexander, was left to raise him and his brother Edmund after the mysterious disappearance of their parents. While his brother grew to be a wealthy Pirate Lord like his parents, Hugo\u2019s many adventures seemed only to be plagued with bad luck and misfortune.\nThrough his study and research of ancient lore he stumbled upon an abstract reference to a lost island and mysterious crystals. Following up on this fragment of information he pieced together a set of coordinates that would eventually lead him to the island of Kullvaria and ultimately to the loss of his original ship and crew. Even this folly, however, would not prove enough to deter him, he swore that he would make it back to Kullvaria, find the legendary crystals, and turn his luck around once and for all.\nKullvaria is defended by brainwashed servants that Hugo has dubbed, Bramblemen. There are currently 3 distinct classes of enemy and 5 unique types within our game. The cannon fodder of the Bramble bunch are known as Fledglings. The general utility class are referred to as Minions, and the aggressor class are known as Generals.\n\nThe Fledgling - Bomber love to blow things up. They will run toward Hugo until one of you has perished.  Kaboom!\nThe Fledgling - Spiker are almost like the Bombers, except they inflict lasting damage. Instead of exploding, they will continue to head toward you until they have pierced you with their spiked mask, and then continue to inflict damage for as long as they are around you.\nThe Minion - Spearman is a medium range enemy that is as agile with a spear as he is with his feet. Quick, light and deadly, the Spearmen don\u2019t know the meaning of quit! Whether this is due to their everlasting motivation or their lack of knowledge in the English language is anyone\u2019s guess!\n\nThe Minion - Dartman is a long range sniping unit. His propensity for aerodynamics and projectile weaponry is unmatched amongst the Bramblemen. While he might be slow to reload, his venomous darts are lightning fast!\nThe General - Bruiser is the tough man of the Bramblemen. His favourite past time is watching old boxing movies on laser disc. If you listen closely you can actually hear his Rocky impression from behind his mask!\nThe mighty Abaddon patrols the Kullvarian seas and defends the island against any and all intruders. Hidden under the sea, the Abaddon lies in wait, ready to ambush all who seek to take its masters treasure.\nOnce the great beast gets a hold of your ship with its immense writhing tentacles, there is little hope left for you and your crew. The only course of action one can take is to stand awe as its massive arms begin ripping apart your vessel from mast to stern, splintering any future you may have had.\nAnd if that were not enough, the voodoo-centric Bramblemen Shaman have wrangled the aquatic giant, with their corrupt magics, while the crafty Bramblemen Engineers have constructed a massive barge, square on its back, so that they may travel with, and aid in the final onslaught.\nKullvaria is an island of intrigue and mystery. Lost to the winds of time before man had even taken his first steps, the island is full of wonderous life forms treacherous territory. The Bramblemen, the islands inhabitants, have evolved independently from the rest of civilization. Initially taking on a simple communicative social structure, it wasn\u2019t long before a shadowy force imprinted itself on their minds, forcing them to abide to his will. Kullvaria is home to old secrets and ancient wisdom, impossibilities turn plausible and insanity becomes mundane.\nThe first version of our game will feature the \u2018Assault on Tartarus\u2019, the initial encounter with the islands inhabitants while laying anchor.\nSubsequent versions will take you through the aforementioned areas. The Diamond Beaches, The Timber Shades, The Shimmering Tarn, The Tremor Cliffs and finally The Void of Cinders.\nThe gameplay of Kullvaria consists of simple, tried and true, twin-stick control mechanisms. We feel that the iOS is ripe for a great dual-stick shooter. Battling the hordes of Bramblemen couldn\u2019t be simpler, as Hugo wields, Martha, his home-made mini-cannon. Built for rapid use and housing his super secret, trademarked, automatic reload chamber, Martha is a force to be reckoned with!  \nApart from Hugo\u2019s sweetheart, the Dartman wields his trusty blowpipe, while the Spearman attacks with, well, what else? His spear! You will find your fellow crewmen armed with an assortment of weapons, from the blind Guntar\u2019s walking cane, to the Chef\u2019s iron skillet! And lastly, as you face off against the ever increasing Bramblemen forces, you will notice that Hugo has equipped his lass with some impressive firepower. Three hand crafted iron cannons sit strategically placed on the decks of the Tartarus. Ready to defend and wreak havoc.\nIn future versions we have many plans to equip players with new and unique weapons, including a power-up mechanic that will let Hugo feel mighty and powerful!\nFinally we come to the most important part! The two folk that are trying to make the magic happen, and bring you guys the love of our life!\nWho are we? Just two guys really... Honestly, it is as simple as that! Raveen is the dark and dashing gentleman, and Michael is the fetchingly frosty lad! 24 and 26 respectively, our goal is to contribute our talent to the ever growing pool of incredible developers popping up on the App Store and the like.\nWe want to share our passion for great games with the whole community, and the best way we can think of to do that is to create games for you guys! But, we need help, as reluctant as we are to admit it, we can\u2019t do it all.\n\nYou are our bread and butter. Without you guys we have no reason to conjure creative magics for you to enjoy. Thank you sincerely, from the bottom of our hearts!\nBelow you will find a bunch of links to more of our Kullvarian works, like our YouTube channel that houses over 50 videos of gameplay tests, back when we were using the Unreal Engine, as well as animation tests by Raveen.\n\nYou will also find links to both Raveen's personal works as well as my own.

Focusing on a non-linear experience, we want the players to interact and play with the world as they like all while having fun.   Many tried and true aspects have been borrowed from other games, but in a combination that is unique.\nWe have set our goal at a minimum of $7500 to complete this project, however every dollar donated helps us create a richer experience. If the donations go above and beyond the minimum we are ready to offer these additions to the project.\n$10,000 - If we reach this goal, we will have the time and resources to port the game to the Mac OS X platform.  Also, everyone who would receives a copy of the game through the donations also will receive a unique dragon egg to raise as a pet!\n$12,500 - If we reach this generous goal, we will clean up and release our voxel modeling editor, completely free for use to the public.  The editor was originally created by us and used for all the models in the game.  Use the tool to make your own models for your own project or make custom models that you can use in game.\nThe World\nWe aim to provide a large and diverse world that is never the same twice.  Using randomly generated terrain, we will be able to provide a unique overworld, dungeons and towns that they player will be able to explore.  Certain events can at times cause the world to change and provide the player with a world that appears to actually be growing and changing around them.\nBuilding\nMuch like other well known sandbox-craft games, the terrain is something that is completely under your control.  With the aid of certain items you will be able to shape the world by digging, building and harvesting the terrain around you.  Many resources that you require come from the terrain so you will need to adventure and locate these resources.\nForging\nAs the game title suggests, forging items will be a large aspect of the game.  As the player adventures and collects resources they will be able to craft a large array of unique items and useful devices.  Most of what defines your character is what items they have, so it will be critical to discover and seek out the recipes and components.\nCombat\nWe aim to have the combat of the game resemble that of classic hack n' slash RPGs like Zelda: Link To The Past or Secret of Mana.  Equipped with a number of different weapons the player must carefully slash, block and cast spells in real time as your enemies encroach.  You will be able to acquire better weapons, equipment and abilities, yet the player's skill in combat will always be a large factor.\nMultiplayer\nForge Quest has been built from the ground up with the intention for allowing networked play.  You can always play through the game by yourself, however, we support and even encourage you to play along with your friends as you adventure in the world. Certain locations may even require a team of people to accomplish due to larger difficulties.\nArtistic Style\nWe want to provide a nostalgic feel of classic 8-Bit RPGs , while maintaining modern 3d graphics and quality. We express a lot of this style through the the voxelized 3D models and oversized pixel graphics in the user interface.\nPlatform\nThe game is primarily being developed for Windows based computers that can support OpenGL graphics of 2.1 with GLSL support of 1.2 and forward.  Our code base has been written abstractly to allow for porting to multiple platforms, but ports are beyond the initial scope of the project.\nScope\nIf the project is successfully funded we conservatively estimate the beta would be released two months after funding is received, and the full project would be completed six months after funding.  Even now we continue to work on the project and hope to release as much as we can as work progresses.\n\nWho Are We?\nThe core team consists of two people, David Fleig and Chase Grozdina.  We are both software developers by profession and each have a unique background of talents.\nChase Grozdina - Has worked as a software developer in the games industry, as well as acted as lead developer for in-house tools of a special effects company.  He brings a strong knowledge of game development concepts, engine development, user interaction as well as artistic talent to the project.\nDavid Fleig - Has been a professional software engineer and lead developer for enterprise corporations, as well as a professor of software engineering at Franklin University.  With strong analytical knowledge he brings a solid development understanding and management to the project.  His devotion to many classic table top games provides insight to many game design concepts.\n\nWhy We Need Your Help!\nDeveloping a game like this is not easy and comes with a large number of costs associated with it.  Your much needed donations will go to supporting a number of direct costs that we need to tackle as well as supporting our time and attention to the project. \nMusic & Sound - Although we both have a large number of talents, music is not one of them.  This means will need to look outside of our team for help in creating all of these assets.\nAdvertising & Distribution - Spreading the word about the game comes with its own set of costs.  Distributing the game, holding a community website as well as maintaining a server can also get expensive.  Allowing us to handle these costs means a greater community of people and a better player experience.\nTime & Attention - There is a large devotion of time required to complete this project, which regardless of what we want, is limited.  Maintaining a full time job and dealing with life can easily get in the way and even make a project impossible to complete.  Having donations to support the project gives us this freedom and flexibility to continue to work and focus our attention.\n\nRewards\nWe want to show the greatest appreciation for people who donate to this project and give them the ability to put their own mark on it.\nWe assume if you donate, you want a copy of the game to play.  So at the base level we will provide you with a full registered copy of the game once it's complete.\nFor people who want to have a more active role in the community, we provide a level above the base which will give them access when we begin our beta of the game as well as access to the beta forums on our website.  We value the community around such projects and want to keep the lines of communication open.\nFor people who donate above and beyond we want to give them an everlasting influence on the project, allowing them to actually provide direct input and help design parts of the game.  At these levels we will work with people directly and help them achieve their idea.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Forge Quest now on Steam Early Access", "update_content": "We just released a gameplay video that showcases the ice dungeon and few new features.

There's nothing more nostalgic than hearing the 8-bit tunes of your favorite childhood video games brought to life through lush, orchestral arrangements, as evidenced by the rising popularity of video game concerts like Video Games Live, Distant Worlds: music from Final Fantasy, and Play! A Video Game Symphony. But there's one video game series close to my heart that hasn't received enough recognition from these musical circles...\nThrough my project Pok\u00e9mon Reorchestrated, I've made it my duty to reinvent the music of the handheld Pok\u00e9mon RPG series in the style of traditional movie scores, making downloadable mp3 versions of my arrangements available to the public for free via my website and streaming them on YouTube for all Pok\u00e9mon fans to hear.\nNow I think it's finally time to tackle the soundtrack to the games that started it all: Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue Versions for the Game Boy. For the next few months, I'll be arranging every memorable Pok\u00e9mon theme on a journey from Route 1 to Indigo Plateau, and through the magic of highly-realistic, sampled orchestral instruments and the help of a few LIVE solo instrumentalists, a complete album of FREE, beautiful, cinematic arrangements called \"Kanto Symphony\" will emerge.\nHere's a teaser track of what's to come on the album--a haunting arrangement of the ghostly Lavender Town:\nWe will need some help. Any pledge you can make toward Kanto Symphony will go toward paying the incredibly talented live musicians I've assembled from around the world to be featured as a cohesive, human element on what might otherwise be an album based on \"replicated\" orchestral sounds.\nBut I'm not asking you to do it for free! Not only will you earn some awesome rewards (including bonus tracks, a physical copy of the album, plushies and trading cards from my personal collection), you will also be ensuring that Kanto Symphony will have some of the best talent in the Pok\u00e9mon fan community playing music on the album--wait, are you laughing? What, seriously! People often underestimate the epicness of the Pok\u00e9mon series and its music, and I'm here to show them otherwise!\nDon't believe me? Check out the rest of my YouTube channel for more music from Pok\u00e9mon Reorchestrated! And stay tuned to updates for more on Kanto Symphony's soloists. Let's show the world that Pok\u00e9mon's influence is here to stay. After all, it's more than just a franchise. It's a way of seeing the world through a lens of adventure, learning, and true friendship--something I feel many games fail to offer nowadays.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my project, watch my videos, and listen to my music! :D If you have any questions, feel free to message me!

Thanks for checking out my Kickstarter project. Would you like to help me make Portals to a real but virtual parallel world??\n\nWhat are Portals?\n\nWell, according to Wikipedia, \"A portal is a magical or technological doorway that connects two distant locations separated by spacetime...Places that a portal will link to include a different spot in the same universe... a parallel world ... the past or the future...and other planes of existence.\" So..yeah, that sounds about right.\n\n\nMore specifically, my Portals will consist of a pair of boxes. Each box has a screen on the front and a gateway on the side where you can reach in with your hand. Through the magic of green screen your hand instantly appears to be in the virtual real-world of Google Streetview. And since you and your objects are now in this parallel world, real-world rules can be broken. For instance, a regular object from the real world could appear animated in this virtual one. These boxes are also connected to the internet which means you could share the space with other people. Here's some videos of where the current prototype is at right now (you can check out my thesis blog for more information too).\n\nWhy?\nLately, people have been getting pretty excited about the idea of interacting with computers by touching screens or gesturing in front of them. But I\u2019ve been wondering, what if you could interact with by getting under, inside, or behind the screen instead? Also, what alternatives are there between the too-real experience of face to face video conferencing and the too-fake experience of completely virtual worlds (like Second Life)?\nThis is an experimental design project to help me explore some of these questions. It's not meant to be a commercial product, but I can speculate about a ton of potential ways people might use these boxes, from building entire parallel worlds to cross country puppet shows. But first I just need to build the boxes.\nFunding\nThe current prototype is a mix of foam core, duct tape, fabric scrap, a desk lamp, an end table, a borrowed monitor, and the cheapest webcam possible. I\u2019d like to level up, and that\u2019s where I thought Kickstarter might be able to help.\n\nFunding would go towards building a pair of Portals (2 boxes, so at least 2 people can use them at once):\nMonitors for each Portal so I could return the other monitor I\u2019ve been borrowing.\nHD webcams and a better lighting set up for a more evenly lit scene, for a cleaner chroma key\nMaterials for building the cases so they\u2019re more portable & sturdy so they could possibly go venture outdoors to public spaces.\nA copy of Dragonframe, a great stop motion program, so I can better create nice stop motion animations of real objects in the virtual world.\nPossibly some sensors for identifying a tag or position of objects inside.\nIf we reach the goal, any additional funding would go towards developing the project even further, exploring ways that interacting with this virtual world could actually affect a real-world location.\nDocumentation of this Kickstarter campaign and the things created for people as rewards ( like postcards, Physical Animation Reality Augmenters, and videos) will also be archived on the site as part of my greater thesis project as well.

Quick, pick-up-and-play tactical decisions are what Auro's all about.  Turn based games are great for mobile games, because they don't require constant, fixed attention.  Further, they don't require as much tactile precision and timing on a touch-screen.\nRich \"Disciplines\" System!  Study the manipulative forces of the Power skill tree, or the sneaky tactics of the Elude skills.  Or play as more of a wizard-type, focusing on Fire or Ice spells.  Because each skill has many uses, there are a thousand ways to play - get creative!\nRandomized Challenges!  The levels, monsters, and items are all randomized each time you play Auro, meaning that it's infinitely re-playable!\nSeveral modes of play!  For those who like traversing an unfolding story, there is a Story Mode.  If you just want an efficient, solid test of your skill, Exhibition Mode is for you.  If you enjoy puzzles, try Puzzle Mode!\nCharm!  We think you'll delight at the characters we've been developing over the past year for Auro.\nQuality Art & Music!  We have a very distinct vision for what Auro should look and sound like.  We hope you'll find it to be a beautiful piece of art on its own when it's complete.\nCross Platform!  Play Auro on your Android Phone, iPad, iPhone, iTouch while you're at work.  When you come home, play it some more on your desktop Windows, MacOS or Linux PC!\nAnyone who's involved in game development knows what an incredible amount of work it is.  Painting, pixel art, animation, graphic design, UI design, programming, game design, video editing, writing - the list of disciplines required to put a game like Auro: The Golden Prince together is staggering.\n\nWe really believe in this game and the real reason we're making it is that we think the world will be the tiniest bit of a better place when it exists.  Auro is not just another game to us - it's the embodiment of all of our philosophies and the expression of our belief in the medium.  It is our collective love letter to the idea of the digital game!\n\nAt least, it will be!  But we really need your help.  Auro is being made by just three people - Keith Burgun, Blake Reynolds and Ido Yeheili.  The amount of work - just raw man-hours that it's going to take to get it from its current prototype phase to a completed, polished product is huge.  We're hoping that Kickstarter may be the way for us to pursue our passion and at the same time, be able to survive.\n\nEvery year, there are some great ideas coming out of independent developers, and there are great productions coming out of large AAA studios.  It's an exceptional situation when one team does both things.  With your help, Dinofarm Games can be that team with Auro: The Golden Prince. \n\nWe thank you for reading, and please consider supporting our game!\n\nAbout Us\nWe're Dinofarm Games.  Making games is extremely time-consuming and requires extreme attention to detail in many, many fields.  We appreciate any support you can give us in making this game.\nKeith Burgun - Lead Designer.  Designed \"100 Rogues\" and many other independent games.  Writer for Gamasutra and several other blogs.  Teaches Game Design at the Katonah Art Center.\nBlake Reynolds - Lead Artist/Composer.

We're considering other possible funding options for the project... please feel free to write me at keithburgun@dinofarmgames.com, or comment with your ideas.\n\nI want to formally acknowledge that we didn't run the best Kickstarter campaign in the world.  We started with a somewhat shoddy video - game developers seemed to like it, but for most people it seemed to come off as a lot of fluff.  We also started off with a character design that, quite frankly, a lot of people just couldn't get behind.  We took your advice to heart and changed it, not because we just buckle to whatever fans want, but because we agreed with the concerns.  However, changing gears mid-way probably didn't help us overall.\n\nOh, and... I think we set our donation amount a little on the high side.  This was our first Kickstarter, if you couldn't tell!\n\nAnyway, depending on what funding plan we go with, Auro may take a little longer to create, but it is still coming.  We spent over a year now planning the game - we believe in it, and we're going to make it be the best dungeon crawling game ever made!\n\nPlease visit our site (www.), follow us on Twitter () and Facebook () for more updates on the future of Auro.\n\nThanks again for your support.\n\n- Keith Burgun, Lead Designer @ Dinofarm Games\nkeithburgun@yahoo.com"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "The Big Announcement!", "update_content": "Guys, we've been working our tails off on this for about two weeks.\n\nBlake is going to be writing a really in-depth article about all the changes we've made, which will go up soon, but for now suffice it to say that we got a lot of helpful feedback from you guys when we first launched, and we took a lot of it to heart.\n\nWe've always been confident that Auro is going to be a blast of a game to play, but we felt that we could be presenting the game in a better, more engaging way.

Read our interview with Nerd-age.com to get all of the juicy details. \nSummary. \nPlayable online, Notch is an open world steampunk MMORPG that allows you to collaborate with other players and build an entire world from scratch. Instead of killing boars or delivering magical amulets, you'll be creating your own villages, cities, religions, and even governments. As you progress in the game, more advanced buildings will become available to you, going from farms and mud houses to holograms and space stations.\nWhy is it unique?\nNotch is the first MMO in history to have its own location-based social networking application. By carrying around a mobile device (iPhone, iPad, and Android), you'll have the ability to check in (like Foursquare) at different locations to earn money and XP. The money and XP is then automatically updated online and can be used to purchase new in-game items such as buildings, scenery, and clothing for your character. \nArt. \nRewards. \nBy pledging (over on the right) for either The Compass, The Opal, or The Golden Glove, you are able to unlock 1 mysterious power and 3 unique gifts within the game. What will you choose?\nYou can also get posters, stickers, wallpapers, and even a 16 GB (White or Black) iPad 2. \nWhat the money is for.\nBy supporting this project, you're helping us build something immense!\nAll of your contributions will go towards:\nArtwork. We want to make Notch ridiculously beautiful. To achieve this, we're working with an extremely talented group of artists who have produced work for both Blizzard and Disney. \nInterface. Nothing's worse than not being able to watch your brand new T.V. because the remote is too complicated. We want to make sure we're providing the best possible experience for players by creating an intuitive UI.\nGrowth. We're a small team with a BIG idea and a lot of passion.

I began researching heavily on NASA missions and came to the realization that the late 1950\u2019s to mid-1970\u2019s were exciting times for new discoveries, for real photographic images of planets and for limitless possibilities. This gave me the incentive to start a personal project based on what I knew very well as a child (creating simple ideas/drawings from imagination) and what I recently researched (the execution of early NASA missions in the infancy of space travel).\nI started exploring different styles of illustrations, which I will share with pledgers above the $5 level. The style I have come up with is based on designers and illustrators that inspire me, on mid-century magazine advertisements and on the printing limitations of silkscreening and letterpress.\nI decided to create three of the more interesting planets that today still have unexplained features or quirks. But, after being entranced with the research and the artistic interpretations of the planets, I decided to not stop and finish all 8 planets (sorry Pluto).\nThe funds\nThe money will be spent on production costs and the rewards, including production cost, supplies and shipping (international shipping extra, please see the FAQ for a detailed list).\nFeatured Song: http://soundcloud.com/aliaksandr_tsurko/north-caucasus\nHuge thanks to Michael George", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Almost there", "update_content": "As promised here are all 8 posters that I finished last week and over the weekend.
