"SYNCOPATION\nArtist Selene States and choreographer Ryan Fran\u00e7ois are working on a b/w 16mm dance film entitled Syncopation exploring the differences between 1940's and contemporary swing dance.\nThe final film will be 6 minutes in length. The routine will consist of two variations developed in both a 1940's and a contemporary style. World-class swing dancers Moe Sakan and Remy Kouakou Kouame will perform the routine to a Slim Gaillard tune.\nAward-winning cinematographer Tim Sidell will film the dancers from above in a bird's-eye view and from below shot through a glass floor. Costume designer Lise Marker will create hybrid contemporary-period costumes that hint at shifting perceptions of time.\nThe film builds on the aesthetic developed by Francis Picabia's 1924 Surrealist film Entr'acte, and Will Jason's 1944 cult classic short Groovie Movie, both of which use dancers' footwork shot from beneath a glass floor.\nSyncopation brings a team of experts on vintage aesthetics together to shoot a new angle of the beautiful classic theme of dance viewed through a glass floor.\nYOUR PLEDGE\nWe need your help to raise $5000 to build the largest plate glass dance floor since these shots were taken in the early 20th century. Your contribution will go towards the construction and installation of the glass floor's steel frame and scaffolding so that Moe and Remy can safely perform their routine.\nFor the steps you take to help out, we offer our thanks in the form of film credits, stills prints, as well as the opportunity for you to dance on the floor yourselves.\nShown at dance events and international art galleries, the final film will be synchronously projected on the floor and ceiling in a film installation, as well as distributed on-line.\nEvery pledge gets us more of a foothold on the final film project Syncopation, so, please pledge as much as you can and be a part of this very special project!\nTHE TEAM\nDirector: Selene States (DE/UK/USA) is an artist working with film and video. Her work investigates nostalgia and anachronistic aesthetics, with solo exhibitions in 2012 dedicated to swing dance and vintage revival such as in her Swing Shoe Shop at the State Museum of Fine Art Baden-Baden and Frigidaire at the Kunstverein Friedrichshafen. http://www.selenestates.com\nChoreographer: Ryan Franc\u0327ois (UK) is considered to be one of the foremost authorities on vernacular swing and jazz dance of the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's.

Available on Bandcamp and iTunes.]\nHi everyone,\nI'm Yuno (fka unouomedude). I started making songs alone in my bedroom in 2007. I made an EP called \"Marsh\" in my bedroom in 2010. In 2011, I released a single called \"Frequency\" that was made in my bedroom. Now, I want to make another record in my bedroom! I'm making a new record called \"V\", and this time I want to make it bigger and better!\nGoal: $2,000\nI started this Kickstarter to raise funds to record my new record, \"V\", and to be able to play these songs live. If I reach my goal of $2,000, I will be able to get the music gear I need to play live shows and some of that gear will also be used to record \"V\". $2,000 will pay for things like a guitar amp, effects pedals, instrument upgrades/repairs, instrument cables, cases, accessories, and new instruments to record and tour with. If I don't reach my goal of $2,000 then no one will be charged, and no rewards will be sent.\nUltimate Goal: $4,500\nIf I reach my ultimate goal of $4,500, I will be able to not only play live shows, but also fully realize my ideas for \"V\" and other future releases. I have a lot of musical ideas, but I don't have the equipment to make all of the pretty sounds that are floating around in my head. Things like a more powerful computer, a better microphone, more instruments, studio monitors, and a better audio interface will allow me to make the sounds that I want to make, without all of my current limitations.\nThere are several exclusive rewards for people who fund this project.

It is scheduled to appear in the sky above the Bay Area between Sept. 12 and 16.\nMerging art and technology, ISHKY has brought together a team of artists, programmers and scientists to give life to a compelling vision that a community of millions will directly experience. The conceptual work, Pi In The Sky, explores the boundaries of scale, public space, impermanence, and the relationship between Earth and the physical universe.  \nPi In The Sky has two unique interpretations: one within Earth's atmosphere and one well beyond it. A team of synchronized aircraft will skywrite the first 1,000 numbers of pi's infinite sequence in a 100+ mile loop around the San Francisco Bay Area. The second interpretation, in outer space, will include a constant string of pi emitted from a satellite. \nOn Earth \nAt 10,000 feet altitude working with our technical partner AirSign, a team of five synchronized aircraft equipped with dot-matrix technology will skywrite the first 1,000 numbers of pi's infinite sequence in a 100-plus-mile loop around the San Francisco Bay Area. Each number will measure over a quarter-mile in height. A sixth AirSign plane will fly above the writing team, documenting the entire process. The two-hour mass intervention is a central feature of the 2012 ZERO1 Biennial. The work will begin above the ZERO1 Garage in San Jose and will follow a flight path determined by ISHKY to include a pantheon of educational and mathematics institutions: Stanford, NASA Ames, Livermore Labs, UC Berkeley, San Francisco's financial district, Twitter, Google, Facebook, and Apple, among many others. \nPi Route\nWithin moments of execution (3.14159265...), the specific meaning of the numbers in the sky will be lost. The piece will dissolve into an unprecedented visual anomaly that prompts curiosity, providing rich opportunity for social interaction as well as basic math education. The Bay Area\u2019s seven million inhabitants will be able to witness the arc of the event in real-time, from its creation to its gradual disappearance. \nIn order to increase opportunities for civic engagement, ISHKY has enlisted the technical expertise of Stamen Design, a world-class creative firm specializing in data-visualization. Stamen, working with data from OpenStreetMap under CC BY SA license, will develop a platform for the public to document and share experiences of the event. \nIn Outer Space \nIn outer space, miles above our atmosphere, a second interpretation of Pi In The Sky will include a constant string of pi emitted from a satellite. Slated to launch later in the fall by a Bay Area start-up satellite firm, the numbers of pi and its GPS coordinate will broadcast from the satellite and circle the Earth every 90 minutes, covering more than a half-a-million kilometers per day. Receiving stations on the ground will pick up these signals and relay the information over the web. ISHKY Studios is developing a smartphone app that will enable users anywhere in the world to locate the satellite overhead and track pi\u2019s travel as it wraps our Earth like a ball of string. \nFunding \nOur Kickstarter goal of $31,415 will help defray hard costs of over $100,000. This includes everything from aircraft landing fees, fuel, lodging for pilots and documentarians, programming costs and more. You can help us reach our funding target and push us well beyond. \nTogether, we will provide a free and uplifting experience for millions of people and create a historic moment for conceptual art, redefining notions of scale and site specificity. Set this momentous and historic undertaking in motion. \nAbout the Artist \nISHKY is a California-born artist with a Bachelor of Science degree from UC Berkeley. As a professional communicator and designer, the agency he founded has helped name and create visual identities for infrastructure projects totaling more than $15 billion in civic investment. His work has focused on public space, health, safety, utilities and transit. As Board Chairman of Illuminate The Arts, he is the visionary behind the public art project \"The Bay Lights,\" a stunning fine arts experience that will live for two years on the Bay Bridge West Span starting in 2013. Designed by artist Leo Villareal, \"The Bay Lights\" is a production of the nonprofit organization Illuminate The Arts which is dedicated to the creation and presentation of community-activating public art.\nEverything is impossible until we prove it is not.

Kickstarter would finance machine hours, improving accuracy, shortening production time. Purchasing material in bulk in combination with access to machines will lower costs + pass the savings on to the consumer. \nWhere to Use: HEX6AGON is a follow up series to FACET. HEX6AGON can be used both indoors + outdoors for up to 5 years. We recommend using HEX6AGON on glass surfaces, like windows, mirrors, even bottles, as the adhesive is \"permanent\".\nDepending on the number of tiles you have, you can use HEX6AGON in differently scaled spaces, or on objects, providing visual definition. HEX6AGON will color your space, variably, changing as the day progresses.\ndimensions may alter in production.\nHow to Use: Pick or design your own pattern. A printed reference sheet will be included in shipments. Start with a cleaned surface, follow cleaning product recommendations for your specific surface (avoiding oils).\nConsider your layout, think about the design. Do you want it centered or floating? Start in a corner  for linear patterns, or from the center, for radiating patterns.\nHEX6AGON tiling vinyl allows for both wet or dry application. The 3mil vinyl has enough of a lip for you to perfectly butt-up each tiling vinyl. HEX6AGON is easily cut with scissors or an Exacto knife for a custom fit.\nLayer HEX6AGON over other tiling vinyl, to create new colors.\nPlay with negative space, your natural view becomes an additional color + texture in the patterns.\nPermanent adhesive. Cleanly removes from glass. Do not apply to precious surfaces, may damage upon removal.\nExpected Lifespan:  A clean surface will give HEX6AGON the best start. You can expect HEX6AGON to \"stick around\" for 5 years. \nIncentives: The semi + full sets of HEX6AGON on Kickstarter are offered below the projected retail price. So buying now, saves later.\n$1 Reward gets a COCO in Color Video!\nShipping: HEX6AGON will ship in November. If you would like tracking, delivery confirmation, signature on arrival, or other specific shipping requests, please make a note in your order (additional costs will be confirmed prior to shipping).  \nInternational Shipping:\n$5 rewards, shipping is on me. :) \n$10 + 15 + $25 rewards, add $2. \n$50 rewards, add $5. \n$135 rewards, add $10.\nWhere the Kickstarter Money Will Be Used:\nProduction machine hours\nPurchasing entire rolls of transparent vinyl material \nProduct packaging - cardboard tubes, plugs + envelopes \nGraphic packaging labels\nGrouping tile series for interior packaging\nInformational inserts\nBasic shipping costs\nKickstarter + Amazon processing fees \nProduct shots\nHow the Kickstarter Investment Will Effect HEX6AGON in the Longterm:\nPreorders will serve as a small market test for retail buyers.

Not just the animals, but the growing industry that surrounds them. The first of these books 'hunters' explores the complex relationship that man has with animal, through the eyes of the tourist trophy hunter. \nIn the 19th Century these hunters would have been from aristocratic backgrounds, the monied elite of Europe and America. Today's hunters are hedge fund managers, surgeons, dentists, attorneys, and their wives and children. They have the option to attend 'safari' training schools in their home countries, shooting remote controlled Elephants, Leopards, and Lions. Most have a place for their trophies in their homes back in the US and Europe, long before they even arrive in Africa. They have expectations of Africa, and these must be met by an industry priding itself on the fact that size does matter.\nSo far this work as been totally self funded. I can only now publish the book, if funds can be found to contribute to the cost, which is why I am asking you, and the Kickstarter community, for sponsorship to help fund the publication of this book.\nI've been approached by an amazing dutch fine art publisher, Schilt, who wants to produce the book in a limited edition (2000), but only if funds can be found to contribute to the cost.\nThe book will be 24.5 x 30 cm (landscape) and hardbound with a dust jacket. There will be 192 pages, and approx 120 full colour plates.\nIn the back of the book, I intend to put a second, smaller book in concertina format. This will be enclosed in a pouch in the back cover, and hold the work from 'elephant story' (see below). On the back of the plates will be the complete essay 'shooting an elephant' by George Orwell.\nThe total cost to produce the book is USD 30,000\nTo make this happen I need to raise at least USD 20,000\nEvery cent received, will contribute directly to the production of the book.\nProject Awards to date.\nWorld Press Photo Award (Elephant Story) the Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize (Huntress with Buck) and  Sony World Photography Award/Nature and Wildlife (Safari Club).\nElephant Story by David Chancellor.\nShooting an Elephant by George Orwell.\nGeorge Orwell's essay 'Shooting an Elephant' created a deep, lasting impression, when I read it as a child. This was brought vividly back to life when I documented the hunting of an elephant by an American hunter in Zimbabwe, and the utilization of it by the local community, under the Campfire Program. I was struck by the stark reality of that death, and the similarity of Orwell's description of the slaying of a rogue elephant in Burma, possibly by his own faltering hand.\nHunters at the Saatchi Gallery, London.\nSaatchi Gallery showcased some of the best photography of the last 50 years.\nPrints.\nAs all my work is shot on 6x7 film, I print both traditional Hand Photographic C-Types, and Archival Pigment Ink. All work is limited to an edition of 5 in total, plus 2x AP, unless otherwise stated.\nA note on how to use Kickstarter to make a pledge:\nTo make a pledge click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button.

Thank you all so much for your support, this has been such an amazing ride so far! We want to take a quick moment to point out our next stretch goal - this is what will happen if we keep going:\nAt $95,000, we\u2019ll drop in what we call the \u201cPerformance Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater variety of terrain. We\u2019ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a higher ground speed. We\u2019ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of autonomy, for future robot development.\nAnd now, back to our Kickstarter page!\nOur Dream\nWe dream of a world where imagination becomes reality simply because enough passionate people decide that an idea has merit. We dream of robots of all shapes and sizes being made across the globe, because the high-end technology needed to make them is simplified, generalized, and made publicly accessible.\nThe first step in achieving that dream for us is building a rideable, 18 foot  wide, 4,000 pound, 6-legged, engine-powered hydraulic walking robot named Stompy, and sharing exactly how we did it with the world.\nWho We Are\nWe are Project Hexapod. We\u2019re a team of 3 instructors, 1 TA, and 15 students based out of a makerspace in Somerville, Massachusetts called Artisan\u2019s Asylum. We\u2019ve spent the last four months running a class on how to design giant robots, and  Stompy is the end result. Our instructors (Gui Cavalcanti, James Whong, and Dan Cody) are professional roboticists who have designed military and commercial robot legs, arms, prosthetics, walking machines, and more. Our TA (Adam Bercu) is a national champion Battlebots builder, and our students come from backgrounds ranging as widely as engineers working for defense contractors to professional programmers to electronics enthusiasts.\nYou may have heard of us and Stompy before, a couple of months back \u2013 we were written up in Wired, Boing Boing, Hack A Day, DVICE, Hizook, the Boston Globe, and Engadget, among others.\nWhy You Should Care\nFirst of all, we\u2019re building a giant walking robot that you can ride, and if all goes according to plan, we\u2019ll be showing it off at a festival or fair near you. Depending on your level of support, you may even get to ride it or drive it - how about that?\nBeyond that, though, your support for Project Hexapod will drive a personal robotics revolution (if we have anything to say about it). The past twenty years have seen an explosion of productivity in hobbyist robotics made possible by cheap, easy to use microcontrollers and RC servos. The hobbyist community has built a wealth of knowledge and infrastructure around these components, but RC servos severely limit the size of robot you can build.\nProject Hexapod wants to make large-scale robots easier to build, and inspire people to build them.\nStompy is 6 giant steps towards that dream. Once we finish this robot, we\u2019re releasing our plans, our CAD, our diagrams, the presentations from all the lectures we gave in class, our lists of materials and parts, everything. The construction and control techniques we're using will drop the cost of controlled hydraulics by an order of magnitude or two from where they are now, and will make giant robots affordable to small groups of enthusiasts everywhere.\nThe robot isn't just being built for fun, though - it has incredibly practical purposes, as well. With 6 force-sensitive legs and a ground clearance of 6 feet, the robot will be able to walk over broken terrain that varies from mountainous areas, to rubble piles, to water up to 7 or 8 feet deep - everywhere existing ground vehicles can't go. Not only that, but while navigating such terrain, Stompy could carry 1,000 pounds at 2-3 mph, and up to 4,000 pounds at 1 mph. This is important because in disaster areas like Haiti's Port Au Prince, it's taken more than three years to clear the rubble out of some areas - meaning that throughout that entire time, people have had to be rescued or resupplied by helicopter, because no ground vehicle could reach them. Stompy (and the technology it represents) could easily reach people who can't be reached by any other means in a natural disaster.\nWhat You Get\nWe\u2019re not your average Kickstarter campaign, so we don\u2019t have  your average Kickstarter levels. At a level of support of $100 or below, we\u2019re going to shout your name from the top of the White Mountains, give you a ton of cool swag (designed by local artists Maria Stangel and Ecco Pierce), and list you as a supporter on our website. At the $10 level, that swag includes a bumper sticker proclaiming your desires for your other car:\nThe $20 level includes a robot apocalypse friendship bracelet that reads 'FRIEND OF ROBOTS - DO NOT TERMINATE'; wear it to ensure your safety during the upcoming robot revolution! At the $40 level, you get your choice of one of the following T-shirts:\nAt the $75 level, you'll get both shirts (or two of one, if you prefer). Feel free to add $35 to any pledge level to get an additional shirt!\nFinally, at the $100 level, we'll send you a signed photo of the entire team in front of the finished Stompy, giving the camera cheesy thumbs ups! After the swag levels, though, things get\u2026interesting.\n\nAt the $200 level, you get to choose between having 10 characters of your choice welded onto our chassis or supplying an inanimate object of your choice for Stompy to crush mercilessly. At the $300 level you get a ride, at the $1,000 level you get to drive, and at the $2,500 to $5,000 level you (or your company) get to be listed as a sponsor. At the $10,000 level we\u2019ll fly you out to Boston for a weekend (if you\u2019re in the lower 48 states \u2013 international supporters, call us beforehand!), give you free ice cream and burgers, and take field trips with Stompy to local rubble piles and scrap yards.\n\nContact us directly if you\u2019re interested in higher levels; $25,000 will get you a Stompy appearance in the lower 48 states once the robot\u2019s done, and $300,000 will get you another Stompy of your very own!\nWhat We've Done So Far\nOver the past four months, we've...\nDeveloped radically low cost computer controlled hydraulic joint designs\nDesigned, built, and successfully controlled a half-scale prototype leg (affectionately known as Gimpy) to test our low cost designs\nDesigned a simulation environment with models of hydraulic force and flow to test our robots before we build them\nGot our engine and hydraulic power unit up and running for the full scale robot\nDesigned and posted our class presentations as we went\nDesigned and ordered parts for a full-scale prototype leg\nDesigned 80% of Stompy's chassis\nWhat We're Doing Now\nRight now we\u2019re building a full-scale prototype leg to make sure our design methodology, actuator sizing, and finite element  analysis are all up to snuff before anyone sets foot in the actual robot. Once we establish that, we\u2019ll be finishing the design of our chassis \u2013 at the end of our four week Kickstarter campaign, we expect we\u2019ll be ready to press print on our drawings and start cutting and welding steel!\nWhat We'll Do With The Money\nWe\u2019re asking for a lot of money, and it\u2019s all going straight into the hardware necessary to build the robot. We estimate that each leg will cost around $6,000, to cover the 350 pounds of waterjet-cut steel, high quality shock absorbers, three hydraulic cylinders, valves, sensors, and what have you. The body of the robot (which accounts for around 1,000 pounds of steel), consumables, electronics, and miscellaneous items like screws and wire make up the balance.\nWhile $65,000 sounds like a lot of money for a project claiming to be low cost, bear in mind that an equivalent robot built with high-end technology could easily cost on the order of a couple of million dollars. As a point of reference, using our technology results in position-controlled hydraulic actuators that can produce 18,000 pounds of force, with strokes up to 2 feet in length... for all of $400 an axis. That's less than some hobby servos. Most of the cost of this project is in steel and other components.\nOnce we get the money, we'll order the thousands of pounds of steel, start the waterjet running at Excell Solutions (our contracted machine shop), and start welding everything together at Artisan's Asylum. We're budgeting 8 months to finish the robot, from the initial steel order.\nOnce we finish the robot, we\u2019ll have a series of demo days and festivals where we give rides, let people drive, stomp things for fun, and more!\nWhat We'll Do With A Lot Of Money\nWe have big plans for what will happen if this takes off\u2026\nAt $95,000, we\u2019ll drop in what we call the \u201cPerformance Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater variety of terrain. We\u2019ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a higher ground speed. We\u2019ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of autonomy, for future robot development.\n\nAt $125,000, we\u2019re going to install the \u201cFlair Upgrade\u201d. We\u2019ll give Stompy an animatronic head, a killer paint job, a sound system, and (pending a full safety review of the robot once it\u2019s built) flame effects.\n\nAt $300,000, we\u2019re going to make this a Really Big Deal. We\u2019re going to buy a waterjet cutter and install it at Artisan\u2019s Asylum for public use, start a company devoted to creating open-source high-end robotic technology, and start developing a zoo\u2019s worth of rideable robots. We\u2019re not even kidding.\nAny funding left over from the project will be put in a bank account and reserved for seed funding for future giant robot projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Lower Legs: 83% Installed!", "update_content": "(We should've waited a week to send out our update email, it turns out!)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Project Hexapod Final Assembly is Underway!", "update_content": "Hello everyone! \nThe most important things first - this is what Stompy currently looks like!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Stompy Build Progress!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe've had a few requests for updates to the website and Kickstarter page, so we went ahead and put together a comprehensive update for everyone that draws on our recent photo albums.

We have a great idea but we need your help.\n1. Why does this clothing line have to exist?Because many women who don't fit into the societal \"feminine\" category have never been able to find clothing made just for them. There has never been a designer or clothing line that design for androgynous women. They have had to find substitutes and be happy with the limited items found in the boys or men's department. The existence of this clothing line will also bring awareness and make people more accepting of others.\n2. Why are we the team to make it happen?\nBecause A Lee has experienced first hand what it's like when looking for neat, clean and simple clothing that fit. We understand the frustrations from the customers\u2019 side and the design side. We also have the capacity for hard work (thanks to our mom) and determination to make this work. We're passionate and believe in this whole-heartedly.\n3. Why should it be done now?\nBecause people have waited long enough. We think society is ready for a change. \n4. Why is this clothing line significant? Why do people need to be a part of it?\nBecause it's greater than fashion or clothing. It's about challenging the gender roles societies have created and being true to yourself. It's about creating a movement that can influence people to be more open and accepting of others. It's okay to be different because that's exactly what makes you who you are.\nAndrogynousFashion.com\nWhy we started androgynous? Instead of making compromises and trying to fit into society, we should embrace who we are and stay true to ourselves. Most people change to fit the mold the world has created because they fear rejection. But there are those brave and courageous souls that remain true to themselves. And they have been looking for a place that sells clothes that suit their personality for too long, to no avail.\nAs far back as I can remember, there was never a time when I was into women\u2019s clothing. The button-down shirts just have too many \u201cstuff\u201d I couldn\u2019t find purpose for. They\u2019re tight and wraps around my body like I\u2019m out to show my curves and to accentuate my breasts and hips\u2026it\u2019s like \u201cLOOK! I HAVE BREASTS AND HIPS!\u201d\nBut my biggest frustration of all \u2013 those two lines in the front of the shirt and the \u201ccleavage\u201d cut. And pockets that are not actual pockets.\nI went on a search for men\u2019s clothes that would fit my body. My search led me to a few websites that catered to tomboyish women. The only problem was that these sites all consisted of T-shirts, which I could find anywhere. I wanted button-down shirts, jackets and dress pants. I wanted the clothes from the men\u2019s runway show. \nOn many occasions after I\u2019ve exhausted my efforts at the women\u2019s department, I would \u201cdrift\u201d into the men\u2019s and try to make it seem like I was just passing by. If I didn\u2019t spot anything, I would then \u201cdrift\u201d into the boy\u2019s department and try my best not to look weird though I was very self-conscious.\nYears passed and finally one day, it just clicked. Why don\u2019t Vee and I just start a clothing line for androgynous people? Somewhere out there in the world, there must be people like me who spend days thinking of how they can take their wardrobe and magically turn it into something like high end menswear.\nVee and I spent many months searching for inspirations. We studied men\u2019s fashion from the last 900 years. What I discovered was that fashion, particularly style, changes VERY slowly. My guess is that people conform to society\u2019s views of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d without questioning.\nThe designs we've come up with are not formfitting, don't taper at the waist and hips, and there no darts where the chest is. Simply elegant, classy, clean-cut menswear made to fit women.\nWe believe that a little weirdness, and a little \u201ccraziness\u201d can cause big changes. And we believe that something as trivial as the clothes you choose to wear can change the way society thinks about what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d\u2026especially what society thinks about what\u2019s right or wrong.\nPart 1.

We need to complete a few more pieces and then finish it all up with mixing and mastering.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur goal is to receive enough pre-orders to afford us additional studio time. We'd love the chance to polish up the tracks and add in a few extras that would make this record exactly what we've been envisioning the past 2 years.\nWe've been tracking since October for the full length record that features most of the material we've been touring with the past year. Being that most of us are in Baltimore (where the record is being tracked) and a couple are in New York (where it is not), the process of writing, recording, and touring this batch of songs has required additional time and money.\nFor having only a single official release as a 6-piece, we're a well traveled band, having toured almost everywhere this side of Texas and Illinois. We recently took a two week run down south to Austin as an official act at SXSW. A tour van and recording costs add up fast, especially when we have only $5 copies of our two year old album to peddle along the way.\nRewards\nWe are offering a bunch of rewards for people kind enough to back our record. Including a few of our previous tape releases (digital files included), Kickstarter only double tapes, Vinyl/Digital versions of the new record, performance opportunities, and test pressings of the final cuts of Rainer before it goes public.\nWho's releasing this?\nFor this release we're sticking with a smaller independent label who will cover only production costs. We're finalizing the fine details of the releasing label and date. Backers will get updates with everything going on with the release!\nWhen is it coming out?\nWe've been working on this release for the past year and have already pushed it back a few months to allow the time to properly complete it. We were recently fortunate enough to film a Shaking Through Session and are using that as the launch point for the record. The session is set to come out in October which is the same time we hope to announce our label plans, along with the album artwork and the first single. The record is currently set to come out in January of 2013 at the latest. \nSecret Mountains?\nAnything else you might possibly want to know about us can be found at www.secret-mountains.com\nHere is another track from the record called \"Golden Blue\".

My name is Brad Walsh. I have recorded a few albums and done some remixes for some pop stars that you might have heard. There have been great reviews of my music in magazines and newspapers, on blogs, and my songs have been on television shows and commercials... YET... for some reason I don't have a Scrooge McDuck moneybin and the leaves on my trees are not hundred dollar bills! So I need some help getting my next album recorded and distributed.\nMaking a record can cost a lot of money, especially when you're doing everything yourself, like I am. The $6000 I am trying to raise is the low end of the projected costs, which include everything from studio fees to song mastering, disc pressing, digital distribution costs, printing of promo materials, and even a little bit of advertisement. I've thought up some fun pledge rewards, though, so your pledge results in you actually getting something cool in the end. In addition to the final album on CD and delivered digitally, you can also choose to receive some of my photo work, or a custom song made just for you, or even some special one-on-one experiences with me and my partner. It's up to you, so please take a look at the different pledge level rewards.\n\nThis new album I'm working on is very danceable, fun pop, and it's by far the best music I've ever made. I'm even impressing myself this time around. There are going to be several really incredible guest singers and players on some of the new tracks as well - different artists that I am a huge fan of - and every day that goes by and every vocal track that's recorded, I have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. It's so cool that these great talents are into making some music with me.\n\nKickstarter is completely changing the way music is made and how artists connect to people who enjoy their work. The estimated date of completion is listed on all rewards as December 2012, but as this is an artistic project they may occur sooner or later than that. Your rewards, however, will come as soon as they are possible. Thank you so much in advance, and I promise you're going to like what you get!\nThe audio track in the video above is one of my new songs (with the lead vocal taken out - only the background demo vocals are left on it so as not to spoil the surprise).

My first book Bodyscapes (2007) contained vibrant creative artwork with painted bodies moving through some of the most diverse landscapes on earth.\n\nThis Kickstarter will allow me to round off the necessary funding to complete, print and publish a second book of photography.  Leap into the Blue dives deeper into our beingness, creating \"fantastic\" interventions within the landscape that challenge viewers to question the lines we draw between mind and body; human and nature; figure and landscape; dream and reality.\nThrough a unique fusion of mediums (such as photography, painting and performance ), all 240 photographs point to our inner freedom, to the humor hidden behind our life predicaments, to our capacity to embrace the unknown, or the unity between our Mind and Body and between ourselves and the environment.\nI\u2019m hoping that through the unexpected wealth of surreal situations photographed, one may be brought to experience a different sense of living poetically or find new liberating perspectives in regards to how we can relate to our surroundings, appreciate beauty and light, or wonder about our own being or what we aspire to.\nTHE THREE MOVEMENTS OF THE BOOK\nARISING GEOMETRY                                                                            The first series of photos explores our Mind\u2019s need to organize our surroundings into recognizable visual patterns and geometries.\nPAS DE DEUX\nThe second series displays the Body and its innate impulse to engage with another human in an infinite dance, pas de deux, or literally, \u201cstep for two.\u201d\nLEAP INTO THE BLUE\nThe third series touches upon our inner aspirations that are here invoked through the flying body.\nFUNDING\nI have already invested over $300,000 in this project since early 2000 and borrowed $20,000 towards the $30,000 necessary for the publisher to cover the printing costs. We are hoping to raise the remaining $10,000 through Kickstarter.\n\nThis final sum will insure the printing and distribution costs of the book, which includes 240 full color photographs, several pages of drawings that show the creative process of the project, as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD by Carmen Cheung. This DVD, with desert footage by filmmaker Trinh Minh-Ha, will give you a chance to listen to some of my views on this work and how it relates to one\u2019s life path, while giving you some insight into the production process.\nANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY\nIn a time when digital manipulation and effects reign in the visual environments that surround us, analog photography is not often the go-to format to creating what I call \u201cstaged photography.\u201d\nAll my photographs of flying bodies, cliff paintings and landscapes have been shot on analog film without the use of any digital technology.\nA grand reward of funding this project is the invitation to be a participant in one of our future expeditions, to co-create the unimaginable and to witness firsthand our whole process.\nABOUT MYSELF\nStarting at an early age in my native country of France, I have always held a passion for the earth, painting, drawing, dance, light, architecture and photography. My interests in architecture, landscape, archeology, and antique murals have greatly influenced my artistic endeavors.\nMy latest book, Vernacular Architecture of West Africa (in which I assembled my photographs and drawings of a disappearing way of building), came out in 2011 and my latest photography book Bodyscapes was published in 2007.\nSince 2000, my photography has focused exclusively on the body and the land and I would love to include as many readers as possible in this ongoing exploration.\nABOUT THE PERFORMERS\n\nAnother purpose for seeing to completion the publication of Leap Into The Blue is also to give homage to the fifty friends who volunteered to be part of this project over these many years and contributed with their energy and creative talents.\nNeedless to say, each of the photographs you see is the outcome of many thrills and ecstasies, but also many trials and unseen sacrifices. All the little or big difficulties encountered during our trips have been outweighed by the unspeakable joys of experiencing the desert\u2019s bare-bone beauty, and being in touch with the Body and Earth in an intimate and colorful way.\nAs much as myself, they would also love to inspire others with their artistic contributions, allowing us to see this Earth and our beings through a different lens.\nWHY YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK\nIf you enjoy adventures, you\u2019ll appreciate the unbelievable landscapes that we found in several deserts of the Western United States.\n\nIf you enjoy dance, you\u2019ll notice our playfulness with the geometry of the body as well as the section that features the Body as literally flying.\nIf you love art and poetry, you\u2019ll enjoy our paintings and the inspiration we took from some of the great masters of our time.\n\nIf you are interested in photography or film, you\u2019ll engage with the settings, staging, lighting and colors of each project.\nWhomever you are though, thank you for reading until this point and thank you from all of us if you can make the publication of Leap Into The Blue possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "MY FINAL UPDATE ...", "update_content": "...

Does the thought of what their aesthetic might sound like if relocated to warmer climes and infused with the passion and counterpoint of the tango sound intriguing? If so, then you need to listen to Sebastian Plano's debut album.\nThe Arrhythmical Part of Hearts was released last year with little fanfare, but is an album that should not be allowed to slip quietly by. Across seven short tracks Plano, a young San Francisco-based composer and multi-instrumentalist who plays everything on the album himself, weaves together an array of sounds including cello, keyboards, bandone\u00f3n, wordless vocals, and electronic effects and percussion into a compelling and emotive suite of compositions charged with tantalizing twists and turns.\nAlthough the music is instrumental, there is a strong sense of storytelling, both within each track and across the album as a whole. Sounds and instruments are added and dropped, tempos are raised and lowered, sudden subtle changes of mood generate forward motion, leading us into new episodes and interludes. The tone is by turn insistently yearning, wistfully pretty, gently melancholy, and urgently rhythmic. The sequence of \u2018In Between Worlds\u2019 and \u2018Emotions (Part III)\u2019 is a good example. The yearning cello of the all-too-brief (but crushingly gorgeous) \u2018In Between Worlds\u2019 begins in a meditative vein that becomes more urgent and dramatic as the track nears its end. The track finishes on a provisional, questioning note, without full resolution, leaning us forwards into \u2018Emotions (Part III)\u2019. The transition catapults us from yearning strings into a passage of faintly exotic percussion, which in turn opens into a restrained and plaintive electronic keyboard motif before drawing us back into the cello\u2019s ardently ascending voice. At each stage we are drawn onward, ears open for what comes next, needing more to complete the tale. The album is full of such miniature dramas, filled with life and beauty. It will reward the time you spend with it.\nhttp://thesilentballet.com\nArticle by Yakob Olesky\n             For longtime readers of The Silent Ballet like myself, the website's year-end list is a special treat, and we anxiously await it like a six year-old who can't sleep on Christmas Eve. One phenomenon that has been constant over the years is TSB's ability to pluck musicians out of complete obscurity and place them into the list as if no one would notice. The act itself is not difficult - anyone could find an unknown musician and rave about him - but what is impressive is that these artists never fail to deserve the praise that they have suddenly been given. Why no mention of these types of acts ever appears on the website prior to the end of the year list still remains a mystery to me, but as a recent addition to the staff I hope to unravel it one day. Sebastian Plano was 2011's \"surprise\" pick. Plano is an Argentinean composer who composed, recorded, and produced The Arrythmical Part of Hearts last year, which proves to be one of the strongest contemporary classical albums of the year. Hearts draws from a wide pool of influences; Plano is obviously influenced by much of classical's main body of work, but we also find similarities to some electronica producers, as well as certain contemporary movie score composers, such as Yann Tiersen. Cello is the main tool utilized on Hearts, but that is not to say that it in singular in its musical voice; rather, Plano achieves a rich network of sounds that dazzle as they weave in an out of one another - old and new, everything is as fresh and smooth as the first time it was played. Hearts is steeped in a deep passion that makes it irresistible - as Plano was previously a completely unknown artist, we can imagine that he was able to create this album without the slightest amount of pressure or fear of scrutiny. As a result, the album is branded with an attractive freedom and confidence that few established artists can afford. Plano's career is bright and wide open ahead of him. Here's hoping that he can relive the magic of Hearts on future works.\nhttp://thesirenssound.com\nArticle by Mog\n               I\u2019ve been listening to The Arrhythmical Part of Hearts for the last two weeks over a dozens of times already and the best part is every time I hear this title, the sound within kept unfolding secret chambers and new avenues. Regardless of the number of listens I gave this album I swear I keep hearing something I didn\u2019t hear on my previous listen. The Arrhythmical Part of Hearts is one hell of an amazing title. Too bad we haven\u2019t got a download yet but by all means do yourself a favour and stream the entire album.\nRecent Seb's interview + review:\nhttp://musicisgood.org/2012/03/interview-sebastian-plano/\n-----------------------------------------------------\nNEWS!!!\nSEBASTIAN PLANO - ARTIST OF THE MONTH IN ECHOES.\nhttp://echoesblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/the-heart-of-ambient-chamber-music-sebastian-plano-2/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Dear Friends and Supporters:", "update_content": "Dear Friends and Supporters,\nI have news about the upcoming records.

Some of you have asked me what exactly these digital toys are. They are sort of like windup toys, except that they are magic. Being magic they can do impossible silly things that toys in our primitive real world can't do.\nYou operate the toys yourself by stimulating them with your mouse and key commands. You can play with them on your computer or mobile units and you can collect and trade them with other toy collectors around the world. We have just begun to explore the possibilities of these ethereal creatures, so check out this video below to get an idea of how they work (wait about an hour while it uploads to vimeo). By the time we finish Cans Without Labels the toys will be much further along.

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys. Tear it out of the virtual package, roll it around, click it in sensitive areas and watch it do something stupid and lovable. \n  You can get a pack of 3 of my fancy-ass new digital toys to collect and trade with friends from many lands through the internets\n          How would you like to get your hands on the folks you put in office who ignore all the things you wanted 'em to do?

Maybe you\u2019ll hold the next famous cartoon character in your hands! Or maybe you'll just get greasy fingers. And you'll have made a funny cartoon!\n    You will get not just one gorgeous hand-made cartoon drawing - but a whole Goddamn scene! Spumco big shots Jim Smith and I drew each scene lovingly with pre-digital age stone tools (pencils) with YOU in mind. Flip through the drawings to see how a real traditional cartoon is acted. Or frame them and show 'em off to all your friends at the reform school.\nThis is some rare shit folks! I happen to have every page of the classic comic \"Comic Book\" drawn by Jim Smith, Vincent Waller, Mike Fontanelli, Shane Glines, Rick Altergott and other top Hollywood cartoonists.

You will own and cherish a whole layout scene from Cans Without Labels - and as an added bonus - a real live painted animation cel from one of Spumco's cartoons, rock videos or commercials. Turn all your neighbors green with envy. Signed by me of course.\nI will not only give you a credit in the cartoon - I will personally draw YOUR HEAD to put next to the credit. Here's a sample:\n  Here's a whole pile of samples of my caricatures:\nhttp://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/search/label/caricature\nYou can show off your head and credit in the cartoon to all your friends and family and act like a big time Hollywood executive!\nYOU'RE PART OF THE 1% AND PROUD OF IT!\nOK, folks here is THE BIG ONE. Join the esteemed ranks of top celebrities I have animated. You - yes YOU will make a cameo appearance in the cartoon. That's right!  I will personally do a caricature of you and animate you into the credits of the cartoon and thank you for being the philanthropic high-roller that you are! Maybe George will even pull your pants down.\nWhere Is Your Money Going?\nWe still need to animate, clean up, inbetween and color the cartoon. We will paint the backgrounds and build a cg set and some props. Then we need to pay for music, sound effects and final editing.  The whole process will take about 7 months.  It will be 8-10 minutes long, which is about the same length as a Ren and Stimpy episode, but for HALF the price!\nWe will also make DVDs and produce the prizes to ship out to all you swell folks who backed the project! \nThis is your chance to be your own Hollywood Cartoon executive and produce a Spumco-type cartoon the way you like it!\nThanks in advance for bringing the future of cartoon-making into the world of now!\nYour best friend,\nJohn Kricfalusi\nP.S.\nDon't for get to check this out!\nmusic courtesy of www.apmmusic.com\nHere's me showing how we ink our cartoons using Toonboom's \"Animate\" program.

We have, and we\u2019d like to make that possible with your help. Every album you\u2019ve ever heard is exactly the same as the first time you heard it, and it will be the same the next time you hear it. Starbound is different. It\u2019s an album that changes each time you play it, and the more you play, the more it changes. Confused by what we mean? Check out our HTML5 Audio Demo. \nIn April of this year we released Earthbound on Porto Franco Records, a small San Francisco based indie label. We had the opportunity to work with some amazing people, NASA scientists, musicians, authors, and artists. This project is the sequel to that effort. Starbound is a remix app to Earthbound that will include millions of remixes that adapt to your input. Starbound is an ambitious project that will also include sonified light curves (the sound of actual stars), an augmented reality space flight game, and an interactive art widget that includes a comic book written by award winning sci-fi author Nnedi Okorafor, artwork by Facebook muralist Jonathan Matas and original illustrations by Tanna Tucker, and tons of unlockable content, from unreleased songs and artwork to star charts to mini-games and playable instruments.\nAn upgrade from our beta version available on the app store that allows you to remix our song Phone Home using any 10 digit number. Every phone number will have a unique version of this song! For those of you counting that\u2019s 10 to the 10th power or 10 billion remixes. \nThis will be a 24 hour long remix to our song Wake Up that changes in 5 minute increments. In order to hear the same version of the song you\u2019ll need to set an alarm.  \nYour story remixes the song. Remix our song Stories using 140 character tweets. You will be able to write a story, hear what it sounds like, and then share it with friends via hashtag. For those of you counting, we have no idea how many remixes this is, but it\u2019s a LOT. \nKaraman Line is an augmented reality game played on the back of the Earthbound CD, or by using a printed AR marker. You will be able to see a \u201chologram\u201d of the CopperWire spaceship hover over the words \u201ccopper wire\u201d written in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Once you launch the ship you will be able to fly through space listening to remixes of the Earthbound album. The spaceship flies with the rhythm of the music, and your actions in the game will determine the how the songs in this app are remixed.   \nSoundTouch will use original interactive artwork by facebook muralist Jonathan Matas to unlock hidden content including, interviews and unreleased songs by CopperWire. SoundTouch will also include paintings, and sketches from other artists including illustrator Tanna Tucker. This widget will unlock a 20 page comic book written by DC comic writer and renowned sci-fi author Nnedi Okorafor based on CopperWire\u2019s Story.\nRemi(x) System\nWe utilize a system that binds musical elements to data using the rules that govern harmony and melody. The rearranging or changing of these data sets creates variations (remixes). We realized that every song at its core is an abstraction that exists as just one iteration of virtually infinite possibilities. We just try to account for as many of these possibilities as we can using a little bit of math, a fair amount of code, and a whole lot of experimentation. The Remi(x) system allows for literally any input data to be turned into musical variation; anything from the rotation of the Earth to how you\u2019re feeling today.\nIf want to see it in action check out the demo web app! (chrome only). \n\nStar Sounds\nJon Jenkins was kind enough to allow us the use of some of his stellar light curve sonifications. What are stellar light curve sonifications? Basically they are interpretations of the sounds of stars based on their brightness over time. Jon found certain stars which pulse at regular intervals (like a drum) and took this pulsing and transformed it into sounds. We take these sounds and modify them using a variety of synthesis and analysis techniques.The end result is a truly unique sonic landscape.\n\nAugmented Reality Game\nThe words \"copper wire\" written in Amharic are designed in such a way that it can function as an AR marker. Utilizing the Qualcomm AR toolkit Vuforia, the app reads the marker and pulls a 3D model of the CopperWire spaceship from a server that can be manipulated in real time in the Unity 3D Game Engine. From your perspective the spaceship actually appears in front of you. Once activated the ship then travels through a space tunnel and will encounter obstacles and bonus pickups that will create additional variations on the music using the Remi(x) system.\nHave a question about how something works? Or even about something else? Please, ask us a question! You'll be helping us, and everyone else who visits. You can message us, or use the link at the bottom of the page. \nWe're very excited to get started on this project but we need your help. We have a talented group of collaborators, experience in mobile and web development, and all the necessary pieces to put the puzzle together. We have basic prototypes for most of the pieces of the app but we still have a lot to do, we still have to...\ncreate the music\nrecord, mix & master\nturn star sounds into music\npurchase developer licenses\npay development costs\ndevelop the app itself (lots of code!)\nalpha & beta test\ndesign the comic book\ncreate the 3D models \nSome of these things cost money, some of them just take a lot of time...and time is money so pretty much we need money to cover the costs of producing a project of this scale.\nThe short answer is absolutely. The development team that will be working on Starbound has a broad spectrum of skill sets that include 3D modeling, graphic design, app development and musical composition experience that ranges from Hip Hop to Classical to Dubstep to Tech Metal. The lead developers Ellias Fullmore and Chris Coniglio have both studied generative and adaptive music and have applied the theories behind this process in several previous iterations that include a 180 degree projected video game, a generative music touch table game, music from brain waves, and an HTML5 web app that applies the concept of Musica Universalis to make musical compositions generated by the orbital motion of planets, moons and stars. As owner of AppSynth Media, Ellias has designed and produced (among other apps) a beta version of one of the elements of Starbound, Phone Home Remi(x) currently available on the app store. At this point in the process we have the enthusiastic support of an impressive list of graphic artists, scientists, musicians, network specialists, app developers, and most importantly fans who are just as excited about Starbound as we are.\nCopperWire - The Ethiopian American sci-fi Hip Hop group consisting of Senior TED Fellow, songwriter and cultural activist Meklit Hadero , Seattle underground hip hop legend Gabriel Teodros and rapper/ producer Burntface provide the lyrical content and inspiration behind StarBound \nChris Coniglio - Chris, producer of the Earthbound album, is a classically trained musician and computer programmer who is the technical wizard behind the code, design, and much of the musical composition behind Starbound.\nAppSynth Media - Ellias Fullmore AKA Burntface in addition to being a rapper/ producer is co-owner of AppSynth Media an Oakland based app development start up. AppSynth Media has collaborated with CopperWire in the past and is looking forward to working on the Starbound app.\nPortoFranco Records - PFR has been generous enough to be supportive of this experiment called Starbound. As the label explores news ways to be relevant in the age of \"free downloads\", owner Peter Varshavsky has been an invaluable resource.\nNnedi Okorafor - The award winning science fiction author has contributed an original story inspired by the Earthbound album and is considered an honorary member of CopperWire. She has helped to garner suppor for CopperWire among the sci-fi and comic book communities.\nDr. Jon Jenkins - Jon is an analyst at NASA Kelper labs, who has produced sonic light curves (the sound of stars) created using data from NASA's Kepler Spacecraft. Dr. Jenkins was been gracious enough to allow us to use his work to make \"star\" music.\nRay Gilstrap- Ray is a network engineer and acting CTO at NASA Ames Research Center, finishing his PhD. in Electrical Engineering. He is a data networking specialist who has volunteered his time and expertise as consultant on this project.    \nJon Matas - Jon is a painter, muralist at Facebook. He will be contributing artwork to the SoundTouch interactive art widget included in Starbound.\nTanna Tucker - Tanna is an illustrator, comic book artist and co-creator of Sea Wulfe, she will be providing original character designs inspired by the CopperWire science fiction story.\nYou- At the end of the day, you provide the input data and create your experience, without you there would be no Starbound.\nEven if you can\u2019t donate to the project you can help us out a lot by sharing the link to the kickstarter or the Remix Demo with your friends.

If you are drawing in Photoshop or Illustrator, we recommend exporting at 6000 px tall.\nPerfectly clear: Your image is 2700 px tall or greater. We can easily size it up from  this without any loss in quality.\nStill safe: You image is 1800 px tall or greater. We can scale it up and use some filters to get it to print clearly.\nIf you have a vector file, you can email that to us and we'll print from that for perfect sharpness. (We haven't figured out supporting vector files on the website yet.)\nDSLR photos are great.\nFor iPhone photos: Our benchmark is the highest size from the iPhone 4 camera, landscape orientation: 2592 x 1936. We have scaled this up and use some Photoshop filtering to get rid of any noise so it prints fine. \nWe have also printed a smaller photo...The nyc dress in the example above used an image that is 1600x1000px. It needed some more filtering to resize it up to printable resolution, but the end result still looked good. (Looks like a photo viewing as a dress, more watercolor-y if you examine the fabric.)\nAnything I should know about colors?\nLarge areas of black are not super black. The ink just doesn't get as black as dyed fabric does. Lines and smaller areas are fine--I've printed houndstooth--you just notice it if you have a large section of black.\nIs $10,000 really enough to do all of this?\n$10K is enough to get us started with an initial batch of preorders. We're quite handy with design and tech, so we're coding our own website and designing everything that goes with it, as well as sewing the initial samples. The funds will help us pay for studio space and materials so we can finish design and testing of the first styles.\nWith the preorder quantity, we can work with a garment production workshop in NYC that will sew the pieces with the best professional standards. Since every piece is unique, we're not doing the traditional wholesale order process that's standard in the industry. But fortunately we can make great use of local sample production.\nWe're getting the fabric printed with a supplier, so we are not budgeting for an industrial grade printer. If this Kickstarter exceeds our expectations, then we can get our own printer much earlier, which means faster order fulfillment times for everyone. \nYou guys seem familiar...\nLast year, we put our project, \"Continuum: Computational Couture\" on Kickstarter. We didn't reach our goal, but we got lots of positive feedback, and have taken that to refine our idea to create CONSTRVCT. Our earlier project was a little more art, and Constrvct is a little more product, but they both center around the same idea of interactive fashion design.

We have met our goal! Thank you all so very much for making this happen. The support and love we've been feeling has been overwhelming.\nBut we're not done yet! Because our $16,000 goal was set conservatively, we do encourage our supporters to keep spreading the word and pledging. Our budget estimate was set to the absolute minimum to make Drag Dad possible, and we could still use more help. Any funds raised beyond our goal would go towards making the film even greater, including:\nExpanding our shoot schedule to capture more material with James and Jeremiah.\nUpgrading our equipment rental package to include the very best tools with which to make this film.\nHiring an award-winning post-production team to to make the final product something we can all, as backers and supporters, be proud of.\nPurchasing Errors and Omissions Insurance to be able to move the film into the theatrical and broadcast medium.\nSubmitting to more high profile international film festivals (this is costlier than you'd think!).\nStrengthening our marketing and distribution efforts to help this film and its message reach as large an audience as we can.\nABOUT THE FILM\n\"Having Jeremiah when I was 17 saved my life.\" -James William Ross, IV (aka Tyra Sanchez)\nDrag Dad is an independent documentary project about a six year old boy named Jeremiah and his father, the drag queen superstar named Tyra Sanchez. In 2010, Tyra Sanchez won the popular reality show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, propelling Tyra and her creator James into stardom.\nCapturing both the everyday and the sensational aspects of James\u2019 dual existence as a drag queen and a parent, the film will examine James\u2019s experience of leading these two contrastive lifestyles. What is it like for Jeremiah to have a dad who is sometimes a man and sometimes a woman? Is James any different a dad because he works as a female impersonator?\nFilmed in an observational cinema verit\u00e9 style, Drag Dad will combine interviews with James, Tyra and Jeremiah, and footage of their everyday domestic lives in Atlanta to gain an in-depth view into this unique LGBT family.\n\"It's like Will Smith's father-son flick, The Pursuit of Happiness, only in lipstick and a bigger wig.\" omgblog.com\n\"We're falling in love with Drag Dad!\" -thefrisky.com\nAlso featured on jezebel.com, walltowatch.com,  gay.net, passportmagazine.com, Los Angeles news KTLA 5's Sunday Edition Show, Icelandic News Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 and RUV, and the Twitter feed of the queen of queens, RuPaul!\nWHY DOES THIS FILM NEED TO BE MADE?\nMost Americans today still believe children should only be raised by a man and a woman. As filmmakers, we feel a need to break down the idea that some parents are somehow better than others because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We think it\u2019s important to show those who hold prejudices against LGBT families that these things do not define what makes a good parent. It shouldn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re gay, straight, a Wall Street broker or drag performer. Love and dedication to your child defies all labels. We\u2019ve seen James and Jeremiah together, and the sweet nature of their relationship. We want to bring that relationship to the screen.\nJames stopped by in New York City recently to perform as Tyra Sanchez, and we were lucky enough to tag along and film Tyra\u2019s adventures for a couple nights (some of which you can see in the above videos). Most Drag Race fans will grant that James is an electric presence on stage. But, from having spent time with him for this first part of filming, we have seen that he is an always engaging, always entertaining character-- and such a great subject for the kind of documentary we want to make.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nTo make this film, we need to raise money to travel with a small crew to Atlanta to film James and Jeremiah in their home environment. We have worked out that $16,000 is the absolute minimum amount to make this film possible. This all goes towards making the film, not to the filmmaker himself. The Kickstarter goal covers the production of the film, post-production, promotions, festival submissions and everything in between.\nYour contributions will go toward:\nProduction: equipment rentals, insurance and taking a small, dedicated team of filmmakers to Atlanta (budget travel, economic lodging and cheap food)\nPost-production: editing, sound mixing, grading\nPromotions/distribution: marketing the film, reaching out to press and communities, film festival submissions and travel. We want this film and its message to reach as large an audience as possible!\nYOUR REWARDS!\nFor making this film possible, we have arranged a fabulous set of rewards for contributors to show our appreciation. With the generous cooperation of Tyra Sanchez herself, we are able to offer you exclusive goodies such as signed photo books and posters, limited edition DVDs, video drag lessons from Tyra, Tyra memorabilia, and even the opportunity for Tyra to personally \u201cdragatize\u201d you and perform at your party, which we\u2019ll film! All contributors will receive a password to stream the film, and all pledges $10 and over will receive a digital download of the film upon its release.\nWe hope you can tell how very excited the filmmakers and James are about making this project happen, and we hope you are too! \nThank you so much for your support!

It was an idea that I'd never seen done before and would love to make myself.\nWhen I first thought of the idea for making this short, I thought that it would be best shot in live action and then 3D tracked, with the letters animated and composited in 3D in post-production. I have experience in 3D tracking, compositing, shooting, and some 3D modeling but I needed extra help with the animation to really make things look right, so I decided to turn to kickstarter for help. With help from the kickstarter community I should have no trouble at all putting together an amazingly fun and entertaining short film.    \nAll funding will go towards creating the most amazing 3D short animated film about text coming to life and battling that I can possibly make. There will be explosions, ink splattering, and most likely comic sans is going to get blown to bits at some point. I'll be using the funding from this project to hire an additional animator and compositor to help with the workload. I will also be hiring a composer to help score the piece properly, and the rest of the funding will go towards the purchase of equipment to shoot and edit the piece. \nDonating also means you can feel good about supporting independent film-making...but honestly, that only goes so far. So, as a reward for your investment I've spent a lot of time designing and producing some very cool stuff to give back. These prints and T-shirts will be limited edition and will only be available through kickstarter. I hope you have as much fun wearing them as I had designing them. \n\"Helveteran\" and \"Arial Squad\" are both printed on high-quality next-level apparel tri-blend shirts in various styles and colors shown above (as well as printed in grey). I chose the tri-blend shirt as it is incredibly soft and comfortable, but also durable and a great cut. These shirts will be awesome, and if you're at a party wearing one, most people, including myself, will have a hard time not making out with you. That's not a threat, it's a promise. \n\"Arial Attack on Inky Hill 64\" is printed on a well-cut 100 percent cotton next level apparel shirt. It is a discharge print so it's extremely soft after washing and has a high amount of detail. The design has some of the history of Helvetica and Arial hidden in the text as well as a few printing tools and some other Easter eggs that will be fun to find as you wear it. It too has the power to make you ridiculously attractive at parties. Use it wisely. Note: there may be minor tweaks in the design before printing as I am a perfectionist at heart and want to make the best shirt possible for you. \nThis is an 11x17 limited edition \"War is helvetica\" poster print. It will be shipped, signed, and numbered as well. If you take it to a party, people might make out with you. I'm just saying, it could happen. \nHey, thank you for viewing my Kickstarter project. Even if you decided to not invest, I just wanted to say thanks for stopping by. Also, If you see a friend or loved one in need of some nerdy design apparel, you know where to point them. Everybody has a birthday, and they hate you when you get them socks. They smile and seem grateful, but really they hate you. So, stock up on cool stuff while you can. Thanks for your help.  \n1. How will I order the right shirt, color, and size? \nWhen my goal is reached and the kickstarter project is over, I will send out a order form to fill out depending on what level of rewards you chose. \n2. How do I know you're not just going to take all the money, go to Vegas, and put it all on red? \nBecause everyone knows you put it on black....No, no, I kid. I am extremely dedicated to this project. The preparation for it, believe it or not, has taken months, and I'm sticking with it until I can sit back and watch an amazing short film, just like the one I envisioned when this idea was first conceived. Your dollars will go to good use. \n3. Did you really write a book called \"Hey is that Dan Schreiner? Or just a tree wearing glasses?\" I can't find it on amazon.  \n No, the ideas in it were too dangerous to publish. \n4. Why is the due date for the actual production set to March of 2013? \nThis film is going to be deliciously difficult to produce and at the moment I'm on another video project that will take a lot of my production focus until later in the summer. On top of this, I really want the animation in the film to be smooth and convey a fun story and that may take some time. Finally  I want to have a really cool musical score to tie things together which pushes back the date I can deliver this piece. Even in a short film format, a production like this will take time. I want to deliver a quality piece for you guys, not something rushed and hobbled together. Here, have a hug, we're going to get through the wait together. Believe me, I want to see it just as bad as you do. If things clear up or if time allows I will try and push production forward as much as I can without sacrificing quality.\n5.

It was the first time I'd seen a place where people all over the world could post their ideas and get the backing of a really awesome community. I started studying it, wondering what attributes would make a project successful, what might cause them to miss their funding. There were all sorts of anomalies and different projects, but I decided that to see something become successful you would have to offer your backers something really special and heartfelt, something original, and unique. I was riding the red line in Chicago looking at all of the street art, stencils, and graffiti and I thought to myself, \"What would you do if you were a street artist?\" I came up with an idea about typefaces fighting and set to work in the middle of a web conference designing a first draft of what eventually became the arial attack on inky hill 64 shirt. I kept building on this idea, kept pushing myself to build a project that I would want to see on Kickstarter, to make rewards that I would want to have, so I kept designing, building other shirts and posters. I eventually went through about 5 drafts of the arial attack shirt before I even posted the project, I went to a local screen printer to do a test print. to make sure it was even possible. The printer was perplexed by why I was going through the trouble until he saw the design. \"Holy Shit.\" he said, \"That's crazy. You're crazy. We can't do that\" But we built a prototype and did it anyway (it's one I'm wearing right now) and after that I updated the design to print cleaner and better.

Detroit is aflame with controversy after the Detroit Lions announce that the popular Canadian band Nickelback will be the halftime entertainment.  A petition threatens to tear the city AND the NFL apart.  Only one band can heal this rift...\n\nFLASH FORWARD TO PRESENT DAY:  Viral internet sensation A Motown Tribute to Nickelback finds itself on a bill alongside The Tragically Hip, Chromeo, Charles Bradley, and others at Virgin Mobile's Live at Squamish in August.  Only one problem...they aren't a \"real\" band... YET.\n\nSince the announcement in May, the band has taken huge strides towards legitimacy by showing up to do a photo shoot and creating a Facebook page.  Only one hurdle remains:  a studio album of Motown-styled Nickelback covers.  This is where YOU come in. \n\nWe're asking for your help to cover the studio and licensing costs involved in creating a full-length CD of Nickelback hits- each one painstakingly transformed via the classic Motown sound.  \n\n\nHelp A Motown Tribute to Nickelback pay tribute to legendary modern rock icons...by redo-ing all of their songs so that they sound like classic Motown tunes instead. \n\n\nA Motown Tribute to Nickelback on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/motownnickelback\nThe video that started it all:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KzP4bC1Ypg\nLive At Squamish:    http://liveatsquamish.com/lineup\n\nThe Road to Squamish documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GywZxUonEcw\nAn interview with Scott Bradlee: http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/11/scott_bradlee_nickelback_cover_motown_detroit_thanksgiving.php\n\n\nOFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY:\nThe brainchild of NYC pianist/arranger Scott Bradlee, A Motown Tribute to Nickelback offers an alternative take on Nickelback\u2019s recorded legacy by painstakingly converting the Canadian modern rock band\u2019s entire oeuvre into authentic Motown styles of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. A Motown Tribute to Nickelback rose to prominence in November of 2011, in response to an internet petition protesting Nickelback\u2019s scheduled performance at the Detroit Lions\u2019 Thanksgiving Day halftime show. The band\u2019s debut video, a tambourine-heavy cover of \u201cHow You Remind Me,\u201d quickly achieved notoriety on the internet as a means to satisfy both Nickelback fans and anti-fans. The band has been featured in media outlets such as The Huffington Post, the Village Voice, and the Vancouver Sun, and was described as \u201ckiller\u201d on Nickelback\u2019s official Twitter feed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "A Motown Tribute to Xmas", "update_content": "Hey folks,\n    Last year at this time, I was calling Drue, Allan, Tim, Adam, and Steve to tell them to show up at my place at 9pm to film a cover of a Nickelback song.

We specialize in creating new and innovative music by combining various genres (classical, pop, etc) and incorporating comedy skits and choreography when we perform live.  We have had requests for an album but have not had the means to produce something of high quality thus far. Our group would like to create an album in order to share our music with a wider audience and to break the barriers between previously separate fields of music.\nWhere will all the money go?\nIn order to make this album, we first need to pay for a recording studio and engineer.  With a studio and engineer, we can have our audio professionally recorded and mixed into a highly listenable CD.  \nBecause we have so many arrangements of popular songs, we also have to pay a hefty sum to purchase copyrights to legally record our arrangements.  Each song can cost hundreds of dollars.  Some of these arrangements are our most requested and we would love to bring them to you!  (These include, but are not limited to: Lady Gaga Saga, Gotye's Somebody That I Used to Know, Fireflies by Owl City, Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap, Forget You! by Cee Lo Green, and many more!)  \nWe also will use funds for travel so we can meet up at the recording studio and make the album.\nWhy support our project?\nWe love making music and bringing entertaining pieces to you in a way that you might never have heard before.  Your donation will not only help us realize our project (to make an epic album!), but it will also go towards knocking down that line between classical and popular music.  What better way to join both genres than a bassoon quartet playing classical, popular, and original works?!\nWe can't do this project without all of you - if we fall short of our goal, we won't receive any of the pledged money (everyone gets refunds) - so thank you thank you thank you!  Please send this page along to anyone and everyone who has ever listened to, loved, or made music.  Thank you so much for your time and help!  \nLook below for more detailed information about our project.

You will be asked to enter your pledge amount and select a reward.  Then, you will be prompted to complete the purchase with Amazon.  If our project is successfully funded, your card will be charged when we reach the funding deadline.  Please contact us if you need help!\nMore Information and Details:\nWhy did we come to Kickstarter?\nThe album is going to be a compilation of a wide array of music, but a lot of what goes on the CD will depend on how much support we receive from YOU.  On Kickstarter, if we meet our fundraising goal, we receive every penny we raise!  The more we surpass our goal, the more songs we can do.  \nWhy is that?  For all the popular tunes, we will be recording someone else's copyrighted music.  Copyright is a really wonderful thing for musicians because it means that others cannot legally reproduce or sell their work without providing some type of compensation.  When we ask for donations, a large chunk of them will go toward other artists' copyright fees and permission to record.  If we go beyond our goal, we can record more popular songs and make a more comprehensive album.  \nAlso, the more support we get, the more studio time we can have.  When we put money towards studio time, we are not only paying to use the space, but we are also renting the recording equipment and a technician to mix the tracks. So the more money we raise, the longer we will be in the studio perfecting our performance and potentially recording extra tracks!  (Bonus features, anybody?)\nWhy do we do what we do?\nBecause we love it!  That goes without saying, but we have a number of other reasons to perform, present, and teach.  First, we feel fulfilled when we know that others are smiling, laughing, or thinking because of our performance.  Wherever we perform, we always have audience members come up to us and tell us how much they enjoyed it.  They hear some songs they know, some they don't know, and learn more about their own preferences!  We also get to raise musical awareness.  That is, we show the public that a seemingly stuffy and stodgy instrument like the bassoon can be fun, inspiring, and play more than just the Mozart Concerto.  We love all kinds of music, and introducing new textures and styles to audiences via the bassoon helps us break down the barrier between classical, popular, rock, jazz, and other genres.  With the production of this album, we hope to spread our reach and touch new audiences. \nWhat is an arrangement, and how do we write one?\nUnlike a composition, an arrangement is essentially a rewrite of a pre-existing song, but for our instrument.  If you've ever listened to something on the radio and then figured it out on piano, cello, or kazoo (or jammed with your garage band!) that's basically an arrangement.  For us, writing an arrangement begins with hearing a song that we really like and would love to play.  This can be anything!  We listen to the song over and over, paying special attention to the melody (in pop music that's usually the singer and sometimes the lead guitar) and the bass line (this is often the bass guitar and sometimes piano).  These are usually the two easiest voices to hear in a song.  Once we are familiar with them, we go to a piano or bassoon and start figuring out the pitches.  (If you want to do your own, you can use any instrument at all.  It can be a bit tricky at first, but if you keep at it, it gets easier!)  When the bass line and melody are written out, we listen to the inner voices.  These are the remaining voices that don't fit either the bass or melodic lines.  A lot of times they are guitar riffs or little fillers throughout the song.  Once those are written in, the writing process is done!  For us, the next step is clear--just grab a few friends and jam out to a brand new arrangement!  \nIf you have any other questions, comments, suggestions, please don't hesitate to write at thebreakingwinds@gmail.com.
