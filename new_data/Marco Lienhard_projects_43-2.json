Projects often have trouble completing production and meeting the expected deadlines for shipment. The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product or packaging does not meet our requirements. However, we will personally be in charge of assembling and shipping all of the pledge rewards as soon as we reach our goal. Our last project was fortunate enough to deliver earlier than expected for most backers. Our team is experienced and has been preparing for months to ensure that post-funding will be like clockwork when the time comes.\nAlthough we do not see any direct risks and challenges, there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during the process of productions. We hope to run everything as streamlined as possible and also ahead of schedule. Like most small businesses, we face a challenge when trying to offer affordable pricing while postage rates are continually rising. Furthermore, due to lack of infrastructure and transport from the global pandemic, reliability in shipments have plummeted resulting in increased costs and losses.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe've designed this wallet to last longer than our BANDO 2.0!

The storage capacity can be upgraded by simply exchanging the SSD module in the future.  \nThis model does not have a built-in SSD storage. \nYou can add your own:\n- external USB Drive or\n- M.2 2280 SSD module to use as your storage. \n\nFor example, if you plug in a 2TB drive, then you will have 2TB storage space. \n* Diskless model also comes with the M.2 SSD connector on it.

We have shipped the first version of Monument to users from 120 different countries and gained an invaluable experience. \n\nIf we experience any difficulties along the way, we will be as transparent as possible and communicate every detail in a timely manner. \n\n- Software Development \nIf you were a part of Monument 1 campaign, you may have experienced difficulties with our initial software. Thanks to our early supporters, we have improved the overall experience significantly. \n\nWhile the software architecture for Monument 2 is developed from the ground up, we're using a significant portion of the existing code base which is pretty stable. Monument 2 software is currently in internal beta testing. The foundation of the client apps is based on our existing software and we've been testing them internally. We are not expecting delays with the Monument 2 software. \n\nAdditionally, we will ship review devices to our beta users before the mass production starts. Doing so, we can ensure the software meets our expectations before we start shipping all rewards.\n\n- Manufacturing \nThe hardware development of the Monument 2 is complete and the design is verified. We're working with our existing manufacturing partners and they're ready to continue with the production once the certification is complete. \n\n- Fulfillment \nWe have an ongoing fulfillment operation and been shipping Monument worldwide. However, due to COVID 19, we have been observing delays with certain carriers and changing regulations depending on the destination due to lockdowns. This may result in additional delays for these regions.

We\u2019ve even looked at different curvatures to come up with the evenest lighting we can get in a compact space. Our LED system guarantees that all your microgreens will grow to a beautifully uniform height for maximum yield.\n  Why Pink Light?  \nThere's a good reason you'll find pink lights in many indoor commercial farms, and Micro is no different. Using LED's that target the specific wavelengths of light where plants are the most efficient at their photosynthetic process allows us to be more effective with the lighting as well as use less power.\nThe Power of Modular Design\nEvery Micro has zero holes that you have to plug something into. Instead, they magnetically snap together, securely transmitting power to each other.\n\n        All this is possible because of the Power plate which is the base of your stackable garden. But wait... The power plates are stackable too! Magnetically snap another one and make your garden taller.\n The Story Behind Agriolabs and the Micro\n S T R E T C H   GOALS\nStretch goals are reward tiers that become available for purchase or are automatically applied to applicable rewards.\n\nIncluded Performance USB Chargers - Applied to Quad Stacks | Unlocks at $13,000\nWith the Agriolabs Performance USB charger, you can ensure that your quad stack will always be performing at its best without any dimming or loss of power. All Quad stacks and above will automatically have these added to their rewards when we surpass $13k!\n\nSeedpad Include Label Stickers - All Tiers Containing Seedpads | Unlocks at $20,000\nKeep track of whats in each micro, especially if you have stacks of them. We make these stickers in house, just like everything else. Every Seedpad will come with a label sticker.\n\nDishwasher Safe Water Drawer & Removable Drawer Fronts - All Micros | Unlocks at $30,000\nWanna keep an eye on your microgreens as they grow? Simply remove the front of the drawer after the microgreens have sprouted (doing this before may result in poor sprouting due to lower humidity). \nWhile the drawer water reservoir isn't that hard to clean with a sponge and some soap,  we'll make it extra easy by making it dishwasher safe. Just throw it on the top rack of your dishwasher and wash as normal! Easy peasy. \n\nTruly Wireless Powerplate - CAD$35 | Unlocks at $50,000\nThe Powerplate requires power via a USB-C Cable... Or does it? With the Wireless Powerplate, the Powerplate itself can be the power source for your Micro's. Simply charge it up, stack your Micro(s) on top, and it'll last you long enough to grow a delicious bed of microgreens. This add-on will allow you to have true freedom. Want to grow microgreens under your sink? Behind your toilet? On the top shelf of a secret closet? We won't judge, go wild, enjoy that absolute freedom.\nWe have some plans and drawings but haven't done all the calculations to finalize this design yet, but we'll make it happen if you make us!\n\nInjection Molded Shell - Automatically Applied to all Micros | Unlocks at $100,000\nThe Micro is full of intricate details that all work together, and most of those details are impossible to injection mold. The outer shell is not one of them. \nWhat's injection molding though!? Injection molding is type of manufacturing where plastic material is melted, and injected into a metal mold. The mold cools and a solid plastic part is formed. Injection molding is how much plastic items are made and is known to have good surface quality, depending on the machine/finishing process.\nAlthough our 3D printed build quality is not that far off from injection molded plastic, the outer shell of the Micro actually takes the longest to print. It's full of broad simple shapes that injection molding would do a fantastic job of creating. Thus injection molding our shell will result in a more consistent build, and quicker fulfillment. It'll also allow our specialized 3D printers focus on what they're good at.\n\nWant to see more stretch goals? We're open to ideas. Chat With Us\n\nLet's Go Hyperlocal... Wait, What Does That Mean?\nTraditional agriculture is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions worldwide. Growing \u201chyper-local\u201d means your food doesn\u2019t have to travel thousands of miles to reach you and cuts out unnecessary middlemen all while delivering you healthier, more affordable food. This is our first step to making hyper-local the new normal.\nDid you know the average North American throws out about $2000 of food a year?\n        A majority of that food waste is organic content which produces methane gas, which is 25x more damaging than carbon dioxide.\nHyper-locally grown food reduces the demand for less sustainably grown produce, as well as tasting better and staying fresh much longer, reducing the amount of organic waste going to the landfill.\nBeautiful, Sustainable Design\n  ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING  \nIs a term for when you add material when creating something instead of taking away material like subtractive manufacturing.\n\n        The most commonly known form of additive manufacturing is 3D printing, which is used in most components of our products with a special high-quality, high-strength version of the bio-polymer called polylactic acid (PLA).\n  SUSTAINABLE TO ITS CORE  \nYour contribution to less global waste doesn\u2019t just start at your first harvest. With additive manufacturing and high quality, compostable bioplastics, it begins the moment you invest in an Agriolabs product.\n  HOW DOES IT WORK?  \nLike nature, 3D Printing builds layer by layer, until the finished product is done. This efficient process allows us to use our material to its greatest extent and minimize waste which is good for the environment and our pockets\n    THE CHALLENGE.  \nTime. 3D printing takes a long time compared to more traditional forms of additive manufacturing like injection molding.\n\n        However, with our print farm growing and constant advances in technology, we are slowly reaching up to the speeds of traditional manufacturing processes.\n\n        We strive to have the best surface finish on all 3D printed parts, whether that means post-processing or working with our material supply partners & polymer engineers to source innovative materials to further improve the visual and structural quality.\n\nThe Humans Behind Agriolabs\nBragging isn't really our style, but we aren't lying when we say we've got the most amazing team ever. Agriolabs was made to tackle big problems by leveraging awesome technology and out of the box thinking. Everyone in the team is a natural problem solver in their own way and we all share the same mission to do good, sustainably. We start with the MICRO as our first step in our mission to get more people eating what they grow, reducing their waste output and carbon footprint. \n\nWhat we'll do with your support:\nYou've decided to support us with your hard earned money, you can bet that we'll use it wisely. From creating jobs, helping reduce food waste, or building vertical farms in the oceans, know that you're supporting a innovative startup that is willing to take massive action. \n Are you looking for the stretch goals here? You'll find them about 3 sections up :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy are seedpads Canada only?\n\nOur seedpads contain organic seeds embedded in hemp fibre mats and covered. This means that most departments of agriculture will NOT allow them to be imported as they are unable to identify the seeds easily, as well as the possibility of certain species being invasive, and other reasons. \nAt this time we are only offering our Canadian backers seedpads in order to keep fulfillment running as smoothly as possible.\n\n\nFulfillment time & process:\n\nWe're looking at being able to fulfill most units within the next 4-6 months of the Kickstarter completing. \nWe'll be fulfilling units of earlier backers first, so if you backed our project on the last day, that's still fantastic and you'll still receive your reward, but it may take longer than some other backers. \n\nWith the pandemic still going strong, please understand that there may be delays in the global shipping system. \n\nBackers's rewards will be organized and processed through our online store system, so you will receive details (such as tracking #'s) regarding your package and shipment by email or text from our site. \n\n\nThe more we raise the quicker fulfillment will be:\n\nSurpassing the goal by large amounts will allow us to bring more processes in house instead of sourcing them internationally. Allowing us to:\n- Bring bio-plastic resins in house where they will be processed, extruded, and used in manufacturing all under the same roof. \n- Get more, higher quality printers and exponentially increase production. \n- Create some jobs! We'll likely be hiring someone to help automate the assembly line, someone to manage our print farm, and another position as well. \n- Get some awesome universal robots to help our staff do all the heavy lifting & repetitive processes quicker and safer.\n\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n2020 has been an extremely unpredictable year so far, and we have no idea what to expect with our fulfillment window extending into 2021. \n\nNo matter what happens though, you had our backs and we'll have yours. Expect frequent updates and reports from our founding team. Our goal is to be as transparent and authentic with our backers as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Micro has a extremely durable build. You probably won't be dropping your garden a lot, but if you do, it'll survive the fall. \nThe Micro is easy to clean with some soap, water, and a sponge. Allowing you to use and re-use it year after year.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith a durable build of over 85% biodegradable & compostable material, the micro will last as long as you will. \nHowever, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose.\nSustainable materials\nThe main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing & packing our own products. \nThis ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper.\nSomething else\nThe very nature of our product is carbon negative.

The problem is fabric mask itself, regardless cotton or polyester made one, does not have the capability to filter small particles. On average, fabric masks can only filter up to 20% of the airborne particles in the air.\nIn plain word, fabric masks alone is not good enough. Filter is needed to add the filtering capability to fabric masks. However, filters comes with different sizes and shape, which means you might need to pair a specific mask to a specific filter. \nEarth Filter Solution\nEarth Filter is created to add filtering capability to your current fabric masks, or any fabric you are wearing. \nEvery Earth Filter is made with 4 layers of top quality filtering materials, which provide filtering ability to N95 standard.\nWith our patented pending Earth Filter tap design, the mask can easily attached to your current fabric masks and add filtering ability immediately.\nEasily Uplift Your Current Fabric Mask\nEven on scarf!!\nWe need your support - and we are offering a awesome launch deal on Kickstarter!\nTo make Earth filter possible commerically, we need your support to reach a reasonable scale for us to negotiate with suppliers.

We have to reduce our mass production.\nWe need more durable products\n  This is why we created Scrubbio: to replace all similar and single-use products with only a simple product, thereby considerably reducing our production.\nThis product replaces many other products in your home and will decrease global production. You could also keep it and use it for years. Scrubbio is made with a recyclable & ultra-durable silicone. \nWe must reduce our production of products to save nature. We have to produce durable and recyclable items easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo FUN!

Having been able to compare a diverse range of pros and cons, we have chosen an experienced, reliable, top quality manufacturer based in the EU and we've agreed on all key terms with them such as lead times, minimum order quantities, terms of quality assurance and pricing. \nWe are, however, not dependant on one manufacturer and we have a sound contingency plan. There might be no planet B, but we definitely have Plan B should there be a delay. \n\nShipping\nOur ultimate goal is to ensure that no US and EU based backer pays any import duties, taxes or other charges on top of their pledge. We have found a fulfilment partner who will help us deliver on that goal.\n\nTiming\nOur timeline published above includes some leeway for unexpected events, except COVID-19 and any other force majeure.\n\nCOVID-19\nOur delivery schedule assumes manufacturing capability of our supplier currently affected by COVID-19 delays returns back to normal by mid-May. We will be closely monitoring the situation and provide you with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAirBag\u2122 has been designed to last a lifetime. We've intentionally chosen a more expensive manufacturer because we want to be 100% sure that we offer quality to support our claim. We've chosen a special, high-strength and durability material and added ripstop technology to make it significantly less prone to ripping and tearing.\nReusability and recyclability\nAirBag\u2122 is made from partially recycled material and it is fully recyclable (at least in the EU and UK).\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe have compared a number of factories in Asia and Europe and the decision is to proceed with a factory in the EU, which meets a number of criteria from carbon offsetting, fair wages, meeting EU environmental standards etc.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhenever available, shipping will be carbon neutral (currently we can guarantee this for customers in the EU and we'll be aiming for the same for orders from the USA as a matter of priority). All shipping will be 100% plastic free.\nSomething else\nFor every bag sold we will help protect a slice of precious wildlife habitat through the World Land Trust's 'Buy An Acre' scheme, best represented by their patron Sir David Attenborough.

Our unique, patented, two-candles-in-one design started with the idea that you could create a candle without the wasted wax left over from burning traditional candles. The idea is simple. Why not move the wick from the center of the candle out to the outer edge? Now you\u2019re burning the side of the candle that normally ends up in the garbage. As the candle burns, the sides flow into the middle leaving you with a cozy, wood wick candle at the end.\nWe started Spiral Light in our garage in 2017.  The demand for candles has grown faster than we could ever have imagined possible. This leaves us with no choice but to seek out a new, larger facility and create custom machines to help make enough candles to keep up with demand.  This Kickstarter campaign means we don't need to \"sell out\" to investors or handcuff ourselves to big banks/venture capital firms. This enables us to continue focusing on independent retailers and resisting the demands to put our candles in big box stores or on Amazon. Don't get us wrong, we like our \"Prime\" too. We just also like shopping local and our candles give stores an exclusive product they can sell without fear of being undercut.\nTo find out more about us and to try some for yourself, click Back This Project. Or read on to hear more of our story.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n Unique Design:\nSpiral Light's unique design burns in a circle for the first three hours, filing in its hollow core. This is our \"Party Trick!\"\nLong Burning Time:\nWhen the hollow center is completely filled and the spiral portion burns out, you're left with a wood wick candle that you can enjoy for over 40 hours. That's the \"Real\" candle.\n Clean Burning: \nWhat's the recipe for a clean burning candle? It's a highly refined, food-grade, edible (please don't eat it) wax perfectly matched to the right sized, 100% cotton wick. It is phthalate-free scent oils mixed with vegetable-based colorants finished off with a locally sourced, softwood wick.\nGreat Scents:\nWe work hard to make sure every candle smells great. It starts with a bit of an obsession, add a little love and just a touch of family disagreement and voila, you have our candle scents. Seriously, we work with some of the best scent companies in the United States to bring you great smelling candles without the nasty chemicals.\nHandcrafted in the U.S.A\nUnlike a lot of candles, ours are all made in the United States from raw materials sourced right here in the U.S.  While we've been able to modify equipment to help us pour our candles faster, everyone of our candles is still hand-manufactured by our family and employees in our facility in Minnesota.\n\n\nWe could have just been happy that one of our candles actually worked and set off to make a million of them but we didn't.  We have three different sizes and burn times so that everyone can afford to try a Spiral Light and make them their favorite \"go-to\" gift item.\n\nWe can climb the highest mountain and scream out all the great things about Spiral Light Candles. But, in the end, we are only as good as what our backers think.  We know we have a great product that people will love but it sure is nice to see it in writing.\n\nLoyal to the Local Store\nIf we had a dollar for every time someone asked us when we are going to \"Sell out\" to the big candle industry or show up on Shark Tank, we wouldn't need to look for backers. We are driven to remain the champions of smaller, independent retailers across the Country. We can do this without investors, without big box stores and without Amazon. Just our family, our friends and our backers making a great product for great people.\nManufacturing Capacity\nOur Existing Factory  \nWhen we started this adventure just over two years ago, we took a huge leap of faith and built out our current 2,500 square feet manufacturing space and small retail store. While it served us well at the time, It's already too small.\n\nThe New Space\nThis is the new home of Spiral Light Candles. At almost 8,000 square feet, we now have the space necessary to grow.  We need your help to bring in the new equipment and hire the people that will help us keep up with the growing demand.\n\nNot sure how this whole Kickstarter thing works? Read on.\nTo help us get the new factory up and running, you must become a \"backer\" of this Kickstarter project.

The good news is we have been making these candles for well over two years. We don't need your help to make a candle, we need your help to grow into a national brand without selling out to the big box stores or venture capitalists. While the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created a complicated environment for a lot of small businesses, we have managed to stay lean throughout our entire growth spurt. We do this by paying for everything we use upfront and we have managed to stay debt free through it all. We will survive and with your support we will use this time to grow stronger.\n \nYour help ensures that we can grow to meet the demand necessary to stay independent and to continue to sell our super cool candles through independent retailers without the need to sell out. \n\nA lot of Kickstarter projects get tripped up during the shipping and fulfillment stage. Believe me, after this last Holiday season we've got this covered. We have the right tools and people in place to make it work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur candles are by nature a consumable item. We do however get our long burn time by utilizing an extremely hard wax.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur unique candle design was invented with very idea that we could completely use all the wax that is normally wasted in a traditional candle. When burned correctly there should be nothing to throw away except a tiny sliver of wax and a recyclable steel clip. With no jar, there is no glass to dispose of and the light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.\n\nWe package all our candles in recyclable kraft paper boxes and ship only using starch based packing peanuts and 100% recyclable shipping boxes.\nSustainable materials\nOur packaging is manufactured from recycled kraft paper. Our wax is a food grade, edible wax (please don't eat it). We use 100% sustainable cotton and softwood wicks. Our scent oils and vegetable based colorants contain no toxins nor California Prop 65 components providing a very clean burning final product.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur new space uses LED lighting and a brand new and efficient heating and cooling system. We work very hard to keep our footprint as small as possible.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.

Most of the problems such as fire, charging error and slow charging during wireless charging are actually due to unstable modules.\n Module can be charged even at a distance of 7mm\n\n1PICK supports up to 10W of wireless charging.\nIt requires 15W wireless charging functionality for both transmitter and receiver to be fully compatible for normal 15W wireless charging. The fact that the wireless charger supports 15W does not mean that all smartphones will be 15W wireless charging and even smartphones that support 15W wireless charging may vary depending on the 'standard' used. Even though the smartphone manufacture's 'original specification' has 15W fast wireless charging technology, most third-party wireless chargers do not charge 15W.\nIn short, most wireless charger specs you know and buy are 15W, but there is no difference in actual charging speed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n5 years ago, in spring 2016, there was a product that I created with the idea of adding wireless charger to the magnet holder, the most convenient form. I thought, 'Let's use it until the right ready-made product came out'. So I decided to commercialize it myself and now I am trying to do more testing, research, hard work to make the right product because it is a product that many people should use.\nWe made our first appearance 1PICK through Kickstarter.\nMost of the funding amount will be used for the development and mass production of 1PICK, Other funds will be used for the development of subsequent 1PICK products.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "1PICK 1EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assis arm + Cable + Absorption Mount\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nAssist Arm\nBlowhole Mount\nCable\nAbsorption Mount\nAdhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["91 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Early Bird Couple Pack : 1PICK 2EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + CD Slot Mount\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 1PICK\n4\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n2\u00d7 Assist Arm\n2\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n2\u00d7 Cable\n2\u00d7 CS Slot Mount\n2\u00d7 Adhesive Mount\nPower Outlet", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers", "Limited (1 left of 30)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 59 or more", "title": "1PICK Couple Pack 2EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + Absorption Mount+ Power Outlet\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 1PICK\n5\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n2\u00d7 Assist Arm\n2\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n2\u00d7 Cable\n2\u00d7 Absorption Mount\n2\u00d7 Adhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["63 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "1PICK Family Pack", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + Absorption Mount + Power Outlet\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 1PICK\n10\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n4\u00d7 Assist Arm\n4\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n4\u00d7 Cable\n4\u00d7 Absorption Mount\nPower Outlet\n4\u00d7 Adhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird : Simple Pack", "descp": "1PICK + Power Outlet + 1PICK Plates\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nPower Outlet\nCable\nAssist Arm", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Early Bird : 1PICK 1EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Asist arm + Cable + CD Slot Mount\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nBlowhole Mount\nAssist Arm\nCable\nCS Slot Mount\nAdhesive Mount\nPower Outlet", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "30 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "New Update", "update_content": "Hello Dear Supporters!\nFirst of all, I am really, really sorry for the late response.\nWhile producing 1PICK magnetic holder, we found the critical bug!\nSome mobile phones cannot be held on exact position because of the inner charger and camera etc."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Good news!

The top finial also features fine knurled details on the outside.\nThe standard stainless steel nib can also be upgraded to a titanium flex nib for an extra \u00a345.\nBronze pens are very hard to find and usually very expensive, which makes the Naos a great opportunity to add one to your collection. Every single part of the pen except the nib has been machined from CuSn8 bronze, the same grade used in high-end watch cases. This material is very heavy and will form an attractive patina with age. \nWe use only the best nibs, manufactured by Peter Bock in Germany. The Naos uses Bock 250 which is a large nib with a 6mm feed, commonly known as a #6 nib.\nYou can add additional nibs to your pledge. Your pen comes with a steel nib, but you can upgrade to more flexible material like titanium for greater line variation. The nibs use a screw-in assembly so you don't need any tools to change them.\nEach material has a different character. Titanium has significant flex (considered a semi-flex nib). Steel is very smooth but provides little flex.\nStainless Steel sizes:  EF, F, M, B.\nTitanium: EF, M\nTitanium Flex Nib - EF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naos fountain pen can be used with international standard cartridges (short or long) or a refillable cartridge called a \"converter\" which has a piston mechanism inside to draw ink up through the nib.\n\nAs explained above, you can transform your Naos fountain pen into a rollerball and vice versa by changing its grip section (extra grip section required, add \u00a310 to your pledge). \nThe rollerball refill provided is the Schmidt 5888F in black with a fine tip, a very smooth writer that uses water-based ink which, unlike ballpoints, requires very little pressure to write. This reduces fatigue and cramping during writing sessions.\n\nKeep your pen safe with our custom sleeves which are made by hand from high quality leather that has gone through the natural process of vegetable tanning.\nSimply add \u00a310 to your pledge.\n\nYou can choose options like colour, fountain pen/rollerball, and nib size in a survey that you will receive at the end of the campaign.\nInterested in multiple pens? Pledge for a set and save more!\n\n\nWant to add extra pens? Apart from the sets we offer, you can add extra pens to your reward simply by adding the following amounts to your pledge:\nTo have two writing instruments in one, just add \u00a310 to your pledge to get one rollerball grip section with a Schmidt refill.\nAdd the following amounts to your pledge. The accessories will also be available to add in the survey at the end of the campaign.\n\n\nNamisu was founded by Adrien Cols and Maria Millan, two fountain pen enthusiasts and designers based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed five large writing instrument projects over the past 5 years on Kickstarter and we will use this experience to successfully deliver your pledge.\n\nThroughout this time, we have developed strong relationships with experienced manufacturers which is crucial to delivering a high quality product. We are using similar manufacturing techniques as our previous five projects and have developed a production prototype to validate the feasibility of the design.\n\nWe know that there can always be some unexpected delays during production but we have planned for this and extended our production schedule accordingly. Raw materials like metal rods can arrive late during busy periods of the year; machines can break down and require servicing. These are minor delays that may require a small extension to the delivery date of the project, but which wouldn't affect our ability to deliver the project.\n\nAnother common challenge is fulfilling a project that exceeds its project funding goal significantly. To solve this potential issue we are working with large manufacturers that can produce our pens in any quantity realistically possible on Kickstarter. We do not anticipate any extension of the delivery date unless the project exceeds 2000 backers, at which point we would need to revise the manufacturing completion target date.\n\nWe are also working with a professional logistics and fulfilment company which will handle all shipping and packing operations to avoid any delays during the shipping phase of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "Naos Aluminium -

Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates.

And that we throw 8 million tons of plastic waste every year into our oceans?\nPlastic situation in the ocean\nGravity Wave is a project created by young social entrepreneurs that have decided to act so that the numbers you just read start decreasing.\nGravity Wave team: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nWe want to change how things work for good and we have a very clear objective: Empty ALL the plastic from the Mediterranean Sea. Not only we want to recollect it, but we want to transform that waste into valuable products.\nTwo years ago we founded our first phone accessories company. We were producing phone cases, ring holders, USB\u2026 and all of our products were made out of plastic. We realised that in the smartphone industry everything gets outdated very fast and especially phone cases, 1 billion units that are thrown away every year because of this (some of them even inside their plastic packaging!) We took the decision of turn the whole business around. How could we be contributing to this negative impact on our lovely planet?  \nPlastic recycling\nWe realised that oceans are full of plastic (8 million tons end up there every year) and it is causing the whole marine ecosystem to collapse. We started thinking about solutions, and how we could collect all this plastic waste, as 70% is at the bottom of the ocean and we do not have the resources to remove it. Moreover, thousands of species are dying because of this.\nImpact of plastic waste in animals\nWe needed people that had the knowledge and the way\u2026 Of course, the fishermen! We then spoke with some of them and realised that every day they collected marine litter but didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and that's when we met our now partner Lefteris Arapakis, founder of Enaleia, a sustainable fishing school that has been operating for more than 3 years in Athens, Greece, where they show local fishermen how to collect waste from the sea. When they go out to fish, they dedicate part of their time to fish plastic waste and afterward they bring it back to the harbour and drop it in our containers. We then pay them for every KG they extract and we take care of the rest of the process. \nWe already have more than 130 boats in Greece which are now called #plasticfishers and have collected over 50 tons of marine litter! Along 2020 we are will start to work with the fishermen in Italy and Spain so we can continue cleaning the Mediterranean Sea.\nSo far we take care of the collection and supply, but how do we transform it? We started working hand in hand with Crazy & Things, our partners in Spain, who have been creating, developing and patenting products for more than 10 years. Recently they created Tecnikoa 3D filaments, a project focused on developing and producing 3D filaments. We had been working together in our previous mobile phone accessories company for a long time developing products, and at that time we decided to go one step further becoming partners of Gravity Wave S.L.\nTogether we got the recycling factory in Alicante, where we select, clean and cut into small pieces that are ready to be reused for creating new products. We then send it to the Crazy & Things factory (also in Alicante), where we produce 3D filament and smartphone cases. \nWe already have the first prototype created in our 3D printer with a filament made out of Ghost Nets collected from the sea.\nPLAY\n\nWe have created a business model that recycles and reuses marine litter to transform it into valuable products. But how do we close the circle? Can we achieve a fully circular economy model?  \nThree step manufacturing process\nAll the cases that we sell, if the user no longer wants them, can bring it to our collecting points all over Spain and will get a great discount for the next purchase of Gravity Wave products. With all the collected cases, we again do the recycling process and give them many more uses until they are no longer recyclable, then we transform it into energy with a 0 emissions certificate.\nThe idea to create this Kickstarter campaign is to produce the 6 needed molds to launch the first 13 phone model cases. By offering more models we reach to more people to whom we provide a sustainable alternative creating like this bigger impact that allows us to collect more and more marine litter every day. \nIn Gravity Wave we create sustainable alternatives for our daily life products so that the consumer knows where all these products come from and how they impact the global climate crisis. But we are not selling charity, we are selling quality.\nTechnical specifications\nBuying 1 Gravity Wave case, you contribute to extract 3KG of plastic from the Mediterranean Sea, and moreover, you contribute to sustainable fishing, empower plastic recycling, support local production, local job creation and of course the development of social projects.\nNow we need you so that Gravity Wave becomes a reality.\nContribute to this campaign and be one of the people leading the climate revolution!\nJoin the Wave!\n ESPA\u00d1OL\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \n1 funda = 3kg pl\u00e1stico\nELIGE TU FUNDA\nEdici\u00f3n GHOST NET\nEdici\u00f3n PLASTIC\nEdici\u00f3n GRAVITY\n\u00bfSab\u00edas que se tiran alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas de pl\u00e1stico para m\u00f3vil al a\u00f1o? \u00bfY que vertemos 8 millones de toneladas de pl\u00e1stico al a\u00f1o en mares y oc\u00e9anos? \nSituaci\u00f3n del pl\u00e1stico en mares y oc\u00e9anos.\nGravity Wave es un proyecto creado por j\u00f3venes emprendedores sociales que hemos decidido actuar para que las cifras que acabas de leer sean cada vez menores. \nEquipo Gravity Wave: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nQueremos cambiar las cosas de una vez por todas y tenemos un objetivo muy claro: vaciar todo el pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo. Pero no solamente recogerlo, sino convertir todo ese desecho en productos de valor. \nHace dos a\u00f1os empezamos con una empresa dedicada a la fabricaci\u00f3n de accesorios para smartphone. Est\u00e1bamos haciendo fundas, anillos de sujeci\u00f3n, USB, y todos ellos llevaban algo de pl\u00e1stico. Nos dimos cuenta que en el sector de la telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil todo es muy pasajero, y las fundas se quedan enseguida obsoletas, as\u00ed que las que no se venden, se tiran. El mercado de fundas para smartphone tira alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas al a\u00f1o por no estar al d\u00eda de los modelos de tel\u00e9fono. As\u00ed que nos replanteamos todo nuestro negocio, \u00bfc\u00f3mo \u00edbamos a seguir contribuyendo nosotros a esta causa tan negativa?  \nReciclaje del pl\u00e1stico\nSe nos ocurri\u00f3 que en mares y oc\u00e9anos hay much\u00edsimo pl\u00e1stico, tanto como 8.000.000 de toneladas que se vierten anualmente y que adem\u00e1s el 25% viene de redes de pesca o \"redes fantasma\". Adem\u00e1s, miles de especies de animales est\u00e1n muriendo por causa de este desecho. \nImpacto del pl\u00e1stico en animales\nEmpezamos a darle vueltas y a pensar en c\u00f3mo pod\u00edamos recoger todo ese pl\u00e1stico, ya que el 70% est\u00e1 en el fondo y nosotros no pod\u00edamos dedicarnos a pescarlo, ten\u00edamos que contar con personas que conocieran muy bien el mar y salieran cada d\u00eda a pescar. \u00a1Claro, los pescadores! Quer\u00edamos empezar por nuestro mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, as\u00ed que hablamos con algunos de ellos y y fue entonces cuando conocimos a nuestro primer socio Lefteris Arapakis, fundador de Enaleia, una escuela de pesca sostenible que lleva operando m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os en Atenas, Grecia, donde muestran a los pescadores tradicionales a recoger residuos del mar. Cuando salen a faenar, dedican parte de su tiempo a pescar pl\u00e1stico y una vez lo traen a puerto lo echan en contenedores, los cuales pesamos, y les compensamos por kg de pl\u00e1stico recogido. En Gravity Wave contamos ya con m\u00e1s de 130 barcos en nuestra sede de Atenas, Grecia, que salen cada d\u00eda a faenar y a recolectar pl\u00e1stico del mar, \u00a1y llevamos m\u00e1s de 50 toneladas de residuos recogidos! En 2020 comenzamos con los pescadores de Italia y Espa\u00f1a para seguir recuperando los residuos del fondo del mar.\nHasta aqu\u00ed tenemos la parte de recogida y suministro del material, pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo transformamos? Comenzamos a trabajar mano a mano con Crazy & Things, nuestros socios en Espa\u00f1a, quienes llevan m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os creando, desarrollando y patentando productos. Recientemente han creado Tecnikoa 3D filaments, donde desarrollan y producen filamentos para impresi\u00f3n 3D. Llev\u00e1bamos ya mucho tiempo trabajando juntos y en ese momento decidimos ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 pasando a ser socios en esta aventura.\nJunto a ellos conseguimos la planta de reciclaje en Alicante, que se dedica a limpiar, seleccionar y trocear el pl\u00e1stico que enviamos desde Atenas en copos y granza (trozos muy peque\u00f1os). M\u00e1s tarde nos lo env\u00edan a nuestra f\u00e1brica de Crazy & Things situada tambi\u00e9n en Alicante, donde producimos filamento para impresi\u00f3n 3D y fundas para smartphone.\n\u00a1YA TENEMOS EL PRIMER PROTOTIPO IMPRESO EN 3D CON FILAMENTO DE REDES DE PESCA RECUPERADAS DEL MAR! \nPLAY\n\nCon estos pasos, hemos conseguido tener un modelo de negocio que recicla y reutiliza los residuos del mar para convertirlos en productos de valor, pero nos queda una \u00faltima cuesti\u00f3n: \u00bfc\u00f3mo cerramos el c\u00edrculo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podemos conseguir un modelo de econom\u00eda circular completo?\nProceso\n\nTodas las fundas que produzcamos y vendamos, una vez el cliente quiera cambiarlas, podr\u00e1 llevarlas a puntos de recogida situados en toda Espa\u00f1a y una vez entregue esa funda, obtendr\u00e1 un vale de descuento para comprar un nuevo modelo de funda Gravity. Con todas las fundas recogidas, volveremos al proceso de limpieza y troceado para darle \"nueva vida\" a los productos de Gravity Wave. \nLa idea de crear la campa\u00f1a de Kickstarter nace para producir 6 moldes, necesarios para sacar 13 modelos de tel\u00e9fono diferentes. Haciendo m\u00e1s modelos llegamos a m\u00e1s personas, a las que ofrecemos una funda sostenible para su m\u00f3vil generando con esta compra un impacto positivo, ayudando a recolectar cada vez m\u00e1s residuos, \u00a1hasta que no quede ni 1KG de pl\u00e1stico en nuestro querido mar!\nEl primer producto desarrollado con este material es LA PRIMERA FUNDA PARA M\u00d3VIL HECHA CON REDES DE PESCA RECOLECTADAS DEL MAR MEDITERR\u00c1NEO. Fundas que no s\u00f3lo protejan tu m\u00f3vil, sino que contribuyan directamente a proteger el mar.\nEn Gravity Wave creamos alternativas sostenibles de productos que consumimos en nuestro d\u00eda a d\u00eda, para que personas como t\u00fa tengan toda la informaci\u00f3n de los productos que compran y puedan contribuir a resolver la crisis clim\u00e1tica. \nNos preocupa la sostenibilidad, pero tambi\u00e9n la calidad. \nCaracter\u00edsticas de nuestras fundas / Cover technical specifications\nComprando una funda de Gravity Wave contribuyes a extraer 3KG de pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, adem\u00e1s contribuyes a la pesca sostenible y responsable, fomentas el reciclaje de pl\u00e1sticos, la producci\u00f3n local, y por supuesto, la creaci\u00f3n de puestos de trabajo y desarrollo de proyectos sociales. \n\n\nEscoge el dise\u00f1o que m\u00e1s te guste y \u00fanete al cambio.

Unbelievably soft, enjoy every activity and everyday in functional comfort with SomerSide. \nPack SomerSide for the day because you never know where the day will lead. From waterfalls and road trips to beach days, you can DO MORE WITH LESS. \nThe only limit on what you can do is your imagination \nEach towel saves 8-14 recycled plastic bottles from ending up in landfills or among our marine friends. \nWe\u2019ve transformed discarded plastic bottles into the more uniquely designed and versatile towel. \nWhy? Because every minute half a million plastic bottles are NOT being recycled and ending up in landfill or our oceans. SomerSide believes strongly in caring for our planet and bringing the most innovative and technology advanced towel to the market. We want to help keep plastic out of our oceans and forests, one towel at a time. We use a high grade of PET to bring you upmost quality.\n The Process\nPLAY\n\nRead the full testimonials further down this page \nThe three designs are given in detail below\n\nAs part of our stretch goals, we've added in the Dreamtime as XL\nSomerSide towels are large with a unique double sided design that you'll want to take with you everywhere.\nHide your valuables, SomerSide is the only towel with a hidden zip pocket. Take a dip without the worry, You never have to worry about asking someone to watch your stuff at the beach again! Carry only the essentials to the beach, perfect for surfers who worry about where to put their key when they're out in the water.\nYou can also put sunscreen, spare bather bottoms, lip balm, a small snack- the essentials and more\nNot a fan of microfibre towels because they often feel like you're drying yourself with paper? SomerSide towels have been designed to be soft against your skin so you can enjoy using it like any other towel. We've used the most innovative technology to create soft thread from recycled plastic with a 15% blend of Nylon for that extra softness.\nSomerSide towels have odor resistant properties so leave your wet towel in your bag for the day without the worry. \nSave space in your everyday bag and luggage. Weighing in at only 400 grams and rolling to the size of a small plastic bottle, SomerSide is the perfect towel for on-the-go, no matter whether you're a roller, folder or scruncher.  \nLeave the sandcastles at the beach where they belong with SomerSide's sand-free technology.  If you ever avoid the beach just because you hate the idea of having sand everywhere, SomerSide towels allow you to have your fun in the sun without worrying and the sand!\nSomerSide towels dry 3 times faster than a regular cotton towel so you can be ready from one adventure to the next. From morning yoga, to a sunset surf and picnic, use it again and again.\nDry off quickly and easily, the water brushes off your skin and absorbs into the towel right away. Whether you're out of the shower, pool, ocean, or any water, Somerside towels are ultra Absorbent.\nSick of throwing your towel on the rack and hope it doesn't fall? Hang SomerSide anywhere to dry for your convenience with our elastic hanging hook. Placed cleverly in the middle of the towel so the bottom of the towel doesn't drag on the floor\nWe are bigger than a regular beach towel and our XL is great for two or for those who like some extra room. The XL doubles up as a picnic blanket for your friends and family! Our XL is currently only available in the Moroccan Mint and Aussie Dreamtime.\nAll our towels come in a pouch made from the same material as the towel so they're eco, soft, quick dry etc. Very handy to put wet swimwear in, easy to wash like the towels, and also a great snack bag for the beach!\nWhether you like the outdoors, travelling , the beach, you're a triathlete, a festival goer, a diver, or just enjoy an active lifestyle, Everyone needs a towel. \n\n\nDELIVERY FOR CHRISTMAS! \n30% more waste is generated on Christmas Day than the rest of the year. This waste is largely related to consumer gifting, Australians alone throw out 20 million unwanted gifts and enough wrapping paper to wrap the earth's equator 4 times. Australia only has 0.33% of the total world population.... not even 1%.We want to help you and the planet by minimising waste this holiday season. Rather than gifting more plastic, gift SomerSide, a present people will love that helps the environment. \nFounder, Gabby giving some behind the scenes information on our manufacturing and timeline\nPLAY\n\nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nNot the number or combination of towels you are looking for? No problems we can add them on manually. Please send us an email at support@somerside.com.au with the subject line 'custom reward' and we will get back to you ASAP! Expect a response within 24 hours. We want to make sure we deliver your order correctly and so we need to make note of all custom orders. \nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nAll our early bird rewards offer discounted worldwide shipping for those backers that have supported us from the start. Our Santa Pack also offers discounted shipping because we want to help all the eco-gift givers out there. \nOur shipping base is located in Melbourne, Australia and will be mailed out from there. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. Aus Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days. We are a small business and unfortunately cannot offer free worldwide shipping at this point in time but we can offer you a great product at an excellent discount. \nCUSTOM DUTIES AND TAX\nCannot mark as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nOur terms of sale for international orders are FOB Destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. \nI've always been an adventurous and active soul that can\u2019t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. \nSomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. \nThank you for support!\nGabriella Samkova\n\nThank you to the Community Creatives for an amazing job in the photography and video production of this campaign", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike a lot of Kickstarter projects, we've put countless hours and our savings into manufacturing and testing SomerSide. The next order which you will help fund will be version 3, which has already been customer tested and all the small kinks resolved. We have a manufacturer that we will be working with and have discussed our timeline to ensure delivery for Christmas. \n\nHowever, things can always happen that are beyond our control, and we do our best to communicate those challenges up front and as they arise as we have from the beginning.

AvoSeedo has been developed to facilitate the germination process of avocados. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!   \nAvocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of ahuacatl, the Aztec word for avocado, was well known amongst the indigenous population. But it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket \u2013 and on our tables. Being outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the famous guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your tongue.  \nAlthough avocado trees like to be warm and cozy, they can handle lower average temperatures (as in central Europe, the US or Canada) quite well. The seed of every supermarket avocado can be made to germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, merely putting the seed in the ground usually won\u2019t work. Instead, the \u201cpointy\u201d end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be wet all the time.  \nThe main challenge when growing an avocado is to keep it wet all the time. If the seed is left high and dry at any time, there\u2019s a chance that the germination process will stop permanently. And this is where AvoSeedo comes to the rescue. \nAvoSeedo is a revolutionary way to grow the perfect avocados without all the usual hassle that it takes to grow these fussy plants. But what\u2019s new with this version of the AvoSeedo?\nThis version will have your kiddies loving growing their very own pet avocados. The AvoSeedo is shaped like a bear, and comes with many different stickers so that they can customize the look of their little pet. \nIt also comes with a bowl for the AvoSeedo to swim in. There is a little cut out that comes with the pot so that kids can make it look like a pool or garden. So much fun!\nAvoSeedo is the perfect little gadget for kids and everyone who loves to grow plants. Avocados are known to be challenging to grow, but with AvoSeedo\u2019s nifty and brand new design, avocados will grow quickly and easily. \nWell for starters, it\u2019s the easiest way to grow avocados. Our new design is sure to capture kids\u2019 attention. The normally very demanding germination of avocados will be a breeze! \nAvoSeedo is a small, yet intricate tool, which works on the same principle as the toothpick method, only better.  Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time. When the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly.  \nCompared to the original toothpick method, there\u2019s another advantage: the avocado seed doesn\u2019t need to be perforated, reducing the risk of damage and injury. \nDue to its smart design, success rates of germinating avocados will increase dramatically. Watering intervals will be reduced, as water levels only need to be checked now and then. \nAs long as some water remains in the pot or pond, the pit stays wet and there is little chance that the seed will dry out \u2013 thanks to the ground hole. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a heart instead. While this may as well add to the cuteness factor of the new AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that avocado seeds of all sizes will be held firmly in its place. Even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won\u2019t sink.\nThe brand new AvoSeedo is, without a doubt, the easiest way to germinate avocados, and kids will love their new \u2018pet\u2019. \nHere are the main benefits of AvoSeedo:\nEasy to use \u2013 peel the avocado pit, put it into the AvoSeedo and presto, it\u2019s ready to go.\nNo attention needed \u2013 due to the smart design of the AvoSeedo, it requires minimal care and will germinate without any hassles.\nGreat design \u2013 easy to use with a great design that will capture kids\u2019 imaginations.\nHighly durable \u2013 the AvoSeedo will last for years as it\u2019s made from super strong plastic.\nNon-toxic \u2013 it is BPA and DEHP free.\nAll in all, AvoSeedo is simply the perfect tool for you to grow avocado trees at home. The difficult germination period can now be mastered with almost no effort \u2013 giving your new trees an edge right from the beginning!\nAvoSeedo 2.0 is already in the works!\nWe are already working on the injection mold and start testing very soon. This is great news for you as this decreases the time until it arrives in your home dramatically. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk is limited.

Therefore, I have named it, \u201cThe Hawk\u201d.\nOver the past 2 years, I have primarily been working on design & tested various type of knives. I have been working along this line with full commitment and throughout the whole process my priority have been to provide the best possible ergonomic handle and well balanced design for the ease of use. I want to ensure that this knife also meet the highest standards with specific guidelines such as blade, material & resources for better efficiency.\nBLADE:\nThe 330 Layered Damascus blade must impress you as the details are so sharp and beautifully attractive patterns. It is long-lasting due to its rustproof blade making it first choice for any professional chefs.\nHANDLE:\nWalnut wood is extremely tough and therefore, it is the best possible combination to go with Damascus blade. The straight grain retains the traditional look and feel with light to a very deep brown colour.\nI have been collecting knives for many years, I do understand the uniqueness and the highly customised process of creating it. From the design prospective to the actual product, it is where every knife will go through a comparable strength and sharpness test during production to provide you all with distinctive wavy pattern and durability to the blade. \nThe Hawk\nLove for small knives lead us to this creation, a perfect sharp & balanced knife which can be used with fully comfort, indoor as well as out door. \nThere are lots of cheap \"Damascus\" knockoff knives in the market. I have owned few myself previously and one can notice straight away how badly they are made. Most noticeable fact is that the metal has weak spots and is made up from poor quality materials.   \nMy own determination has been over the time to choose the right brand of Damascus and provide you all with something that is pretty and practical in terms of usage. With my knowledge and crafting skills, I'll use durable Damascus that takes time and meticulous attention to detail. Thats the kind of integrity I want to build on this platform.   \nThe Hawk ( 100% Damascus Paring Knife )\nI know the fact that its important to properly heat the Damascus as its vital part of the whole process. Also once its ready, I'll be making sure that every knife has quality the finish, baring in mind that it can rise my costs but it is also my job to provide you with great finish.   \nPLAY\n\nCutting ,chopping ,peeling ,slicing or even dicing with this mini beast.\nFor me, selling online on various e commerce platforms isn't pleasing as I don't feel well connected with the potential buyers. Therefore, I have chosen \"Kickstarter\" platform as my start, so I build upon my knowledge and a direct interaction with you all. \nSince it's my first project in line, consumer feedback is very important to me and thats why I have decided to keep the prices very reasonable. Though, I believe in providing quality, price is just for the hardwork which is going at the background. As you save, I build integrity, relationship and knowledge. \nThe Hawk\n100% Damascus paring knife; Designed & created to serve as paring knife, its simple, elegant & fully comfortable while in hands.\nHawk ( 100% Damascus Paring knife )\n With 330 Layers of steel, full tang & wooden handle \nI am introducing \"The Hawk\" in 2 sizes, (20cm & 24cm) as I feel that will give best combination. I have handcrafted and used traditional skills to come up with these designs. I have given a thought process and attributes which are key, such as;\nHand Forged Damascus Steel\nErgonomics & Well Balanced\nDurable Handle\nSuperior Sharpness\nThe Hawk Pair ( 24cm & 20 cm )\nErgonomically designed Walnut wood handle ensures a firm grip, comfort and add touch of elegance. \nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n The sheaths are of this pattern more or less, the final look may differ a bit but is make of 100% leather.\n Walnut wood & brass pins adds grace to this knife\nPLAY\n\nThis item is produced in limited quantities only. This means that every piece is unique. Sizes & finish may vary lightly from piece to piece.\nPLAY\n\n Smooth cuts with no drag or food stick, easy to clean and stays sharp\n The knife is not a showpiece, its fully functional and heat-treated to take the impact.\nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n Its designed to give comfort to the palm. \n Full tang blade (Its entirely a single length with no soldering ) \nBeautiful design with precious look & sharp with full tang all adds character to this hawkish knife and make it a real Kitchen Hawk. \n There are many things I want to achieve through this platform, For someone new, it does makes it harder to overcome certain aspects of the project.

Gone were the days of carrying your laptop charger, phone charger, power converter \u2013 replace all of these with a single Nimble. \n\n 1 Nimble - 6 devices \nOne adaptor to rule them all - The Nimble can accommodate up to 6 devices at the same time, without sacrificing any charging performance across its USB -A and USB - C ports\nWe rely on the broad range of electronics when travelling to keep us occupied during long journeys. That doesn\u2019t mean you should have to bring broad range of chargers that simply take up valuable baggage space.\n \nIs it the same as the Travel Adapter on Amazon?\nWe have picked some of the bestsellers on Amazon to show you why the Nimble is truly unique with a dedicated USB-C output unlike traditional adapter which will share power across output ports. \n\n\n\nIndependently Powered Ports - Quick Charge and Power Delivery\nImagine if everyone in a large restaurant shared one single waiter.\nThe same way traditional travel adaptors share power across all its outlets. Nimble however, offers each of your devices its own personal service. No compromise. No loss of performance.\nThe Nimble utilizes 2 independent circuit boards to power the main plug, the USB-C PD/QC and the 3x USB-A/1x USB-C output \u2013 resulting in  dedicated power through its USB-C QC/PD port to ensure optimized charging for all QC and PD compatible devices \u2013 traditional chargers will share power between all the ports resulting in slow charging.\n\n\n\nCompared With Other Travel Chargers \n\n\nTravel, Home, Office \nWhether you are travelling long distances or commuting between home and the office, the Nimble fits perfectly into your life without occupying noticeable space. Small and sleek, definitely a charger we are not used to.\n The 35W Power Delivery is perfect to replace those big clunky laptop chargers we are so use to. \n\nUSB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning\n\n\nRewards\nADD On Menu: Because Your Nimble Deserves the Best \nOnce you\u2019ve backed the project, you can add additional cables. Simply increase your pledge by the corresponding HKD dollar amount. When the campaign ends, we\u2019ll send you a survey asking which items you want. \n\n\nDetailed Specs\n\n\n\nCharge Safe\u2026.With Nimble\nPLAY\n\nThe Nimble charges safe with multiple layers of inbuilt protection so you can power and charge your gadgets with no worries. The Nimble uses over voltage protection, current stabiliser and over heating protection - One less thing to worry about when you are traveling abroad. \n\n\n\n\nCharge Like A Local, Travel Like A Pro\nCharge like a local and travel like a pro, never worry about not having the correct adapter as the Nimble covers over 150 countries. Never be caught out again when travelling to another country.\n Prototype \nThe Nimble has been designed by a collective of travellers to be the ultimate travel gadget you need for any type of travel. Next time you set off on a new adventure, travel light, travel nimble and you will not regret it.\nTimeline\nTeam\nIt has been an amazing journey and with your help we can bring this project to life, a simple idea has grown to become something that we honestly believe is the best travel adapter on the market right now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked tirelessly to deliver our first campaign to the Kickstarter community to avoid any disappointment.

Off course you can enjoy with wasabi tube.\nThe wasabi-yama was created from the thought to have more wasabi more freely.\nWhen people ordered a plate of some mixed sashimi at a restaurant, a little amount of wasabi was offered on the edge of the plate and everyone shared it, picking it with their chopsticks. \nIt was not really comfortable thing to do for each people.\n\u201cAnd above all, there was too little of it!!\u201d\n\u201cHow could I have the delicious dishes with more wasabi, more freely, we wondered?\u201d\nThis \u201cwasabi-yama\u201d came out of these thoughts.\nWhile we were thinking about what kind of plate, people can enjoy more wasabi more freely then, we heard of this talk.\n\u201cPeople in Edo (Tokyo) won\u2019t allow wasabi to soak in the soy-sauce.\u201d\nPic2\nWe were inspired by it and tried to make a \u201cnew plate for wasabi\u201d and this is its shape.\nThe wasabi-lovers who might once have wished to monopolize the wasabi can do it with this one!\nSize: 11 cm diameter x 3.35cm height\nInstruction: Place wasabi on the top of the mountain and pour some soy-sauce around in the plate.\n\u25b2Hizen-yoshida Pottery details http://www.yoshidayaki.jp/process/#prettyPhoto\nIt is made on a one-by-one basis with great care.\nThe white porcelain in the Arita area has a beautiful white color as its character. \nThe whiteness of this plate comes from the clay itself and the glaze which has been used is colorless and transparent.\nSo, the natural whiteness from the clay appears and this pure white texture is there to see.\nFor obtaining this result, good quality raw materials have been chosen. \n\nFor a mass production of the white porcelain, the mold is necessary.\nThere are 3 types of mold, such as \n1 throw away mold (sample mold)\n2 case mold\n3 use mold (a mass production mold). \nThey are needed to be made depending on each stage.\n1. After inventing a design, a mold (\u2460throw away mold) which is used as a sample (master) is made.\n2. Make a mold (\u2461case mold) for verification \u2460abandoned mold as a model and then after checking the repeatability of the size and shape, produce the duplicate mold for the mass production (\u2462use mold).\n3. Pour the fluid viscos called mud in the \u2462 and make an original mold.\n4. Bake it as it is in the mold to stabilize it. (unglazed pottery)\n5. Pour the glaze on the surface of the vessel to make a film on it. \n During the bisque-firing, the glaze melts and vitrifies the surface. \n(glazing)\n6. Then, bake it for 12~14 hours with a temperature of 1300\u2103.\n(high temperature firing in a big kiln)\n *This is the important process which largely influences the glaze, the color of the paint and the gloss.\nThe work of this time is to produce a product made by using a mold, but it is a very delicate process which requires various adjustments according to the weather and humidity of the day.\nIf the glaze isn\u2019t put on evenly, the uneven color appears after a high temperature firing in a big kiln and it is a persevering work which is required to check the mold one by one during the firing.\nIt is the creative world in which the experience of the experienced craftsman is important.\nWe would like to create the enjoyable daily life using the tableware with which you can enjoy your meals.\nNowadays, we can enjoy the nice food anywhere, and we think that people are interested in what to eat, but they are not bothered in what tools to eat them from.\n\u201cWe would like people to eat the delicious foods together with the enjoyable tools.\u201d\nPLAY\n\nThe meals while having fun make daily life rich.\nWe really want to design these kinds of products from now on.\nAlso, we would like to create the environment and the way of economy for not only the hand-craftsmen who create things but also the ones who mine the raw materials and also the ones who manage mountains doing a wonderful work with a fair price through the \u201cproduct design\u201d.\nIt is a set that you can receive and can easily experience the wasabi-yama, just by your initial support as a kickstarter.  \nThe wasabi, wood and soy sauce bottle listed in the photo are not included in this set.

We have tried and tested different types of ink and have chosen the best one for you. It is an innovative system for smooth and elegant writing.

Every pen will come with Schmidt P8126 capless roller ball refill, perfect for writing, drawing and taking notes.\n       If you will need a replacement, you won`t have problems finding it.

So whenever you\u2019ll need it, there will always be a plenty to choose from.\n       We came a long way from first sketches to final prototype. Now we need your SUPPORT to start full production. We need funds for manufacturing, assembling, packaging and shipping to YOU.\nNOTEBOOK COVER.\nPLAY\n\n       To keep your pen and notebook together, we created a simple, yet functional cover. Under its minimalist look there are compartments for the notebook and pen, two slots for cards and a small pocket for some little things that may be handy throughout your day. The cover is also a stylish accessory that's hard to let off your hands, moreover to forget at home.\n       The cover is made from natural vegetable tanned leather to give it strength and a nice texture. It also develops a rich tint as time goes on. The leather is cut with a laser for precision and accuracy that are impossible to achieve while cutting by hand.\n      But the sewing is only done manually \u2013 it is far more difficult, but the stitches come out stronger and last longer. As a final step, we carefully treat the edges of the leather to give the cover its finished look and provide you with a product that is ideal in every detail.\n       Simple like everything ingenious, this set is great to have around. It gives an ability to write down, sketch, plan and organize your plans and ideas to turn them into successful achievements in the future.\nSpecifications:\nVegetable tanned leather\nNylon thread\nHand sewn\nPen sleeve\n155mm x 115mm ( 6,1 \" x 4,5 \" )", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience with 6 successful projects on Kickstarter, so process of production and delivery is well established.

Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  \nSilver has been used by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles. Bamboo charcoal\u2019s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.\nAir Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring during sleeping. The combination of the textiles wick moisture away twice as fast as cotton, reducing the humidity in your bed by up to 50%. \nThe problem with traditional pillows is that they require porous materials to create a soft comfortable feel. In as little as 7 days, millions of colony forming units of bacteria can grow inside this permeable space where mold and other pathogens can thrive. This leads to allergies, skin irritation and many illnesses. \nAlpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mould into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help with insomnia. \nImpinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area. \nAlpha allows your spine to be alined and it elevates your upper body, unblocking the airways and opening nasal passages so you can breathe easier. Alpha's Dimensions: 60 x 40 x 12 cm.\nSilver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of minimizing the bacteria helps with eliminating odor, prevents allergies such as skin irritations, pimples, asthma, runny nose, sneezing and more. It has taken years of development for silver fabrics to arrive at this level of quality.  \nThe benefits of silver used by NASA, U.S. Special Forces as well as Athletes, providing effective antimicrobial properties, which means it naturally destroys odor-causing pathogens.\nTo add any of our Alpha\u2122 Collection products,  please click on your \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (on top side when you open the project page), than click \u201cChange your pledge\u201d and simply add to the total cost.

Australia\u2019s long isolation and vast area has created an ideal setting for nature to express its incredible diversity. More than 90 percent of the 30,000 different plant species found in Australia are found only in Australia! Our aim at NativeRepublica is to bring some of those truly unique flowers and plants to the rest of the world. To share something that will grow and blossom. \nOUR STORY\n....................................\nJust over a year ago my husband and I travelled around Australia camping for 5 months. We set off from my hometown of Newcastle, Australia on what was to be the most amazing adventure. What really struck me about that trip, besides the vast size of the country, was the range of amazingly beautiful, vibrate and burley wildflowers. Colours and forms truly unique to Australia. Mid last year my husband and I moved to his hometown in Switzerland and I began to deeply miss the unique smells and sights of Australia. That was when I decided to bring a little bit of Australia with me. I started NativeRepublica to showcase and celebrate the joyful heirloom wildflowers of Australia and bring their beauty to the rest of the world. We have since been working on sourcing the best native Australian wildflower seeds to share with the world.\nVIDEO\n....................................\nOUR RANGE\n....................................\nWe\u2019ve selected six of the most unique Australian wildflowers:\nTHE PRODUCT\n....................................\nOur eco-friendly packets of native wildflower seeds are sold individually or as a gift pack of three. Each vibrant packet of seeds contains sowing and care instructions, native seeds and a sowing label.\nTHE GIFT PACK\n....................................\nOur gift pack of three individual seed packets. \nAs part of this Kickstarter campaign we are offering a special on our gift pack of Bottlebrush seeds, Kangaroo Paw seeds and Blue Rottnest Island Daisy seeds (special only available through KickStarter).\nNow that we have reached our streach goal we can introduce two new gift pack options!!!!\nTHE FLOWERS\n....................................\n1. Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea\nThe Strut\u2019s Desert Pea is the most iconic and unique Australian wildflower. Not only that, it\u2019s also the emblem of South Australia. I spent a good part of our trip intensely looking for this amazing flower in the wild. Originating from the deserts of South Australia and the Northern Territory the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea eluded me. I can only imagine what Charles Sturt would have though seeing its distinctive elongated red flowers and piercing black eye on his 1814 journey into the depths of Australia in search of an inland sea. Nothing else in the world compares to the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea. The red beauty looks like a tough customer but is actually very endearing. They love to be in frost-free positions with excellent drainage, either in a container or sandy garden bed.\n2. Bottle Brush\nThe vibrant red flowers of Bottle Brush played such an important part of my childhood. The memory of being fascinated by their soft bizarre brush head is so vivid in my mind. This magnificent flower is an iconic plant, well-recognised in Australia and increasingly in gardens throughout the world. It easy to grow, hardy and very adaptable. The vibrant red colour is a magnet for wildlife and birds, they just love it! This versatile plant in also known by indigenous Australians as a beautiful tea, what a superstar!\n3. Blue Rottnest Island Daisy\nAs if Australia was not isolated enough! This little beauty originates from the even more remote Rottnest Island, located off the coast of Western Australia. It\u2019s long slender strokes are topped a striking pincushion like array of petite bluey purple blooms. Insects love the pretty blue flowers including snails so be sure to protect them when they are juvenile. Blue Rottnest Island Daisies are super easy to grow so no garden has any excuse to be without them.\n4. Wattle\nIn Australia you know summer has arrived when you see those big blooms of glowing golden Wattle flowers. I can\u2019t remember a summer where I didn\u2019t stop and admire Wattle\u2019s vibrant presents. This plant has the amazing power of being able to immediately infuse happiness \u263a Glorious Wattle is our national flower in Australia. We even have \u2018Wattle Day\u2019 on September 1 every year! That\u2019s how much we love this plant. Wattle belongs to the same family as the more common Mimosa and Thorntree variety of Acacia. Staggeringly 950 of the 1300 Acacia species abound worldwide are native to Australia. This plant is not just a pretty face, although undoubtedly highly ornamental, wattle seeds plays an important part in ingenious Australians medicine. Easy to grow, this plant is a must in any garden.\n5. Geraldton Wax\nGeraldton wax is having a comeback moment. Its long been appreciated as a hardy plant with profusely long lasting pretty pink waxy flowers. It is an iconic Australian plant and one of the world\u2019s best cut flowers. The aroma when crushing the foliage between your fingers is to die for. This flower is super robust, fast growing and most importantly copes well with irregular watering so its perfect for the lazy gardener ;) Use the cut flowers in the home as they will last up to a week.\n6. Kangaroo Paw\nKangaroo Paw plant is stunning full stop. With its long elegantly flattened leaves and beautiful brilliant green flowers bloom that fans out like a cluster this flower is truly truly unique. Each Kangaroo Paw flower has a bright red ovary which, with the unusual paw-shaped flowers, gives the flower its very fitting name. Its paws are soft and velvety with fine brightly coloured hairs covering the entire surface. This fury little guy sturdy stem is a natural perch for birds. The blooms are long lasting and make amazing cut flowers.\nOUR PEOPLE\n....................................\nGreen thumbs who want a truly unique garden full of heirloom native flowers\nTravellers who want to bring a little unique magic home with them\nGivers of unique eco-friendly gifts. \nPeople who want something uniquely beautiful that will grow and blossom for years to come \nThe Goals\n.......................\nRaise $1,000 AUD to buy supplies and packaging\nThe stretch goals: $2,000 AUD introduce new wildflower varieties to the range $3,000 AUD introduce fruits, herbs and spice plants to the range.\nWILL THEY GROW?\n....................................\nAustralian wildflowers have evolved to fill every available habitat on the huge continent from hot dry to frosty mountaintops. Our range of wildflowers grow naturally in USDA hardiness zones 5-12. Outside of these zones they can be grown in a green house.\nBest of all most of our flowers are perennial! with the exception of Blue Rottnest Island Daisy it is erect annual or biannual. Re-propagation shouldn't be an issue. For more info on the botanical aspects please check out the following link:\nhttps://www.anbg.gov.au/index.html https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/\nTHE SEEDS\n....................................\nCAN YOU BRING SEEDS INTO THE COUNTRY?\n....................................\nGreat question! Each country has its own rules about bringing in plant and plant products (i.e. seeds). It\u2019s always best to check with your country\u2019s customs and quarantine laws before making a pledge. Most countries allow non-commercial quantities to enter without any paperwork however some require a Phytosanitary Certificate. \nUNITED STATES\nIf you live in the United States, \"up to 50 seeds per species\" can be imported under the Small Seed Lots Permit without a Phytosanitary Certificate. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/permits...\nEUROPE\nSimilarly in Europe \"Small quantities of plants, plant products, foodstuffs or animal feed that their owner or recipient will use for non-industrial, non-commercial purposes or consume during transport\" do not need a certificatehttps://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/non_eu_trade_en\nCANADA\n\"Small lots\" of seed, i.e., quantities of less than 5 kg of large seeded kinds such as peas, beans and corn or quantities of less than 500 g of small seeded kinds such as carrot or alfalfa, are exempted from providing an import declaration or a seed analysis certificate and do not require an ICA. Most seed imported by Canadian gardeners would fall under the \"small lot\" category. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/seeds/imports/small-packet-seed/eng/1470410938949/1470410961778\nNEW ZEALAND\nWe don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to our strict quarantine requirements.\nARE THEY INVASIVE?\n..........................\nEach native environment is unique and diverse. Sometimes introducing a new species into the harmonious balance can result in disastrous results. Our mission is to enhance not destroy the local environment. Whilst each country has its own list, NON of our flowers are classified as invasive species in the US, Canada and Europe. \nUNITED STATES: https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/main.shtml \nCANADA: http://www.rbg.ca/archive/cbcn/en/projects/invasives/i_list.html\nEUROPE: https://www.eppo.int/INVASIVE_PLANTS/ias_lists.htm#IAPList\nBotanical names of our flowers:\nGeraldton Wax CHAMELAUCIUM uncinatum\nBottle BrushCALLISTEMON glaucus \nBlue Rottenest Island Daisy TRACHYMENE coerulea\nSturt's Desert Pea SWAINSONA formosa\nWattle ACACIA drummondii\nKangaroo Paw ANIGOZANTHOS flavidus \nNOTE: We don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to their strict quarantine requirements.\nSTRECH GOALS\n...................\nI'm happy to say we have reached both our stretch goals which means we can introduce three new seeds to our original range of six!\nFirst up is Billy Button!!!\nAvailable as a Combo 'Stretch goal -add on' reward and as part of the 'Multi gift pack' rewards\nAs part of the second stretch goal we are thrilled to introduce a new reward...Bush Fruits and Spice Seeds! Quandong and Old Man Salt Bush :)\nCurious as to how these taste? We've got a tasting rewards lined up as well. Receive these beautifully packaged native bush spices for tasting.\nFirst up is ground Quandong fruit: Funny name, delicious flavour! These sweet, glossy fruits, also known as \u2018wild peaches\u2019, are packed with vitamin C, protein, complex oils, iron and zinc. While you can eat them straight off the tree, our dried ground quandongs are great to add to cakes, juices and fruit salads or with fish and Asian food.\nAnd Old Man Salt Bush Milled leaf: Old man saltbush is salty! Many different varieties exist across arid regions of Australia. Traditionally used by indigenous Australians in dampers, this spices is great as a general spice and amazing with roasted potatoes. Contains 15g. Store in a dry cool place for up to 6 months\nphoto credits: Kangaroo paw- Richard Watson, Bottlebrush - Houzz, Geraldton wax-OzHank, Wattle- Sue Robertson, Blue Rottnest island daisy-Rottnest foundation, Sturt desert pea-Andrew Alderson, opening EUCALYPTUS macrocarpa- Austalian Geographic", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays in the certificate for export.

This 10\u201d track is sewn into the back of the belt to create over 40+ size positions to adjust with. This means you can adjust your Ultimate belt in \u00bc\u201d increments and achieve the perfect fit. So whether you just ate a big meal, or just started that new diet - your Ultimate belt is going to provide the perfect fit, every time. It's like a giant zip tie for your waist - only more fun to use. As a matter of fact, once you wear an Ultimate belt \u2013 you\u2019ll never want to go back to a traditional belt. To release or adjust the belt, just pinch the small tab under the buckle.   \n        After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate Belts (1.5\" wide) are constructed using 3 key elements. First, the exterior is a handsome nylon webbing test rated to over 500 lbs. Inside is a poly-urethane core center for added strength and stability to support gear, and yet flexible enough for comfort. On the inside is Super Fiber, a hybrid material that's both extremely durable and water resistant. These 3 elements combined make this the toughest belt you'll ever own and the last belt you'll ever need. \nUltimate buckles and nylon belts are interchangeable with ALL our other EDC (1.5\" wide) belts and buckles featured on our website.  \n\n                 See >>  http://www.KoreEssentials.com    \n                   After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n  At Kore Essentials creating innovative, quality products for men is what we do.

These unique, reinforced poly-core belts (1.5\u201d wide) are constructed using top-grade nylon webbing. The back of the belt is a Super-Fiber that's tough and water resistant. The buckles (2.25\u201d x 1.5\u201d) are a high-quality zinc alloy with a hardened gunmetal color finish.

When you receive your new belt, turn it over and locate your Pant Size using the printed ruler marks. Then add 4 inches and cut using sharp scissors. So for example, if your pant size is 36\" - cut your belt at the 40\" mark. Then snap the cut end into the buckle receptacle (teeth) and put it on.  If it's still too big - you can trim off more, an inch at a time. It's liberating to be able to adjust your belt up to 5 inches in either direction \u2013 in or out - in tiny \u00bc\u201d increments.  \n                     \"This is the best fitting belt you\u2019ll ever own.\"  \n   < Backer Comments From Our Previous Kickstarter Projects >\n\u201cI love my Trakline belt! I show it off to everyone. Great product, so glad I became a backer!\u201d - Mike Goodridge\n\n\u201cHave to say the Trakline belt is the best Kickstarter item I have backed so far. The quality is great and is now my favourite belt!\u201d - Thurstan Johnstan\n\n\u201cGot my two belts and buckles and they're amazing. The quality is top-notch.\u201d - Casus Belli\n\n\u201cI love the belt and the quality in manufacturing and design is evident in everything.\u201d - Scott Burns\n\n\u201cSeriously, I can't get over how much I love this belt. I totally forget I'm wearing it because it's so comfortable.\u201d - Thomas Ella \nDespite our success, we\u2019re still a small company and launching a new product requires a lot of resources and funds up front. This means we need your support to help pay for tooling and enough starting inventory to keep the costs down. In return, we\u2019d love to give you one of these awesome new belts, or several if you like. Either way \u2013 we promise you\u2019re going to love it.  \nX2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   Once the Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will send out surveys to all backers to gather reward choices (buckle styles, leather colors, etc.) and shipping address. Once we get the surveys back we\u2019ll commence production. Based on the factories estimate, this process should take about 30-40 days to complete dependent on volume. We're going to make the belts at a responsible factory in China that we've done a lot of business with. One of our partners (Mauro) will personally be on hand to oversee and ensure that the best quality standards are met. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California (2 weeks) and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers (1 week). So all in all, you should get your belt about 60-70 days after the campaign ends.  \n          After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   A number of years ago my wife bought me an expensive belt for my birthday. Unfortunately, my waist was \u201cin-between\u201d the belt holes at the time. We\u2019ve all been there. This time I boldly decided to poke a few holes of my own in the leather and \u201cfix it\u201d myself. Bad idea. I completely ruined the belt. I learned several key lessons that day. First \u2013 belt holes are bad. Second, never puncture a gift from your wife. It never turns out well. The good news - it set us out on a journey to create a better belt for men.  \nOur original Kickstarter Trakline belt campaign from 2013\nFlash forward - after 18 months of designing, prototyping and testing we launched our first evolution of Trakline belts right here on Kickstarter in 2013. We were fortunate enough to attract over 4,000 backers and were on our way. So here we are\u2026 back again to introduce our latest incarnation our new Ultimate belt.  \nX1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n  Karl Kozak: Sales & Marketing\nMauro Bove: Manufacturing & Quality Control\nSteve Olson: Product & Web Design \n\nThe three of us have been friends and business partners for over 13 years now. Here's a little of our background and relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of high-quality retail products for some of America\u2019s biggest retailers. Steve on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the three of us make a great, motivated team that\u2019s focused on creating and marketing great products.  \nOur Pledge Management Partner\n  X1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n As of 2017 we have a total of 5 patents on our unique Trakline ratchet belts including one on a ratchet belt system with reinforced belt core to support gear. Why all the patents ? We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology and we'd like to keep it that way. \n   \n               Visit us online @  http://www.KoreEssentials.com \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n                                THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME & SUPPORT \n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n       After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Kore Essentials, Inc.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign since we launched our original Trakline belt project back in 2013. Since that time we've managed to launch and successfully deliver 6 new products to over 15,000 backers. And I think we can say with some certainty, that we met, or exceeded, most backers expectations in regards to product quality, design and function. \n\nOf course, along the way we've learned a few valuable lessons. \n\nFor example, we make a habit of communicating frequently and openly with our backers regarding the manufacturing progress and shipping status. We do an update every 1-2 weeks after the project is completed. \n\nGoal # 1 is to deliver a well designed, quality product that exceeds Backer expectations and that backers love. As proof with past campaigns - after receiving their Trakline belts over 40% of the backers visited our online store to purchase a 2nd, 3rd and 4th belt .\n\nNevertheless, we understand moving forward this is a new project, with its own set of challenges and that past successes don't eliminate all the future risks involved.\n\nThe biggest challenge as always for us when creating a new product, is timing. We strive to get our projects completed on time, with no snafus. There are molds and tooling to create and we test at each step of the process. But if delays do happen, we keep backers \"in the loop\" as to what's going on and the new timelines. \n\nBased on our track record - we feel like backers can be confident and assured - they're going to get a great product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "EARLYBIRD >> 1 Ultimate Belt", "descp": "Includes 1 Buckle & 1 Belt.

You lay everything out on the counter and reach for a knife - your favorite knife. The one that\u2019s dirty, but you stop to clean it anyway. The knife that makes you a more confident and creative cook. The right knife.\nWe\u2019ve made that knife. By combining the very best of eastern and western knifemaking, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp, beautiful, premium blade - and we\u2019re bringing it to you for a non-premium price.\nThe right blade\nYour chef knife is central to creating nearly every dish. Whether you\u2019re mincing chives, or cutting apart a whole chicken, the chef knife can do it all.\nHowever, your choices at the store are confusing. Cheap knives are clunky to use and dull quickly. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right blade can be a frustrating experience, but we don\u2019t think that needs to be the case.\n An incredible knife for a fair price \nThe world of chef knives is out of date. The big knife brands are operating on outdated sales margins that inflate the price of knives sold at a retail store. By avoiding the traditional retail sales model and bringing our product to you directly online, we have created a great knife for a fraction of the price.\nDon\u2019t waste your money on a knife block filled with knives you\u2019ll never use. Get the one knife you\u2019ll reach for again and again.\nComparison of the costs that go into bringing you a knife\nOne great blade\nA good knife stays sharp and is comfortable to use. A great knife is the one you reach for.\nWe\u2019ve put a ton of attention into how people hold and use their knives, and we think we\u2019ve designed the ultimate hybrid. A knife that takes the best elements of western and eastern knifemaking, and combines them into one blade.\nAfter experimenting with dozens of blade profiles, grip shapes and types of steel, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp blade that feels right at home in your hand. A long deep belly helps with effortless chopping, while the lowered tip makes slicing and finer work more approachable.\n  Grip & Bolster \nThe grip and bolster are designed with intention. The contour of the grip makes it feel secure regardless of your preferred grip style or the the size of your hands. Olive Wood - a durable hardwood - keeps the handle grippy whether it's wet or dry.\nEven when holding the blade in a pinch grip, a thumb groove in the bolster makes for a more confident and comfortable grip on the blade.\nA well balanced blade.\n Layered Steel\nThe vast majority of stainless steel blades are made with soft steel that won\u2019t hold an edge. Our blade has a cutting core made of Japanese VG-10 steel. This innovative high-carbon stainless steel holds an incredible edge and won\u2019t corrode like other high carbon steels.\nThis cutting core is then sandwiched in 66 layers of alternating stainless steels. This technique - sometimes referred to as \u201cSan Mai\u201d which is used in traditional Japanese sword making - allows the VG10 to be used for the edge while the other layers form a jacket around it. This layering protects the cutting core, while providing a beautiful layered finish on the faces of the blade.\nHow sharp? Very sharp. \nMany knives on the market are sharp, but few stay that way for long. Being as sharp as possible isn\u2019t necessarily best, particularly if you\u2019re trading off the knife\u2019s ability to retain that sharp edge. A scalpel may be sharper than a kitchen knife, but it would dull quickly.\nIf your steel is too hard it becomes brittle, and if your edge angle is too fine it will dull quickly. We experimented until we found the right steel and edge profile that maximizes edge retention. The result is a blade that\u2019s razor sharp and stays that way.\nOur steel is hardened to between 57-59 rockwell hardness, which allows for a more finely sharpened edge. The blade is then tapered to a 17 degree edge angle, allowing you to glide through even the toughest of root vegetables.\n  Testing\u2026 Testing... \nWe\u2019ve tested our blade with both chefs and home cooks to develop something that feels intuitive for everyone. After more than a year of designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing samples we\u2019re ready to go to production. Dozens of revisions have helped us to develop a knife we can\u2019t wait to share with the world.\nStretch Goals\nCustom textured ABS Blade Guard. Image is a mockup.\n  1000/6000 combination grit whetstone. Image is a mockup.\nWhy we need your help \nOur knife is ready for production - now we need to raise $25,000 to fund the first production run. All the funds raised will go directly towards sourcing the materials and expert labor needed to create these handmade blades. We have the suppliers and manufacturers lined up and ready to go, we just need your help to bring the blade to life. \nTimeline \nWho are we?   \n  Get Your Project Funded Today!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk is manufacturing delays.\n\nWe already have fully established relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers.

Through attending perfumery classes, and consulting with with some really amazing perfumers, we gained the background we needed to create a line of designer grade cologne scented candles. \nWhile we've done lots of test runs, we need funding to launch our first full scale line of production.  The costs of packaging, vessels, custom wax blends, and most notably our fragrance oils (which are as high quality as any on the market) are expensive and we need funding as capital to place orders.  Once we are funded, and we have the materials we need, we will be hand pouring and packaging each candle ourselves.\nNOTE: the candle glasses shown in our video have changed a bit for the better since we shot it.

In our initial tests, we experienced diminished \"throw\" in a few test candles when we did not allow for the correct amount of maceration time of the oils. Maceration is a technical term that involves giving the various fragrance ingredients time to bond and react. We attempted to rush this compounding process to see if we could get these out the door quicker to you guys but there are no short cuts, and they aren't real great without proper maceration and cure time.

After meeting with our perfumer in the beginning of February, we made a very important decision to make a few tweaks to the fragrances for our first line of candles. We had this discussion prior to placing the bulk orders of our fragrance oils because we felt very passionately that if there was even a little room for us to improve and give everyone the best possible product, we would do it. After meeting with our perfumer, we were hopeful that the delivery of our fragrance oil with the final iterations would arrive towards the close of February 2016. We still felt confident in delivery because we do our own pours and could fulfill the order of 700 candles on our own in a couple days. Unfortunately, delivery of the fragrance oils has been delayed. We are now anticipating them to arrive to us in the middle of March 2016. Our fragrance oils are made right here in Los Angeles so we hope you feel reassured that delivery to us will not take a significant amount of time once completed.

It's most commonly made from of the incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as tar; that's right, TAR! It's a product that is labeled as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nInk isn't only made of pigments, a considerable amount of ink is made up of binders, carriers, and solvents. Most carriers are petroleum oil, while most solvents used in inks are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all of which have detrimental human and environmental impacts.\nThe Solution\nDevelop an ink that is safe and sustainable. Living Ink is produced in cells using sunlight and CO2 from the atmosphere; its only byproducts are oxygen and clean water. This means Living Ink is actually great for the environment. Living Ink is the first step in weaning the world off of regular ink and moving towards a safe and renewable solution.\nIf you love science too, or want to know even more about the technical details behind Living Ink, shoot us an email. We\u2019re scientists at heart and we love talking shop, anytime.\nWhile researching and developing our sustainable algae ink to replace the regular ink we use everyday something unexpected happened\u2014the ink changed from one day to the next.\nAs scientists, we began analyzing the \u201cproblem.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize that this \u201cLiving Ink\u201d was really cool.\nAfter sending Grandma Elle a Living Ink birthday card, seeing how much our kids loved drawing their favorite stories, and watching actual artists use it in creative ways, we knew we had to share it with the world.\nWe are here on Kickstarter because it\u2019s a creative community that supports art and science. Until this point, we\u2019ve been deep in the science (something to the tune of 10 years studying and researching algae). But, our goal has always been to see something useful result from all of that research.\nWe know that Living Ink will be incredibly useful to all types of people, but we need help to take this from R&D to actual product.\nThat\u2019s where the Kickstarter community comes in. The majority of funds for this project will go directly to manufacturing the world\u2019s first pen that writes in algae. The remaining pledges will allow us to purchase materials and produce components in bulk, in order to get the cost low enough to get Living Ink into the hands of all you artists, creatives, inventors, DIY'ers, and genuinely interesting people.\nEnvironmental Protection\nIf you haven\u2019t figured it out already, our Living Ink is made of Algae. Algae is the planet\u2019s superfood\u2014critical to the existence of thousands of species, the water we drink, and countless other life sustaining functions. It is our priority to ensure that our ink helps protect the environment through responsible business practices, and through educating our customers about the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.  \nEmpowering Storytellers\nEven before we had ink, humans were sharing their past, explaining their present, and dreaming up their future through stories. The desire to be understood transcends all cultures and eras. It\u2019s our goal to continue to inspire and empower storytellers to excel at their craft.\nSharing Science\nWe believe that science is the most exciting way to improve our lives. We hope that our project will inspire the next generation of scientists to turn research into awesome products that advance society.\nScott and Steve are two scientists who have dedicated the last decade to developing new ways to use algae as ink, to replace the inks we see and use every day. Steve is the mad scientist. For him, if it\u2019s not a well-documented process, then it\u2019s not worth doing. Scott is the Clark Kent of Science. Sometimes he\u2019s just a normal nerdy guy, and then he turns into this scientific super hero of sorts. They teamed up with some of their smartest friends to help them pull off this Kickstarter campaign. Jared and Tyler are the creative force behind this campaign and the products we'll be shipping out. If you spot one of the many small details of awesomeness, it surely was their doing. David brought to the team his proven Kickstarter strategy that he has honed while \"monkii'ing\" around. He tells our story in a way that has propelled Living Ink as a brand and product to new heights.\nMost importantly, it took friends and family to fill in the gaps. Now, we look to the Kickstarter community to join our team and make Living Ink come to life!\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. Ink formulation stability.\nWe have developed the first pen formulation that is capable of growing and we are really excited about this. We also have added other components to the ink so that you can see where you are writing as you make your masterpiece. These added components disappear from the page under an hour, so that your message becomes a mystery to anyone but you. This formulation has been quite a challenge for us to get perfect, and any deviation from this formulation may change the rate at which the ink grows. We\u2019re constantly working on ways to ensure that this isn\u2019t a problem when we ship out the product and this successful Kickstarter will help ensure nothing but the best product leaves our lab. \n \n2 Variability in growth conditions.\nWhile our inks can grow in low light and cool conditions, they\u2019d much rather have bright light and warm temperatures all day long. Here at Living Ink we are dedicated to clearly communicating how much light is required and the right temperature for your ink to grow the way we say it does. Low light conditions and cooler temperatures may cause your ink to grow slower than expected. While we currently use an algae strain that is sensitive to these changing conditions, we are also researching other species of algae that allow for a much wider range of light and temperature conditions.\n\n3. Shipping logistics.\nWe package living algae cells into the pens that are shipped to your door. These microscopic organisms are very robust, but conditions outside of their comfort level can cause them to die, which doesn\u2019t make for good growing ink. We believe that our scientists have developed formulations that prepare the cells to live in dark conditions for long periods of time, but problems in the shipping process and/or cold weather may cause the ink to improperly function once you start using them. Not to worry, though. We\u2019re on it and believe that when you get your ink, there will be more than enough live algae cells to make your images come to life, no matter how long it takes to get to your door!\n\n4. We're scientists\nWe've never shipped a product before! We knew we had a lot to learn in this regard, so we teamed up with people who have successfully designed products and fulfilled large Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nThroughout the entire campaign, and if/when any challenges arise, we\u2019re committed to being transparent and communicative to our backers. This means you\u2019ll get regular campaign updates and be involved during the entire fulfillment process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Thank you and Remaining Backer Surveys", "update_content": " Hey Backers,\nWhat a crazy last couple months it has been!

As caretakers for kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their kodama best will be remembered for generations!\nFrom the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama branches out into a fun new way to play! Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth. At the end of each season, one kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs. With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family.\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games, playing in under 45 minutes for 2-5 players. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse our rule book here.\n \nThe Deluxe Edition of the game includes the below components in addition to the ones above:\nThe story of Kodama is an interesting one indeed. Initially, we sought to publish Daniel's game Kigi, but felt we could help to develop a few elements of the game. Two months later, we realized that we had a much different game than Kigi and Kodama took seed! (You can read more about this here in Daniel's Design Diary.)\nWhile both games come from similar roots, Kodama provides a very different game experience from its predecessor.\nHere are the differences in Kigi and Kodama:\nTHEME: In Kodama, players cultivate homes (trees) for the kodama.\nPLACEMENT: In Kodama, there is no pruning, but rather a 10 point scoring cap for placement that encourages diversity while leaving players with a beautiful tree by the end of the game. Additionally, players now only place branches on their own trees.\nFEATURES: Not only are all of the features updated to help represent the theme, there are now six features as opposed to five.\nGOALS: In Kigi, goals came in the form of Commission cards that were shuffled into the branch deck. Now, players are dealt four kodama cards, three of which they will score over three seasons.\nSEASONS: Play is now divided into three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. At the beginning of each season a Decree will be revealed which will add or amend a rule in the game--adding more replayability and strategy to placement. After placing four branches, players will select one of their Kodama cards to score. At the end of three seasons, players score a final Kodama card and a winner is determined!\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the fifth project from Action Phase Games and was designed by the very talented Daniel Solis. With the successful execution of our first four projects, we have become experienced as publishers. We will confidently execute this project to the same high standard.\nThe deluxe edition, containing additional content and upgraded components, will not be available in retail.\nDaniel Solis has successfully designed a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and levels of experience. Kodama is innovative while remaining easy to learn and play. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that this game will be played for years to come.\nPeople who have demoed and play-tested this game have uniformly loved it for its original mechanics, charm, artistic beauty, and accessibility. While the game takes under 45 minutes to teach and play, it offers a surprising amount of tactical depth and replay value.\nAll of the art assets (with the exception of the 3 Become a Guardian pledge levels) are complete.\nThe game is full of charming illustrations by the extremely gifted Kwanchai Moriya, with graphic design by the equally talented Scott Hartman.\nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project \u2014 we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any over-funding goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. You'll get access weeks before it's made available to everyone else!\nPledge levels vary from just $1 to several hundred dollars. And each different level opens up a new creative reward.

We will be in touch with all backers shortly after the campaign has ended.\nThank you all!!\nThe ONELID Team\n\n\nONELID\nThe world\u2019s first truly universal multifunction lid that actually looks good and works like a dream. Once you try this - we promise you\u2019ll never want to go back to using your old lids. Well maybe for drumming that is...\nONELID was originally spawned by the ambition to make a lid that would minimize the risk of over boiling - but along the way we learned there were so many more annoying things related to the regular lids we use, like finding a lid that fits, burning hands and difficulties draining.\nMeet ONELID \n\nThe only lid that is :\nUniversal - will fit most of your pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\" diameter).\nReduces over boiling -  intelligent groove system will let out just the right amount of excess steam.\nHas an integrated strainer \u2013 draining a pot has never been easier or safer, just grab your pot or pan and pour.\n\nDoes not transfer heat - even when boiling for extended amount of time the ONELID handle stays cool to the touch.  \n\nMakes no sound - soft on the outside - yet sturdy on the inside makes for safe handling and silent operation.\nDanish Design at its best - we are pretty proud to have fit all these features into a design this modern, sophisticated and elegant.\nIs dishwasher safe - naturally...\nSo, if you are like us, and would like to get your hands on one of the first ONELIDS, please sign up - and we will do our utmost to make your cooking experience easier, safer and more enjoyable for years to come. For a little more in-depth knowledge - please read on...  \nONELID - HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSIZE - having trouble finding a lid to fit?\nNot to mention the cacophony of noisy metal striking metal when desperately trying to find the right lid inside your kitchen cabinet? ONELID offers 4 ingenious features combined with great modern design in one elegant lid that will fit all your existing pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\").\nEver experienced boiling over?\nDepending on what you\u2019re cooking, every pot will tend to over boil if you turn the heat up too high. The bigger the pot - the more steam is let out. ONELID greatly reduces this tendency by letting out just the right amount of excess steam. The intelligently designed grooves on the underside of ONELID are shaped to match the size of your pot and release just the right amount of steam to prevent over-boiling. Simple :) \nAnd you know the moisture that drips from your current lids onto the stovetop? ONELIDs patented convex underside ensures the drops that form will run back into your pot, so your stovetop stays cleaner.\nDraining  - no more burned fingers or spilled pasta in your sink\nTired of burning your fingers on metal/glass lids during cooking or while pouring? Ever tried sliding your conventional lid a little to the side allowing that boiling water to drain, but ended up soaking your pot holders and getting peas and pasta into the sink? Yeah - who hasn\u2019t!\n\nWell no more. Because of the unique air-vents doubling as strainer (draining) holes, you now have trouble-free draining. ONELIDs silicone surface ensures great friction against the pot so your ONELID will stay centered and safe \u2013 even when held vertically. Your peas and pasta will remain in the pot where they belong.\nPerfect for casseroles too. The ONELID handle have taken many forms to reach this final design. ONELID now boasts superior ergonomics - both for 1 and 2-handle pots. And with a diameter of 23 cm/9\" ONELID will cover all you pots up to 3,5 liters. (covering 90-95 % of all private cooking). \nJust check your old pot diameters before signing up.\nHeat distribution - cool to the touch\nThis FLIR-photo comparison shows how much better the heat distribution of ONELID works compared to a steel lid (and btw. glass lids are the same). Other than the hotter steam areas (away from the handles) the ONELID handle has the same temperature as the room and is barely affected by the boiling process within. No matter where you grip ONELID, your fingers are safe from burning. The better insulation will also save you power !\nEarly tests on temperature...\nPLAY\n\nCHECK OUT THE VIDEO BELOW HIGHLIGTING THE MAIN FEATURES \nPLAY\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\nThe initial idea behind ONELID was spawned by professional chef, and ONELID co-creator, Sylvester Vantore. He observed how chefs would use tin foil as a substitute for the right size pot lid. This simple technique furthermore had the adjustability to let out just the right amount of excess steam in order to reduce over-boiling. Although functional, it\u2019s not very practical nor pretty. Understanding that there must be a better way, Sylvester eventually came up with the idea of an oversized lid (to fit varying pot sizes) designed with under-lid grooves to allow excess steam to escape.\nSylvester brought this discovery to the attention of prominent Danish designer, Martin Sonne. Martin eagerly took up the challenge to make the 'perfect lid'. From that point on, the lid began to evolve, but it would be years before the form and function were perfected.\n\nCHALLENGES PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES\nWe knew we had to let out just enough steam to minimize the risk of over boiling without wasting energy so we added some more grooves and came up with the 'swing' to the channels so the vent holes 'adjusts' to the diameter of the pot. Small pot, small holes - larger pot, larger holes. It was only during early tests that we discovered that the vent holes provided the perfect effect for straining. And again - the bigger the pot the faster the water is let out so it was a win-win.  \nWe also came up with the now patented convex underside in order for the lid to fit multiple pot sizes. This had added benefits too: The lid will 'automatically' center on any pot and stay securely in place - and it takes very little effort to hold while pouring because it more or less 'hangs' from the friction created by the silicone. The condensed steam forming on the underside of the lid will flow back into the pot and not onto your stove top.\nEven though it didn't exactly made things easier, requiring the silicone surface was a big priority. The benefits are many: 260 \u00b0C (500 \u00b0F) heat resistance, non-stick easy clean-up, non-toxic, and very resistant to microbiological growth. Add to that, ONELID makes a fashion statement in any kitchen. It not only looks and feels great, ONELID provides exceptional ergonomics, because the friction created when the lid is on the pot is far superior to metal. You\u2019ll immediately feel the difference when you handle the pot - the lid just stays more securely in place.\nTHE PROCESS\nAlong the way we have tested several designs. Below is an array of the various designs and prototypes ranging from the first 360 degree design through to a more solid design - unfortunately proving impossible to make but leading the way to the beautiful final design we have today.\nTHE PRODUCTION\nFinally we have the details right - It did take us years of work and a skilled manufacturer. A true professional and we even needed to go to the other side of the world to find him. Kenny is his first name, KONG his surname. We call him \"King Kong\" as he helped us nail the final procedure. So we worked out a 4 part procedure to make a lid with 4 functions - makes sense :) \nStep 1 : Mold inner core in nylon with Stainless insert\nStep 2 : Full silicone overmold\nStep 3 : Mold lower handle in ABS\nStep 4 : Mold upper handle in ABS\n\nMount and UV weld, pack and ship to you guys in the sturdy packaging so you too can start enjoying the ONELID life ;)\n\nTHE IP\nONELID holds a patent based on the concave shape and the ingenious groove system on the lower side.\nMore to this we have applied for a design protection since we find it worth the money to try and  protect the signature design by Martin. There will be copies sooner or later - but we aver none with the qualitiy of our design, material composition and finish.\n\nMILESTONES\nSeptember         Kickstarter campaign launch\nOctober              Mold start-up\nDecember          Production 1 roll.\nJanuary 2016     Production start - start shipping\nFebruary  2016  Shipping done \nApril 2016          Shipping Glass lids\nABOUT US\nMartin Sonne - with more than 20 years of designing products and working with visual communication, Martin is still striving for the simplest solutions to the most complex problems. Designing ONELID has been a journey in just that - trying to fit all these unique features into a lid so simple and so clean that one would think it is just another lid. Staying within that comfort zone of what people expect a lid to look like and then add a little evolution on top seemed to be the right approach.\nSylvester Vantore - the man with the 1000 ideas. Sylvester is on a quest to make good things better; To find that little thing that will make a normal item become a unique item. Being a chef and having learned from the best (Rasmus Kofoed - world champion chef 2011) Sylvester knows what makes for good kitchen tools. So it comes as no surprise that he was the man to invent ONELID.\nWe couldn't have done this alone though. With great production expertise and patience from Lars Forsberg (from Danish company Fabrikators) we are now ready to move into production. \nWant to know more about Fabrikators go to www.fabrikators.com\n\nAnd Kenny Kong the man will make sure tooling and production is second to none once we get there. \nSo 5 years down the road and we are ready to let you guys take us the rest of the way. We can't tell you how much we want this to happen. We want to let the world try how cooking can be if you have the right tools. This lid is made like it should have been in the first place - ONELID - is all you need. So please help us get this baby to take its first steps...\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n40,000 USD     GET'S US STARTED - ITS ALL WE NEED !\nONELID standard edition - comes in pale grey or dark grey\nONELID Kickstarter limited edition\n70.000 USD    GET'S THE GLASS VERSION ON THE POT\nSame functions - same materials - and still have the grooves...only this time with a glass center so you can tell what's cooking'..\nONELID glass edition\nIf we do hit 70k we will do a special Kickstarter version just for you guys.

Islands simply have a set point value that players will score at the end of the game if they control the seas surrounding it. However, whenever you place an island card, you must draw an event card. Events often reward the player with a unique strategic action, but there are three Kraken cards in the deck, and when all three are revealed, the game ends immediately! \nMore game info below in the Overview Section, including a FREE Print & Play, Draft Rules Download, and a Tutorial Video!\nWhy Pledge Now? \nDiscount - By backing Virgin Seas you will get your copy at a nice discount.

Unfortunately he and his crew met their untimely end before being able to retrieve the precious gems! Now you must collect these gems to gain fortune and fame and be crowned king of the Virgin Seas!\nRed Beard's Booty is an exciting expansion for Virgin Seas that adds a fabulous red velvet pouch, 48 beautiful gems (same type used in Dig Down Dwarf), and an instruction mat, all housed in a reusable clam-shell case. Instead of each island being worth the set amount indicated on the card, players now draw random gems from the bag and seed the island. Players draw a number of gems equal to the number on the island card. Each gem scores in a different way and this adds a new layer of strategy and excitement to the game! \nIf we fund, we promise that Virgin Seas will be a thrilling and rewarding experience for you and your family and friends. However, if we over fund we will be able to expand the game in both quality and quantity. You see, the more we raise, the more units we will be able to manufacture. This equates to a lower unit cost. These saving WILL be added back into the game in the form of additional content and better quality components.

We will send out detailed surveys after funding to gather the info needed to customize your pledge. Enjoy! Worldwide shipping included!\nSimply add $20 to any pledge (that includes a copy of the game) and you will have it upgraded to a Collector's Edition! You could even add $100 (5x$20) to the Merchant Pledge level and get 5 copies of the Collector's Edition! Mind Blown!\nThe cost of shipping Virgin Seas is factored into the pledge levels for U.S. Backers. I wanted to explain the shipping costs to everyone, so that you can see exactly where the numbers come from. Below is a nice chart that shows the dollar amount you need to add to your pledge depending on where you live and the shipping credit that is applied at each level. Whatever the cost is to ship within the U.S. becomes a credit that is applied to Canadian, EU, and International shipping. Example: It costs $7 to ship one copy of the game within the U.S. and it costs $13 to ship the same package to Canada, so $7 is taken off the cost for Canadian Backers, thus you only have to pay $6 for shipping instead of the full $15.\n                                                                                                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to make a quality product and we understand the challenges of doing so.

After the successful funding of nearly $500,000 from our previous campaign, Bomber Barrel, our early Kickstarter backers asked us to make a survival keychain to go with their Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and bracelet. Introducing \u2014 Bomber Survival Gear, Survival Bracelet and Keychain.\nBomber Complete Pack - Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Paracord Bracelet\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nBomber Paracord Survival Bracelet\nWe wanted to create a timeless piece to accommodate your Bomber Barrel: an accessory that you can bring with you to the city, on hikes, and on all of your adventures. So the conception of the perfect everyday keychain was brought to life.\nFirestarter Paracord Survival Keychain\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nWith its minimal design and effective functionality, the Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain is the perfect addition to your Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and survival gear collection.\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nWe carefully crafted and tied premium quality 550 paracord into the design. The Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain can be used for a variety of emergency situations. \nBomber Paracord Keychain\n                 Bomber Paracord Keychain X MagKey\nEquipped with 3 meters of paracord and fire-starting capabilities, the Bomber Survival Bracelet is not only stylish but practical.  The funding will help us manufacture a second production run of our Bomber Survival Bracelets.\nBomber Paracord Bracelet\nBomber Paracord Bracelet and Keychain\nIn addition to its functional 550 paracord strength, the Bomber Survival Bracelet and Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain both have firestarting capabilities using flint/steel woven within its design.\nBomber Paracord Survival Bracelet\nDue to popular demand, we are bringing back the Bomber Barrel Set with an added bonus: the Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain.\nThe complete Bomber Set includes the original Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag, Mini Bomber Travel Kit, Bomber Survival Bracelet, and Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain.  With your help, we can start a second production run of the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bags.  All of the original tooling and pattern costs have been set up. Now, we're just in need of funding to get started on our production.\nBomber Barrel Duffle Bag, Paracord Bracelet, & Keychain\nBomber Barrel Duffle Bag\nBomber Barrel\nParacord was first used as suspension lines for U.S. parachutes during WWII, but has since proved itself useful in hundreds, if not thousands of other ways. The braided sheath has an incredible number of interwoven strands compared to its thickness, giving it a smooth texture, elastic feel, and unmatched strength. This makes it compact, fashionable, and highly useful in survival and dangerous situations.\nBomber & Company - Paracord Survival Gear\n                                                      Bomber & Company was founded on Kickstarter by you!

Comes in matte black which fits the look of the bag and was developed for military packs and gear. For added versatility it also functions with those standard metal snaps mentioned which you can buy in the sewing section at most stores and they are all military spec in size.

Would you benefit from instruction, motivation, and tuition to help you record the sights you see and the people and places that you visit?  \nAs the answer to this, we at 3dtotal Publishing have created an inspiring artistic solution to enable you to carry your creativity around with you: How to Keep a Sketch Journal. \nThe different elements for the full How to Keep a Sketch Journal package\nA sketch journal allows you to record what you see around you and visualize your inner thoughts. It can offer an opportunity for you to relax and contemplate, a space for you to experiment with new materials and ideas, and a memoir in which to chronicle your progress and store references.\nYou can use a sketch journal to record your pets, friends, meals, family, special events, and occasions; to remember something nice someone did for you today, something that inspired you, something that taught you a new trick; to collect ideas and try new things.\nThis colourful display is by Rhea Dadoo, one of the featured artists in the How to Keep a Sketch Journal guide book\nFollowing the success of the Sketch Workshop Kickstarter campaign, 3dtotal Publishing\u2019s How to Keep a Sketch Journal package will help you follow your creative aspirations and unleash the artist within you. The project incorporates the informative How to Keep a Sketch Journal guide book teamed with high-quality sketch pads, quintessential artist tools, and a soft leather cover to wrap everything up as a compact artistic companion.\nAt 3dtotal we believe everyone has the potential to be creative, so How to Keep a Sketch Journal will help even the most beginner sketcher to unlock their inner artist, teaching you all the essential techniques to get your journal started \u2013 and how to keep it going!\n112 pages of expert advice and stunning images; note that this is a mock-up image\nThe book will consist of four main sections with step-by-step guides covering the basics, watercolour techniques, pen and pencil techniques, and mixed media techniques. The specially selected artists behind the book will offer you advice and insights into their own work, as well as talking to you about some of their favourite techniques. The aim is to encourage you to discover how to keep a sketch journal in your own unique way.\nBook mock-up - Florian Afflerbach\nNot all of us lead exciting lives jetting around the world so How to Keep a Sketch Journal will provide you with plenty of ideas for interpreting the most mundane day-to-day subjects as exciting visual expressions, from annotated sketches to multimedia drawings. \nBook mock-up - Rhea Dadoo\nFor those of you who are lucky enough to have landmarks like the Eiffel Tower at your doorstep, we\u2019ll give you a glimpse into other artists\u2019 sketch journals to give you ideas for optimizing and maintaining your visual diary. With its attractive hand-drawn feel, this A5-size book will give you all the knowledge, motivation, and confidence you\u2019ll need!\nBook mock-up - Florian Afflerbach\nSketch wherever you go and carry your journal, tools, and How to Keep a Sketch Journal book with you! The soft, real leather cover is designed to be light and comfortable for you to carry wherever you are going. Slightly bigger than A5, it will neatly wrap up your sketch journal items while the leather ribbon will ensure your art tools are kept secure.\nOf course, you'll also need your own, blank journal for you to start your sketching adventures in! We therefore have two journals for you to choose from to allow you to tailor the package to your needs and budget:  \nAn A5 hardback journal with 170gsm high-quality cartridge paper, ideal for sketching with pen and pencil - portrait orientation  \nA Monsieur A5 soft leather cover premium journal with 200gsm watercolour paper - landscape orientation  \nJust select the pledge option that best suits you!\nThe landscape premium watercolour journal and the portrait hardback journal\nThe tool set includes the basic HB pencil and a fineliner pen, plus a watercolour set and a water brush pen, so you\u2019ll be able to add colour and your own distinct style to your journal. \nWe\u2019ve carefully selected tools that are high quality yet practical enough to be used on the move. For example the handy water brush pen will make painting on location a breeze, without the inconvenience of having to wipe up spilled water. \nPlus, as part of the watercolour set we'll include handy postcards displaying colour swatches and a colour wheel that can easily be tucked into one of the inside pockets of the leather cover, so you'll have all the essential information close to hand.\nWe created the How to Keep a Sketch Journal package as a beautiful and inspiring bundle for anyone who has ever thought about keeping a sketch journal or who just wants to find a new creative outlet, whatever your skill level.

Please note that we can only reship an order once if it is lost. If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.\nWith the Sketch Workshop experience now firmly under our belts, we are already hard at work writing and commissioning content for the How to Keep a Sketch Journal book, while continuing to refine and make improvements to the leather cover to ensure it's as comfortable and easy to carry as it is good-looking. If we reach our funding goal in July, we will be able to finalise the cover for mass production, and we expect for our shipments of books and covers to arrive in early December, allowing us to ship to backers throughout the month of December.  \nAs with any Kickstarter project, schedules can change depending on a variety of factors, however we have a lot of experience as publishers and Kickstarter creators, so we are confident we can stay on track. We will of course keep our backers up to date if any changes arise.\nAs a publisher of art books and tools specialising in computer graphics, we love that we can reach a new audience for traditional art through Kickstarter. We have met so many talented and inspiring people through the Kickstarter community already, and we hope to grow that network further still through the Sketch Journal project.

Over the past year Bluetooth LE (low energy) technology, has unlocked entire new categories of tech gadgets, one of which are small tracking devices. We think this technology is really cool but we have yet to find a tracker that we would use on a daily basis. Inspired by the potential of this technology, we decided to design and create our own device. We know people appreciate great quality when it comes to personal items. So we created Loopio, the World's first all aluminium Bluetooth tracker and also Loopio Sport, which has been inspired by the comments we recieced from Kickstarters since we launched our project. Both trackers use our smart antenna design to maximise signal performance and functionality.\nOur frustration with existing products\nHere are the current products available. Most of them are cheap, badly designed pieces of plastic. The truth is the majority of these trackers simply don\u2019t work well enough to be used in every day life. In tests we found the main problems were lack of signal and poor battery life. This is caused by failing to utilise the current low energy bluetooth technology to its full potential.\nWhat we did\nTaking all these factors into account we designed & developed a new device, something that's built for purpose. Loopio has been designed from the ground up to be stylish, high quality and functional.\nWhat makes the Loopio design so unique?\nThe Loopio is made from aluminium. To make this possible we needed a new way to incorporate the antenna, so we decided to add the antenna in the form of a loop. This loop also doubles up as the key loop, or by which you can attach it to anything you like. Our smart antenna design combined with the latest hardware enables Loopio to achieve optimal signal stability for up to a 50m (164feet) range. We then packaged this into the smallest design possible.\nHow the Loopio works\nLoopio is Innovation\nThe Loopio is small and compact\nThanks to its intelligent flexible loop design we also managed to make the Loopio very compact. This means that when you attach your keys to the Loopio, it folds with your keys taking up minimal space, making sure it fits perfectly in your pocket.\nSuper efficient\nThanks to the low voltage bluetooth technology the Loopio is super efficient. The battery lasts for one year and is easily replaceable by the user.\nDesigned to be tough\nMade from aluminium the Loopio is designed to be tough. It's lightweight too, weighing in at just 13grams, It's also water and dust resistant.\nDesigned with attention to detail, we believe in the small details\nThe Loopio has been designed with care and attention to detail. We hope you like the design as much as we do.\n Loopio Colors\nThe Loopio is currently available in silver or black, we will be adding more colors and finishes based on stretch goals and your suggestions.\nTech Specifications \nProject Timeline\nAbout us\nNow that you've learned about Loopio, we'd like to take a moment to introduce the minds behind this project. The loopio has been designed and developed in the UK. The Loopio concept, including the antenna design, has been designed by myself and the development and prototyping stages have been a collaboration with a UK technology & research company. The manufacturing will be outsourced to China, to meet our quality and price requirements needed in order to make this project viable.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are so excited to share Loopio with Kickstarter before anyone else. The reason we have chosen the Kickstarter platform is simple. We have put a lot of time, effort and money into the design and development of our product and we know kickstarter has the potential to give our project the momentum it needs to succeed. \nWe recognise that kickstarter has an important community of gadget enthusiasts, innovators and creators. This is why we want to share our idea with you because we feel your opinions and suggestions can really help us make this product the best it can be.\nYour funding means more than anything to us, and we hope you can all join our exciting journey. All of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making Loopio a reality. We truly believe that our product will be in a class of its own.\nThank You!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt has taken us nearly a year to get to were we are today with the design and development of the Loopio. It has been a great challenge to achieve such great performance in such a compact sleek design.\nThe (BLE) bluetooth low energy technology that powers the Loopio is tried and tested, this inherently reduces the amount of risk still involved during the final stages of our project.\nThe largest of our hurdles left is to fine tune and get the antenna design ready for production. To help us with this we have partnered up with a world-class manufacturer leading in implementation of bluetooth technology.\nThe last stages of our project involves final development of our app and then bringing all these elements together including tooling, testing and production. \nThe last challenge will be shipping out the product to each of our kickstarter backers. We have already researched this and have found the right logistics partner to use. We don't anticipate any complications during this stage.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Serge Beynon\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi I'm Serge, a creative designer.

Each year, millions of barrels of whiskey are produced and sold. As part of the distilling process, the whiskey is aged in oak barrels.\nThe whiskey is aged in these barrels for 4 years. The used barrels are salvaged, the steel bands are removed, and the staves disassembled. Finally, the staves are cut into over-sized (7/8in. x 7/8in. x 5-1/4in. minimum) pen blanks.\nMy great grandfather, Stephen Ernest Whidden, was a carpenter. He ran a carpentry shop along with Mr. Decatur and Mr. Smith on the northeast corner of Broad Street and Lincoln Terrace in Peekskill, New York back in the 1920s. My grandfather, Ernest Richard Whidden, built airplanes for a living, but in his spare time he enjoyed carpentry.\nInspired by their legacy, I decided in 2014 to begin learning about woodworking. I purchased a lathe and began to make woodturned projects such as pens, keychains, winestoppers, and bowls.\nOne of the motivating factors at our woodshop has always been using reclaimed, salvaged, and sustainable wood sources. For the most part, I collect my own wood or purchase it from local salvage companies.\nThe wood being used to create the rewards for this campaign is from salvaged whiskey barrels once used by the Jack Daniel's Distillery.\nInitially, pen making started out as a hobby. It has grown from that and turned into a full time family business. We currently run an online Etsy shop and sell items locally, but that isn't enough to provide for our growing family of 6 (and 2 cats).\nKickstarter allows for global exposure and creates permanent relationships with people who are passionate about what we create and also with potential retail buyers.\nOur goal for this campaign is to raise enough funds to fulfill all our rewards, purchase a new lathe and drill press for our shop, and to provide for monthly expenses for our family.\nI enjoy creating unique projects with a story. Each of the rewards for this campaign include an authentic piece of American distilling history. Included with each reward is a certificate of authenticity and a story that you can share with your friends.\nRemember each item is handcrafted and unique! There may be variances in wood coloring and grain. Your particular keychain or pen may look slightly different than the one in the picture. If you would like more or higher resolution pictures of the rewards, please let me know!\n\nRewards will begin shipping in July and continue until completed.\nLevel 1 - $8 Reward: Whidden's Woodshop Tote Bag\nLevel 2 - $18 Reward: Wood Keychain\nLevel 3 - $28 Reward: Ballpoint Pen\nLevel 4 - $43 Reward: Ballpoint Pen & Pencil Set\nLevel 5 - $48 Reward: Rollerball Pen\n Level 6 - $50 Reward: Bolt Action Pen\n Level 7 - $60 Reward: Fountain Pen\nLevel 8 - $200 Reward: Ultimate Handcrafted Bundle\nPens from left to right: Fountain, Rollerball, Pencil, Ballpoint Pen, Bolt-Action, Keychain on top.\nAll of our pens come in a display box with a magnetic closure.

There are just a few days left, support now!\nIntroduction:\nHello Kickstarter Community! I need your help to create the future of the water bottle: a sustainable, sleek bottle that filters your water as you drink it. \nStandard reusable bottles are great for the environment and save you money that would otherwise go to over-priced and environmentally costly bottled water\u2014but it\u2019s still on you to fill them with pure, great-tasting water. \nIt\u2019s time for a better solution. \nI\u2019ve designed the WELLY Bottle to be exactly that: an easy-to-carry, reusable, BPA-free water bottle with a built-in filter made from activated and carbonized coconut shells that purifies your water as you drink it. The compressible bamboo hand-panels on the front and back not only look and feel distinctive, but they also allow you to accelerate water flow when you need it most. \nNow I just need your help to get it off the ground! \nThe Inspiration\nWELLY\u2019s story begins with my mom Ellen (my Dad called her 'Elly'), who passed away in 2012 from liver cancer after a life filled with philanthropy and community involvement in my hometown of Pittsburgh. I saw first-hand the impact that the impurities and toxins that saturate so much of our lives can have on a person\u2014a person who also taught me a lifelong lesson in the importance of doing something good for the world.\nAs painful as this experience has been, it inspired me to make something that would help people purify their lives. I had already become frustrated with the incredibly wasteful bottled water industry and decided to create a bottle that is cleaner for your body and cleaner for the environment.\nThis inspiration comes together in our name. WELLY pays tribute to the wells that symbolize humanity\u2019s long relationship with water, as well as the kinds of wells that charity: water builds in the developing world. WELLY also stands as a statement of the power of wellness in invigorating life. Finally, and for me most importantly, WELLY honors and continues the legacy begun by my dear mom Elly.\nThe Design: Purity Meets Usability\nThis starts with the highly absorbent filter, made entirely from coconut shells, that strips away chlorine, odor and other impurities that contaminate the naturally pure taste of clean water. Our filter is independently certified by the stringent standards of NSF International, which has collaborated for years with the World Health Organization on global water issues. Each filter provides two months (or 40 gallons!) of clean water, and you\u2019ll be able to find replacement filters on our website individually or as part of a subscription plan.\nWe then designed our bottle to be a joy for someone who\u2019s serious about staying hydrated while active and on the go. We know from personal experience what it\u2019s like to crave pure water after a run, a session in the yoga studio or a long hike. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built in a bunch of unique (patent pending) features such as:\nA mouthpiece that is protected within the bottle\u2019s cap, ensuring it stays clean, yet easily accessible by tapping the bottle\u2019s trigger\nBamboo hand panels you can squeeze to accelerate water flow\nA finger loop that makes carrying your bottle by hand or on a carabiner easy and secure\nFeet on the bottle\u2019s bottom for stability\nAn opening large enough to accommodate ice cubes\nA slim profile to minimize the space required to carry the bottle in a bag or purse\nAnd, of course, the entire bottle is absolutely BPA and phthalate free.\nOur Commitment: Purification Beyond The Bottle\nWe\u2019re delighted to put the ability to purify your own water supply in the palm of your hand, but we know that the issue of water purity is global in scope as 748 million people currently don\u2019t have access to clean water. That\u2019s why we\u2019re humbled and excited to link up with charity: water, one of the world's leading organizations working on global water safety today. charity: water\u2018s work has already impacted over 5 million people in 24 countries, they operate with full transparently, and with their help, we can show you exactly what projects your money helps to fund (like this one).\n$1 of every WELLY bottle sold, and a percentage of every future filter sold, will go straight to charity: water, where 100% of the donations will directly fund sustainable clean water solutions. \nOur Values: Sustainability At Every Turn\nWe crafted every element of our business model with a focus on sustainability. Our bamboo itself is one of the most rapidly renewable resources on the planet and a source of economic opportunity for over 800,000 people, and it comes only from suppliers using sustainable harvesting practices.

From the printer project, I re-evaluated my approach toward product design as a whole and began taking into consideration the full cycle of products; everything from how materials are first sourced to the manufacturing processes, as well as environmental foot prints pre and post-consumer use. Being inspired I ran with the idea of integrating alternative inks leading me eventually to the creation of the WINKpen!\nIn essence, the WINKpen was born from the desire to create a sustainable alternative to something that many of us use in our daily lives. Traditional pens are, more often than not, disposable products; once the pre-loaded ink stem is exhausted, they essentially just become empty plastic cases that inevitably wind up in a land-fill somewhere. With with the WINKpen, however, an ink reload can be found right there in your kitchen.\nReusable, sustainable, and long-lasting. Helps mitigate \u201cthrowaway\u201d culture and there's also the added benefit of having inexpensive ink available virtually anywhere!\nEveryone! My goal with WINKpens was to create an innovative and simple product people could use and re-use in their daily lives. In many ways, this pen can be a new addition to your creative arsenal, allowing individuals to experiment and express with untraditional mediums. It can be a unique purchase for the creative in your life or just as easily serve as an elegant and customed promotional gift for your business. It is a \u201clow-tech\u201d product that marries modern aesthetics and environmental awareness with traditional function.\nOver the last year and a half, I've devoted the majority of my spare time outside of work to the creation of the WINKpen. Like the creation of anything worth-while, it wasn't exactly easy! There was a lot of sleepless nights spent sketching, designing, and just tinkering in the shop; utilizing everything from 3D printing, sanding mock-ups, jumping on the lathe, using saws, sourcing various materials that were within reach, and reverse engineering. There was a lot of back and forth with sketching, prototyping, and testing. Whenever a prototype failed to meet expectations, I'd start again from square one. While I've poured a lot of my time, and personal finances into the project, I wasn't without support. I contracted others on board when necessary\u2014such as my engineer, who explained to me what was feasible and what wasn't\u2014all of which have aided me into bringing the best solutions into constructing the most user-friendly product possible. Thank you to everyone who's encouraged, advised, and helped me along the way... because without each and every single one of them, I certainly would not be where I am today.\nThe WINKpen is built to be as modular and user friendly as possible. All components fit snuggly together with the use of rubber o-rings, and can be easily pulled apart and pushed back together for ease of cleaning.\nA double-sided glass nib features an angled tip for calligraphy and also a conical tip for finer penmanship. The glass replaces the metal tips and ball-points in traditional pens, removing the risk of corrosion and making it easy to clean. Spiraled grooves in the glass nib elegantly feed ink to paper while also boasting a beautiful aesthetic.\nThe interior of the coupler is lined with an elastomer which acts to hold the glass nib securely in place. The elastomer lining, in combination with the fine feeding tube also aids in the steady flow of ink.\nDiplomat's piston design allows for a simple twist refill and ink release system, making it a simple process to controllably unload and load the pen with various inks of your choosing.\nOur logo will be beautifully etched on the outside of the glass housing. Customizable options will be available in the near future however, as part of this kickstarter you can get yours personalized NOW!                              \n** see pledge perks for details**\nCheck out WINKpens rewards for contributing! The connection I have to this product and startup is something I would love to also share with my supporters, thus I will happily be spending time sketching with beer and wine myself for some unique perks! \n** International Backers - YES I can ship to you!:)  However in order to cover this cost, please add on $25 to your pledge - contact me with any questions**\nAfter getting the first version of this product into the world for people to use, plans for the future of the product include sketch pads, inks, and customizability options; such as cosmetic sleeves (wood, metal, etc.), colored glass nibs, business logos, and personalized names.\n- WINKpens' vision of an innovative new tool that will open up new avenues of creativity.\n- Upfront tool cost and materials. 30k is needed for tooling alone!\n- Allowance for large-scale production.\n- The very first order and run of our product!\n- Continued support for business development, strategies for production, growth, and order management.\n- A few hours of shut-eye for the designer!\nHi, my name is Jess! I'm an industrial designer and contemporary artist located in Portland, Oregon. Creativity made its way into my life early on in a number of ways. Growing up, there was so much in the world that inspired me: nature, colors, and objects that provoked my natural desires to express and problem solve. It wasn't until very recently did my career of choice really begin to emerge to combine all of my experiences into my current path of becoming an entrepreneur.\nMy diverse background from teaching martial arts and personal training to business marketing, customer service, construction, freelance and design--has all contributed to the creation of product that I'm beyond passionate about. Martial arts instilled in me the fighting mentality to relentlessly pursue my goals, business provided the applicable knowledge, construction gave me the hands-on experience, and freelancing as an industrial designer and artist taught me how to better manage and deliver quality products. In a way, each major experience has been a stepping stone to who and where I am now.\nFor me, design is all about solution and utility, while art is expression \u2013 together, they provide endless opportunities and create stories of growth all their own. The potential to touch another person, to ignite that spark in them that might blossom into something great, and the daily opportunity to just provide new experiences is what eternally fuels the love for my craft.\nFrom the very bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for your support and sharing this project with your friends and family! \nAN EXTRA SPECIAL THANK YOU to this awesome crew for your expertise and support! \nMatthew Malone - Engineer \nKurt Rassos - Graphic Designer \nDonald Chan - Editor\nBlacklist Media - Film \n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the creation of any product that includes manufacturing processes and hand-made glass components, there can be a number of unforeseen risks and obstacles.

The current models are 3D printed to provide a functional dimensioned proof of concept; however, this funding will allow us to incorporate injection and overmolding, cover the costly upfront tooling costs, and utilize all the correct quality materials.\n\nWhen I first began this project, I set out to design the WINKpen with integrity. I've put my best foot forward since day one and adamantly refuse to compromise quality. I've hand-selected excellent companies and am constantly learning from mentors and other experienced professionals in an effort to maintain product progression and business growth.

Through many years of research and engineering we have redesigned the mechanics of the umbrella whilst maintaining the familiar look. The KAZbrella is a patented, reverse folding umbrella.\nKAZbrella: reverse folding umbrella\nOpens to look like a conventional umbrella\nDrip free. The KAZbrella opens inside out - Think of it like a flower opening. This leaves the wet side of the canopy contained on the inside when closed. The KAZbrella is dry to handle. It won't drip on the floor or soak anything it touches. \nOpens/Closes in confined spaces. Getting into your car, you can close the KAZbrella into the smallest gap of a car door, whilst remaining dry. Now you can even put the KAZbrella on your car seat without soaking it! \nEasy to open and close in a crowd. KAZbrella opens up and over the user avoiding poking in the eye! Perfect in a crowd.\nStrong in the wind. As the KAZbrella is double spoked, it is extremely strong. In the unlikely event that the KAZbrella is blown inside out, it's not a problem. A click of the button and the KAZbrella will restore back to its open shape. \nHow the KAZbrella opens.\nKAZbrella Closed\nKAZbrella Opening\nKAZbrella Opening\nWe understand an umbrella has to do more than function correctly. It needs to look good too. There are many gimmicky umbrellas on the market and that's not what we're about. We believe in engineering and intelligent design. We want you to be proud to carry a KAZbrella.\nHaving a successful career as an aeronautical and offshore engineer, Jenan has applied his knowledge to his invention. Precise engineering and mathematical equations have been used to ensure the KAZbrella outperforms a conventional umbrella whilst keeping its familiar aesthetics and usability. This has not yet been achieved by any other umbrella designer.\nPrototype Detail\nOur technology and designs are protected by a number of patents and trademarks.\nWe believe in quality and have used high standard materials, from the aircraft-grade aluminium shaft to the lightweight fibreglass spokes. \nThe premium double canopy is made from breathable fabric. It has hydrophobic coating, causing water to bead and roll off the canopy rather than being absorbed into the material.\nBespoke Textile Design for our printed lower canopy:\nOur in-house design team have created a unique textiles design. With tessellating shapes incorporating the KAZ logo, the geometric print reflects an Escher painting.\nAll the top canopies are classic black. Part of the beauty of the KAZbrella is when closed, the inside colour or print will be revealed on the outside.\nWhere applicable we will email you for your colour choice. \nInternational Shippers: Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.\nNB: Pledge funds are being managed by BDL Engineering for and on behalf of KAZ Designs.  \n\"I think this is brilliant because getting into a car with my hair when it's raining I've often wished it would go the other way.\" Kelly Hoppen (Interior Designer)\n\u201cThe \u2018inside out umbrella\u2019 was one of my favourite inventions. It came together with a moment of mechanical inspiration and works beautifully well!\u201d Jem Stansfield (Presenter of Bang Goes the Theory)\n\"You've made me feel like a complete idiot for using a normal umbrella.\" Ben Redhead (Buyer for Firebox.com)\n\"It's a superb example of some reverse engineering\" Angus Rankine (Entrepreneur)\n\"I really really want one.\" Duncan Bannatyne (Entrepreneur)\nWe have manufacturers on board which we have been working with for over a year. We have working production samples. Now, all that we need is your help to get the KAZbrella on the production line. Our Kickstarter funding will be used for the manufacturing process. This will include:\nTooling - as this is a unique product every component has been specifically designed and will require special tooling to make them. \nManufacturing - setting up production line, quality control and testing of the product. \nLogistics - To ensure the delivery is quick and efficient. \nShould we go beyond our target funding for manufacturing, we will use the excess for further prototyping, 3D printing and advancement of the KAZbrella. This will include the development of a range of KAZbrella sizes, handles and canopy designs. \nKaz Designs is a family owned business which draws on the strengths and expertise of its members. \nJenan with a background in Aeronautical and Marine Engineering is the brains behind the mechanics of the patented KAZbrella. \nWendy has sold textile designs to the likes of John Lewis and Liberty of London. She has run her own greeting card company and has an eye for aesthetics and design. \nRiann is a 3D designer and can turn her hand to many jobs. One being translating Jenan's vision into 3D drawings. Not an easy task when you see the inventors' sketches and scribbles! Riann is also a great administrator.\nMax, our talented videographer is responsible for our videos and promotion. \nTony, last but not least, is our skilled Graphic Designer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct\nWe have a production sample which is working well and looking beautiful but we are not done yet. We are working on further improvements. The samples have been manufactured using 3D printed parts to prove the concept and identify the tooling requirements.\n\nDue to the complexity of making a KAZbrella, there is a small possibility that the final specification may change. We will keep you informed on any modifications. \n\nManufacturers\nOver the last 12 months, we have established a close working relationship with our manufacturers who have 20 years experience in producing innovative, quality umbrellas. Together with the expertise of the manufacturers and Jenan's engineering experience we are confident that we can overcome any technical difficulties that may arise. \n\nDelivery\nWe will of course do our upmost to ensure that we hit delivery dates.

The future is bright because of you!\nIf you missed out on our campaign don't worry, check out our website to see how you can grab a GOBAG.\nwww.wearegobag.co.uk\n#PackSmallThinkBig\nThe GOB\u2206G is a carry-on sized duffel bag designed so you can travel compact with all the gear you need. Its killer feature is the Max Pack Bag, which allows you to vacuum compress your soft items. This enables you to carry enough for a long trip in a 35 litre bag.\nGOB\u2206G\u2019s simple and robust design is engineered to last a lifetime. The outer bag is constructed from only two pieces of TPU coated ballistic nylon, a material commonly used to make inflatable boats. This \u2018less is more\u2019 design approach is continued throughout the product.\nThe Full Edge Zip is a 2 meter long, durable YKK zip that runs along the outer edge of the front and side panels. This means more of your gear is next to the zip; you'll never have to dig around at the bottom of your bag again.\nMore zip. Less hassle.\nThis feature doesn't need much explanation. It's the perfect size for 95% of the major airlines' carry-on, even Ryanair!\nThe Max Pack Bag is the GOB\u2206G's killer feature. It's a welded bag made from TPU coated nylon with an integrated vacuum check valve to compress all your soft goods. Just throw your gear into the bag, seal it and compress it. You can compress the bag by either using a vacuum cleaner or compressing it by hand.\nPack. Vac. Go.\nThe Max Pack Bag is fully removable. Just unscrew the check valve, release the attachments inside the GOB\u2206G, and pop the cap on, then you're ready to go.\nWe've had enough of those disposable plastic bags you get at the airport. Our integrated wash bag means an end to wasting time at airport security \u2013 your liquids and pastes are ready to go from the off. Just rip off the wash bag from its velcro attachment and you're good to go.\nWe've also designed an adaptable laptop harness that holds your notebook securely away from the edges of the bag. It can take care of everything between 11-15 inches. One less thing to worry about.\nShhhh... we've added a hidden pocket to the bag. Who doesn't love a secret pocket?! It's also quite useful for your money, passport and other secret stuff. \nHere's what some of our early testers have been saying about the GOB\u2206G.\nIts about to get a little detailed here, so skip this bit if you trust that we've used the best.\n1000d Codura Nylon is the ultimate in abrasion protection. We have placed it over the maximum wear areas like the base.\nTPU Coated Ballistic Nylon the ultimate waterproof material. This is the stuff that inflatable power boats are made out of.\nCarbon Steel G Hooks Forget those flimsy plastic buckles that you get on some bags. All of ours are made out of Carbon Steel. \nMonkey Fist Zip Pulls Made from high tensile strength para cord. A knot that a salty sea dog would be proud of.\nYKK Zippers Everyone knows that all the best gear uses YKK zips not some rubbish imitation. Zips matter!\nDue to the initial costs and high minimum order quantities for the first production run, we need your support. Here\u2019s how you can support our campaign and be the first to own a GOB\u2206G.\nJames came up with the idea for the GOBAG two years ago. He was traveling a lot between London and Scotland for weekend trips on Easyjet flights and was frustrated that he couldn't take everything he needed as hand luggage. His budget but functional solution was to pack all his clothes in a bin bag, vacuum the air out and zip tie the end. He thought \"There's got to be an easier way to do this...\"\nThe GOBAG was born.\nA picture of James' trusty Singer Sewing Machine, bought for \u00a320 on Gumtree.\nOver the last two years we have put the GOB\u2206G through rigorous testing. Here are a few shots from our most recent wear trials.\nGOBAG Wear Trial; Loch Tulla, Scotland\nGOBAG Wear Trial; Rannoch Moor, Scotland\nGOBAG Wear Trial; Salisbury Plain, England\nWe have sourced and secured a great manufacturer in China whose other clients include some big outdoor brands.\nIf (*ahem...* when) we secure the funding for the first production run we plan on having a member of the GOBAG Team go to China to supervise the manufacturing and oversee the quality control, ensuring that you get a great quality product. \nWe've got it all planned out.\n    Backers: kickstarter@wearegobag.co.uk\nBusiness Enquiries: business@wearegobag.co.uk\nPress Enquiries: press@wearegobag.co.uk\nThanks for taking the time to check out the GOB\u2206G!

We've spent over two years refining the GOBAG design and taking advice from UK based experts to minimise these risks.\n\nIf we find opportunities for improvement we will address them immediately with updated and improved design solutions. We will let you know if any improvements and alterations are made. These improvements will then be verified in the final testing stage in July 2015 when the first product articles from the production line will be tested. Final tweaks will then be made before the full production run in August 2015. We are experienced in sourcing and manufacturing in Asia and are therefore well prepared to deal with any potential issues.\n\nWhen the volume production run commences we will be present in China supervising all aspects of the production and the quality assurance. We are completely committed to ensuring that the GOBAG lives up to our high expectations of functionality and craftsmanship.\n\nWe have kept our reward tiers as simple as possible to ensure fulfilment goes smoothly. We know this is where many Kickstarter projects have slipped up in the past and we do not underestimate this stage's challenges.

For four hundred years, wallet designers have strived to balance design, functionality, and sleekness. The invention of the credit card in the 1950s gave rise to the modern wallet with its multiple slots to carry cards. Until 1996, wallets remained unchanged until the development of the first evolutionary bi-fold wallet, which reduced the bulkiness of its predecessors by nearly half its size. Many wallets have numerous pockets that are great for storing necessary items, but can also allow people to accumulate a lot of junk very quickly.\nHere at Bronxton Designs, we eliminate clunkiness by creating wallets that are minimalistic, fashionable and, most importantly, functional\u2014and we do so in a range of styles. Our focus: design accessories that help you carry all daily essentials in true minimalist style. We develop two types of leather wallets: the \u201c1222 Rule\u201d wallets and the Stasher wallets. The 1222 Rule wallets carry the recommended essentials: one ID, two credit cards, two insurance cards (car and health), and two $20-dollar bills for emergencies. The Stasher wallets are for people who prefer or need to carry more than the essentials.\nWith all our wallets we never rush, taking time to carefully design each wallet with our vision in mind. Using only the best materials, our products are designed and handcrafted from beginning to end in Park City, Utah, under our control. We have been successfully funded three times on Kickstarter since we fired up in 2014. With the help of our backers, we were able to purchase all the tools required to produce our wallets. Having our own tools allows us to keep everything in house from design to fulfillment. To expand our brand with new product lines, we need more tools for the job. That\u2019s where backers like you come in. Your pledges make it possible for us to get the equipment we need to grow our company with new, innovative products and to create and keep jobs in the United States.\n A Brief Understanding of Your Leather\nWhen purchasing a wallet or any other leather article it is important to understand what you are paying for; many companies sell genuine leather for the price of full grain. We use the only leather good enough for our wallets: full grain leather. The leather we use comes from the best tannery in the world, Horween, which has supplied quality leather hides for over 110 years.\nFull grain leather comes from the top layer of the hide, which has ALL of the grain, therefore, FULL grain. The natural surface of full grain leather burnishes and beautifies with use. Full-grain leather refers to hides that have not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed to remove imperfections or natural marks on the surface of the hide. This means each wallet will be naturally unique. No two wallets are alike! The grain remains, giving the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out, it will develop a patina over time. That means your wallet will wear beautifully and it will actually look better as it ages! This might be the last wallet you will ever need since it will last for many, many years to come.\nTop grain leather, the second grade of leather, is a split from the top layer of blemished hide, then sanded and refinished. This is how manufacturers get rid of scars and scrapes and light cow brands. Top grain leather does not age nicely with use.\nGenuine leather, the third grade of leather, is produced from the layers of hide that remain after the top is split off for the better grades. The surface is usually refinished (spray painted) to resemble a higher grade.\nThe tannery\n\nOur Wallets: We have One for You \nWe create all our wallets with careful design and craftsmanship; there\u2019s one for you in our line-up. The 1222 Rule wallets include the Entry and the Prospect; the Stasher Wallets include the Briber, Tri-fold and Main Street.\nThe Entry\nEven when filled with cards and cash, this wallet is so comfortable, that you won\u2019t feel it in your front or back pocket. The Entry is perfect for going out at night, walking long distances, simplifying your life, and carrying the absolute bare minimum. Though The Entry is minimalistic and affordable, we kept the elegance and quality of well-designed wallet made with Horween leather.\nThe Entry\nAt $25 ($20 for early backers) The Entry is the most affordable, minimalistic, handcrafted, full grain leather wallet you\u2019ll find. While we managed to make it very inexpensive, we did not cut any corners. The main difference from other wallets in our line is that The Entry is not hand-stitched; it is laser-cut, engraved, and machine sewn. Thanks to the backers of the previous project, we were able to buy a sewing machine!\nSpecs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nTwo card pockets. Each pocket stores up to 3 cards, for a total of 6 cards per wallet.\nCash slot (in between card pockets) stores up to 6 bills folded in half.\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nDue to how minimalistic this wallet is, it is not offered with RFID protection.\nMachine sewn.\nOffered in Dark Brown and Black.\nMeasurements:\n 2.25\" High by 3.9\" Wide\nThe Main Street\nThe Main Street wallet is made with leather and high-quality elastic. The elastic expands as needed while the leather keeps the wallet classy and elegant. The Main Street wallet offers 4 pockets: 2 front pockets, 1 middle pocket, and 1 elastic pocket. The front pockets are designed to hold ids and credit cards; the middle pocket is perfect for business cards, but can also be used for any cards or cash. The high quality, low-profile elastic pocket expands so it can hold from 1 to 10 cards.\nThe Main Street\nSpecs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nThree card pockets. Each pocket stores up to 3 cards, plus some cash.\nElastic pocket holds 1 to 10 cards or anything else you can think of storing in there.\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nOptional RFID Protection (add $10 to your reward).\nHand-stitched.\nOffered in Black with Black or Red Stitching and Brown with Brown or Tan Stitching.\nMeasurements:\n2.75\" High by 3.9\" Wide\nThe Tri-fold\nThe Tri-fold is not your grandpa\u2019s wallet! While it has a traditional look, it is not old school! Similar to The Briber, the main advantage of The Tri-fold is that all your cards are fully protected inside the wallet.\nThe Tri-fold - Closed\nThe Tri-fold - Open\nTraditional EMPTY Bi-fold vs. Bronxton's LOADED Tri-fold (as seen on the intro).\n Specs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nTri-fold.\nFour pockets. Each pocket holds up to 3 cards, for a total of 12 cards per wallet.\nID Slot (stores up to 2 IDs).\nBronxton Signature Cash Strap (holds up to 12 bills folded in half).\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nOptional RFID Protection (add $18 to your reward).\nHand-stitched.\nOffered in Black with Black or Red Stitching and Brown with Brown or Tan Stitching.\nMeasurements:\nFolded - 3.9\" High by 3\" Wide\nUnfolded - 3.9\" High by 8.6\" Wide\nThe Prospect\nThe Prospect wallet was the first wallet we designed. We\u2019ve sold a few hundred of these and received great feedback! We now offer the Prospect with the new logo!\nThe Prospect\nSpecs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nTwo card pockets. Each pocket stores up to 3 cards, for a total of 6 cards per wallet.\nBronxton Signature Cash Strap (holds up to 12 bills folded in half).\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nOptional RFID Protection (add $10 to your reward).\nHands-stitched.\nOffered in Black with Black or Red Stitching and Brown with Brown or Tan Stitching. \nMeasurements:\n2.75\" High by 3.9\" Wide\nThe Briber\nThe Briber was funded in our previous Kickstarter project. We\u2019ve sold several hundred of the Briber and have not received a single complaint or suggestion to improve it. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The Briber is a minimalistic bi-fold wallet made in vintage Americana style. The Briber at full capacity is skinnier than any of the other EMPTY bi-folds out there.\nThe Briber\nThe Briber: Open and Closed\n Specs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nBi-fold.\nFour pockets. Each pocket holds up to 3 cards, for a total of 12 cards per wallet.\nID Slot (stores up to 2 IDs).\nBronxton Signature Cash Strap (holds up to 12 bills folded in half).\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nOptional RFID Protection (add $15 to your reward).\nHand-stitched.\nOffered in Black with Black or Red Stitching and Brown with Brown or Tan Stitching.\nMeasurements:\nFolded - 3.9\" High by 3\" Wide\nUnfolded - 3.9\" High by 5.7\" Wide\nThe Complete Family\nThe Complete Family\nColor Options\nLeather:\nCurrently we offer 2 choices of leather color:\n1. Black\n2. Dark Brown\nThread:\n1. Black\n2. Brown\n3. Tan\n4. Red\nThread options\nOptional Add-ons\nEngraving\nWe recommend that engraving be placed in the front/back right corner on the bottom of the wallet; however, during the survey process, you will be given the opportunity to add notes and can request a different placement for your engraving. The engraving size varies with the word or initials that you request; we will ensure that it is proportional with the size of the wallet.\nFont Choices:\nRFID Protection\nWhat is it? Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a system that transmits the identity (in the form of a unique serial number) of an object or person wirelessly, using radio waves.\nAlmost all of our wallets now come with optional RFID protection! Most banks and credit card companies have been moving away from swipe card technology and issuing RFID-enabled cards and many places in Europe even have them embedded in personal identification documents.\nThe RFID Problem.\nUnfortunately hackers and others use technologies that can pickpocket that information from you without ever touching your wallet! Sometimes from several yards away! To keep your information safe, our optional RFID protection is made with 2 layers of anti-RFID materials that ensure no access to the information stored in your credit cards and documents. And as you can see in the video it works every time!\n  PLAY\n\nPast and Current PR and Blog Coverage:\nBronxton Coasters \u2013 Unlocked!!!\nEveryone with a pledge of $70 or more (before shipping for international backers) will receive a free pair of Bronxton coasters! If your pledge is $140 or more, you will receive 2 pairs of coasters, and so on. \nFor those who pledge less than $70, we\u2019ve got your back too! You can either bump up your pledge amount to $70 or add $14 to your pledge\u2014whichever is less money for you. \nFor those who simply want to support the project and what we stand for, there is a new $14 pledge to get the coasters. They will serve you well for many years to come and give your furniture a little extra protection while drinking in style.\nThe coaster manufacturing process: it takes nearly 4 thousand laser passes to make each one of the coasters. They are then dyed with a natural aging solution, left to dry under UV light, and then given 2 coats of clear satin to seal the coasters from moisture. Just like our wallets, the coasters are made in-house. \nThe coasters will ship at the same time as your wallets, at no additional shipping cost. \nBronxton Woodies - Unlocked!!!\nBronxton Woodies\u2014We\u2019ve kept this one under wraps. It\u2019s something that we\u2018ve been working on for a long time. Like all our products, these sunglasses are handcrafted. We\u2019ve been stress testing them for some time now, making all the necessary adjustments to ensure that, unlike other cheap wood sunglasses, these will not break easily. \nThe Wolf Creek:\nMade with two-tone Wood. Weighs only 0.9 oz (26g).\nMeasurements:\nLens Width: 54 mm  \nBridge Width: 21 mm\nLens Vertical (Frame Height): 49 mm\nFrame Width: 140 mm  \nTemple Length: 144 mm\nThe Deer Creek:\nMade with Zebrawood. Weighs only 1oz (28g).\nMeasurements:\nLens Width: 54 mm\nBridge Width: 12 mm  \nLens Vertical (Frame Height): 49 mm\n Frame Width: 140 mm\nTemple Length: 140 mm\nAdditional Features \nUnisex.\nHandcrafted.\nDesigned with stainless steel spring hinges offering more comfort and flexibility. \nCome with grey polarized lenses that help reduce glare. Glare is caused when light from the sun is reflected off of water or a solid surface. By neutralizing glare, polarized lenses help you see objects more clearly, and also help reduce the harmful effects of UV light. Polarized lenses are especially beneficial if you practice water sports including boating, fishing, etc. \n400% UVA/UVB lens protection. \nAnti-scratch lens coat. \nMade with 3 custom wood layers for extra durability. 2 horizontal layers and 1 vertical layer in the middle. \nCarved from natural woods, so no two pairs are the same.\nHard paper case and microfiber cloth is included.\nCome with one-year warranty against manufacturing defects, something that other vendors do not offer.\nIf you are already pledging for a wallet and would like the sunglasses as well, all you need to do is increase your pledge by $60! Bronxton woodies will ship in September, separately from the wallets, at no additional shipping cost to you. You will be able to choose the style during the survey process at the end of the project.\nAnyone, who just wants the sunglasses, there is a special $75 reward for you!\nSocial media sharing contest\nFor all those who have shared our project already, we want to say thank you! We appreciate your support more than you can imagine, and we want to reward you! We are launching a contest that will award a $235 wallet kit to the person who has the most amount of shares and \u201clikes\u201d at the end of our project.\nThe rules are simple:\nTo participate, just share the link to our project (http://kck.st/1JOoDYM) on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, etc. Shares descriptions must contain the hashtags #Bronxton #Kickstarter \u201cLikes\u201d must be organic; they need to come from your own list of followers, friends or groups you might belong to. Submit a list of all of your shares between June 3 and June 5 to info@bronxton.com Winner will be announced on June 7th after all shares and likes are verified.\nThe Kit Includes:\n1 Entry Wallet\n1 Main Street\n1 Prospect\n1 Briber\n1 Trifold\nColors will be assorted between Black and Brown.\nWhat's next?\nWe\u2019re developing multiple product lines, but to ensure our products meet our quality standards, we are releasing products in the order they have been created and properly tested. We hope to release another line of leather products within a few months, but we will not announce these product launches until the new products have passed our rigorous testing.\n.\nFEEDBACK\nWe value feedback, both positive and negative. Positive feedback gives us assurance that our processes are in place and our creativity is producing products that are wanted. Negative feedback gives us the chance to remain humble and improve in areas where we need to. Check out what people are saying about us and the quality of our products.

Nah, just kidding: we are all terrified of buses and trucks and stay as far away from them as possible. \nThe only real risks are delays that may be caused if the tannery is out of our leather. It has not happened yet, but if it did, it would delay the project by almost four weeks.

Richard and Lauren you are HUGE HEROS to us!!!!\n        A little lantern with a HUGE impact.\nVideo by Fredric King of Fountainhead Transmedia, Fountainhead.com\nThe SolarPuff is the ideal product. It's a patent pending solar lantern that packs flat and easily pops open into a charming cube of light. Beautifully designed with Origami technology to appeal to everyone from the most discerning design conscious hipster to a hermit living in the hills.It's perfect for emergencies, camping, hiking, boating, around the pool, in the pool, as a night light, in your car... You get the picture, its uses are endless, and it makes for a fabulous house gift.  \nSimply Put\nDesigned with sustainable and high-performance fabric specifically engineered for durability, flexibility and water resistance, and structured for adaptability and recyclability.\nIt's light weight, just 2.5 ounces.\nIt floats and can withstand complete immersion under water.\nFor as many hours as you charge it in the sun, it will provide light for just as long. For example, 5 hours of charging in the sun will provide illumination to light up a 10 X 10 room for 5-8  hours. Charge it for 8 hours and it will light for 8-12 hours.\nIt has a shelf life of over three years.\nHow It Works\nSOLARPUFF how to Open and Close\nPLAY\n\nAdd-On: Option\nTo add on to your pledge go to the top right of the page and under the green button, \"You're a Backer\", click the blue button \"Manage\" \n-If you add $25 to your pledge you can donate 1 SolarPuff to Nepal. \n-If you add $50 to your pledge, you can donate 2 SolarPuffs to Nepal.\nWe will send a survey at the end of the campaign, asking you to clarify what you want for your pledge. Just make sure what you want adds up properly, corresponding to the rewards listed.\n  It's Different\nOur  lantern distinguishes itself from other solar lanterns because of its modern flatpack pop-open design. The purpose of the SolarPuff's design component is fostering our belief in good design for all, in both the first world and third world countries. \nThe SolarPuff looks stunning traversing poolside to camp side to Subsaharan huts. Our product is engineered to flatten and then pop open into a clean, beautiful, modern cube lamp which is a critical distinction for transforming poverty into dignity. \nThis little light flat packs to 0.25 inches and can fit in any back pocket. It boasts 100 lumens and can fully charge in the sun in 8 hours lasting for 8-12 hours of light. If you only get to charge it for 5 hours, it\u2019s ok, it will still last for 5-8 hours of light. \nThe circuit contains a photovoltaic solar panel, 10 bright white LEDS and a lithium-ion polymer battery. Although the circuit is made in China, the special fabric of the expandable bladder which is the light disfusing element, is made in Connecticut. \nIt is specifically engineered to withstand extreme outdoor environments. This product is revolutionizing the way we light our world. It is a formidable champion of beautiful, mobile, modern, and sustainable lighting, simply using the limitless renewable awesomeness of our sun.\nAWARDS + PRESS\nA Little History\nBackground\nThis light was first developed by Alice Min Soo Chun for emergency relief after the Haiti earthquake. In 2010, while teaching at Columbia University, Alice returned from Haiti and converted her architecture lab into an innovation center for disaster relief. Alice shared her years of research on integrating thin film substrates with photo voltaics and the idea of an inflatable solar light with the goal of creating sustainable solutions for disaster relief. The first prototype for the SolarPuff, along with all other inflatable solar lanterns currently on the market, were born in her lab.  Alice holds four patents for the inflatable solar lantern and solar light assembly.\nWhere we are Today \nIt took quite a few prototypes to find the right fabric, best components and the unparalleled design.  We wanted to make sure the fabric was non-toxic (PVC free) to the environment and full recyclable. We finally produced the perfect combination this past summer (2014). \nIn September 2014, we signed a licensing agreement with a distributor in Japan who received their first order for SolarPuffs in December 2014. All have sold and they are awaiting their next shipment.\nIn March 2015, we signed a distribution agreement with a Caribbean distributor and we are currently speaking with other distributors in India, Belgium, UK, Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Nairobi, Singapore and Hong Kong for starters.\nWho \"WANTS\" A SolarPuff?\nThis superior solar inflatable light is great for the home, gardens, pools, boating enthusiasts, camping, hiking, corporate premiums and military applications. It is also the most ideal lantern for emergency and disaster relief, due to its light weight and it's the most hygienic since there is no need to use your mouth to inflate.The light weight design makes for lower shipping costs and its foldability allows for dense packing of 80+ units per box. The high tech fabric creates a delightful dispersion of light. Every household on the earth would benefit from owning a SolarPuff. It's the perfect gift for everyone.\nWho \"NEEDS\" A SolarPuff?\nThe IFC (International Finance Corporation) estimates that globally, over 1.6 billion people \u2013 possibly as high as 3 billion \u2013 are living without access to reliable electricity. \n According to figures from the International Energy Agency, at least 20% of the planet's inhabitants are still without the simple luxury of a light switch.\nSo how do they light their homes and cook their food? They are using kerosene, wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and dung. Worldwide, over 500 million households use kerosene, for lighting.\nAccording to studies conducted by Dr. Evan Mills, founder of the Lumina Project, an initiative that promotes low-carbon alternatives to fuel-based lighting, \"kerosene (or as he refers to it, \"dirty lighting\") consumes 77 billion liters of fuel worldwide, costing its predominantly impoverished end-users a total of $36 billion annually.\"Kerosene costs 25 to 30 percent of a family\u2019s income \u2014 globally. The poor do not use kerosene because it is cheap \u2014 they are kept poor in significant part because they must rely on expensive, dirty kerosene. .\nWhat We Want to Do  \nWith your help, we can revolutionize how people are lighting their homes. We want people to be prepared with a SolarPuff in their home for when the next Hurricane Katrina or Sandy hits and we want to provide clean sustainable lighting to those that need it most. \nCalculated from research, if everyone in the United States used a SolarPuff for one hour a day instead of a regular light bulb, it would save over 11 BILLION tons of CO2 emissions from going into the air each year!! \nIn the United States 75% of the air pollution in urban areas is due to energy consumption from buildings. Solight Design wants to design and manufacture beautifully architected solar solutions that people will want in their homes and, at the same time, help eradicate pollution, poverty and excessive energy consumption!  \nWe don't want to stop there! We want to change the reliance on dirty fuels to light the homes of people living off the grid. Globally there are at least 1.6 billion people without reliable access to electricity. This lack of access to efficient energy becomes even more apparent in rural areas of developing countries where most lighting is fueled by kerosene, which is not only toxic but extremely expensive, creating a vicious cycle of poverty.\nThe HELIX vs PUFF:\nMany of our supporters have been asking how the Helix and Puff are different. Well the Helix is a Twist and a little more compact than the SolarPuff. It is made from recyclable TPU, a thermoplastic that has a unique memory for shape retention. you can see in the video here that a slight push will start the deflation process in motion and it will remember to flat pack back to a square. Also the light is more uniform than the SolarPuff since the SolarPuff has more a a spectrum of light. The SolarPuff has a ziplock pouch for packaging and the Helix has a paper packaging. The SolarPuff  light diffuser is made from a Sail Cloth Fabric that is made in the USA and the Helix light diffuser material (TPU)is made in China. Hope this helps!\nPLAY\n\nHelix\nHelix\nSolarPuff packs into a Polygon\nSolarPuff\nWho Are We?\nAlice Min Soo Chun and Stacy Kelly, Co-Founders\nAlice Min Soo Chun is a Co-Founder and CEO of Solight Design and the inventor of the Solar Inflatable Light: SolarPuff.

Whereas the SolarPuff, has a spectrum of light dispersion and is prism-like as the light transfers through the high tech fabric material. \nFolding technology - Both use origami principles yet the Helix is a twist fold and pack motion. The SolarPuff has a pinch and fold motion. \nCosts  - TPU is less expensive and allows us to produce a economical version of the SolarPuff.\nIn all other components and functions, they are the same. They both float as the solar circuit is completely protected in a vacuumed sealed bladder. They both recycle. They charge the same and have the same lumenosity. They have equal lighting and will last just as long. And, finally, both have three settings, low, high and flash.\nCheck out the video at the top of the page to see how we demo the SoalrPuff vs the Helix,\nPledge $5 or more \nThank you\nYou get a \"Thank You\" note and our immense gratitude!!

She is ingenious, generous and humble as a practitioner and as an educator. Unfortunately, in our culture, kindness and humility may be mistaken for weakness and preyed upon. I also know Andrea Sureshta and Anna Stork as they were students in a first year design studio that I taught at the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia, and, I sat on the review of the Haiti studio when they presented large scale umbrella lights before Alice shifted the scale of the studio projects to smaller realizable designs. I am very disappointed in the way success has been sought at the expense of others and at the vindictiveness of Anna's campaign against Alice Chun. Andrea and Anna fit the model of the start-up and the focus on youth and ingenuity in design fields and the culture at large. Alice has been reluctant to tell her story as a single mother, as inventor, as designer at multiple scales, as an educator... Unfortunately, in the United States, the general populace seems to believe the \"those who can't teach\" ethos. As someone with a successful practice sustained simultaneously while a dedicated educator, I write to refute this. Architecture design problems require craft and uniquely reflect their creators. A well-crafted problem or program contains inherent possible solutions. Without the well-crafted problem and the nurturing of the instructor the design project as such would not be conceived. For a student to claim sole authorship of a design work in the contemporary design studio is not accurate in most cases. Further, instructors run the risk of having their ideas co-opted without credit should they share their work too freely. The situation in design studios is more complex and cooperative than is admitted. I am so happy to see Alice clarified the facts regarding her relationship as a patent holder of LuminAid and posted the patents. As a self-inflating structure, \"SolarPuff & SolarHelix are a unique little lights\" that were designed with a mission to help those in need and they are also beautiful well made objects.

I went off and read some of the entries on Google under \"kickstarter failures\" - 9% of projects fail to deliver anything at all (according to Kickstarter themselves!). So the lesson to take away is this - never invest money in a project that you're not prepared to loose. It's a gamble. Although to better the odds, never invest in any team that doesn't have a background in production or evidence of previous successful projects.

Expecting German quality, I was disappointed with the result, they do not seem worth the price paid. There is leftover flash on the plastic pieces, these remnants from the plastic mould are usually removed on higher quality products. One friend had a small electrical shock when plugging in, which was worrying. Maybe static but odd to happen, and certainly had never happened with another cable. The cables do not fit into many cases. Finally - and rather damningly - these cables do not charge iPhones any faster than a normal and much cheaper option. Significantly misleading people on the key benefit. So in all, not a great buy for the backers, especially considering the timescales involved.

We hope you share our passion for this fun way of communicating! It doesn\u2019t matter which reward you choose - we will put these stickers inside your package no matter what, as long as we reach $250.000 CAD goal. There are only several days left, so hurry up to spread the word to reach it quickly!\nStatically Charged\nMeet the Magnetic family: Magnetic Notes, Magnetic Pads, Magnetic Boards, and Magnetic Sheets. All Magnetic products are based on stable static charge, which lets them stick to any dry surface. Magnetic has no glue, so it's completely movable and replaceable. Enjoy visualizing your ideas, brainstorming in teams, and leaving messages. Now THAT'S a convenient and fun way to communicate!\nAny Surface\nMagnetic can stick to any dry surface, including wood, plastic, metal, leather, glass, textile, paper, and more. No glue means no traces. Magnetic is fully charged. It can even stick to the ceiling! \nIdeal Handwriting\nMagnetic in not actually paper. It's better than paper. We created it with the idea of getting enjoyment out of writing on it. With Magnetic\u2019s unique smooth surface, you will be amazed that your handwriting is more beautiful than ever, regardless of whether you use a pen, a pencil, or a marker.\nReusable Back\nMagnetic can save you lots of money that you would otherwise spend on sticky notes. Not only can you stick Magnetic notes from either side, you can also write on the back with a marker, erase it, and write all over again! It's like always having an erasable surface with you.\nThe Magnetic Family\nMagnetic Notes that come in 3 sizes in 9 different colors, including transparent and black for white markers\nMagnetic Pads that are larger options for painting, classifieds, and many other office and home uses\nMagnetic Boards that you can stick and write on with markers, erase, and write again.\nColor Range\nMagnetic Notes and Magnetic Pads come in 9 colors. We will ask you about your color preferences as soon as Magnetic is successfully funded.\nMagnetic Standards\nWe\u2019ve conducted hundreds of experiments to come up with the best product possible. We set strict quality standards and refuse to compromise on them. We love the environment, so we made all Magnetic products fully recyclable.\nWhat Next?\nNow we have peerless technology and perfected product. We want everyone in the world to be able to enjoy convenience of Magnetic. To do this, we need to set up cost-effective mass production, which will guarantee good prices and the best quality. But we can only do that with your support! We need about $30,000 CAD. We commit to pledge half of that by ourselves. For the other half, we invite you to participate in this awesome challenge. We'll be thrilled to have an army of backers behind us to help us write Magnetic's story.\nLet's Make the World a Better Place\nWe want children in the poorest African schools to enjoy the comfort and convenience of whiteboards that they don\u2019t currently have. So for every $1,000 we raise, we will be able to equip one school with 10 Magnetic reusable boards, 3 maps, erasers, and markers. This campaign will last throughout 2015, and we will post reports on it all over social media with the hashtag #AfricanEducation, as well as through updates to our backers.\n                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working really hard for several years to ready Magnetic for its broad public appearance. We have gone through all the stages of the production process, and we know exactly what issues are hidden under each step. Our senior engineer has more than 30 years of experience in the paper industry. We already have substantial experience manufacturing Magnetic on our small production line. All we need now is to scale it to mass production. However, as with any product, there are risks and challenges related to delays. Supply chain logistics can potentially impact product delivery. Additionally, delays may result from testing procedures. We will do our best to choose the best shipping option possible, but we cannot guarantee their fulfillment on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "New Products!", "update_content": "Hi backers and friends,  "}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Anuchart Matanasarawoot", "content": "I did\u2019t get any items yet, please please please check......", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Melissa Bianco", "content": "I love these!

It is an amazingly efficient way to do laundry.  It is clinically demonstrated to be as effective as detergent and lasts up to 1000 washes!  Our goal now is Crystal Wash 2.0, the \u201cconnected\u201d version, which will make it even easier to use than it is already and give you a set of tools & features that will help you do your laundry better.\nThese days everyone and everything is looking to \u201cget connected\u201d to make things easier, provide greater vision and insight into the task at hand.  We know that doing laundry is not exactly exciting, but lets face it\u2026 everyone has to do it!  Crystal Wash is something that works and the truth is we really can make doing laundry easier for you, save you money and be better for the environment.  We will give you a brief explanation of how the current version of Crystal Wash works and then we will get into the details of what we want to accomplish with our Patent Pending Crystal Wash 2.0\u2026\nBackground on Crystal Wash\nCrystal Wash is a proven technology that literately lasts for at least 1000 loads of laundry.  It uses the power of Bio Ceramics from the earth, which naturally clean your clothes as effectively as laundry detergent.  It is better for your skin and more gentle on your fabrics.  It is also better for the environment because it reduces contaminated waste water filtered back into the water supply, saves water by lowering required rinse cycles, and effectively reduces CO2 production by requiring less energy than a traditional detergent based wash.\nThese special Bio Ceramics were developed using various minerals with very effective antibacterial and anti-oxidant properties.\nThe pH level of laundry water impacts the wash greatly. If the water is overly acidic or alkaline it can damage delicate clothes and fabrics, cause colors to fade and cause clothing to still seem dirty even after washing.  Most detergents on the market are a pH level of 6.5 \u2013 9, but they use chemicals to achieve these levels.\nThe key to Crystal Wash is the Bio Ceramics:\nAs the Bio Ceramics collect odors, dirt and waste from your laundry, they need to be \u2018recharged\u2019 in order to make sure the pH levels of the laundry water continue to be raised.   To recharge Crystal Wash you simply put them in the sun for an afternoon.  You only need to do this approximately every 30 days (or 30 laundry loads).  There is nothing else you need to do\u2026 Just a little sun and they will be just as effective as their first wash.   Lets face it, this process is simple but easily forgotten and if not done the effectiveness of Crystal Wash is decreased.  It would be nice, if there was a way to be reminded that it was time to recharge them.\nBy embedding a state-of-the-art pH water sensing chip and a micro-controller with Bluetooth capability inside the current Crystal Wash, we can give users accurate recharge alerts so that they don\u2019t have to remember when it is time to put them in the sun.   And while we are at it \u2013 why not give users several other tools and features right on their smartphone that will help make doing laundry easier & more effective\u2026\nWith the Patent Pending Crystal Wash 2.0 we will be able to illustrate the effectiveness of this great device and show the user the real time pH level of their wash.  We\u2019ll be able to give the user recharge alerts, wash cycle tracking stats, wash complete alerts and many additional metrics and tools to help each Crystal Wash user become a \u201cLaundryNista.\u201d\n  The Crystal Wash App Features:\nReal-time Wash pH Levels\nRecharge Alerts\nWash Complete Alerts\nWash Cycle Tracking Stats \u2013 Graphs, Counters, Social Sharing\nSavings Tracking\nCrystal Wash \u2013 Wash Cycle Counter \u2013 Time to order new Crystal Wash\nStain guide\nLabel decoder\n\n  Our development process has gone through a few prototyping phases.  Our biggest issues were figuring out how to engineer a miniaturized version that would allow us to fit all the necessary components inside the current Crystal Wash form factor.  And how to create a module to best withstand the harsh environmental factors present inside a laundry machine... like water, shock, and temperature exposure.\nUsing some of the most current prototyping tools available we have made good progress after a few versions, but we still had some major obstacles to overcome.  Below are some pictures of the prototyping and miniaturization progress we have made.\nPrototype v1 Addressed:\npH Reading & Calibration Control From Simple Mobile App\nElectrode Sensitivity Testing & Protection\nEnclosure Testing\nCurrently in the testing phase, our miniaturized prototype v2 is sending back pH data to a mobile device via Bluetooth and showing us first-hand the impact Crystal Wash has on laundry. We've developed an enclosure that is impact resistant. And have begun focusing on the temperature resistance aspect of the enclosure.  Addressing the rigors of a normal load of laundry gets us closer to a final module design then we ever were before. \nPrototype v2 Addressed:\nElectrode Miniaturization\nPrototyping Board Miniaturization & Simplification\nWash Basin Bluetooth Connectivity Testing\nWaterproofing\nShock Resistance\nThe v2 submerge tests show successful waterproofing and connectivity and we now look forward to moving on to our final module development.\nWe reached a milestone in our R&D process when we realized we could potentially do away with the traditional electrode.  Building on the idea of \u201clab on a chip\u201d and \u201cmicro-fluidics\u201d we began to see the possibility of engineering our own solid-state sensor, which would allow us to miniaturize the electrode and effectively eliminate the need for calibration.  Our team went to work researching the feasibility of this and found some really great resources for how to use these cutting edge techniques to bring our idea to reality.\nBy engineering our own sensing chip we will be able to minimize calibration requirements, reduce power consumption, and come up with our own compact logic board all designed to fit within the Crystal Wash form factor.\nThe response at CES was huge... with interest from the press, to retailers, to investors, and distributors...\nOur Next Steps: \n We\u2019ve come a long way.  We have a miniaturized prototype and are starting to get back real usable laundry data.  Now we need to refine the pH sensor design, work out our power consumption goals, build out the final mobile app.  We already have our manufacturing Vendor for the final product, but we still need to source our final vendors for the connected components.\nWe\u2019re close but need your help to bring this exciting, innovative device to fruition.  Help us get there Kickstarter, lets all help the environment, save money and become LaundryNistas!\nLaun\u00b7dry\u00b7ni\u00b7sta  /,l\u00f4ndr\u0113ni-\u0161ta/ noun one who has mastered the art of laundry and has obtained a sense of \u201claundry enlightenment.\u201d \nThe Crystal Wash Team:\nThe Crystal Wash team has combined a unique selection of expertise. Pooling resources from engineering, marketing, software development, art, and design backgrounds the Crystal Wash team has the technical, design, and entrepreneurial savvy that has already brought the current version to the market.  We are capable and ready to bring this exciting and innovative Version 2.0 to market.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any new innovative project there are inherit risks and challenges...\n\nWith Crystal Wash 2.0 the biggest challenge was how do we engineer the components to be small, efficient and robust. Traditional pH electrodes are large, expensive, fragile, and require constant recalibration. We needed to address all the above mentioned electrode issues and make a cost effective module small enough to fit into a 105mm x 19mm form factor.\n\nSupply and Logistics\n\nLuckily we have already developed many of the necessary supply and logistic relationships required to bring the original Crystal Wash to market. For Crystal Wash 2.0 our biggest hurdle is making sure all the new \"connected\" components are sourced from the best and most reliable vendors. We only want consistent and on time delivery allowing us to reach our production goals and distribute rewards to our loyal backers.\n\nWe have established relationships with experienced manufacturers and fulfillment vendors and are confident we will be able to reach our goals. \n\nThrough multiple prototypes we have come to a clear path of how to bring our vision to reality. We definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are very close.

If the correct exercises are performed well and frequently, the back problems become far easier to treat and far easier to prevent.\nWith this in mind, my colleagues and I set out to develop a simple prop to enhance the exercises we prescribe in our clinic here in the UK.\nAfter many hours brainstorming we agreed on the need for a prop/support that would actively align, mobilize and decompress the joints of the lower back in a safe controlled form.\nCountless props were designed, built and assembled in a variety of materials before being tested within the clinic by our understanding patients.\nDuring the past 2 years, the original design has been continually altered by patient feedback and our clinical evaluation.\nTo date, our in house research & development has produced a highly effective back pain device that we intend to develop further by developing new sections for Bacrac users to add to the base model and so personalize and enhance the experience.\nBacrac components/assembly\n The modular design and simple assembly means that sections can be removed for smaller framed users, it takes a few seconds to undo the retainer and slide out the extra section.\nPLAY\n\nBacrac use/protocol\nUsing Bacrac is easy. However to get the best from this remarkable device we suggest you use it as often as you can. If work, family, studies prevent you getting 5 minutes during a busy day, then use it after work when your back can really benefit.\nPLAY\n\n1. Simply place on the floor (preferably on a carpet or rug). \n2. Lay down next to bac rac. (You may find a small head cushion more comfortable). \n3. Draw both knees up, raise your pelvis and slide bac rac under your back with one hand. \n4. Lower onto the support and ease into position. (This may need minor re positioning up or down). \n5. After a few seconds of adjustment, slowly rock your knees from side to side. This movement only needs to be in the 10-2 range. Continue for 5 minutes then relax in position. \n6. Finish by rolling off either left or right. Move onto your hands and knees before bringing one leg through to stand upright.\nN.B. Our Bacrac timeline has been edited to account for an unfortunate delay now resolved. \nN.B. Our Bacrac target has recently been revised from \u00a325,000 to \u00a315,000 to account for reduced tooling costs. \nKicking it Forward\nWe'll commit 5% of profits towards getting future Kickstarter projects funded!

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS !!!\n------------------------------------------\nThe Perfect Sketchbook\n(60 pages of Artist Grade 100% Cotton, watercolor paper) \nby Erwin lian & Bynd Artisan\n\nThe Story\nOver the past 14 months or so, I have been traveling around the world and sketching... France, Germany, Spain, Italy, across Asia and the list continues to grow. The term \"sketch-hunter\", coined by Robert Henri, describes me best. I sketch almost daily, noting down everything from interesting people to the places I have visited. Whether it is in a moving subway cabin, a car, a bus or on a Tut-Tut, I sketch.\nhttp://cherngzhi.tumblr.com/\nme, my sketchbook and world travels\n\nMy passion has led me to try out numerous sketchbooks and I have tried using everything available in the market. With the need to perfect my watercolor sketches, I began to search for that perfect sketchbook. One that should be hardbound, compact, binds well, opens flat, and filled with  Artist Grade 100% cotton paper (makes it strong but pliable). Unfortunately, I couldn't find such a sketchbook out there... so, I decided to make one.\nI went on and searched for quality sketchbooks manufacturers and discovered Bynd Artisan\u00ae; a premium leather and paper label in Singapore. The people behind this brand have been in the book-making business for more than 70 years, and were very receptive of my ideas on a sketchbook. They agreed to collaborate on this project, and their sincerity & earnestness to create the Perfect Sketchbook moved me beyond words.\n\nThe Perfect Sketchbook is a top-of-the-line sketchbook made with quality materials sourced from around the world.\n\nStay updated with our Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theperfectsketchbook\n_____________________________________________________________\n      PLAY\n\nphotography by Erwin Lian\nThe ability to assess + establish correct values are two of the most important skills required in painting. Chroma inherits values and this is why many painters will first complete an under-painting (with only values) before applying chroma. Having a value chart with you, allows for you to place it against the subject to properly assess values.\nMost artists hold their sketchbook in a certain way to keep it flat. The value chart was designed for ease of use for both left- and right-handed Artists. So if you are a left holder, you may flip to the left for the value chart and if you are a right holder, you may flip to the right for it. While this could be more user-friendly with a portrait- format book. The decision for a landscape-format was strictly based off reliable data which informs us that users who use a book of this size would prefer the landscape-format. Of course, given a chance in the future, I will release a series of different sizes and formats\nLocating the right value with a value chart\nYou may be able to upgrade the existing value chart by punching holes on each step. As seen in the image above, I managed to pick the right value for the grass by hovering my value chart over it. Squinting your eyes helps a little with the assessment process. However, this would entail that your sketchbook be less aesthetically pleasing, and this is why The Perfect Sketchbook that you will receive will not come with these punched holes.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nGRAIN DIRECTION IN PAPER.\nThe Perfect Sketchbook requires up to 3 full sheets of watercolor paper. Why so many for such a small book? Well, that\u2019s due to proper grain direction.  \nWhy paper grain is important?\nIf the grain is wrong, many undesirable things will happen:\n1) The book will not open very well. \n2) The paper will crease and buckle (due to paper expansion) 3) Stress is put on the stitching and could even break it; \nAn illustration to the utilization of paper with proper grain direction:\nAs there would be more paper wastage when we consider grain direction, I am working on possibly re-cutting the waste to create paper swatches that can be inserted into The Perfect Sketchbook's inner pocket. The Artist can make use of these inserts to test their colors prior to actual application. This suggestion has yet been finalized, and I will keep everyone updated.\nMany sketchbook-makers may not consider the grain direction in order to reduce cost of production. However, this will result in poor quality.\n                                                          Please note that Singapore-based backers will also enjoy the free shipping offered to America-based backers. Simply back the reward at the amount without international shipping charges. Free shipment is ONLY for Singapore and U.S. based backers. Thank You\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLAY\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Team\nErwin Lian | Artist / Educator/ Designer\nMe, sketching in the kingdom of Bhutan\nMy name is Erwin and I am an Artist from Singapore. I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Time-Based Media Studies from the Columbus College of Art (2004) and completed my Master of Arts in Design Development from The Ohio State University (2009).  I lecture at the Film Media Studies department in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore.\n\nI travel extensively with my sketchbooks, recording the visages of the people who I meet, places I have been to and cultures that I have personally experienced. Through my craft, I hope to inspire and share the peace and joy I feel whenever I create and paint.\nI painted all the paintings,shot all the photographs and did part of the computer animation featured in this kick starter project. The entire project was completed by me and two students, Jason Yong and Jacon Lim from DVFX, Ngee Ann Polytechnic\n\n(www.cherngzhi.com)\nBYND ARTISTAN | Partner & Manufacturer\nThe Goy Liang Book-Making Company had its first true home in 1945 when it was set up in a little shop house along Mohamed Sultan Road. It was a family-run business that served a genuine need and it gradually grew beyond the boundaries of Singapore and Malaysia.\nThrough the intervening years, the business of book-binding has moved inexorably with the progress of technology. Yet at its heart, each and every book had its beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade.\nBynd Artisan was conceptualized to celebrate the joy of traditional paper and leather making.  Bynd Artisan hopes to write its own history through the remarkable output of Singapore\u2019s greatest practicing craftsmen.\n\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities both in Singapore & Malaysia.\n(http://www.byndartisan.com)\nGrandluxe is the parent company of the Label Bynd Artisan\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated Time Schedule\nThe thicker the arrow = more funds goes there\n\nThis really is a project derived through an impulse based on personal need. Due to the requirement of new materials that was unavailable at the manufacturer, the cost of materials would be very high if I only made enough for personal consumption, so I decided to open up the availability of this pet project so that supporters may enjoy the same high quality that I personally demand while driving costs down for all of us. Kindly note that funds are subjected to 5% commission from Kickstarter and 5% from Amazon for credit card transaction fees. I have made most of the graphics and shot the photographs myself. The computer animation was completed with help from two students of mine (Jason & Jacob) and a stipend was paid to them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: \n1)Since this book is constructed with quality materials from all over the world, shipment may run into delays.

We'll ask which you want when we send out our survey at the end of the project.\n45\u00ba Plug: In our pictures you'll notice a 90\u00ba power plug. We've upgraded the plug to a 45\u00ba so you can plug in two MOS Reach into adjacent power outlets.\n The MOS brand is all about creating elegant solutions to everyday problems. You\u2019ve probably seen us here on Kickstarter\u2014we brought you MOS, the Magnetic Organization System keeping cables within easy reach since 2012. We also brought you the pint-sized MOS Menos and the indomitable MOS Spring cable to help you reduce cable clutter and tidy up your life.\nWe\u2019re excited to bring you the next labor of love in the MOS family...\nWhat is Reach?\nBasically, I live in a small room and I don\u2019t have a single power outlet that isn\u2019t hidden behind furniture. I have a lot of devices that require charging including my laptop, phone, Bluetooth speaker, power bank, and camera batteries. In the case of my laptop charger and camera batteries (things I need to take with me every day) I have to crawl under my desk or slide behind my nightstand to retrieve them.\nMy daily routine of plugging and unplugging helped me realize that the traditional wall outlet model was due for a redesign. While there are plenty of USB wall adapters on the market, none of them address the problem of power outlets being obstructed by furniture. First and foremost the power simply needed to be relocated to allow for easier access.\nThis allowed for power to reach ABOVE nightstands and desks and entertainment centers, the things that were causing me so much trouble, but the redesign didn\u2019t stop there. I wanted to create a flexible power solution with multiple mounting options that could twist and bend and contort around any kind of furniture or obstruction and mount horizontally and vertically to get power EVERYWHERE.\nOf course this would all be pointless if we didn\u2019t give Reach the capacity to charge and power every kind of modern device: two USB ports with enough capacity to charge an iPad, as well as a three-prong power outlet for laptop and other tablet chargers.\nI wanted to create a power solution with tastefully understated aesthetics so Reach could blend into its surroundings: an inconspicuous rectangle in both black and white to elegantly fit into any decor.\nFinally, it wouldn\u2019t be a true MOS product without magnets. By adding two super-powered neodymium magnets into the sides of the MOS Reach we could achieve the same organizational benefits of the MOS which keeps cables tidy, accessible, up off the ground, and ready for use.\n Each Reach comes with a pair of MOS cable ties so you can keep all your cables tidy, including the ones that are light on metal.\nWith this set of features in mind, we worked diligently to produce the product we had envisioned. There were bumps in the road that required a lot of attention. We had to do a lot of wrestling with our design in order to fit two 3.1 amp USB outlets, a three-prong 110 volt outlet, and magnets large and powerful enough to do the job. Persistence paid off in the end though, and our Reach prototype is as svelte as we could have hoped for while retaining all the functionality we initially imagined.\nThe cable also posed a challenge because we knew that we needed something much more flexible and attractive than the typical PVC commonly used. We vetted cable samples until we found a soft-touch TPE jacket that met our criteria. It definitely feels nicer than the more common options, but it also has some safety benefits which will help us secure UL certification for the Reach. This process is expensive, but it\u2019s a corner we\u2019re not willing to cut.\nBecause we like to obsess over materials, we went through a similar selection process to pick the ABS/Polycarbonate combination for the head\u2014it\u2019s a polymer most commonly used in the automobile industry, but we think it\u2019s perfect for the Reach.\nNOTE: The new design will now feature a 45\u00ba power plug instead of the 90\u00ba plug featured here, so you can easily plug in 2 MOS Reach into adjacent outlets.\nOnce we had the materials all locked down, we terminated the cable with a compact 90-degree plug (now a 45\u00ba power plug!) which gives the Reach a lot of leeway even in tight quarters. A lot of these choices were difficult to make, but it was worth the trouble to see our initial vision come to life.\nFeatures:\nReach gives you easy access to power outlets that are otherwise obstructed by furniture\u2014no more crawling under desks or shimmying behind dressers to charge your devices.\nReach has been designed to be as unobtrusive as possible and its compact size ensures that it\u2019s never in the way whether you use it on your desk, your nightstand, or your wall.\nReach consolidates your power outlets and USB wall adapters into an attractive moveable all-in-one power solution.\nReach helps you cut down on cable clutter by making clever use of Neodymium magnets in conjunction with MOS cable ties to keep out-of-use cables out of the way until you need them.\nReach works well even in tight quarters thanks to its slim 45 degree angle power plug.\nReach is composed of premium materials so it looks and feels great.\nReach gives you a choice of two mounting options: AirStick microsuction tape lets you give your MOS Reach a semi-permanent home on any flat surface. Foam adhesive tape works great if you want to give your Reach a more permanent station horizontally or vertically. The Airstick\u2122 microsuction tape can be cleaned with a damp cloth if it ever loses sticking power to bring it back to full strength.\nApplications:\nOffice Desk\nHome Desk\nNightstand for overnight device charging.\nBedpost/frame for convenient phone/tablet/laptop use.\nCouch foot/frame or coffee table for convenient phone/tablet/laptop use or for game controller charging while playing.\nWorkbench/hackerspace for convenient power tool switching.\nCraft/sewing bench\nEntertainment center (Xbox One/PS4 controller charging station)\nReach is great for travel since it can convert any single outlet at your hotel or airport into a mobile charging station. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\nSpecs:\nUSB 5V 3.1A total charging power (2 ports)\n1x 80-250V/15A power port\n175 Joule Surge protection\nStandard NEMA-5 compatible plug and receptacle for North American outlets\nHead composed of a premium ABS/Polycarbonate compound\n3-foot power cable with soft-touch TPE sheath\nComes in either White or Black\nDon't Worry! We've got you covered. Included in the cost of international shipping we are including 2 region-specific power converters with each Reach. We'll get pictures of the power converters as soon as possible. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of the Reach.\nWrap Up\nThanks for taking the time to read through our pitch. We\u2019re confident that with your help we can add Reach to our growing line-up of clever solutions to everyday problems. As a quick recap, MOS Reach lets you tastefully relocate your power outlets to places that actually make sense: whether you affix Reach to your work desk, your nightstand, or your craft bench, you\u2019ll always have easy access to a 3-prong outlet, to USB ports, and to the organizational benefit of powerful magnets. MOS Reach has helped us tidy up our work and living spaces\u2014please back us so Reach can do the same for you. Please check out our reward tiers below. We\u2019re sure you\u2019ll enjoy using your Reach as much as we enjoyed creating it.\n$100,000 \u2013 45\u00ba Angle Plug & Longer Cable \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nThe addition of a 45\u00ba plug allows the Reach to be used in more places. For example, with the cable exiting the plug at a 45\u00ba angle, you can use two MOS Reach in one power outlet at the same time.\nThe longer cable will be an as-yet-to-be-determined length between 4-6 feet. We received a lot of good feedback from our backers that the 3 foot cable in the original design was too short for some applications. We'll let you know as soon as we decide the length of the cable. You can voice your opinion in our survey.\nMOS Spring cables are the perfect accessory to the MOS Reach. At 3 feet long they make it easy to manage a charging station on your nighstand or desk when used with the MOS Reach. The MOS Spring cables feature anodized aluminum heads, metal spring strain relief to prevent shorts, and our Exoskeleton\u2122 hyper-durable cable jacket.\nAll MOS Spring cables are covered by our lifetime warranty. If your MOS Spring cable fails for any reason just send it back and we'll give you a new one, no questions asked.\n Find out more about our popular MOS Spring Cables.\n1.

During these commutes I'm regularly faced with the challenge of carrying stuff while biking. Everything from phones to packages and bike locks there are many challenges to carrying and accessing stuff while biking.\nIn this project I wanted to design simple solutions for some of these everyday bike commute problems. Over the last year, I\u2019ve come up with over 50 designs and 30 functional prototypes. Sketch after sketch, proto after proto, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to 3 simple designs I call TYNY Tools Collection 1.\nKEY CLIPS\nOriginally designed to quickly locate and access my bike lock keys, Key Clips can be used to attach anything onto your bike or backpack. You can use it indoors for electronic cord management or bundling stuff together. Made with super strong industrial silicone and a unique swivel carabiner design you can use one or multiple units to strap down many many things. Comes in 3 great colors and 2 different sizes.\nPerfect Keychains\nBike Rack Straps\nBackpack Attachment Straps\nYoga Mat Straps\nAvailable in 2 sizes / 3 colors\nSmall Length 7 in\nMedium Length 11 in\nSWIVEL CLIPS\nI took the unique swivel carabiner design from the Key Clips and joined it together with a twin. Two carabiners merged into one simple design that swivels, expands the functionality over the traditional carabiner. Hang, store, clip and organize anything you want. Comes in 3 great colors and 3 different sizes.\nKeys\nClip Water Bottles to Backpacks\nHang Lanterns\nAvailable in 3 sizes / 3 colors\nSmall 1/2\" x 1 1/2\" \nMedium 1\" x 2 3/4\"\nLarge 1 1/2\" x 3 1/2\" \nLOCK BANDS\nMade with the same industrial silicon material as the Key Clips, the Lock Bands come with a small locking clip perfect for wrapping your bike pump around your bike tube, attaching your smart phone onto handle bars or wrapping any electrical chords together. You can join multiple rings together for the right size you need. Comes in 3 great colors.\nManaging Electrical Chords \nAttach Phones to Bike Handle Bars\nAttach Frame Pumps to Bikes\nAvailable in 3 colors\nDiameter 2 3/4\"\nWHAT WE NEED\nNow that we've completed the design process, we have to navigate the expensive process of manufacturing and producing this product. While we're close to entering production, your contributions will help fund the final tooling molds and material costs. Combined, these expenses make it difficult for a small company like Tyny Tools to design and produce an innovative product. With your help we can meet our goal of $15,000 and be well on our way to bringing these amazing products to market for you!\nREWARDS\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nInternational backers will be responsible for applicable tariffs and customs fees.\nPRODUCTION SCHEDULE\nWe\u2019ll ship in Summer 2014. Here's our schedule for delivery:\nEarly July: Place first order.\nMid July: First production run.\nMid August: Receive and ship first batch.\nTHANK YOU\nA shout out to everyone who has supported and made TYNY TOOLS what it is today!

Throughout that time I've worked closely and have built a great relationship with my manufacturing partner for this project which has a long-standing reputation for producing premium quality products in the outdoor industry.\n\nGiven the high cost of materials, manufacturing, and minimum order quantities from the factory, the biggest challenge I face in bringing TYNY Tools to market is funding. The manufacturing timeline is set and tooling can begin immediately pending a successful campaign.

We have spent 5 years tinkering, problem solving and innovating to reach the stage we are at now\u2026.and we are proud of the results from our labour. Through an innovative and unique fold-a-bowl design, the RMDLO Colander is capable of folding closed to a fraction of its in use size, making it a modern kitchen utensil ideally suited for anyone with space saving in mind.\nThe Fold-A-Bowl Tech\nObsessed with origami and geometry, we were convinced the humble colander could be folded up. So we came up with RMDLO\u2019s Fold-A-Bowl technology (patent pending). This design concept allows several stainless steel sheets to be effortlessly collapsed in on top of one another at the flick of a wrist.\nStorage Made Easy\nThanks to the Fold-A-Bowl technology, the RMDLO Colander is very easy to store, especially when compared with its more traditional cousin. Closed, the colander is just 1.6cm thick and can be easily slid into a cutlery drawer, back-pack or alternatively, hung (using one of its O handles) from a nail or peg on the wall. What better way to enjoy the RMDLO Colander\u2019s contemporary design then by prominently displaying it on your Kitchen wall for all to admire! \nFlexibility for the Chef\nAnother problem that RMDLO set out to solve was the complete inflexibility that plagues the rigid design of the more traditional colander. Imagine the scene...your pasta has been properly strained and then you try to guide it onto your plate and...it slides out in one big mass, spilling everywhere! So frustrating! Thanks to the RMDLO Colander\u2019s flexible design, it is possible to squeeze it together with your fingers, forming a basket shape which will allow you to simply guide the food onto your plate.....with no messy margins for error!\nSimply squeeze together in order to pour into small containers.\nSafe and Easy to Clean\nWe take the safety of all our designs very seriously. The RMDLO Colander is made from non-toxic kitchen grade materials. The stainless steel is specially heat treated before being rolled to remove any impurities. The O rings are made from BPA free non pollutant plastics. The colander is easy to clean either by hand or thanks to its corrosion free properties and compact size, it is also dishwasher ready.\nAre Looks Important? Absolutely!\nAt RMDLO we believe so. The RMDLO Colander encapsulates everything that we hold dear in our brand \u2013 quality, design and especially, space saving. Precision cut stainless steel sheets infused with beautifully crafted plastic rings, allow the RMDLO Colander to put the \u201cCool\u201d back into colander. Taking pride of place on your kitchen counter or mounted to the wall, it will never look out of place in any kitchen.\nFor whom?\nThanks to its space saving credentials, the RMDLO Colander is ideally suited towards people with limited space in their kitchen. Whether in a caravan, shared or perhaps just smaller kitchen, the RMDLO Colander will effortlessly slide into a drawer or conveniently hang on the wall using up as little precious space as possible. Alternatively, its versatile and portable design, allows it to be taken out and about with you for picnics, festivals or any other outdoor pursuits. Easy to clean and safe to operate, the RMDLO Colander can be used by people of all ages.\nPledges Explained\nPost Kickstarter Plan?\n55% - Design refinement, tools & moulds\n45% - Manufacturing, packaging & delivery\n0%   - Filling the office fridge (or an office...)\nThe first thing we want to make clear is that no funds will be wasted on salaries, marketing campaigns, filling an office fridge - even an office for that matter! Or any other irrelevant and expensive activity that does not directly benefit backers or improve the product. The key areas where the funds will be spent are as follows \u2013\n\n- Engineering Development \u2013 a large proportion of funds raised will be spent on a three month further development programme with a world class engineering firm. Their job is to make the product the very best it could be from a functional and visual perspective.\n- Tooling \u2013 we need to produce hard tooling to lovingly cut, bend and mould the components required to assemble each colander.\n- Manufacturing \u2013 setting up production line, assembly, packaging & quality assurance.\n- Logistics \u2013 we want to ensure that our deliveries to our backers are as quick and efficient as possible.\nMarket Testing\nWe don\u2019t get to go out much but we decided to take the RMDLO Colander on the road and ask a few people what they thought. In practice the \u201cfew people\u201d turned into hundreds and honestly, it is hard to quantify the positive reaction! Not a single person that we showed and tested the colander on walked away without a smile on their face or agreeing that they would \u201cdefinitely buy one of those\u201d. Some of the most commonly used comments/questions were as follows \u2013\n\u201cWhere and when can I buy one of those?\u201d \u2013 All in good time my friend.\n\u201cNow that is cool!\u201d \u2013 Indeed.\n\u201cIs it stainless steel? \u2013 Yes, only the best will do.\n\u201cIs that a sex toy?\u201d \u2013 Errrmmmm, I need to go now!\nNo, we can\u2019t produce statistical evidence but please do watch the video above.\nWho is Behind RMDLO?\nRan, Industrial designer/Co-founder\nHola! I\u2019m Ran and the inventor behind the RMDLO colander. In my career I've had a chance to design many different objects, from shoes & toys up to mobile phones & TVs. I've had the pleasure of working for Samsung, Dyson and Speedo as part of their innovation teams. Working directly for Dyson's founder, Sir James, was the best of all where I was able to learn so much about what makes a great and functional product. I have taken these lessons with me and ploughed them into the making of the RMDLO Colander. My responsibility @ RMDLO is designing our customers a perfect product :)\nFred, Commercial director/Co-founder\nBonjour, I am Fred. I have been working in product based businesses for the last 8 years. I am obsessed with cool looking and innovative products, an obsession which lead me to co-create RMDLO with my buddy Ran. My responsibilities @ RMDLO are the operational and business aspects of the project, so it is my job to get the products produced and to your door step as quickly and efficiently as possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Product\nThe colander in its current form is market ready but not to the highest standard that we expect at RMDLO. Therefore it will go into a final design for manufacturing stage with an engineering firm in the 3 months following our campaign of further development work on the product in order to address a small list of design issues that the product currently has. There is no guarantee that the engineering firm will be able to fix all the issues.\n\nReassurance: Rest assured that the issues are minimal and the engineering firm who would be contracted are one of the world\u2019s foremost firms in the field of product development.\n\nDelays\nWe will of course do our upmost to ensure that we hit delivery dates, however, as with all pre-order programmes, we must remind fellow pledgers that often delays can occur as a result of unforeseen circumstances. Ships sinking \uf04a, parts turning out incorrect etc, are all potential risks that if realised will create delays to the project\u2019s deliverables.\n\nReassurance: Rest assured however, we have a great team with substantial manufacturing experience so the delay risks are minimised.

Most tape dispensers are purely functional products and do not really make you smile. Other \u2018design dispensers\u2019 loose there functionality in being cool or are just too expensive. I hope you agree that I have found the perfect balance. A tape dispenser that is everything Dutch design stands for: timeless, smart and beautifully simplistic.\nMany, many prototypes to get it just right.\nThe dispenser\nAfter many design sessions I found the ring shape of the tape itself to be the perfect form. This ring is made out of flexible plastic to allow the tape to be clicked into the dispenser. Simplistic, playful and very easy to use. \nClickTape dispenser: ready to role!\nThe shape and production are fully optimised over a period of many months. Making one dispenser now only requires 12 grams of plastic. Sustainable it is!\nThe ClickTape dispenser is designed to stand out on your home or office desk but it is also very portable.\nClickTape: the ideal travel companion\nNew available Colours\nWe have selected Black and Blue as our main colours and Turquoise,  Kickstarter Green and Red to be our Backer specials. Check it out!\nThe colours samples below are from our supplier, this will give each ClickTape dispenser a rich color. \nColor samples (red to be added shortly)\nHow to use it\nAlthough the project video covers it all, you can find the individual usage steps below.\nAdding tape\nThe ClickTape dispenser is made out of plastic and is designed to be flexible. A role of tape can simply be clicked into the dispenser.\nPLAY\n\nUsing the tape\nThe dispenser is fitted with a stainless steel blade for durability and quick action. A small step in the blade helps you to get hold of the tape.\nPLAY\n\nRemoving the tape\nBecause of the flexibility of the dispenser it is easy to push or pull out the tape or remaining core.\nThe tape\nThe ClickTape dispenser will be sold with a role of 'invisible' tape, but also fits all other tapes measuring (like Scotch or Staples) : \nTape width 19 mm (3/4 inch). \nCore width 19mm (3/4 inch)  *some 19mm wide tapes have a smaller core width, this may not fit the dispenser.\n Internal diameter of core 26 mm (1 inch) \nThe ring shape is designed based on a 60mm (2.36 inch) diameter, which equals a tape length of about 33 meters (1296 inch). It will fit smaller but results in less magic.\nRewards\nAll rewards include free shipping :-)\nInvestment\nKickstarter is the ideal platform to get products that require a large investment, like the ClickTape dispenser, to market and available for you!\nThe 9.500 euro funding does not include any profit and will be used for:\nTooling\nProduction tooling for injection moulding the dispenser. See Wikipedia for more info on this process: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_molding\nProduction tooling for the stainless steel blades\nMaterial costs\nRaw material costs of plastic and stainless steel\nManufacturing the dispensers and blades\nMany meters of tape\nShipping costs\nPackaging and shipping costs\nPlanning\nThe Kickstarter campaign will run for one month. If we are able to reach our goal, tooling will be initiated in June. The tooling of the metal moulds for the dispenser will take up most of the lead time. Once the tooling is completed and fine-tuned production can be started. Shipping time will depend on your location but the ClickTape dispenser is not afraid of flying :-).\nQuestions?\nThat's all there is to say. We will try to keep the process as simple and smooth as the ClickTape dispenser itself. Feel free to contact us if you are left with any questions.\nThank you for your interest in this exciting project!\n Let's roll!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing plastic parts by means of injection moulding is a specialised form of manufacturing but very common for many house hold products. We are confident in our abilities to deliver this project on time and with great quality. Our previous experience in manufacturing consumer products makes us prepared for the unforeseen challenges we may encounter during the production process. We have previously manufactured injection moulded parts with our selected supplier.\n\nKeep in mind there are always issues that can arise, such as having to run multiple runs during the tooling process to fine-tune the tooling or to optimise the assembly or product finish. \n\nWe are committed to make the ClickTape dispenser both fantastic in form and function.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "ClickTape Update: using it! :-)", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nIt has been great to see many replies coming in from backers that have received their ClickTape's.

We felt from the start that Kickstarter would be the ideal place to launch The TravelCard\u2122.  Support and feedback from the Kickstarter community on The TravelCard\u2122 and future products will be invaluable.\nGO DESIGN was founded with the aim of producing products that provide problem-solving solutions for busy people.  The TravelCard\u2122 and other products we have on the drawing board accomplish this goal by taking a simple-is-better approach to functionality, without sacrificing design elements.\nBrian Neufang's background is in sales and marketing of consumer products. He was also a producer on the Kickstarter-funded indie hit movie, \"Ingenious.\" Our other partners/employees have extensive experience creating and sourcing successful products for national retailers, including unique houseware items, animated watches and computer accessories. \nWe hope to build the business by becoming known as the small company with big time saving ideas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce The TravelCard\u2122 concept was found to be feasible, we located an ultra-thin Lithium battery source. Then we methodically sought out an experienced Apple certified factory to produce The Travel Card. The Chinese factory we selected has been in business over eight years, has 450 employees and has gone through an extensive certification process to become Apple MFI (Made for iPhone) 6.0 licensed. Apple approved our factory's initial design prototype in November 2013. The final step in the approval process will be Apple signing off on a production sample and issuing a MFI license. There is always the possibility that Apple could want modifications made before approval. But according to the head engineer at our factory, this is unlikely since Apple has already approved the design. Our factory has had a close working relationship with Apple, having produced over forty MFI products.\n\nWe feel we've allowed ample time for pre-production, and once production is under way, we are confident that our factory has the capacity to keep up with demand.\n\nManufacturing delays could occur, but our sources tell us our factory is very reliable. We believe this to be the case or they wouldn't be Apple certified.\n\nShipping to our backers around the world in a timely manner presents a challenge because of the increased restrictions on products with batteries.

Thank you, so much for your support!\n____________________________________________________\nI'll make this short, and sweet...\nfab figs has been offered a few awesome retail opportunities - but needs \"retail\" packaging!  (for instance, there's this company that requested samples...you may have heard of them - Dean & Deluca?  Samples were sent, they enjoyed the figs, but they are not sold on the packaging).\nUnless you've already tried fab figs, or have seen them online - you may not know that they come in a box... a box that you can't see into - like this:\nThe figs themselves are quite tasty, I'm told... \"tastebud bliss,\" \"orgasmic,\" \"oh. my. god.\" are just a few quotes about the luscious dried figs filled with chocolate ganache.\nI also get compliments on the packaging and logo, but Retailers are requesting that I make a change, thus allowing customers who have never had a fab fig the ability to see \"what's in the box.\"\nI've tried the clear plastic boxes - but the figs are too heavy for them.  I've looked at standard see-through lid boxes, but they aren't high enough to accommodate the figs...\nThe money from this campaign will be put toward the creation of custom packaging prototypes... I have some ideas that include custom inserts, new box design, and new graphics - but all of these things cost money to get the figs rolling:\nnew photos\nnew labels\nnew containers\nnew inserts \nIf this campaign is successful, I expect to have the new packaging designed, created, and ready for production by May, 2014.  At that time, I'll be sure to send you all an update with the new look! \nIn the meantime, please pledge and enjoy fab figs, which will arrive to you in the current box~\n___________________________________________________\nFor your pledge to this Valentine's Day campaign, here are your rewards (outside of the box):\nSWEETHEART~\n One box of 4 original fab figs.\n________________________________________________\nBE MY VALENTINE~\n fab figs Valentine Box - One box of 8 boozy fab figs~ featuring the amazing Eastside Distilling's \"Burnside Bourbon\" in the dark chocolate ganache!\n____________________________________________________\nLUST AT FIRST SITE~\n One box of 8 original fab figs\n___________________________________________________\nLOVER~\n One box of 16 original fab figs.\n________________________________________________\nTRUE LOVE~\n One box filled with an assortment of all of the above!\n__________________________________________________\nFor those not familiar with kickstarter... it's really easy to pledge: just click here to find out how it works.

We know that Nanotips will be a great addition to your lives. If you missed the Kickstarter, no worries, you can buy it direct from our website at www.Nanotips.ca!\nThe liquid solution to your everyday problem.  If you wear gloves and own a touchscreen device, Nanotips is for you. \nWhat is Nanotips? It's a conductive polyamide liquid solution that can transform your ordinary gloves into touchscreen ones. Formulated using nanotechnology, Nanotips mimics the touch of human skin. It was designed with functionality and durability in mind making it great for all lifestyles. \nWhy Nanotips? How many pairs of gloves do you own? How many of them are touchscreen compatible?  Nanotips is the most cost friendly and effective solution that will transform all the gloves you own into touchscreen ones.  Upgrade your existing gloves or choose from a wider selection without being limited to style, comfort, and functionality.  \nLong lasting. Our formula is designed to last. Each application can last from a few weeks to a few months. It all depends on what you use your gloves for.  If it wears off, simply re-apply!\nRestoring functionality. Touchscreen gloves eventually stop working from daily wear and tear. Nanotips has the ability to restore the functionality and value to these gloves.\nMultiple applications. We have put enough liquid into each bottle to treat multiple gloves.  Nanotips Blue can treat an average of 15 fingers while Nanotips Black can treat up to 30!  So go ahead. Share with a friend or turn all your gloves into touchscreen gloves!\nFreedom to choose. With the huge variety of gloves on the market, why should you be limited to the select few that have touchscreen compatibility? Nanotips gives you the freedom to choose the perfect glove while not having to worry about touchscreen functionality.\nNANOTIPS is for everyone. From the cold winter months to the hot summer days, Nanotips is functional in every season.  Military gloves, running gloves, biking gloves, construction gloves, golfing gloves and even the thickest snowboarding and skiing gloves can now all be made touchscreen compatible. \nWinter Sports. Extremely durable and weather resistant. Nanotips will work in any weather and accept any abuse you throw at it.\nEveryday. Never limit yourself to certain styles. Give yourself the freedom of choice!\nWork Gloves. They don't make touchscreen work gloves because the touchscreen material would wear out too quickly. Our unique formula allows it to withstand even the roughest conditions. If it wears off, just re-apply.\nOn the go. Music and Lifestyle apps. Stay connected.\nYou might know this feeling if you ride a bike...\nWith simplicity and functionality in mind, we set out to create the quickest and most effective universal touchscreen upgrade ever. This formula has been created to last in any condition and takes less than 2 minutes to apply.   \nAPPLY\nDRY\nUSE\nWe have formulated two solutions to meet your specific needs: Nanotips Blue and Nanotips Black.\nNANOTIPS Blue\nFor use on fabrics ONLY. Nanotips Blue is designed specifically for fabrics.  This solution dries to a transparent blue which makes it practically invisible on colored fabrics. This formula soaks into the fabric creating a conductive bridge between your finger and the touchscreen device. Treats up to 15 fingers per bottle depending on material.\nNanotips Black\nNanotips Black is specifically tailored for leathers, rubbers, and other thicker materials. This formula works for all materials, however it may alter the texture of your fabric gloves. This formula can work in two ways. A) It creates a conductive layer on the surface of your glove B) It soaks into the fabric and creates a conductive bridge between the finger and the touchscreen device. Treats up to 30 fingers per bottle depending on material.\nGet your exclusive Kickstarter Nanotips T-Shirt before its too late! The LAST day to pledge for T-shirts is on FEBRUARY 18, 2014 MIDNIGHT !!\nDESIGN #1\nDESIGN #2\n**VOTE ON YOUR FAVOURITE DEISGN BEFORE 12AM TUESDAY FEBRUARY 18, 2014.** \nOur T-shirts come in a range of sizes from S-XL for men, women and children!\nCREATE A STYLUS/PEN COMBO. \nMake your own stylus. Details in the updates!\nCONDUCTIVE CIRCUIT\nDraw and create your own circuits with Nanotips Black!\nResearch and Testing\nWe began testing different formulations that would meet our specific requirements.  We started in a garage, carefully mixing and testing each solution with Durability, Simplicity, and Functionality in mind. We came out with a product that is finally ready for the market!\nOur design progression\nTechnical Details\nNanotips Black. Quite a bit of work has been done in the development of this product. Comprised of evenly dispersed ultra-fine conductive nanoparticles, each particle is carefully prepped and made to interlink with one another; this helps to form a conductive grid-like film on the surface of the material. Because your glove undergoes constant flex, abrasion, creasing, and natural elements, our formula allows the materials to remain in grid formation even under extreme conditions. This helps to create an evenly distributed conductive channel on the surface of your glove. \nNanotips Blue. Comprised of evenly dispersed ultra-fine conductive nanoparticles, each particle is carefully prepped and made to interlink with one another.  These particles are suspended in a solution which allows the nanoparticles to remain chained to one another even under extreme physical stressors. When applied to fabrics, Nanotips Blue soaks into the material and effectively creates a conductive chain, bridging the gap between your finger and the touchscreen device. The sacrifice for transparency over conductivity was made for Nanotips Blue which is the reason why this solution only functions for fabrics.\nBottles. Our bottles are made from glass. We chose glass over other materials because it allows the liquid to achieve a longer shelf life as it remains sealed in the bottle. The brush is a Dupont nylon brush. Using the brush method of application means that each individual would be able to precisely apply the solution to the targeted area.\nThe hard part is done and the working prototype is complete. We now have a product that we feel will revolutionize this industry. We need your help to get this product to market. Our production partners are ready and we need your pledges to help initiate the first large scale production run! Jump on board as one of the founders of Nanotips. Each dollar backed will help make this product a reality! \nManufacturing Plan\nAs soon as we reach our funding goal we will begin production. The total production time from the time we reach our funding goal is approximately 2.5 weeks.  The sooner we hit our goal the quicker we can get Nanotips into your hands!  \nThe breakdown...\n>> Orders will be placed for Labels, Bottles, and Boxes. Production and shipping time for these products takes roughly 1-2 weeks.\n>> Raw materials used in the formulation of the liquid will be ordered as soon as we reach our funding goal.  They are local companies which makes it convenient pick up within 5 days.\n>> Once all the materials have arrived, we will begin production.  Getting Nanotips into your hands as soon as possible. 1-2 weeks.\n>> The formula will be produced using a large batch method.  Every 100 grams will be thoroughly tested to ensure consistency throughout the batch.  \n>> Delivery of the product will be managed by our logistics team.  We will have the product shipped out to you as soon as it is tested and ready. Shipping time 5-7 business days depending on location.\nIf our campaign is successful, we would like to continue our research to expand in these areas. Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on how you would like to see our product developed!\nPROSTHETIC HANDS.  During the creation of Nanotips, we had discovered that many prosthetic limbs are unable to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices. Because touchscreen technology is such an integral part of our society, daily interactions for anyone with prosthetic hands becomes a challenge. We would like to expand in this field by testing Nanotips on a variety of prosthetics; our goal is to give them the ability to easily interact with touchscreen devices. \nJump to 3:00 to see how difficult it is to use a touchscreen device with a prosthetic.\nTRANSPARENT SOLUTION.  We are constantly working towards making a fully transparent universal solution. The idea is to create a touchscreen liquid that would work with all materials and is invisible to the naked eye.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story? Send us an email with your story idea(s) and if it's a story that fits the bill (and we have the # of backers to do it! ) we'll send our high-end video production team around the country to capture the best of best. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur 10-Year Hoodie project taught us that making a great product in a bunch of colors and sizes can get pretty complicated.

The Sugar Skull tea spoon is the perfect gift for those who need reminding to take a little less sugar in their drinks, and even if you don't, it's still MUCH more interesting than a regular spoon...\n\nMade from Stainless steel and with a concave shape to ensure you still get plenty of sweetness per scoop, it's ripe for kick starting!\nTea Spoon close up\nSpoonful of sugar - concave shape makes up for sugar lost through eyes\n 3.0 THE REWARDS\nReward #1: A6 bumper sticker\nReward #1: A6 Bumper Sticker\nReward #2: 1 x Sugar Skull Spoon\nReward #2: Sugar Skull Spoon (tea cup not included)\nReward #3: Special Edition Mug and 1 x Sugar Skull Spoon\nReward #3: Special Edition Mug and 1 x Sugar Skull Spoon\n4.0 THE DEVELOPMENT\nFinal Technical Drawings\n\nWe spent 6 months perfecting the proportions, developing 3D models and prototypes and discussing manufacturing processes with factories worldwide, to get the idea to the stage it's at now, primed and ready for Kickstarting! Your pledges of investment will be spent on placing the production order, this includes the stock and materials and also will help pay for freight charges to our warehouse, at which point we can ship out all the lovely rewards you have given so generously for!\nFirst Concept Sketch\nOur Sugar Skull Spoon is made from high-quality stainless steel, with a laser etched 'Hundred Million' logo subtly engraved into the back of the handle, drawing on inspiration from the Mexican D\u00eda de los Muertos Festival, gothic culture, Tim Burton films, and of course lots and lots of coffee in the office, led us to this design, and we are ready to unleash it upon the World!\nInitial Prototype - Rejected because of weird proportions!\nPrototype Number 2 - Created using the (unsuccessful) 'cut-from-flat-sheet-then-bend-into-shape' method\n 5.0 PRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT PLAN\nAssuming we achieve our funding, and because of the developmental work we have already invested time in, the production and fulfillment stages of the project will move quite quickly.\n\nYour pledges will almost immediately be used for us to place the main order for Sugar Skull Spoons with our factory, they will take approximately 6 weeks to produce and polish, and another 5 weeks for quality control inspection and delivery to our studio.\n\nDuring this time we will also order production and printing of the special edition mugs and bumper stickers - which have much shorter lead times and should arrive ahead of the Sugar Skull Spoons.\n\nOnce the various products have arrived in our UK studio we will package them up as per pledged amounts, and complete all thank you cards! before dispatching orders. Hundred Million is a company used to shipping out orders internationally, so this is a phase which does not phase us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge so far has been production methods - what started out as a seemingly simple manufacturing alteration (punching a skull design out of an existing teaspoon) quickly became a mission to find the perfect factory.\n\n Each tea spoon is cast in a mould, but first we tried many methods of manufacture including cutting and shaping the design, and using existing spoons and stamping out the shape as a post-production process.

We also have a lot of other wonderful products with many more to come, so be sure to stay in touch:\nwearewellmade.com\nFacebook\n@wearewellmade on Instagram\nPinterest\nStiicks, a new way to think about quality framing.\nTheir minimal construction makes them perfect for any room.\nSo what exactly are... Stiicks?\nIncredibly simple by design, even easier to install\nMade by expert craftsmen in Chicago, IL\nThey use sustainable materials, sourced regionally and responsibly\nSwap artwork easier than any frame out there\nMade properly, to last forever\nStiicks are a patent-pending frame composed of 4 thin strips of sustainably-sourced American hardwood \u2013 No set of Stiicks will ever be made from a tree that was cut down for lumber. Each Stiick is embedded with several super-strong magnets that sandwich whatever you're hanging firmly in between.\nRare-earth magnets hold your artwork right where you want it.\nTwo of the four pieces come pre-drilled which makes mounting significantly easier, with a more stable result, than a traditional frame. In fact we recommend just putting a single screw in the wall and using your smart phone as a level.\nStiicks work smarter, not harder.\nSimply center your artwork and drop the other Stiick into place.\nAvailable in 4 Sizes and 5 Finishes.\nWe have designed Stiicks in four standard sizes, but the great thing about a floating magnetic frame is that they can fit literally dozens of sizes, at virtually any length, without batting an eye.\nSmall \u2013 12\" long, designed for 11\"x14\" prints\nSorta-Big \u2013 17\" long, designed for 16\"x20\" prints\nKinda-Big \u2013 19\" long, designed for 18\"x24\" prints\nLarge \u2013 25\" long, designed for 24\"x36\" prints\nPick your reward NOW, and your finish AFTER the campaign ends.\nCherry \u2013 An amber-red American hardwood.\nBright-White \u2013 Coated with 2 coats of premium paint before finishing.\nMaple \u2013 Blonde in color, excellent in appearance.\nFlat-Black \u2013 This finish also receives 2 coats of premium paint.\nOak \u2013 This tan colored hardwood is also the most common.\n* Lacquer Finish * \u2013Whether left natural or painted, each and every Stiick is finished with two coats of matte lacquer for a long-lasting and durable finish.\nShipping\nEverything is in place for Stiicks to go directly into production the moment we meet our goal. Our first priority is to get the initial production run into the hands of our US backers with enough time to get them under the Christmas tree. Please read carefully as many of our Rewards have sold out for Christmas delivery, but all sizes are still available.\nEarly Bird Special \u2013 SOLD OUT\nSmall \u2013 January delivery available\nSorta-Big \u2013 January delivery available\nKinda-Big \u2013 Christmas delivery still available!\nLarge \u2013 Christmas delivery still available!\nBuy1, Give1 \u2013 January delivery available\nFull Set \u2013 Christmas delivery still available!\nCollector Pack \u2013 January delivery available\nALL Rewards include US shipping.\nOur Schedule\nMonday, December 2nd at 11:59pm \u2013 Campaign ends the evening of Cyber Monday.\nTuesday, December 3rd \u2013 Backer Survey is sent out.\nWhile we ask that Backers reply as quickly as possible, you will have 2 weeks to reply to your survey.\nMonday, Decmber 16th \u2013 The initial round of rewards ships from Chicago, Illinois all around the world.\nInternational Shipping \u2013 While we are committing to domestic delivery in time for Christmas Day, we cannot guarantee the same for international shipments. If you purchase one of the first 50 of any reward tiers and supply all necessary shipping information on time, your package will ship Monday, December 16th.

While production represents a significant task, we have confidence in our final product and have streamlined our production process. Which is why in order to ship rewards within a pretty tight window, we are asking that our supporters remain engaged and are prompt with their survey responses so we can deliver on time, potentially even a few days early.\n\nIn addition, Well Made is committed to using sustainable sourcing for its lumber, which can have a slightly more irregular availability than commercial lumber.

Thanks to you, our backers, we have reached an amazing 800%+ of our goal! \n The Finex team and I will strive to live up to the level of confidence you have shown for us and the product. \n Please stay in contact by going to www.finexusa.com to continue to get information, and sign up for our newsletter. \nAgain: THANK YOU! \nMike Whitehead\n                                                                       A NOTE to the media: A full press page (with full resolution images) is available at www.finexusa.com/press-resources\n    Why did I start this?\nI love cast iron skillets but the well-finished ones are commanding an outrageous premium on Ebay, and they still have the old-school integrated handles that are too hot, too flat, and too small to use effectively. \nYou see, the newer skillets are just quickly cast and then tossed out for sale.  The insides (where the action happens!) are rough and build up a kind of gross burnt-food surface -- completely different than the wonderful carbon-based, inherently low-stick surface that a great cast iron skillet gains as it seasons.\nYou see, the inside of the newer cast iron skillets are NOT machined - they are left rough and rugged, which is a problem for serious cooks. They just don't release the food easily (leading to 'fractured foods'), nor do they allow that wonderful crispiness that forms on the bottom of skillet-cooked food to be picked up by a spatula and be transferred to your waiting plate. \nI decided that I needed to machine the inside of my skillets - despite the cost - because the surface finish on the skillet equaled the finish on the food.\nRe-designing a classic can seem brash\nI've completely re-worked the design. But, fear not! I've kept the best parts and then carefully added just the features that were really needed to upgrade this classic.  And, I got to use the best of current casting and machining technologies to really put it a 'step-above'!\nMade in the Pacific Northwest\nSourcing locally:\nOne design goal for me was to source everything in the US and to keep the sources close to my home city of Portland, Oregon. \nThis allowed me to use my existing sources of supply from my 'day job' (the ones I knew could, and would, perform well), and it let me keep a close eye on things and intervene with an on-site visit when needed (or when I wanted to watch industry-in-action!)\nPortland is known as a design and food-lovers destination - perfect for this skillet!\nIt's really hard to not love food when living in Portland. We've had the highest ratio of restaurants to population for decades. And, we were one of the earliest places for startups in the micro-brewery industry.\nInnovative Octagonal Shape\nThe octagonal shape lets you put the skillet on its side (like for drying it after washing) and it won't roll around like those 'other' skillets.\nPlus, it gives 6 directions that you can pour from, because each 'corner' becomes a pour-spout - it's a little bit like magic.\nThose flat sides also allow a spatula to slide in easily for getting under pancakes, fried eggs, etc.\nSpring Handle for Cooling and Comfortable Grip\nThere are three problems with the old-style skillet handle:\nThey are too small\nThey are too thin for comfort\nThey stay hot too long\nFinex has solved these problems!\nThe Finex spring handle harks back to the classic woodstove handles that kept us from burning our hands when stoking the fire. The spring design is both tried-and-true and brilliant.  \nThe spring handle has lots of air space so it cools quickly after being used in the oven or on a gas-burner stove-top.  \nPlus, its naturally curved shape fits in your hand giving a secure and comfortable grip, which is important when pouring or moving it around the kitchen with food in it. \nAnd, of course: it looks great!\nYou'll see that the handle is heavy-duty - it's made from 1/4\" diameter stainless steel. That makes it solid and easy to grab, yet open enough to cool quickly. \nThe bronze end-cap is a signature part of the skillet. It will also put up with anything you can throw at it in a kitchen environment. Bronze melts at 1,742 \u00b0F so unless you cook like my friend Charles, you'll be fine. (just joking about Charles' cooking!) :-)\n\nHere's a video of the prototyping prove-out run that we did at the spring house:\nCNC Machined Smooth Interior\nThe inside of the FINEX Skillet will be CNC machined. What this means for you is the inside will be very smooth - this makes it naturally less-stick, and easier to clean.\nPlus, it won't build up that scary-looking burnt-food 'ruggedness' that cheap import skillets grow over time - instead, it will season to a beautifully smooth carbonized surface that will cook like nothing else in the world.\nThis is what separates the great cast iron skillets from the 'cheap-os'. It adds cost and complexity to the manufacturing process but the results are stellar!\nManufacturing the Finex Skillet:\nThe Finex skillet will be cast using the oldest method around: SAND CASTING.  It may be the oldest method, but it's still the best for short-runs like this skillet! \nThe first-article pour will be streamed LIVE!\nOf course, over the last 2000+ years, sand-casting has improved dramatically, as have the alloys of cast iron. I'll be using one of the Northwest's premium sand-casting houses to pour these beauties, and I'll be on hand for the first pour, which we'll be streaming live as it happens. \nHere's a quick overview of how sand-casting is done:\nFirst, the design must available in digital form. Since the skillet was designed in CAD, that's already done.  \nThen, the CAD file is turned into toolpaths for a CNC vertical machining center to mill the pattern from a solid block of aluminum. \nUPDATE:\nThe Finex Skillet mold is being made from a polyurethane block that will then be embedded in an aluminum plate. Willamette Pattern chose to use the polyurethane board because it machines more easily and for the skillet it is a better choice.\nHere's a video of the mold being machined on Nov 5, 2013:\nAfter it is machined, the finished pattern mold is placed between two casting frames (called the flask, consisting of the the cope on top and the drag on bottom) and has the sand rammed in around it. The aluminum becomes the negative space that the molten cast iron is poured into.\nProject Timeline:\nThe Finex Coaster - a 'Thank You!' for our supporters\nWith over 90 craft breweries in the Portland area, it's hard for us not to appreciate a great coaster, and cork is the classic material, just like cast iron is the classic material for skillets.\nI offer these as a 'Thank you!' for supporting this project at $25.\n This cork coaster will be offered ONLY through Kickstarter for our backers.\nYES!  All Finex skillets will be lightly pre-seasoned\nSince launching the project many people have asked: \"Will it be pre-seasoned?\" The answer is \"Yes!\":\nYour Finex skillet will arrive lightly seasoned and include instructions for maintaining or re-seasoning it at any time.\nThe Finex skillet is seasoned with nature's ultimate oil - organic flaxseed oil that is cold-pressed and unrefined. Flax seed oil is fantastic at creating a hard, slick surface on cast iron that is the essence of cast iron's naturally low-stick cooking surface.\nIf you burn something in your skillet or a guest scrubs it with steel wool and soap (yipes!) - DON'T WORRY. Just use a little extra oil the next time you use it. When the cooking surface is this smooth it really takes the mystery out of seasoning the surface - that's one of the reasons we will be CNC machining the inside!\nHow much will the Finex Skillet weigh?\nThis is another question we've been getting and it points out that the (all-too-common) cheap import skillets are heavy! \nWhy? Because they use inferior alloys of cast iron, less fine-grained sand for casting, and don't machine the inside.\nAll of those bits of extra attention to detail and specifications will make the Finex Skillet weigh in at around 6 to 7 pounds vs. a 'cheapie' skillet at 8+ pounds.\nWe don't have exact numbers yet because the first round of actual cast iron casting will take place (with YOUR support!) in mid-November. But we can assure you that the Finex will be much easier to handle and work with on a regular basis than the cast iron skillets you can buy off the shelf currently.\nWe can tell you that the CAD system calculations say the skillet is right about 6.75 pounds and we've weighed the prototype spring handle at 1/2 pound, so that's a total of 7-1/4 pounds without the bronze knob at the end of the handle. \nThat's comparable to the weight of the best old-style skillet ever made, the Griswold 12\" (which has the problematic handle).  So, the Finex with that lusciously large handle will be a breeze to maneuver!\nIs a lid being planned?\nYes! A Finex skillet lid is being planned and we will announce it sometime after the first of the year.\nWe are making absolutely SURE that we do a great job of supporting our backers on this skillet before we take on more projects! \nHowever... we are excited about the lid as the Finex 8-sided design allows the lid to out-baste our competition with it\u2019s almost air tight fit and it doesn\u2019t have any air gaps where traditional pour spouts leak steam. \nMany people have asked about it scratching a glass stove top...\nCast iron is absolutely wonderful on smooth top ranges (glass and inductive heat).\nThat said, you are working on glass so I recommend minimizing how much you drag, slide or drop any cookware on glass topped ranges.\n A little bit about the team behind the Finex Skillet:\nDavid Lewin - Finex Industrial Designer\nDavid Lewin\nMike Whitehead approached David Lewin (http://www.lewindesigns.com/) with a gift of probably the hardest challenge an industrial designer could ask for -- create the ultimate functional product, using natural materials and local labor. Something that will literally last forever. \nDavid undertook shaping the skillet with respect to the traditions, added skillful insights and empathy for the everyday user. The result is a skillet that is elegant, versatile and a practical contribution to chefs everywhere.\nThank you, David!\n.\nKip Buck - Finex 3D modeler and drafter\nNike, Adidas, Keen, FILA, Lewin Design,Specialized, I Generator, ARIAT, Leupold are companies that Kip has had the pleasure to work with. Design, engineering, CAD, RHINO, RP are all in his quiver ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.\nNow he's conquered the FINEX challenge!  \nKip can be contacted at bluewolves4@yahoo.com \n.\nAaron Draplin - logo designer for Finex\nAaron Draplin\nRaised in the Michigan Northwoods, schooled at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and currently hunkered down in the mighty Pacific Northwest, Aaron Draplin proudly rolls up his sleeves on projects related to Print, Identity, Web Development and Illustration. \nHis client list includes: Coal Headwear, Union Binding Co., Field Notes, Richmond Fontaine, Nike, Wired, Timberline, Ford Motor Co., Viva Voce, Hutchco, Patagonia, Chunklet, Incase, Giro, Cobra Dogs, Burton Snowboards, Hughes Entertainment, Megafaun and even the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. \nHe prides himself on a high level of craftsmanship and quality that keeps him up late into the wet Portland night. www.draplin.com/\n.\nCharles Waugh - Kickstarter guru for Finex Skillet\nCharles Waugh\nHe's the guy that set up and ran the complete Finex Kickstarter campaign. Including buiidling this entire page - the videos (writing the script, doing the videography and editing, and voice-overs when needed), the graphics, the product photography and retouching, plus writing most of the copy on this page (including writing this entirely self-serving, but true, blurb).\nAs a fine art portrait photographer for over a decade, engineer, designer, sculptor, videographer, copywriter, calligrapher, and general maniac, Charles really does it all.  Having a portrait studio in Portland, a shop-to-die-for at his house, plus fine woodworking and design engineering in his background, Charles thinks sleep is highly over-rated.\nThis is Charles' third successful project on Kickstarter (www.woxom.com, www.simplepen.com), with two more in the works currently (keep your eyes peeled for them!)\nCharles can be contacted at cw@charleswaugh.com ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been an engineering manager and product designer in Northwest industries like Boeing for decades. I have overseen projects in aerospace, consumer goods, and optics, so I understand how to design the product, select the vendors, and manage the process to generate the specified results. Of course while keeping it all on-time, on-spec, and within budget (plus having fun!)\n\nAs of the launch of this project, the CAD modeling is done, the 3D printed prototypes have been proven out, the prototype mold is soon to be machined, the spring house is selected and prototypes have been run, and the foundry is selected. The preliminary marketing is beginning to be put in place, and the packaging and sales support materials are shaping up.\n\n\nThe entire value stream has been carefully selected within the Northwest U.S., to keep things close to home, in the USA, and largely within my existing manufacturing relationships. I haven't just grabbed the lowest quote and hoped they might deliver - I know many of them, have worked with many of them before, and have visited and grilled the others to verify their credentials.\n\nI've run the numbers of the business plan and we are right on track at this point: ready for a Kickstarter launch! \n\nSUMMARY: All that is left to get this skillet cooking is for you to tell us you agree with our vision by pledging to support the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Gourmet Grubber", "content": "Thank you in advance for your update!", "time": "over 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Patrick Weir", "content": "KSTHANKS14 code doesn't seem to be working anymore.

A spatula made from a single piece of silicone, heat resistant to 464\u00b0F, with weight and balance that make it easy to whip up a quick batch of pancakes, and fun to stir your grandma's spaghetti sauce for six hours on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing fancy here. No gimmicks. Just the best spatula you've ever used.\nTHANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING CAMPAIGN!\nThis was a lot of fun - thanks for the support. We're wrapping up on Kickstarter, but the GIR Spatula is here to stay! Visit our website at productofgir.com to get your hands on the Spatula and keep track of the latest from GIR.\nTHE STORY BEHIND IT ALL\nIt started with a common spatula\u2026 or more accurately, with a drawer of spatulas. For a tool that's so simple it's nearly two-dimensional, but integral to any cook's toolkit, we felt let down by every model we put in our hands.\nWooden handles burned on the edge of the pan and warped in the dishwasher. Metal handles were hot to the touch. Detachable blades and superfluous nooks and crannies trapped oil and food particles, which made cleaning a chore. Some were floppy, others so inflexible they couldn't scrape a bowl. And anything but a silicone blade had us worried that we'd ruin nonstick pans or be eating plastic out of the skillet if we turned around for more than a few seconds. Out of a collection of over a dozen, not a single one \"got it right.\"\nWe figured it was time for a change. So we designed a spatula that solved every one of those problems. Our small improvements to otherwise run-of-the-mill utensils have added up to an innovative, multi-purpose kitchen tool. And after several months of testing and prototype design, we're ready to rock and happy to introduce the patent-pending GIR Spatula: a single piece of molded silicone, heat resistant to 464\u00b0, easy to clean and easy to hold, flex- vs. structure-optimized.\nCORE DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS & KEY BENEFITS\nSAFE & HEAT RESISTANT\nThe Spatula does not get hot to the touch and it does not melt or burn: its heat resistant silicone withstands temperatures to 464\u00b0F (and you can deep freeze it to -40\u00b0F if you're in the mood).\nAN INCREDIBLY VERSATILE KITCHEN TOOL\nThe heavy-duty silicone rubber and strong but flexible blade make it easy to maneuver food, liquid, dry mixes, wet batters... you name it. Suitable for containers of all sizes: bowls, pots, hot pans, and plates.\nFOR HOME & PROFESSIONAL USE\nWe like to think of the Spatula as the ultimate kitchen tool, friendly and approachable enough for beginners at home, as well as super sanitary and multipurpose enough to serve as the go-to tool for experienced chefs at work. Lightweight but sturdy, non-slippery with a comfortable handle and grip, the Spatula was designed with both the occasional cook and seasoned chef in mind.\nCLEANS THOROUGHLY & EASILY\nThe Spatula\u2019s solid body construction doesn't trap food or oil particulates. It's quick and easy to clean by hand, so you can get right back to cooking. And of course, it's dishwasher safe. We put it through hundreds of cycles to make sure it didn't degrade or wear over time. And it performed just beautifully.\nECO-FRIENDLY & LONG-LASTING\nMade of eco-friendly, non-toxic material, the Spatula is designed to spend a lifetime in your kitchen.\nPATENT PENDING\nThe Spatula's novel design and construction make it a one-of-a-kind kitchen implement. So we can add another cool item to its highlight reel: Patent Pending.\nWITH YOUR SUPPORT\nWe've come a long way. The Spatula graduated from idea to prototype, and now it's ready for the big time. We're gearing up to launch a full-scale manufacturing run, and we can't do it without your help.\nSo where are we now? We've:\n- Finalized the Spatula's design, from handle to blade\n- Tested a range of material combinations\n- Built and tested five generations of silicone prototypes\n- Tested a production run of units in every color\nBy supporting this effort, you'll be the first to get your hands on a game-changing spatula unlike any other.\nWe're on track to deliver the first batch to our Kickstarter backers by early December 2012. We think they belong in every kitchen in the world, starting with yours.\nWHAT WILL YOURS LOOK LIKE?\nWe bet you have a drawer or bucket of subpar (or uninspiring) spatulas just like we did. If we may be so bold: throw them all away, and get the Ultimate Spatula. We wouldn't blame you if your next purchase was a trophy case.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent the better part of a year designing, developing, prototyping, testing, and beating up the GIR Spatula. If we were going to claim it as the \"ultimate,\" it HAD to stand up to the wear and tear of daily use\u2026 as well as some more extreme treatment.\n\nHere were some of the biggest challenges:\n\u2022 Refining the design of the polymer core so that we'd hit the optimal flex level\n\u2022 Selecting the appropriate food-grade silicone to use \n\u2022 Running test batches of silicone in each Pantone color until they looked right\n\u2022 Testing each color's durability with 7+ hours in simmering tomato sauce \n\u2022 Finding a manufacturer willing to work with us to produce smaller prototype orders so that we could get our models in the kitchen and test them (and test them, and test them\u2026) \n\u2022 Destroying almost every other spatula we owned to uncover any weaknesses we'd overlooked (RIP, stainless steel pan with melted plastic spatula all over it)\n\nWhat we came up with was unique enough to merit an application to the USPTO. So our intrepid little spatula is Patent Pending.\n\nWe're really proud of the amount of design, brainpower, and cooking that have gone into this project. We've put up some real investment dollars of our own to get it to this stage, and nothing would be a better reward than seeing you (and your friends) try it out for yourselves.

The one-cup-at-a-time handcrafted brewing process (without paper filters, electric mechanisms, risky balancing acts or fussy coils and plungers) results in a clean, yet full-bodied cup that has captured all the flavor of the beans and nothing else.\nThe Impress Coffee design is almost complete. We just need to make a few final revisions from our last prototype, invest in tooling and get moving on a pilot run. To thank you for joining in on the fun and being one of the first people in the world to own an Impress, we'll throw in some incentives, like Impress Coffee brewers, delicious coffee beans - and stickers!! \n3 Easy Pieces - No Mechanical Plungers & No Mess!\nThe Impress is a 2-piece nested press with a to-go cup lid that brews a full-flavored great cup of coffee in 3 minutes or less. After placing fresh grounds in the outer cup and pouring in hot water, you let it brew to your taste\u2014we suggest 3 minutes (our coffee experts have tested it and we agree). Then,  simply push the inner cup (reverse-flow filter inspired by the portafilter) all the way down, and clean full bodied coffee flows up into the vessel as the grounds get pushed down. That's it - you're done! Put a lid on it and go. The grounds stay at the bottom and out of your coffee until you are ready to pull the inner cup filter back out to clean it. The filter technology keeps the grounds from brewing any further after the coffee is pressed, so you only get the 3 minute brew you intended, even if the coffee stays put for a while longer!\nInsulated Outer Vessel, Nesting Inner Filter, To-Go Lid\nThe Specs\n\u2022 PIECES: double-walled outer cup, nesting inner cup with removable filter basket, to-go lid\n\u2022 SIZE: 6\" tall, 3.375\" diameter (approximate)\n\u2022 VOLUME: recommended 13 oz (max = 14 oz)\n\u2022 MATERIALS: 304 Stainless Steel, food-grade Silicone\n\u2022 MICRO-FILTER: 304 Stainless Steel, removable for washing\n\u2022 CARE: Top-rack dishwasher safe\nHot Forever\nThe outer cup is double-walled stainless steel for maximum heat retention while remaining cool to the touch. Early testers have consistently been impressed by how long their coffee stays hot \u2013 many of them pour their coffee into their favorite mugs just so they can cool it off.\nInsulated Outer Cup Keeps Coffee Hot\nMicro-Filter\nThe inner stainless steel cup is designed as a reverse flow filter that is pressed down after the appropriate brewing time and nests inside the outer cup. It is inspired by the portafilter, so it allows you some flexibility with the grind size.\nTiny Filter Holes Inspired by the Portafilter\nClean & Full Flavored Coffee\nThe Impress is uniquely designed so that brewing stops completely once the inner and outer cups are fully nested. The tiny filter holes work well with any grind size, and the filter traps the grounds below the finished coffee so it can\u2019t overbrew or let sediment in. No more overbrewed bitterness or muddy sediment of traditional press pots! With a stainless steel construction and filter, you can rest assured you will only be tasting the flavor of the coffee itself.\nTake It To-Go\nBecause of the double-walled outer cup and nested inner cup, the Impress is a triple-insulated to-go vessel full of delicious coffee. Arrive at work and coffee is still as hot, clean and full flavored as when you left home. You might even decide to share some of your coffee with a co-worker. The Impress makes 14oz of coffee, enough for 2 people to share.\nDrink Straight Out of the Vessel - Coffee Hot, Fingers Not.\nCleaning is Easy \nBecause the Impress is made of simple parts rather than intricate coils, filters, mechanisms and plungers, the grounds and oils can't get trapped in little crevices. Just knock out the grounds and give a quick rinse to be ready for your next delicious cup.\nThe Idea\nA few years ago, we found a bit of time to dive into the world of fine tea and explore the need for a good one-cup tea infuser. After a few years worth of tea times, we were able to bring The Teastick, a one-cup tea infuser, to market. We were simply floored, and humbled, at how well received the design was and how much people loved the simplicity, as well as the great cup of tea The Teastick infused. Since the day it was released, we have been asked if we could create a one-cup-at-a time coffee maker.\nOf course, coffee and tea are very different, so a coffee product had to be a brand new concept. It took us a few more years after the Teastick to find the time to dedicate to coffee, but we LOVE coffee, so it was a sacrifice worth making.\nBeing very regular coffee drinkers, we naturally had a number of different coffee brewers at the office, from electric drip brewers to pour-over options to press pots, and various inventer-versions of all of the above. Although many of them made a nice cup of coffee, there was still something missing. Press pots are known to overbrew the coffee and get muddy as it sits there. They are also difficult to clean when finished. Pour-overs have to work with a different mug and need a paper filter. And most of the inventer versions just felt, well, too inventery. AND, none of them kept the coffee insulated or worked as a brewer and to-go vessel in one. These points became our design criteria. With the prototype of Impress Coffee, we now know (if we didn't before) that there's nothing better than a clean, full-flavored cup of piping hot coffee that stays clean, full-flavored and piping hot all day long.\nLaunching with Kickstarter\nWe are community-minded and community-driven people. To find an online tool that cultivates and grows our community is exciting and intriguing to us. We see Kickstarter as a great way to help us launch the Impress. If we are fortunate enough to realize our goal, we will quickly move forward with a pilot run of the Impress Coffee brewer. If we are even more fortunate and surpass our goal, we will increase our production quantity, add new colorways and patterns to the outer cup and get started on a multi-cup version. Please help us make the world a better coffee place one Impress at a time. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major challenges of any pilot run of a product is finalizing the product and working with the manufacturer to make sure the production is as the design intended. Fortunately, we do this every day for our clients. Aly Khalifa, the owner of Gamil Design and designer of Impress Coffee, is not only a product designer, but an engineer as well, with 20+ years of experience working with factories on tooling, sampling and manufacturing. We have already determined an appropriate factory and have received prototypes and samples from them to prove that they are equipped to handle the job. We have also worked with client product launches as well as with our own product, The Teastick, to launch, process and fulfill orders at first adopter stage, regular every day times and media blitz bumps.

First, you really do need to disassemble the filter portion to clean it. Some who are unhappy might find that the problem is the grounds and sediment gets caught in the filter threads and that might be the issue so always take the extra 30 seconds to unscrew the filter and clean it. If you still have a bitter taste, try some CLR for cleaning (but make sure you do a completely thorough cleaning after use). The CLR is what I've used in $9K commercial espresso and brewers for years and its always worked. As for burning your lip, well, the product was over-designed from an insulation standpoint which is a good thing but you need to exercise caution when dealing with boiling water. Lastly, boiling water for brewing is fine as long as you don't over boil (Time wise). Over boiling causes oxygen depletion in the water that will affect the taste. Just let it come to a gentle boil and stop, pour and enjoy. Mope this helps. I'm planning on ordering a bunch of these for holiday presents for family and business associates.

The way Kickstarter works, once there are any backers involved, we could not alter the verbage of the reward at all, so that higher shipping charge had to stay there, which make things a bit confusing.

If you missed it but still want to donate to the Sacramento Taiko Dan, you can contribute online at our website: www.sactaiko.org.\n\nNow that we've reached funding status, we can grow our repair order!! We're shooting for $12,000 now!  Help us take this project to the next level!\n  Wow!  We reached our goal early, which means we can expand our project now.  Our initial goal was to repair the drums in the most critical shape, but there are many more that need repair.  Now that we are officially funded, any extra pledges will help us add more drums to our project. If we can raise $12,000 by the end of this pledge drive, we can add additional shime and chu daiko to our repair order.\n  We have tons of rewards still available, like tee-shirts, bachi, workshop passes and many more.  Our pledge drive is open until October 22nd, so join us today.  We have an amazing team at the Sacramento Taiko Dan, and we want you to be part of it!  (As an added incentive, we're changing our $100 reward tier to include an optional tee-shirt with the bachi.  This is a great deal!  Make a $100 pledge before the drive ends!) \n  To everyone who has backed us already, we are extremely excited about getting funded!  An Odaiko-sized thank you to all of you!  We are beyond appreciative!  Thank you so much!\n  Great Performances Depend On Great Drums\nSince 1989, we at the Sacramento Taiko Dan have dedicated ourselves to bringing amazing taiko performances to the Sacramento area.  We take great pride in our shows, combining awe-inspiring drumming with carefully crafted movement to bring our fans an experience they will remember for years to come.  The Sacramento Taiko Dan performance drums are an integral part of this experience, providing the foundation from which Sacramento Taiko Dan shows are built from.  This fall, we are trying to raise money to repair these drums.  Properly maintaining these drums will help us continue the work we do and enable many more years of great performances.\nThe Sacramento Taiko Dan Performance Drums Are In Need Of Essential Repairs\nOur goal with this fundraiser is to raise money for much needed repairs to our performance drums. Gradual wear from many years of use has begun to deteriorate the drum heads. Some of the skins have formed holes, and a few of our drums have been temporarily decommissioned until their skins can be properly replaced.\nThese drums are provided to us through the generous support of Asano Taiko in Japan. Based in Ishikawa Prefecture, Asano Taiko has been hand crafting beautiful, high quality drums since 1609, passing on their skill and knowledge from generation to generation. To honor Asano Taiko's support, properly maintaining these drums is our due responsibility.\nIf we meet our Kickstarter project goal this fall, you will help us pay to have staff from Asano Taiko replace the heads of these drums.  Sacramento Taiko Dan will host an Asano technician here in Sacramento while the repairs are made, (this option is less expensive than shipping our drums to their shop Japan).  Your contributions will also help us pay for the raw materials needed for the repairs, such as the tacks and skins prepared by the Asano Taiko shop.\nWho We Are And What We Do\nFor the past 23 years, Sacramento Taiko Dan has been an important non-profit arts and cultural resource for the Sacramento metropolitan community.  Our mission is to study, preserve and promote traditional and contemporary styles of taiko drumming.  We seek to provide the people in the Sacramento area with opportunities for greater cultural awareness and understanding of this traditional Japanese art form through performances, classes, and public education programs.\nPerformances are the mainstay of Sacramento Taiko Dan.  We average sixty to eighty performances each year at cultural events throughout the Sacramento and Bay areas, including the Sacramento Pacific Rim Festival, the California State Fair, local Obon festivals and bazaars, art expositions, and many others.  We produce two major showcase concerts each year in Sacramento, and take part in the Annual International Taiko Festival each fall with the San Francisco Taiko Dojo. Our performance drums are an essential part of every one of these shows, (this is why these repairs are so important to us). \nSacramento Taiko Dan also teaches classes year round for people interested in learning and playing taiko.  We provide youth and adult classes for all skill levels, from beginning to advanced.  Students learn traditional songs and rhythms, as well as basic music and performance skills, and develop self-discipline and confidence through learning to perform on stage.  \nWe also reach a few thousand local K-12 students each year through our Taiko In Schools outreach program.   With our Taiko In Schools program we bring highly interactive assembly programs to Sacramento area schools, where children learn about traditional Japanese culture and folk music.  This program is free to participating schools through our coordination with the California Arts Council\u2019s Exemplary Arts program.\nYour Help Today Is Important to Us\nLike many other arts programs around the country, Sacramento Taiko Dan has been adversely affected by the recent events of the economic downturn.  In the past, Sacramento Taiko Dan has received critical grant support from the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission and the California Arts Council.   In the last few years however, these organizations have been hit hard by the recession, and as a result our grant funding has diminished significantly.  This year we received only 18 percent of the funding we were awarded just three years ago. \nDespite this setback, Sacramento Taiko Dan is committed to continuing its work in the local arts and cultural communities.  We invite you to join us as we continue forward in our mission.  By contributing to this Kickstarter Project today, not only will you help Sacramento Taiko Dan pay for essential repairs to its performance drums, you will be backing an invaluable arts and cultural program in the Sacramento area.  We have many exciting rewards available for all levels of support, so please make your contribution today!\nDomo Arigato!\nRewards Gallery\nBelow are selected images from our reward tiers.

There\u2019s an app for that. airbridge devices can stream your presentation over WiFi (AirBridge Pro will even make one when there\u2019s none) to other iOS devices, with or without a screen connected. App users can take a snapshot and write out some notes if they want to, and store those snapshots for later review; or even record the presentation to a video file. Pretty handy, huh?\nWant to share a worksheet or data file to go along with your presentation? That app we just talked about also does that, without even needing the device. The app will detect who is close by, and you can just drag a file to the face of the person you want to give it to.

It\u2019s made for everyone, including professional users and serious presenters. Airbridge Lite has one feature less (it does not group broadcast) than the Pro and is made for everyday casual users. Check out this FAQ for a full breakdown between Pro & Lite - airbridge Pro vs airbridge Lite\nThe Dream & The Passion\nOur dream: We want technology to play effortlessly well with other technology. We want it to act like a silent servant \u2013 reliable, durable, and making lives easier, and in a way that's not frustrating, unnecessarily difficult or complicated to use.\nOur passion: We want to help our local economy by creating jobs in the US. Airbridge will be produced in the US, and put food on families\u2019 tables. We want to be a pioneer in local economic growth by starting a movement that will help rejuvenate other nations by inspiring other innovators and entrepreneurs to step up and step out and make a like difference in their countries. If curious, see FAQ - How and where will airbridge be made?\nWe need you\n------------ Magnetized cover for seamless closing and easy carrying ------------\nIn order to see our dream and passion come into reality we need you. Though we have prototypes built, we want to make the final version sleeker looking and more compact. Additionally, in order to complete the development and make the project production ready, we still need to finish app development, work out fabrication, design circuit boards for the final product, perform final testing, etc. Sounds like a mouth full, but all these things can be done in a matter of 4 months or less. Yet, without financial backing, none of these things can happen.\nLike our dream and passion? Awesome. We love you. But we\u2019d love you more if you helped our dream and passion become a reality by sharing this kickstarter campaign with your social network and funding our project.

It's great to know that our product is one of a kind and protected.\n9.01.12- The team has just decided to develop and produce an iClip\u2122 for the coming iPhone 5 concurrently with the iPhone 4/4S model.

Ben, Devin, and Nand here.\nThank you so much for checking out our first Kickstarter project!  We believe the iClip\u2122 is an innovative product that will find a number of uses in your everyday life.  We truly appreciate your interest and support.\nWhile driving one day, the idea came to Nand for a simple, inexpensive product that would allow someone to clip their iPhone to the visor of their car. After doing some research, he came to find that no one had yet made a product that met his criteria.\nWhen Nand approached Ben and Devin with his vision, they immediately saw the potential for much more.\nThe team has been diligently working on the design and detailing of the iClip\u2122 for several months at this point, and has produced dozens of rapid prototypes to flesh out the iClip's\u2122 simple yet versatile design.  Two months ago a limited run of 1500 iClips\u2122 was produced from a temporary mold.\nSo far, everyone who has had the chance to test an iClip\u2122 has said the same thing: \"Where can I get one of these?\"\nEarly on in the process it became apparent that we were onto something with true potential, a product that they had never seen before.  Naturally we wanted to protect it, and have recently filed applications for both utility and design patents.\nAt this point, all of the front work is done, but the team can't finish the race without your help. With the funds raised through Kickstarter, we can purchase permanent molds to begin production and international distribution.\nWhat exactly does the iClip\u2122 do?\nWell, obviously, the iClip\u2122 clips.  \nThe integrated clip allows you to attach your iPhone to a variety of objects that are less than 5/8\" (16mm) thick.  The driving force behind its design was for use on you cars sun visor to make hands-free calls.\nAnd the iClip\u2122 stands.\nThe patent pending arm design allows the iClip\u2122 to hold your phone vertically and horizontally in a standing position without using any moving parts.\nThe iClip\u2122 also reclines. \nThe patent pending design allows the iClip\u2122 to hold your phone vertically and horizontally in a reclined position.\nThe iClip\u2122 even helps to keep your headphones tidy.\nThe clips arm features an integrated wire catch which allows your headphones to be neatly stowed.\nIn how many colors is the iClip\u2122 available?\nThe iClip\u2122 will be available in five colors during it's Kickstarter campaign. We think they're pretty sweet.\nWhere can the iClip\u2122 be used?\nIn our time with the iClip we've found a multitude of uses for it, here are some of our favorites.\nIn the car; for hands-free calling.\nOn a plane; the two horizontal reclining positions are perfect for watching downloaded content or reading your favorite E Book.\nAt home; the vertical standing position is great for facetime.\nIn the office; the vertical standing position keeps your phone in plain sight so you catch all of your important updates.\nAt home; as an alarm clock stand and charging station.\nThe iClip\u2122 is awesome for air travel.\nTray tables are less than 5/8\"!\nWhere will the iClip\u2122 be produced?\nFrom the very beginning of this project, manufacturing and packaging the iClip\u2122 in the USA has been a top priority.  The team is very proud to say that this product was designed and will be manufactured in Southern California.\nDoes the iClip\u2122 support any other devices?\nThis model will only hold an iPhone 4/4S.  However, after this project is successfully funded, we have plans to produce iClips\u2122 for many other devices.  We have already designed and prototyped  iPhone 3G/3GS and iPod Touch models of the iClip.  We have plans in the future to expand our line to support the iPhone 5, iPod Touch 2, the iPad, the Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3, and several HTC smartphones.\nHow will the iClip\u2122 ship?\nPlease be sure to add the shipping costs below when making your pledge.  All iClip\u2122 orders will ship via USPS priority mail within the US and First-Class Mail International Parcel when shipping internationally. \n.  \n1-4 iClips\u2122 will ship anywhere in the US for $6 and internationally for $9. \n5-28 iClips\u2122 will ship anywhere in the US for $12 and internationally for $16.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ben Hopkins+Devin Connolly+Nand Harjani\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nBen currently works at TOMS in Los Angeles, where he designs and details environments, ranging from POP displays to full custom build outs.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "10 Days Left!", "update_content": "Seriously!

Set of custom glasses at $300k\n** please read our full update page here\nThe Porthole is a simple, beautiful infusion vessel designed by Martin Kastner of Crucial Detail design studio. The Porthole can be used to create striking cocktails, oils, teas, dressings, lemonade, coffee, or any other type of infusion.  \nNick's Lemonade\nThe Story:\nThe idea for the Porthole was born during a conversation with bar chefs preparing for the opening of the Aviary. We were discussing \"fast infusions\" -- cocktails evolving during the course of the time it takes to serve them -- and it occurred to me that what we're really looking for is a window into another world, space, and time. An image of the submarine porthole in Karel Zeman's 1958 movie 'The Fabulous World of Jules Verne' came to my mind and the design direction was set.\nSubmarine Porthole in The Fabulous World of Jules Verne.\nA small batch of the Porthole vessels was hand-crafted at Crucial Detail design studio. At the Aviary, it is used to create, display, and serve a variety of time-lapse infusions for seasonal cocktails. \nTequila Ginger Apricot cocktail at the Aviary.\nSince its debut a little over a year ago, the Porthole has gained significant attention.  Aviary cocktails displayed in the Porthole have been featured in dozens of magazines and blogs, including the cover of Food Arts magazine. \nMany Aviary guests have requested to purchase the vessel, including some who, when told they couldn't buy one, have taken it upon themselves to \u2018liberate\u2019 them from the lounge. That's when I realized that the design and functionality of the Porthole resonates strongly with people. The enthusiastic response to the piece has driven our decision to adopt the Porthole for production. \nAdaptation:\nThe technology used to produce the original small batch revolved around our in-house capabilities, utilizing methods suitable for small-scale production. The cost of each unit in the initial batch was over four hundred dollars. In order to make the Porthole more accessible, we have sought higher volume manufacturing technologies and have completely redesigned the components to achieve our target price of less than $100 dollars. The finished Porthole is dishwasher safe, durable, and easy to use. We have gone through a rigorous manufacturer selection process and identified a partner with the capacity and experience to produce the Porthole to our high standards.\nWe are now ready to pull the trigger. We've gone a long way towards our goal of bringing the project to life outside the Aviary but we're still facing a $ 28,500 investment for molds, first batch manufacturing, and associated expenses. By pre-ordering your Porthole, you help us get it off the ground.\nPlease check out the backer rewards on the right and help us make it possible to bring this artful service piece to your home.\nSpecs:\nThe Porthole holds 390ml (13 fl oz) of liquid.\nIt is made of precision ground and tempered Low Iron Glass, food grade Delrin,  food grade Silicone, and Stainless Steel.\nWhat is Included:\nOne Porthole.\nThree photo-etched stainless steel filter screens of varying densities.\nOne flexible silicone cap to seal the contents for longer term infusions.\nA set of thumbscrews that can be used as an alternative to the countersunk screws for faster assembly.\nPorthole use tips:\nThank you!\nMartin Kastner and the Crucial Detail team\nSpecial Thanks:  Lara Kastner, Grant Achatz, Nick Kokonas, Micah Melton, Christian Seel, and everyone at the Aviary in Chicago.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays!", "update_content": "Hi everyone.\nI hope you\u2019re enjoying your Portholes.

But unlike most cardholders, you can keep bills and receipts in a full-size billfold.  And it all folds up and fits easily in your front pocket.\ntriHOLD Features\nModern and compact design \nEasy access to your two favorite cards \nHigh-quality Napa leather and stainless steel clasp\nSix pockets for cards plus one ticket holder\nFull-size billfold that fits all major currencies plus receipts\nWith six cards and cash, the triHOLD is 16mm thick.

The wallet is designed to feel compact and secure in your hand and pocket.

We found an outstanding partner in China to create the triHOLD wallet. Our manufacturing partner has 12 years of leather manufacturing experience and a staff of 200 people that will hand-craft each triHOLD wallet using genuine Napa leather.  We have everything ready to go, and have received the final manufacturing samples that show exactly how triHOLD will be for customers.

But when, despite his injury, he earned the highest single score for his next dive and went on to win the Gold medal, it was among the most incredible feats in sports history.\nOlympic Champion Greg Louganis is considered by many to be the greatest diver of all time.  We are making a feature-length independent documentary about Louganis to highlight his heroic personal story. We're here on Kickstarter because we need your help to finish shooting our film!  Our goal is to get our film finished and released by 2013 -- the 25th anniversary of Greg's incredible performance in the 1988 Olympic Games.\nWe will be shooting with Greg in London in August during the Olympic Games and for a few more months this fall. We need to raise $50,000 to finish shooting. We ultimately need to raise over $300,000 to finish the film, but raising $50,000 now will allow us to keep going towards the finish line! You can be a part of this exciting project by pledging whatever you can afford.\nBACK ON BOARD GREG LOUGANIS is an engrossing story about an American legend on the cusp of a comeback. This film reveals Louganis\u2019 evolution from childhood diving prodigy to Olympic champion, and from pioneering openly gay athlete with HIV to a sometimes forgotten sports icon. His recent return to diving as a mentor to US Olympic divers competing at the 2012 London Games provides an exciting new chapter to his life-story.\nOur film is an independently-produced project.  We don\u2019t have the backing of a production company, a TV channel, or a big film studio.  We're counting on donations from people like YOU who are willing to help us bring this important story to the screen.\nWHY ARE WE MAKING THIS FILM\nGreg Louganis\u2019 story is so inspiring and his life so extraordinary -- we really wanted to watch a documentary about him to learn more. But that film didn't exist. We are in the process of changing that with BACK ON BOARD GREG LOUGANIS.  \nGreg's story is connected to so many important moments in American history including the Olympics, the AIDS epidemic, the gay rights movement, and even the recent housing crisis. His return to diving, after a long absence, gave us a natural way to tell his unique story and explore his enduring legacy. What is really great about Kickstarter is that we can share the experience of the making the film that tells this important story with others.\nOUR GOAL FOR THE FILM\nThis is a film with a message of hope and against-the-odds courage. It is a story that will inspire all those who see it.  In order to make this film a reality, we are looking to involve many of Greg\u2019s fans, documentary film aficionados, divers, athletes, and members of the LGBT community. \nWe are confident that Louganis\u2019 legacy will become even more powerful as this film travels throughout the world affecting the lives of the next generation. Louganis\u2019 life has touched, and been touched, by so many of today\u2019s important social issues; LGBT issues; HIV/AIDS; bullying; the housing crisis; dyslexia; adoption; depression; and domestic violence, to name a few. As filmmakers, we are committed to using this film to do educational outreach in connection with the distribution of the film.\nWHAT WILL THESE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nThe funds will go directly toward the making of BACK ON BOARD GREG LOUGANIS. Expenses include: \nair travel for crew and production team to shoot with Greg at events in late summer and early fall of 2012\ncamera equipment rental\nsound package rental\nhiring a camera person\nhiring a location sound recordist\ntransferring rare archival clips of Greg from his personal home video library\narchival research\nhard drives to store and back-up our footage\npaying the editor to work her magic with our extraordinary footage\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nFinishing this film is only going to be possible with your help.\nSupport our Kickstarter Campaign! \nSpread the word! Email your friends! Post to Facebook! Tweet it!\nCheck us out on the web: Facebook / Twitter / Email list\nHelp us get press about this movie and our Kickstarter campaign! Share this news w bloggers, journalists, etc!\nWHEN WILL THE FILM BE FINISHED? WHERE CAN I SEE THE FILM?\nWe are currently still in production on the film. Our goal is to submit to film festivals and secure a wide release in 2013 - the 25th anniversary of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. We will explore all distribution options including theatrical and broadcast. We plan on taking the film to film festivals around the country and beyond.  If all of our filmmaker dreams came true we'd also have a theatrical release and a national TV broadcast!  Eventually we will release the film on DVD and digitally (e.g. iTunes, Netflix, etc.). \nIS MY DONATION TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?\nDonations made via KICKSTARTER are NOT tax-deductible.

A self that has been suppressed for many \u2014 and by many \u2014 for ages. Together, we can experience the beauty of  being who you truly are.\nAbout The Film\nGENDER BLENDER: A FILM ABOUT GENDER DIVERSITY follows the life of Lauren, a person who identifies as \u201cgender neutral,*\u201d as well as the life of others who exist outside the binary gender structure of female and male. Take an intimate journey through the physical, emotional, and spiritual changes Lauren and others undergoes just to be themselves.\nSee how simple things like choosing which public restroom (or changing room) to use is a challenge and part of every day life.\nThis positive and empowering film will highlight what individuals must go through to fulfill their ultimate life-long dream: to feel comfortable and natural in their own skin. Intimately travel with Lauren and others through their extraordinary journeys and witness the beautiful lives of gender diverse individuals.\nAfter hearing \u201cour truth\u201d, you will never look at gender the same way.\n\nPlease note that there are gender neutral pronouns, such as hir/ze. These will be addressed in the film. Lauren does not mind being referred to by male, female, or neutral pronouns, although other genderqueer people have different preferences\u2026\n*Please also note: There is little consensus over the difference between terms such as agender, genderless, non-gender, gender neutral and neutrois. These terms are often used interchangeably or defined differently by individual writers in ways that do not necessarily match the self definitions of others using those terms.\nAren't there only two genders?\nWe have been conditioned to only recognize two genders: male and female (this is known as the gender binary). There are, in fact, many more genders. There are a spectrum of various gender expressions that exist beyond the binary.\nEverything in life exists on a fluid continuum\u2026 and gender is no exception.\nWhat will the money be used for?\nYour funds will go towards getting the film made and seen, from pre-production all the way to submitting it to film festivals and marketing it around the world.\nWe have assembled a talented, accomplished team that we will be introducing to in the coming weeks. It is important that this documentary be shot with broadcast quality equipment and crewed by professional camera operators, sound mixers and editors, so that it is seen by as many people as possible, used in educational settings, and presented at film festivals. Every penny of your money goes directly to the funding and distribution of this film, including:\nShooting with a professional crew\nEditing and post-production, including professional sound mastering and mixing\nClosed Captioning\nLicensing the rights to news footage and music\nLegal and production insurance\nFilm festival and registration fees and filing\nMarketing and distribution\nHow Kickerstarter Works\nKickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" platform. Therefore, each donation plays an intricate role in the making of this entire project. If we do not raise the full amount, we receive no funding... and we will be unable to document this process that we believe so strongly in. If you wish to pay with PayPal (which Kickstarter does not currently accept), click here. PayPal payments will not be added to the Kickstarter total, but we will make sure that you still receive the rewards listed for your contribution level.)\nHow Will We Use Extra Money?\nIf we raise money above our goal, we will use it to help with extra marketing and distribution. Our goal is to get this seen by as many people as possible.\nFilm Festivals\nWe intend to enter this film into the major indie and LGBT film festivals. We believes its subject matter is unique, powerful, and extremely provocative. Very few (if any) movies have documented the journey of one \"female's\" transition to become third-gender. If you are able to help with the marketing and distribution of this film, please get in contact with us at hello@genderblendermovie.com.\nFinal Words From Lauren\nI wish to share my story, experiences and life with others like me and unlike me.

They're made from the copra (coconut meat), sliced out and toasted with sugar and salt. \nThe coconut chips are: Vegan, Gluten Free, No Cholesterol, No Dairy, No MSG\nThey\u2019re versatile \u2013 they can be used as a topping for yogurt, salads, ice cream, baked goods, cereal, pancakes, and more.\nWho carries Dang?\nCurrently about 15 stores in SF, NYC, and Seattle carry our chips. See our website for a store near you.\nWe have Whole Foods waiting to get some. Chobani uses it as a yogurt topping at their retail store in Manhattan.\nWhen did Dang begin?\nA year ago we came up with the concept at the SF Underground Farmer's Market. We set out to make a recipe for Thai Lettuce Wraps, and found the toasted coconut to be irresistibly delicious! Since then, we\u2019ve designed packaging and contacted suppliers, arranged shipping from Thailand, and struck up relationships with buyers. Now we need your help to pull the trigger on our first large shipment. Up until now, we\u2019ve sold small batches to select stores, but it\u2019s time to grow!\nWe need to get a container full of chips.\nThe money will be used for:\n-       Paying for the production run\n-       Packaging, Boxes, Shipping, Warehousing\n-       Attending events to spread word about Dang \nAbout the Dang family:\nSprawled across the world, we have bases in San Francisco, New York, and Bangkok. We love food and we have multiple generations working to bring the best food in Thailand into your kitchen. \nWe believe in the 3 Cs and 4 Fs:\nFamily - We are a family company, and as such we support each other to the fullest.\nFriends - We treat our partners and customers as we would treat our friends\u2026with respect.\nFun - We're happy and we know it!\nFood - We live to eat and we love to share what we eat.\nCulture - We're aware of those things that are ingrained by one's upbringing and value the richness of diversity that exists in this wonderful world.\nCommunity - We think community is the best way to live a fulfilling life on this earth so we strive to create beautiful communities and give back to our community.\nCreativity - We're into trying new things.

We had a very successful period during pledge matching that helped bring us closer to our our $15,000 stretch goal.  With just minutes left to go in the campaign for Nekko, we would love to make it all the way to the stretch goal so that we can bring enhancements to the project like a live score and superior quality camera lenses.  Please continue to spread the word, make sure to enter our Facebook giveaway, and be sure to check out the latest update to hear a bit from all of us!\nWhat is Nekko? \nNekko is a short film being developed by a tight knit group of talented young filmmakers with experience ranging from feature films to music videos and commercials. The title of the film, \u201c\u6839\u3063\u3053\u201d, pronounced \u201cnekko\u201d, is a Japanese translation of the English word \u201croots\u201d that captures the important role that both physical and familial roots play in the film. The story, which has been in development for nearly a year, has blossomed into a passionate tale that appeals to all ages. \nStory:\n Set on a remote farm in Feudal Japan, nine-year-old Kue wishes to be free from the strict regimen of manual labor imposed by her widowed mother. When strange roots begin to overrun their crops, Kue\u2019s mother mysteriously disappears, leaving Kue to revel in her newfound freedom. She finds an unlikely friend in a magical origami hummingbird, but when the sinister roots steal her new companion, Kue decides to attempt a rescue. Descending into a subterranean world below the roots, Kue is confronted by a reality that is more complex than she ever could have imagined.\nProduction:\n The ambitious nature of this project is matched with a talented team of creatives and careful planning has gone into researching the best way to tell this story with as little artistic compromise as possible. Three sets (the house, garden, and underground lair) have been designed to be historically accurate and are currently being built. Principal photography will take place at the Marion Knott Studios using these sets. A separate mountainside location in Northern California has already been chosen as the virtual \u201csetting\u201d for the film. By building the sets to match the exact dimensions of the Northern California location, wrapping those sets in blue screen, and then shooting footage (or \u201c\u2019plates\u201d) of that mountainside after-the-fact, the visual effects artists will be able to composite the actors and sets shot in Orange County with the photography of the mountainside in Northern California. The mountainside footage will be digitally enhanced with Japanese details to fully realize this fantasy world. \n In addition to creating the setting, visual effects play a large role in other areas of the project. Kue\u2019s friend, the hummingbird, as well as many other origami creatures will be entirely computer generated and are currently in production. Bringing these original CG characters to life will require 3D modeling, animation, and compositing to be done in entirety from the ground up. These characters will seamlessly interact with live actors to produce a cohesive visual language. \nOne unique aspect of the film is an entirely animated segment which transitions Kue from the normal world to the dark and magical world of the paper roots. The animation and textures will be highly stylized to emphasize the rush of emotion that Kue feels in this sequence. We are excited to be using this mixed medium approach in order to create a more abstract and impressionistic sequence within the film. \n The production has already obtained a significant amount of resources. Access to a soundstage, camera package, lights, grip supplies, and electrical equipment, as well as insurance will be fully provided by Marion Knott Studios in September and October. On the digital side, visual effects artists are hard at work already designing characters on state-of-the-art computers utilizing the latest hardware and software. \nWhile much of the production is accounted for, there are significant costs that we do not currently have the funds to cover. First, we do not have the money to cast or compensate any of our actors. Second, without over 2000 square feet of chroma-key bluescreen, we will not be able to place our actors and sets into a virtual environment. Though the funds needed for blue screen and cast are not insignificant, the vast majority of our budgetary need is due to the high cost of materials needed for building our historically accurate and elaborate sets. Creating the physical sets for the farm, home, and underground root caves from scratch will be a massive undertaking, and though we have a full production design team consisting entirely of unpaid volunteers, the simple cost of materials is daunting. We want to create an immersive environment for the viewer, but doing so practically will not be feasible without help from the Kickstarter community.\nFrom The Director:\nWhen I was first shown an early draft of the script, what interested me the most about the story was the striking relationship between Kue and her mother. Hidden in the heart of this crazy-cool Japanese fantasy adventure was a simple story about the way our relationships change during childhood and the difficulties of growing up. After a great deal of research, we chose to set the film in Feudal Japan. I have had a fascination with Japanese culture since a young age. My parents worked for a Japanese company while I was growing up, and as a teenager I was lucky enough to do a Japanese exchange program which gave me the opportunity to live with a Japanese family on the island of Kagawa. Though my time there was brief, the value of respect and the aesthetics of simplicity left lasting impressions on me. \nOn their small farm in Feudal Japan, with no man and little money, Kue and her widowed mother are barely able to scrape by. In those times, a season's harvest could be the difference between life and death and because of this, Kue is forced to work constantly by her mother. Simultaneously, Kue\u2019s mother tries to teach Kue the skills and behaviors that will enable her to marry up out of her situation. Kue loathes what she feels is a double standard imposed by her mother and it is this resentment that burns at their relationship. It is very important to me that the film not only be universal in its message, but authentically Japanese in its content. For that reason, all of the dialogue in the film will be in Japanese and we are working with translators and advisors to ensure accuracy and artistry.\nAs both a director and cinematographer, my passion in film has always been for visual storytelling. Whether it's in the performance, framing, or editing, the magic of watching a story unfold without words or explanation is what for me separates cinema from all other media. For this reason, screenwriter Dag Shapshak and I chose to rarely utilize dialogue, focusing on progressing the story nonverbally. Dag and I have been constant collaborators for over six years now, and this project is the culmination of our work up until now. \nIt is impossible for me to discuss collaboration without introducing the incredibly talented team of young creative professionals who will be helming this project beside me. At the center of the project from its inception have been Hunter Schmidt and Phil McGuire, the visual effects supervisors. Both prodigies in the fields of 3D modeling, animation, and compositing, the two of them are responsible for bringing the magic in the story to life. Production designer Alex Lubow has an equally daunting task: building both the environments of Fuedal Japan and an entirely fantastical underground world through physical sets and props. Composer Trevor Doherty, who just recently finished his undergraduate degree in music composition from The Juliard School has collaborated with me on every film I\u2019ve ever directed. A music scholar as well as a composer, Trevor\u2019s knowledge of Japanese music combined with his talent for composing for film will be a fundamental asset to the emotional resonance of the film. As a cinematographer myself, I\u2019m looking forward to be teaming with Brian White, the most dedicated DP I've ever met. Esther Sokolow, the film\u2019s editor was on the project even before I was and she has had her finger on the story\u2019s pulse since the original inception of the concept. Finally, at the head of this beast, is producer Brandon Padveen who is responsible for making sure everything gets done (even things like this director statement for Kickstarter). As you can see, he's doing an amazing job so far. \nI couldn't be more excited to share this story and with your help I know that we can bring these paper pages to life. \n                                                                           -Mishka Kornai", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "WATCH THE FILM", "update_content": "Dearest Kickstarter Backers, \nI could not be more proud to present the completed version of our film! \nThe genesis of this project has been the longest and most laborious process I myself, or any of the other key creatives, have ever undertaken.

We hope you had a little bit of fun with our animation.\nAfter I purchased my iPad, I had to put up with missing cables, missing chargers, and having no access to my cool gadgets when I needed them the most. There was no way to organize everything in one place. I finally reached my tipping point (and my tolerance level is usually very high), so I determined that I must come up with a solution.\nFrom that point, I started prototyping an iPad pouch that could safely keep and organize all my iPad accessories and personal belongings while having the best protection for my iPad.\nIntroducing tabu tablet Pouch \n360 view of the Pouch\nMemory Foam for Maximum Protection\nSome may ask, what is it? It is high-density foam that has incredible shock absorbency. Invented by NASA to protect astronauts during rocket takeoff, now it is more widely used in beds and pillows. Are you wondering, \u201cMemory foam beds? The foam must be thick.\u201d The answer is, \u201cNope.\u201d Our pouch is light and thin, with the perfect amount of foam that protects your iPad against drops and bumps.\nhave fun with the unique memory foam texture\nWater Resistance \nThe body of the Pouch is made with polyurethane fiber which makes the Pouch durable and water resistant. It keeps the gadgets safe from rain drops and splashes. Great for beach side visits.\nTranslucent Zipper Pocket \nIt secures all your accessories in the front of the Pouch. No more digging inside your bag and searching for your small items (a hair clip, USB flash drive, or anything small). You can see them at a glance.\nMagnetic Closure for Convenience and protection\nSix industrial grade magnets secure your iPad safely inside the Pouch. The magnets are covered with memory foam, and microfiber lining protects your iPad from zipper scratches when you insert or remove the iPad from the Pouch.\nAuto screen cleaning \nYour iPad screen will be cleaned automatically by the microfiber lining when your iPad goes in and out of the Pouch. No more dirty finger prints on your screen!\nSlim design\nBack Cases and Smart Cover compatible \nWe designed the Pouch so that it will fit even if you have a back case and Smart Cover on your iPad\nWorks with Smart Cover and Back cases\nThis very simple solution saves you from a lot of hassels! Our goal is to improve everyone\u2019s experience with their iPad and accessories without sacrificing desk space and wasting precious time.\nColors\nYou can choose from two colors: blue or grey. We would love to come up with more colors for the Pouch and that\u2019s why we need your help, Kickstarters.\nFundings\nFunding Your funding is very important for us to pay for the initial manufacturing and mass manufacturing cost. We have received quotations from several different factories. It takes $5000 to order material and manufacture the Pouch at a reasonable price. In addition, we also want to expand our color collection, so all of you can be happy with a wide range of colors in the future. \nWhy can\u2019t you just buy a small pouch for your accessories? \nWhy waste money buying two carriers when you can pay a good price for just one? Also, our tabu tablet Pouch is a lot more convenient and safe to use with the extra memory foam protection. It not only gives mobility to your iPad, but it also keeps your crazy fun accessories together!\nThank You for Supporting Us! \nThank you very much for your time and money, Backers! We will start manufacturing once the project is funded.
