[{"backer": "Omote", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "TrueBlack Forge is a husband/wife duo hand-polishing solid brass and iron coins from the fictional land of Dalmere for your tabletop games and RPGs!\n\nWhile most fantasy coins fall into either the category of cheaper zinc-cast coins or expensive artisan-made collectible coins, we wanted to combine the best of both worlds: A beautiful, affordable RPG coin that also stands alone as shiny pieces of fantastical art!\n\n\nThese coins aren't cheaper zinc-cast coins that are plated, but solid metal blanks that are die-struck, just like the old fashioned way. We believe the most realistic-looking coins are ones that are made from the same materials and processes as real coins. \nEach set comes complete with a black burlap sack, and includes:\n10x Silver Bullheads\n   Solid iron, 23mm (larger than a nickel)\n  20x Silver Sails\n   Solid iron, 26mm (larger than a quarter)\n  15x Golden Bastions\n   Solid brass, 26mm (larger than a quarter)\n  10x Golden Thrones\n   Solid brass, 30mm (US half-dollar size)\n  8x Teruzine Gems\n   Glass crystal\n   3x in 18mm, 5x in 14mm\n  Every set of coins also comes with beautiful glass gems!\nEach coin was designed and illustrated for a more realistic, grounded take on traditional fantasy coinage, focusing on symbols of the people, their beliefs and values, and their history.\nThe vessel for this history comes from the fictional kingdom of Dalmere, with mottos and inscriptions written in old english.\n\nCheck out the backstory of each coin's design below!\nThese Silver Sail coins are made from pure iron.\nHeads up: Iron can rust in areas of high humidity! \n\nDalmere is fueled by the \u201cSilver Sail,\u201d its most commonly used coin. Used as an intermediary piece, the Sail is valued at 10 silver \u201cBullheads\u201d and 1/10 of a golden \u201cBastion\u201d, and is traded in innumerable quantities across the kingdom daily. Used to hire laborers, buy everyday equipment, and stock up on bulk foodstuffs, this coin is truly the backbone of a civilization. Its obverse is stamped with its namesake, a sailing ship known as a \u201ccog\u201d or \u201croundship\u201d, the hulking carriers that brought Dalmere wealth and prosperity over hundreds of years, with surrounding type roughly translated to \u201c150 years (of) endless prosperity growing from/into the ocean\u201d\n\n   The coin\u2019s reverse displays a scale for weighing and measuring goods and precious metals, a symbol of the coin\u2019s daily and everlong task of facilitating trade across the kingdom, and is stamped with the words \u201cStability/Constancy, Growth\u201d\n\n These Golden Bastion coins are made from pure brass. \n\nWhile the Silver Sail is the most commonly used coin in Dalmere, it is the \u201cBastion\u201d that reigns as the golden standard. The gold coin sets the rate at which other coins are measured, and is the basis for one \u201cgold piece.\u201d\nThe obverse is stamped with the visage of Queen Ada Dalmere, wearing the blindfold synonymous with her person. Ada, born blind in an orphanage and childhood friend to King Petrus Dalmere, has stood as the embodiment of charity, kindness, and warmth for the people of Dalmere, her face encircled with the words \u201cStrength is forgiveness\u201d and \u201cmercy\u201d.\nThe commoner\u2019s admiration for the queen has grown such that she is likened to the patron goddess of the lost and sick, Enala, whose symbol is the chalice stamped upon the reverse of the golden Bastion. There, Enala\u2019s chalice stands above the seat of Dalmere\u2019s power, Castle Gernsback, encircled with the words \u201cStrong days, Bright days\u201d.\n These Golden Throne coins are made from pure brass. \n\nThe golden \u201cThrone\u201d is Dalmere\u2019s highest minted denomination, valued at 10 golden Bastions. Always decreed to feature the head of the reigning king, the current Throne has been stamped with the visage of King Petrus Dalmere for the past 15 years, following the death of his father, King Reinnard Dalmere near the conclusion of the Sweeping Wars. A time of unrivaled expansion in exchange for an equally unrivaled cost of life, Petrus vowed to never again repeat such an age of bloody turmoil, and Dalmere has flourished in relative peace and economic growth since. His image is flanked by words translating to \u201cpledged faith\u201d and \u201cbrave deed\u201d, with abbreviations for \u201calways serving\u201d atop his crown.\nThe reverse is emblazoned with the sigil of the kingdom, the Undutta-Elk and a shield featuring a hammer. Fabled to be the war mount of choice of the first founding fathers of the kingdom, the Undutta-Elk, now extinct and a beast of legend, was famed to be the strongest and most resilient of all animals, both kind and fiercely protective. Before the reign of King Petrus, the royal sigil featured only the elk and hammer. The six-sided shield was added relatively recently upon the king\u2019s request, his symbol to signify the end of hostilities and an internal strengthening of the kingdom.\n\n These Silver Bullhead coins are made from pure iron. \nHeads up: Iron can rust in areas of high humidity!\n\nThe Silver Sail\u2019s smaller brother is the silver \u201cBullhead,\u201d the lowest denomination of Dalmere. It is most commonly used for trading the smallest of goods, meals, and favors, and is also usually the first coin a Dalmerian citizen is likely to own, particularly as a child entering the workforce.\nFounded by a people that value hard work and perseverance, the humble and strong bull was elected its namesake, bearing the weight of labor and earning the vast majority of the working people\u2019s livelihoods. This obverse also translates to \u201cStrength, perseverance\u201d.\nThe reverse is an homage to the working classes responsible for the sturdy foundation of the land: an axe for the woodsman, a hammer for the smith, and a bushel of wheat for the farmer. This side features the unusually inspiring mantra translating to \u201cGreat things start small.\u201d\n  These scintillating Teruzine gems are made from solid glass. \n\n\u201cTeruzine,\u201d discovered and primarily mined by the northern towns of Dalmere, is the most precious mineral export of the kingdom. Mount Lockett, the only known region of the continent harboring the stone, is settled at its base by the mining outposts of Carrading, Goldslode, and Lockett-Town, collectively known as the \u201cTeru-town Three.\u201d\nNot particularly hard or resilient as compared to other precious stones, Teruzine finds little utilitarian purpose. Its warm yellow coloring and highly refractive facets earn it great acclaim by jewelers and collectors, though the vast majority of its great fame and value are instead earned by its more curious property: scent.\nTeruzine, when heated at high temperature, can be ground and refined through the use of various acids and alcohols to produce an intensely warm, musky, and sweet perfume. It reportedly conjures feelings of comfort and memories of long-lost love and nostalgia. Colloquially known as \"honeystone\" for this reason, its perfumes are exported and sold across the known world. In high enough quantities and frequent enough exposure, the resulting substance can form a psychological addiction, though one that only the rich are in danger of affording.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is very low risk.

Legendary Kingdoms is a gamebook campaign, where you lead a party of adventurers in a world that adapts to your actions. Venture into ancient ruins, pick a side and lead an army into battle, sail the high seas on your own warship, defeat tyrants or restore them to power. Along the way your party will increase in skill, wealth and renown, allowing them to take on more challenging adventures. Reach the heights of power and you may uncover a dreadful threat to the world itself and go on a mission that spans all six gamebooks in the series.\nSo is this a Solo Gamebook or an RPG?\nThe Legendary Kingdoms series has been designed to be played solo, as a choose your own adventure gamebook. However, as you lead a party of four adventurers on an epic journey in a truly sandbox world, we have had playthroughs where one person has acted as the GM (Narrator) and four friends have taken on a character each.\nIt works just as well being played online as it does around a table.\nPlaytesters and backers have commented on how good this book is for someone who would love to have a go at being a GM, but are daunted by the task. With simple combat rules and the turns already written out, where better to have your first go at being a GM, than in Legendary Kingdoms.\nFollow the link below and download a free sample and give it a go.\nWe are raising funds to produce the second book in the series, Book Two: Crown and Tower. Book One is already in print, and you can buy it here, or get it as part of a pledge bundle when you order Book Two. You can also play a fully illustrated free sample of book one here to experience a little of the gamebook adventure.\n\nIn total, Spidermind Games is planning to produce six titles in the legendary Kingdoms series. With your help we can bring book two, 'Crown & Tower' to life and begin work on the next in the series. It is our plan to release one title a year, completing the collection in 2025.\nYou can explore the world of Legendary Kingdoms in any order you choose. Each book is dedicated to a particular geographic area, but you can travel between books at will by walking or sailing off the edge of the map. Each book features dozens of quests and locations with an approximate 12+ hours of content in each.\nFeatures of Legendary Kingdoms\nA world that adapts to your choices. The book \u2018remembers\u2019 the friends you make and enemies you defeat. Slain kings will stay dead, and as you grow in fame people\u2019s reactions to you will also change.\nA changing world. Depending on your choices, new avenues of adventure, or new trouble, could await you in locations you have previously explored.\nA detailed world. From the lawless deserts of the Valley of Bones, to the feudal hierarchies of the Kingdom of Royce. Embrace the wild freedoms of the buccaneering Splintered Isles, or face morbid darkness in the forges of Drakehallow.  Be the first to map the unexplored Savage Lands, or dethrone a corrupt king in the ludicrously wealthy Duchy of Pendrilor. Multi-book spanning quests allow you to further your ambitions in distant courts, and make friends in foreign nations that might help you when you visit their homeland.\nParty based adventures. You are not alone, but can combine the skills of up to four different characters in your party.\nThe game can be played solo or in a group.  It also works online with one player acting as the reader!  A good lockdown game.\nCharacters that are grounded in the Legendary Kingdoms world. Each party member has ties to a different book in the series, and each has unresolved issues in their homeland. Characters can seek redemption, seize power, exact revenge or fall in love with other party members.\nFast paced but tactical personal combat.\nRaise an army and fight mass combat battles with thousands of soldiers on each side. Conquered one realm? Transfer troops from one book to another if you can capture city-ports with access to ships.\nSail the world on your own ship. Gather an armada and defeat powerful rulers with your own fleet of warships. Or peacefully trade goods between rich ports.\nPowerful magic unlocks secrets galore! Think you\u2019ve completely explored an area? Discover the Shadow Door spell and find hidden paths in old dungeons. Learn how to Teleport and access areas impossible to find without magic. Bypass a foe\u2019s defences by using Teleport Circle to appear inside their fortress, allowing you to rob them blind.\nForge magic items with magical weaves. Raise armies with gold bullion.

These region books each have a more detailed, zoomed-in version of the map. Every location on the map can be reached, either on foot, by sea or by magical transportation (if you possess such a power). You can go back and forth between books at will \u2013 just walk or sail off the edge of the map.\nBook 1: The Valley of Bones takes place in a desert wilderness where tyrant kings oppress the teeming masses in a land strewn with ancient artefacts and ruins. But their grip on power is fragile \u2026 and the citizenry are ripe for revolution. It is a land of blood and sand, where civilisation is rare and terrible beasts roam freely.\nBook 2: Crown and Tower takes place in the high-medieval realm of Longport Bay, torn apart by the struggle for power between two noble families. Baron Baldwin Dayne lies dying, and his children must grasp the mantle of power, or see their family destroyed forever. Ancient ruins await plunder and exploration, and savage armies hang on the borders, waiting for the county to weaken itself with its incessant warring. Glittering steel, the flash of long forgotten magics, and terrible monsters all wait to be found as you build your strength for the final confrontation.\nBook 3: Pirates of the Splintered Isles is set in a tropical paradise, where competition for spice has the great powers of the world vying for domination.\nBook 4: The Gilded Throne covers the duchy of Pendrilor, seat of the corrupt king of Royce. Wealth drips from its ports, but it is blind to an encroaching threat which could see it wiped from the globe!\nBook 5: The Savage Lands is set in an untamed wilderness, unmapped by civilised realms. A terrible secret lurks in its forgotten grottos and sky-touching mountains.\nBook 6: Drakehallow is a gas-powered hell of furnaces and sorcery. The population cram into over-packed, crumbling cities for fear of encountering the monstrous creations of their depraved industry. \nMore Art\nWe are commissioning 20 more pieces of art for the book including a more detailed pictorial journey through the city of Longport Bay.\n \u2018The Sonderleign Drops\u2019\nA brand new stand alone adventure.\n\u201cThere is something I desire, but it is located in a place my conventional agents will not go. Deep in the woods to the northwest are the Sonderleign Drops, the ruins of a fantastic underground city. Many have attempted to excavate and explore it in the past, but even the largest expeditions have failed.\u201d\nThis adventure is on top of a book, already with more that 900 references and will test your team but the rewards are well worth it.\u201d\nYet More Art\nTravelling the County of Longport Bay this art expansion creates more images of the rich and diverse land you are exploring.\n\n\u2018Missing, Presumed Dead\u2019\nA second brand new adventure takes your team on a mission to find an important officer of the crown who has gone missing. This particular man is a clerk at the seigneurial office. Its role is to determine which nobles own which piece of land, which family members are permitted to inherit titles, and what legal privileges the ownership of certain noble ranks grant in tax and trade law. It is pretty dry stuff, but the decisions of the seigneurial office can ruin lesser families or provoke war between greater ones.\nWhere is he and why did he suddenly disappear?\nProduction Upgrade\nCollectors Edition:-\nIt was suggested that we have dust covers for the collectors editions, so that these premium copies of the Legendary Kingdoms series can enjoy the same amazing cover art that the softbacks do. We loved the suggestion and so as soon as this stretch is hit we will include dust covers on all current and future current and future volumes of the LK Collectors Edition.\nSoftback Edition:-\nHaving spoken to the printers the book will now with thicker more sturdy paper but at no extra cost. This upgrade will extend the life of the book and give the pages a smoother feel and a crisper print.\n\u2018Maw of Abraxas\u2019\nYou are wandering the bleak Mawlands, an area of scrubland just north of the Salvar Rise, a chain of mountains that shields the county of Longport Bay from the Savage Lands to the south.\nThe area gets its name from the terrifying cave network known as the Maw of Abraxas, which plunges into the mountain foothills. It has a terrifying reputation as a place of death, although rumours persist of great treasures hidden away in its secret vaults.\nTempted?\nEven More Art\nGetting to know the characters more with extra art covering even more of the key moments in your adventures.\nBookmark Ribbon and a Character Sheet Upgrade\nAnother great suggestion from our backers is the very useful page holder ribbon and it would be our pleasure to be able to include this in every Collectors Edition copy.\nWe have also taken a look at the free character sheet everyone can download as a pdf and decided it need the same art upgrade as the maps. We will show off the new and improved version here on the updates when it has been complete.\nA Brand New Adventure, played live on our Facebook Group.\nPlay Legendary Kingdoms with players across the world on Facebook!  If this target is reached, Legendary Kingdoms author Oliver Hulme will create a unique adventure that will update on Facebook every week.  Players worldwide will help in designing party members, and will jointly decide what actions to take that week via Facebook polls.\nCreate your own characters or choose from six adventurers with their own deep backstory in the world, each of whom have personalised quests and interactions with the plot. Your characters can gain special powers, fall in love, seek revenge, become lords and ladies and encounter friends, family and enemies from their youths. Each of the six starting characters were brought up in a different part of the world, and all have their own special quests to resolve in their homeland.\n(or Nitty-gritty)\nLegendary Kingdoms uses a success-based dice system for skill checks and combat. Each party-member has a skill value in each of the five main skills of the game (Fighting, Stealth, Lore, Survival and Charisma). Each skill point allows you to roll a single die. Sar Jessica Dayne, for instance, has a Fighting skill of 5, which means she can roll 5 dice whenever she makes any Fighting skill checks. Your party will either make skill-checks individually, if they are separated, or as a team if more than one person can help with a check.\nYour skills can improve through experience or by finding special items. Find a steel longsword (Fighting +2) and you can improve your Fighting skill by 2, for instance. As you play, you will have to decide if you want your party-members to specialise in certain skills, or have them generally improve all their skills. Both ideas have merit. Specialisation is powerful when you are working as a team \u2026 but if your party has an argument or someone wanders off on their own, you might prefer it if everyone was equipped to handle everything. Just like real life, you won\u2019t always be able to count on your friends being around all the time!\nThe game keeps track of events through the use of codes. Save an old man and his family from the city guards and you might gain the code A15. Every so often, the book will ask you if you have a code. Having the code A15 will stop you from constantly encountering old men being hassled by the city guards every time you walk down the street!\nThe best way to see how the game works is by playing it. You can download the Kickstarter sample here.\nFree PDF Quickstart\nIf you have ever played Fighting Fantasy or Choose Your Own Adventure books, you have the basic idea of what a gamebook looks like. In terms of how it plays, it is quite similar structurally to Fabled Lands by Dave Morris & Jamie Thomson. That book series also featured a number of connected books that you could wander between at will. Long term, Legendary Kingdoms feels quite similar to Sorcery by Steve Jackson, in that it has a grand quest, sorcery is rare and powerful, and there is a final goal to achieve. There is also just a whiff of Way of the Tiger by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, mainly through Akihiro and his quest for enlightenment.\nLegendary Kingdoms itself is a zero to hero narrative. You begin as penniless slaves, and end the game becoming great generals who make or break the future of the world based on your actions. The main difference with games like Sorcery or Destiny Quest is that you decide the order you want to do it. There are many ways into the main super-plot of the books, and different parties will experience different routes in. Forgive us for being cryptic \u2026 but we don\u2019t want to ruin the plot!\nThat said, each book is also very self-contained. There are several dozen independent quests, one \u2018book quest\u2019 which involves the epic clash of armies, one character quest, where the history and goals of one of the pre-generated characters is explored in depth, and a number of minor party-member events. These minor events allow your party members to fall in love, become enemies, save each other\u2019s lives, or just give each other time to shine.\n\"I enjoyed the preview so much that I purchased the pdf of Book 1 to keep playing!\" \n- Emma\n\n\"Loving the sample book - really high quality while still retaining that \u2018retro\u2019 feel.\"\n- Simon\n\n\"I downloaded the demo and then played it. I was hooked and quickly bought volume 1 in pdf. Thanks for the great book! I love it!\" - Gerard\n\n\"I've played the sample and I love it. It reminds me the \"choose your own adventure\" books from my childhood, but on steroids.\" - Diego\n\nThis crowdfunding campaign aims to raise the funds to produce book 2 of the Legendary Kingdoms gamebook series.\nThe campaign will run for 30 days and as soon as the campaign closes we will begin production of Crown & Tower. By backing this project you are agreeing to have your card charged with the amount you pledge at the project end, which is Thursday 15th April.\nFollowing the end of the campaign, usually a few weeks later, we will send you a post campaign survey where you will confirm your pledge level (and get a chance to upgrade if you wish), give us your address details and settle the postage. If you have ordered both books in the softcover form, you will be given the option of splitting the postage and being sent book 1 straight away and then book 2 when production is complete (estimated to be September).\nThis process will have you making two payments, the first for the pledge, a charging process handled by Kickstarter which will happen on or around 15th April, and then the second for postage and any upgrades, which is handled by the company sending you the survey. For this campaign we will be using a company called Backer Kit.\nSo how do I make a pledge?\nAt the top of the campaign page you will see the green \u201cBack this project\u201d button. Alternatively, you can scroll down to select a reward tier.\nAfter selecting the tier you wish to pledge for, check the amount being pledged and select 'continue' to proceed.\nYou will then be taken through to the payments page where you\u2019ll be prompted to enter your payment details. To complete your pledge, click the green \u201cPledge\" button and you\u2019ll be all set!\nYou should receive a confirmation email to confirm that you are now a backer of the project. As long as we are successfully funded, your card will be charged when the campaign ends.\n\nMarketed & Promoted by  \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox, the tech marketing company behind many successful Kickstarters. We use heavy technology to help creators maximize their projects and ROAS.\nMore than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSpidermind Games has run several successful Kickstarter campaigns, building a product list based on quality and a community based on communication. \n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur, IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control. Industrial action, acts of God, fire and flood, ash clouds from volcanoes, global pandemics as well as plague and pestilence are just some of the issues and problems that might occur that we have no control over.\n\nWe have, however, already added in \u2018stretch\u2019 room, additional time for each section of the project to be completed and will keep the delivery dates and other deadlines updated on the KS page as well as through our social media channels. We will work hard to ensure all your queries are answered in a timely fashion.\n\nWe pride ourselves on being open and honest with all out Kickstarter campaigns. We have chosen a superb team to support us in this project who want this campaign to become as much a reality as we do. This being said many of our team are sub-contractors working for several clients at the same time. Sometimes this leads to parts of our production process working slower than we had planned or forecast. If this happens, we will let you, the most important people in this project, know what has happened and what we intend on doing about it.\n\nIn essence we commit to keeping our backers updated to any changes or developments when they happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Crown & Tower Classic Paperback Edition", "descp": "You will receive one, classic paperback copy of Crown & Tower, book 2 of the Legendary Kingdoms gamebook series.\nYou will also receive all relevant unlocked stretch goals.\nCrown & Tower paperback edition measures 204mm wide by 250 mm high and 10mm thick", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["287 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a335 or more", "title": "Both Books - Softback Bundle", "descp": "You will receive two classic paperback copies; One each of The Valley of Bones and Crown & Tower, books 1 & 2 in the Legendary Kingdoms gamebook series.\nYou will also receive all relevant unlocked stretch goals.\nEach paperback edition measures 204mm wide by 250 mm high and 10mm thick.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["2,785 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a360 or more", "title": "Crown & Tower Special Collectors Edition", "descp": "You will receive one, special edition, individually numbered, hardback copy of Crown & Tower, book 2 of the Legendary Kingdoms gamebook series.\nAdded to this you will receive a Kickstarter Exclusive Crown & Tower 'Character' piece of artwork from the hand of Robin Smith, artist and illustrator for Legendary Kingdoms.\nPlus 2 deluxe character sheets for both books.\nAnd to complete the bundle you will receive a fold out Legendary Kingdoms World Map and local maps for both The Valley of Bones and Crown & Tower.\nYou will also receive all relevant unlocked stretch goals.\nCrown & Tower special edition hardback copy measures ????", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["73 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Both Books - Collectors Bundle", "descp": "You will receive one hardback copy of each of the first two books in the Legendary Kingdoms series.

They built a vast city and mined the earth for its wealth. The dwarves, led by House Stoneborn and taught by their god Thaneduhr, forged artifacts and weapons of unparalleled craftsmanship. Under the mountains they grew and flourished. The dwarves befriended the first humans to settle the region and trade allowed both races to prosper.\nIn time, Gundgathol came under siege - not from above, but from below. The duergar, or gray dwarves, in a coordinated attack, infiltrated the city from deep subterranean tunnels. Jealous of the mountain dwarves' wealth, the duergar and their dark allies pushed House Stoneborn out of their ancestral home. The remaining dwarves retreated to the human settlement of Hamelet and vowed their revenge. In the centuries that followed, the dwarves sent warbands into the mountains, but only a handful returned. Those who did told tales of great sorrow. The majesty and grandeur of the city, the cradle of dwarven civilization, was now a bleak, half-drowned dungeon overrun with evil monsters. Today, only the dwarves refer to their sacred homeland as Gundgathol. The people of the Northern Reaches simply call it --- Dwarrowdeep.\nSome say there is more to this story than meets the eye. Some say House Stoneborn keeps a dark secret known only to the dwarves...\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to explore the long dark of Dwarrowdeep? \nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure for the Old School Renaissance and the Fifth Edition of the World's Most Popular Role-Playing Game. Dwarrowdeep represents the fourth in a massive six-part megadungeon adventure series never before undertaken in the history of fantasy role-playing games.\nThe OSR Labyrinth Lord edition can be played with any TSR rule-set from the 70s/80s/90s, or inspired by them, such as Original Edition, B/X, First or Second Edition, OSRIC, Old School Essentials, or Swords and Wizardry without conversion. The adventure is designed to support low-to-high level play within a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 260-290 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover). The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia my follow-up project, was 293 pages. Like my other megadungeons, Dwarrowdeep will provide PDF poster maps in both black and Old School blue.\nDwarrowdeep begins with a gazetteer that outlines the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history of the dwarves as well as detailing the town of Hamelet - the base of operations for the campaign. The dungeon proper will be levelled in a traditional style, albeit with twists and surprises. You can expect new spells and magic items, special monsters, pregenerated characters, new races, and rival adventuring parties. Dwarrowdeep merges my own unique vision (one that has never been realized in a dwarven-themed adventure) with inspiration drawn from J.R.R. Tolkien and classic adventures like Shrine of the Kuo-Toa and The Night Below.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so all those in the United States and abroad should take note of currency conversion savings. If you are unfamiliar, the conversion for 2021 to date is $1.00 USD = 1.22 CAD (citation: bankofcanada.ca).\nTherefore a $70 CAD pledge = approximately $55 USD.\nHere are some past layout samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect in Dwarrowdeep:\nSample format from Barrowmaze Complete\nOld school adventures should celebrate the origins of the hobby while also charting a path forward. The classic fantasy gaming experience isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in my approach to design and commitment to premium artwork.\nJust like Barrowmaze, Forbidden Caverns, and HighFell, Dwarrowdeep will place an emphasis on outstanding old school art. I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, Russ Nicholson, and Tim Truman. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Dave Needham, Kennon James, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Stephen Thompson, and others. Similar to past projects for Labyrinth Lord, every creature in the monster section will have its own illustration (Forbidden Caverns, for example, had over 100 monsters). \nIn terms of mapping, those of you with a close eye will notice my adventures are slowly filling in an old school wilderness game map that serves as the basis of my Northern Reaches homegame (we affectionately call it...Greghawk). Dwarrowdeep continues this tradition as a tip-of-the-cap to Gygax's original campaign.\nKennon James and Dave Needham have created some fantastic preliminary illustrations to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the monsters.\nDuergar Dwarf by Kennon James\nCyclopsman by Kennon James\nThe Town of Hamelet by Dave Needham\nAll hardcover books, except Dwarrowdeep, will ship (and pdf codes emailed) after Kickstarter funds have cleared. Dwarrowdeep will ship upon completion no later than August 2022. I normally provide updates monthly or every other other month, subject to developments.\nLike my other projects Dwarrowdeep will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, have old school charm, cool coffee-table appeal, and be super fun for your gaming group. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with my past projects, you already know what to expect.\nAs part of this kickstarter project, and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of my first session of Barrowmaze in my home campaign, I\u2019ve created a new monochrome cover for Barrowmaze Complete. The book will have a foreword by Grognardia author James Maliszewski that will contextualize Barrowmaze within the history of the OSR. Artist Stefan Poag illustrated both the front and back cover, including homages to characters we established as iconics within the pages of previous iterations:\nBarrowmaze Complete 10th Anniversary Special Edition\nHighFell: The Drifting Dungeon\nThe Forbidden Caverns of Archaia\nThe Forbidden Caverns of Archaia 5E\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am a Professor of Popular Culture in Ontario, Canada and winner of the 2018 Three Castles Award for Role-Playing Game Design. I teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games. I am also the author/designer of three popular Old School megadungeons called Barrowmaze Complete, The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia, and HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon. All three of these massive adventures are available in Fifth Edition.

But there was always darkness about her.

Lady Ingrade obsessed about the adventurers that rode across the countryside unhindered. Grave robbers, all of them. That's when the crypt construction began.\nLady Ingrade feared a filthy group of adventurers would violate her in death. She compulsively built crypts to lure in tomb raiders and dispatch them with deadly traps and creatures.\nUpon her death, the wealth she accumulated was not found. Presumed to be dispersed throughout her many crypts or hidden within her true, final resting place. No one is sure what's within the crypts. Those that enter, do not return.\n\nWhich Ruleset?\nOld School Essentials. \n\nWhat's Inside the Zine?\nThis is a series of adventures focused on Lady Ingrade's crypts. Some are linked and some are stand alone, 'found' locations. A referee can easily insert these adventures in their campaign or be used as one-shot adventures. I'm guessing the page count will be a minimal of 24 pages, but more in the 32 to 36 page range. \n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nPDFS will be fulfilled by coupons through DriveThruRPG.\nPrint copies will ship USPS. This year I plan to print using Mixam. As much fun as I had last printing all the zines at home, I thought I would share the fun this year. \n\nThe Team\nJason Sholtis created the art for The Many Crypts of Lady Ingrade. Jason was also the first artist I ever worked with back in 2011, when he drew the cover for the first issue of The Manor. His art never fails to impress.\nRob Conley drew all the maps for The Many Crypts of Lady Ingrade. I\u2019ve been friends with Rob since the 80\u2019s. He draws amazing maps and is best known for the maps he recreated for Judges Guild.

Duard seeks power here\u2014legends say that the elves of the tower keep a dark power hidden there\u2014immortality and weird magical abilities granted to the one who performs the rituals to unlock them. \nFor centuries, the elves of this region have been custodians of the Tower of Shadow. Their charge has been to keep its ancient magic hidden from those who might use it in the name of chaos\u2014the ability to harness the powers of the Shadow Plane. To become shadow itself.\nSince the assault, the denizens of the surrounding forest, including the more monstrous creatures\u2014trolls and giant spiders\u2014 have fled from the vicinity of the tower and into the nearby mountains, causing problems for settlers of the region\u2014including the residents of the peaceful dwarven town of Karn Buldahr. The town council has sought aid from any willing adventurers to help deal with the attacks.\n\nBugbear Attack!\nIn the Shadow of Tower Silveraxe is a 52 page (not including cover) adventure module zine designed for use with the Old School Essentials or Basic/Expert classic fantasy rules. It's old-school in both flavor and design mindset\u2014weird and fantastic pulp adventure. Not all encounters are balanced and survival is not a guarantee. \nThe zine contains a detailed map of the Gemthrone wilderness, seven dungeons, and four settlements including the dwarven town of Karn Buldahr\u2014 which can serve well as a starting location for lower level adventurers. Each settlement has its own list of rumors, hooks, and NPCs.\nIt is designed as a module. Use it as a standalone campaign, graft it onto your existing campaign wherever you find mountainous wilderness, or drop in any of the dungeons as a one-shot. \nAlso, the layout is designed with clarity and usability in mind. Dungeon maps are easy to read and their corresponding room descriptions and relevant monster stats are placed so that they are all on the same spread\u2014less page flipping, less time prepping!\ntldr:\n52 interior pages \nTopographic wilderness overland map\n7 dungeon locations\n4 settlement locations with hooks and NPCs\nSetting and local faction lore\nAdditional rules for more simple and dynamic weather\nBelow are a few examples of what's inside.\nCover mockup\nMock up of a 2-page spread of one of the dungeons in the module.\nThe Dwarven town of Karn Buldahr.\nThe contour overland map for the Gemthrone Wilderness region.\nCloseup view of a section of the overland map\nThe map is done in the style of a topographic wilderness hiking map, complete with elevation, contours, vegetation density, relief shading, water features, and trail mileage noted to the 1/10 of a mile! All this detail is so the referee can accurately describe the surroundings, precise travel times, and adjudicate exploration should the players decide to take a different route. In addition, a 6-mile hex grid overlay will help if they want to go off trail or if you prefer running a hex-crawl  style games. \nCrab Spider Attack! Art featured in the zine.\n\nAll of the art, cartography, and layout design are done by me. The only art left to complete is the interior art which will come as either smaller filler art and a couple (maybe more) larger full page pieces in black and white. The art will be thematic to the content of the zine and invoke older-era RPG-ness in my style. I usually work traditionally with pen (and brush) and ink\u2014except for the cover art, which I digitally painted. \n My Instagram \n\n\n\nI have set July as the expected delivery date, but I expect to have it out sooner than that.

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

This campaign did far more than we ever expected and we owe it all to you. So from us to you, a kindly Thank You! Lots of work to do, but we've already plunged in!\nJoin the Road to Adventure with the Castles & Crusades Players Handbook, the Adventurers Spellbook, the Players Archive! \nWith Iron Heel, the World Grinds Away\nPlunge into worlds of fantastic adventure where dragons lie and the undead stalk the shades of your mind's imaginings, where creatures of legend plunder wealth through the horror of their passage. Monsters grim and foul taunt with the ecstasy of gold and glory. Upon the heels of these foes stalk heroes of great might; those who take up sword and shield, who harness eldritch might, those who traverse the narrow corridors in search of sport, and those who serve a purpose greater than all the others: Heroes, Freebooters, Mercenaries, and Adventurers. \n\nBEFORE WE CONTINUE: Back in March, after Covid hit, we released the digital PDF of the C&C Players Handbook, 7th printing, offering it to everyone stuck at home for free. If you want to check it out. You can download it here and see what all the fuss is about.\nYou have to be asking yourself if we are on the 8th printing, what's new?  As many of the older C&Cers know we pledged to keep the game the same, no new editions, way back with the release of the 1st printing. We've done that. The Players Handbook, 8th printing stays the same, EXCEPT, we are overhauling the layout and including a new cover and all-new interior art! The cover below is by Jason Walton. As you can see, it's going to be something else! \n\nA Game That is Yours to Command\n                                                 Castles & Crusades is a fantasy role-playing game with countless possibilities. The C&C Players Handbook allows you to take up the sword and shield, the staff or bow; to arm yourself as you desire and wander upon planes of your own imagination to reap the harvest of adventure. \nDesigned for use with multiple players, Castles & Crusades puts you in charge of the adventure path. Included within are all the rules of play, how to get started in your very own role-playing game, how to run the game and play in it. \nIts easy to learn attribute-based rules system allows players to choose among 13 archetypal character classes and 7 races to create their characters. Spells, equipment, fast-paced combat rules, and all essential information needed to play a game of Castles & Crusades are in this book. \nThe Players Handbook, 8th printing. This will be a 196 page hardcover, full-color book. It will retail for $39.99.\nIn the last 16-17 years, Castles & Crusades has grown immensely. We have dozens of sourcebooks to expand your play, two world settings, several mini settings, and adventures piled up everywhere. With that some of our material has become a bit scattered.

Along with providing details, the supplement contains rules for adapting the material to the Swords & Wizardry RPG and other classic editions of the original roleplaying game. \nSince then, I have continued to run campaigns and now have enough material and rules to release a new series of supplements. The supplements together will function as their own system, useful as a tool for running many different types of fantasy campaigns. They will also function as individual supplements to the Swords & Wizardry RPG and other RPGs based on the classic editions. \nThis reflects the reality that most fantasy campaigns based on the classic editions are a kitbash of different elements that the referee finds useful. So rather than try to compete with the large number of excellent RPGs targeting the classic editions, I decided to format my take in a way that supports kitbashing. While I hope people will enjoy the system I created as a whole, I expect most will pick out just the parts they are interested in, whether it is classes, monsters, or magic items. \nHowever, there needs to be something that ties these different elements together. A supplement that explains and illustrates how these rules work together as a complete system. To this end, I wrote The Basic Rules For The Majestic Fantasy RPG. It covers the traditional four classes of burglar, cleric, fighter, and magic user from levels 1 to 5 along with details on spells, equipment, and combat rules. It also supports the referee by including a list of monsters, NPCs, and magic items for a fantasy campaign. It ends with two sections of referee advice on how I use the elements of the classic editions to construct the rules and to make new rulings to cover the fantastic and unexpected things that players will attempt as their characters. Then it explains how to use the included material to bring the world outside the dungeon to life. \nTable of Contents Preview \nMajestic Fantasy RPG Basic rules cover.\nNote: The art has not been finalized.\nThis is one part of this Kickstarter. The other part is a series of printed (or PDF) aids that I use to allow people to quickly generate characters using these rules. This aid is in the form of printed cards or tiles. There is an initial card that you hand the player that outlines how the character generation process works. From there, the players pick a class, a background, and buy equipment using the individual cards as a reference to fill out their character sheet. I have refined this over the past decade while running convention and game store sessions and found that it will allow a player to completely generate a character within 15 to 20 minutes. \nThe print + pdf level will include a print option for these cards. However given DriveThruRPG's print prices it is not a cost effective option compared to just buying cardstock and printing what you need at home from the PDF. See the print cost section further down.  The print option will contain 5 copies of the common card and 3 copies of the cards for each class. There is a total of 20 cards.\nmagic user card front\nThis Kickstarter will be offering a set of these cards for the Basic Rules Of The Majestic Fantasy RPG. There will be five copies of each type of card to cover an entire table of players. Finally, all levels of this Kickstarter will also include a complimentary coupon for a printed copy of my Blackmarsh setting which is compatible with these rules.  \nThe Majestic Fantasy Realms\nThis Kickstarter also marks the beginning of expanded support for the Majestic Fantasy Realms, the setting that is behind Blackmarsh, Points of Light, and Points of Light II: The Sunrise Sea. Both of PoL books are published by Goodman Games. \nPrior to acquiring the license that led to my Majestic Wilderlands supplement, I was creating a version of my setting without the Judges Guild IP. This work made it into both Points of Light books as well as Blackmarsh. Since the license is ending, I am resuming work on this material and am planning to release more books detailing the inhabitants and realms that I have created. Additional setting details will also be found in the supplements I will be making for the Majestic Fantasy RPG to illustrate the rules. Look for the first standalone Majestic Fantasy Realm product, The Wild North, in a few months.\nTo follow what I do on my other projects along with tips and commentary on the RPG hobby please head over to the Bat in the Attic blog.\nOpen Content\nAll materials except for the art and trademarks will be released as open content under the Open Game License in the form of art-free editable documents. This includes the quick character generation cards.  \nINFORMATION ON PRINT COUPONS\nThe printed version of the rules and cards will be released using Print on Demand at DriveThruRPG. Everyone selecting a print reward will receive a coupon that they can redeem for their own print copy. The cost of this coupon will be equal to the base price that DriveThruRPG charges plus 50 cents. The extra 50 cents are so that your purchase will register as a sale for DriveThruRPG rankings. The pledge price for the print reward level has been adjusted downward accordingly.\nThe estimated print costs from DriveThruRPG are\nThe Basic Rules for the Majestic Fantasy RPG - $3.75 to $4.50.\nThe Quick Character Generation Cards - $9 to $11. \nFor shipping I tested a few addresses and found the following estimates\nThe Basic Rules for the Majestic Fantasy RPG - $4.50 to $5.50 US, Canada, & Europe.\nThe Quick Character Generation Cards - $5.75 to $6 US, $13 to $16 Canada & Europe.\nIn addition be advised that shipping cards is separate from shipping books. This means that you will be making two orders with two shipping charges. This is due to the fact that DriveThruRPG prints the cards in-house while the books are provided through Lightning Source outside of the company.  And please read the below.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The cards from DriveThruRPG are printed on 8\" by 10\" card stock  with a low-gloss UV Coating. While sturdy, it is not as cost effective as printing at home on card stock bought locally especially if you live in Canada or Europe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have released nearly a dozen products over a decade using the same distribution model of PDF and Print on Demand coupons.

But now, the projects I envision have a more substantial word count and require more upfront investment, particularly in editing. To cover these costs, I am turning to Kickstarter. \n\nThe writing is done on both portions of this project: the quick character generation cards and the basic rules. The rough draft of both these will be available during and after the Kickstarter. \n\nThis mitigates but doesn't eliminate the risks that either the cover artist, editor, or I doing the layout will not be able to see the job through.

Shelves groan with the weight of clay jars, glass containers, parchment scrolls, boxes of rare minerals, and ancient books forbidden to own. This is the mysterious domain of the alchemist, and now the secrets of this venerable craft are opened before you for use in your 5th edition D&D game. A Pathfinder 1.0 version will be made as a print on demand softcover option (upgrades to hardcover at 250 sold). No leather editions will be made of the Pathfinder Tome of Alchemy.\nPlayers and game masters both can use the mysteries of alchemy to expand options for adventuring and adventure design. This masterful work by Courtney Campbell explores all aspects of the venerable craft of alchemy and weaves it into the structure of the world's most popular fantasy role-playing game!\nNot only does this Kickstarter offer the Tome of Alchemy itself, but backers also have the option to purchase the Deck of Mysterious Creations, a card-based system for tracking and developing alchemical experiments. The cards are system-neutral.\nWhat's in the Book?\nThe Basics of Alchemy: Alchemists use specialized systems of code inherited from their mentors. Their methodology, like that of spellcasters, is  individualized, didactic, empirical, and arbitrary.\nMaterials and Essences: Tome of Alchemy describes the raw materials of item creation, from basic minerals to specialized equipment for the laboratory.\nAlchemical Items: Even the still-mundane work of master alchemists can be of great use in the right hands, and highly destructive when they fall into the hands of problematic individuals (such as the average character!). A variety of incenses, ointments, pastes, powders, solvents, and tinctures are included for you to build a richly detailed world. Grenades are included so the characters can blow it up.\nMagic Items: The highest use of alchemy (and the most profitable) is to provide the basics and the methodology for creating many different kinds of magical items. This section is the largest in the book, describing hundreds of formulae for the enhancement and creation of armor, weapons, miscellaneous magic items, and ... of course ... potions.\nSpells: The relationship between alchemy and true magic is complex and deadly. Tome of Alchemy explains various ways in which alchemy and spell-casting may be combined to heighten the effects of traditional magic.\nTome of Alchemy offers resources for every gaming need:\nHundreds of new magic and mundane items with recipes to craft them\nRules for brewing potions\nDozens of new spells\nA system for harvesting alchemical reagents for use in new alchemical recipes (or to be sold by the party's rogue on the black market)\nA detailed alchemical research-system\nA salvaging system for recovering reagents. After all, you don't want to have to hunt down a second lich just to get the dust you were supposed to collect.\nAppendices detailing alchemical mishaps, providing a list of adventure hooks, and containing other useful information for alchemists.\nThe Deck of Mysterious Creations is a system-neutral deck of cards that can be used to combine ingredients, essences, and reagents according to certain rules, and determine the result. The Deck is integrated with the Tome of Alchemy, but does not require the Tome for use (nor does the Tome require the deck).\nThere are 2 types of ingredient cards and 3 types of essence cards (representing levels of the essence's crafting power). Various ingredients the characters might collect during the game can be tracked using the cards, and when the time comes for experimentation, the cards allow the results of their alchemical research to be determined.\n\n\nThe Deck of Mysterious Creations contains the following:\nReagent cards allow an interactive gaming procedure for tracking reagents throughout play.\nEach reagent card has unique artwork depicting a magical ingredient.\nCards are provided to brew recipes in the Tome of Alchemy!\nThe Tome of Alchemy 5e  ($55 hardcover book and PDF, $200 leather book and PDF)\nPathfinder Print on Demand Tome of Alchemy Softcover* ($56 softcover book and PDF)\nInternational Print on Demand Tome of Alchemy Softcover ($57 softcover book and PDF)\nDeck of Mysterious Creations ($12 PDF, $25 Deck of Physical Cards and PDF)\n *Once backers have selected pledge rewards exceeding 250 Pathfinder Print on Demand Softcover books they will all be upgraded to Hardcover library bound copies free!

This stretch goal is measured by the count of the $56 and $76 pledges only.\n$35,000 - We will add a PDF that allows you to print a \"playmat\" for tracking alchemy cards while research is in progress.\n$40,000 - We will add a big ol\u2019 tuckbox, to house and transport your alchemy cards.\n$45,000 - We will add three additional Alchemy Cards that will be exclusive only to folks that backed this Kickstarter. These special cards may or may not resemble  Necromancer Game staff. \n$50,000 - We will add an additional 10 magic items to the book plus 1 more exclusive Kickstarter Alchemy card.\n$55,000 - We will add an additional 10 magic potions to the book plus 1 more exclusive Kickstarter Alchemy card.\n1,000 Backers - We will make plans for a future crowdfunding project for another set of cards.\n(locked) $65,000 - We will give all backers 5 preview magic items from a forthcoming book when they become available.\nAll Frog God Games and Necromancer Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a  hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email us and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email us anyway and we will hook you up in some way).\nYou will be receiving a kickstarter survey to finalize your address and contact information. We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. \nInitial digital fulfillment is a three-step process that is completed using your Frog God Games web store account. If you do not have an account you will need to create on the Frog God Games website to get your digital rewards  The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using one or more coupon codes we provide. Codes will be sent via email to backers at the email address provided in the Kickstarter survey. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. \nIf you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nWhen our website fulfillment page for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nImportant News to Non-US Customers postage rates for the non-POD version of this book may be extremely high due to the rates charged by the US Postal system for international shipping. Other shippers such as FedEx are even more expensive. Please keep this in mind. Estimates are that current high postage rates may increase 150-300% because of complications from the Pandemic. \nImportant note on Tariffs. Yep \u2014 we just got smacked with 7.5% tariffs on all hardcover books. We talked internally, and decided we would only raise prices by 5%, and would absorb the other 5% (e.g. $55 instead of $60). If these get resolved or erased, we will lower prices once again.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw, or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds: If for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter and Paypal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNecromancer Games is financially backed and owned by Frog God Games.

That's not their main purpose, though -- the main purpose of the monster cards is to track the presence of the \"vital essences.\" The vital essences are described in the Alchemy book, and they are key to most categories of alchemical items.

Backers vote on which goals to work toward next. \nDue to the overwhelming response to the Dice Miner campaign, every stretch goal we planned to offer \u2014 and some that we didn't plan \u2014 has been unlocked. There is always the temptation, when a campaign is exceeding expectations, to pile on more and more stretch goals. We've reached the limit of what we think we can responsibly deliver, so we're drawing a happy line under what's been unlocked and get to work delivering on our promises.\nThank you, backers!\nThe Dice Miner backer pack is a collection of components and extras delivered only to Kickstarter backers. The exact contents of the backer pack depend on which stretch goals are unlocked, as decided by you, the backers. \nWhen bonus tunnel dice are unlocked, the ones you get in your backer pack will depend on which version of the game you're getting. Standard backers will get Standard Edition bonus dice, Deluxe backers will get Deluxe Edition bonus dice. \nBonus Goals\n\"Adventuring Party\" Play Mode: If six new heroes are unlocked, the \"Adventuring Party\" play mode will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. In this mode, each player gets three heroes per game, and uses a different one in each round. This bonus goal has been unlocked!\nLiquid Courage Dice Game: If five tunnel dice are unlocked, a brand new dice game called Liquid Courage will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. Created by our friends Sam Mitschke and Randy Scheunemann at Steve Jackson Games, we'll let Sam tell you more below. This bonus goal has been unlocked! \nMy co-designer, Randy Scheunemann, and I set out to create a variety of dice games that offer interesting choices and give players some control over how the game plays out. Yes, even the randomness of dice games can include meaningful choices!\nWe spent months working with this goal in mind, we designed a ton of different games, and then we ultimately narrowed it all down to 26 that we feel are the best of the bunch. Those games are all featured in our book, Random Fun Generator \u2014 A Collection of Dice Games, which will be offered in an upcoming Kickstarter campaign from Steve Jackson Games.\nOne of those games, Liquid Courage, was designed specifically for Atlas Games, with the awesome custom dice from Dice Miner in mind, and we hope you enjoy it! \n\u2014 Sam Mitschke / Chief Creative Officer / Steve Jackson Games \nWe'll alert Dice Miner backers about the Random Fun Generator Kickstarter when it goes  live, but you can also monitor dice.sjgames.com, where the book will feature prominently when it launches. We're extremely happy to feature Liquid Courage as a stretch goal for Dice Miner backers.\nLiquid Courage is best played with six tunnel dice per player, but we're unlocking it with the fifth backer pack tunnel die because backers can still play it easily by using the 27 tunnel dice form their copies of Dice Miner. If more tunnel die are added to the backer pack after the fifth one, so much the better.\nThe campaign mines Gems in four ways: basic, first day, social media, and challenges.\nBasic\nOne Dollar of Funding = 1 Gem\nOne Backer = 2 Gems\nFirst-Day\nOne First-Day Dollar = 3 Extra Gems*\nOne First-Day Backer = 5 Extra Gems*\n* First-day Gem rewards are over and above the \u201cbasic gems\u201d amount for dollars and backers.\nSocial Media\nOne New @AtlasGamesInsta Instagram Follower = 5 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games Facebook Page Like = 3 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games YouTube Subscriber = 3 Gems\nOne New @AtlasGames Twitter Follower = 2 Gem\n  Challenges\n Stream a Dwarfbook Live Video (Go live on Facebook, tell us why you\u2019re excited about dwarves, dice, or Dice Miner, and tag Atlas Games) = 50 Gems\n Mine for Dice on Instagram (Post an image on Instagram of dice you have discovered within or placed inside a hole of some kind, and tag #tabletop and @AtlasGamesInsta) = 35 Gems\n Subscribe to the Atlas Games mailing list for fans or retailers = 20 Gems\n Tweet Dwarves Love Dice (Tweet a photo including both a dwarf and a die, including a link to this Kickstarter and tagging @AtlasGames) = 25 Gems\n Cover Facebook in Glitter (Post a photo on Facebook showing off all your glittery dice, linking to this Kickstarter and tagging Atlas Games) = 20 Gems\n\nYou\u2019ll pay later for shipping. You keep more of your money longer, and shipping rates will be as close as possible to actual cost. Trust us, we won\u2019t make any money on shipping.\nRewards will ship from the Atlas Games warehouse in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Based on our experience, this is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global partners. In part due to our direct control of this facility, our shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\nYou\u2019ll prepay taxes later.

They are our best estimates, not guarantees.\nFor group pledge tiers, we will collect shipping and handling after the campaign. We will not charge for duties or taxes, nor pre-pay them, nor be involved in their administration or payment whatsoever. For group pledges, duties and taxes are the backer\u2019s responsibility.\nThis campaign will not ship rewards to Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine.\nFrom the day we begin shipping, you\u2019ll have a year to complete your order and pay for shipping and taxes. Pledges unclaimed after a year will be assumed abandoned.\nRetail tier backers use Atlas Games\u2019 standard direct-to-retail sales terms for shipping. See \u201cStones & Mortar,\u201d below.\nAdd-ons will be available in the pledge management phase of the campaign. In addition to a variety of other Atlas Games titles, you\u2019ll be able to add the following.\nPunchboard Mountain \u2014 $8. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Deluxe backers who would also like to have a punchboard mountain, in addition to a plastic mountain.\nDeluxe Dice Set \u2014 $18. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Standard backers who prefer the look of the punchboard mountain to the look of the plastic mountain, but who dig fancy dice. (We understand that a Standard Edition pledge plus a deluxe dice set costs about the same as a Deluxe Edition pledge. It reflects what the dice cost, and the fact that you wind up with 120 dice instead of only 60.) Includes a Deluxe Edition dice bag.\nStandard Dice Set \u2014 $14. Available to everyone, added by popular demand. This is a full set of the sixty dice that come in the Standard Edition. Includes a Standard Edition dice bag.\nStandard-to-Deluxe Upgrade \u2014 $18. Available to backers at the \"Standard Group\" pledge level only. Each of these add-ons upgrades one of the five Standard Edition games that are part of that pledge level to a Deluxe Edition game. This allows the two editions to be be mixed among a group of gamers who are backing together.\nJosh DeBonis is the president of BumbleBear Games, where he designs arcade games. He lives in Brooklyn, NY, with his wife Amanda.\nNikola Risteski is French-born, residing in the US, managing IT by day, designing board games by night.

Our campaign offers the standard edition at $29 (MSRP: $29.95) and the Deluxe Edition at $49 (MSRP: $49.95). Our Kickstarter does not undercut long-term sales.\n Exclusive Deluxe Edition access. The Deluxe Edition of Dice Miner will not be made available through distribution.\n You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. Dice Miner\u2019s channel street date is January 15, 2021, but if all goes according to plan (not guaranteed, but likely), you\u2019ll receive your copies in early December and can sell them right away.\n Retail-only stretch goal. If 100 retail stores back Dice Miner, every one will receive a free demo copy of the Standard Edition.

Its rules have been extensively tested, its components have been modeled, the art is all finished (with the exception of any new art required by unlocked stretch goals), and the graphic design is nearly done. We expect that Dice Miner will go to press before this campaign is over.\n\nAt the same time: Yes, indeed, many things seem very uncertain these days.

The Stretch Reward  Adtherpe's Greater Book of Material Ecology, Herbology and Alchemy and the FREE PDF is a go! Thank you all for Joining the Fray! It is appreciated more than you'll ever know!\nAdtherpe was a wizard of some renown! He fought in the Winter Dark Wars and ended his days upon the Wheel of Pins in Aufstrag. But before his tragic binding he was a scholar of some great repute and he penned two volumes of works whose worth far exceeded most of his kind, either before him or since. Adtherpe\u2019s Guide to Herbologyand Alchemy and Adtherpe\u2019s Material Ecology.\nCURIOUS What's in it? Well here's the Index of the Existing CKG:  CKG INDEX! \nChat with us on DISCORD: This is one of the first Kickstarters we've had since we launched our Discord Server.  We've started a channel for this Kickstarter called #ckg-kickstarter-chat which we hope you will join.  Trolls and mods are on hand to help answer questions, discuss the CKG, and to hang out.  You can join with this link:  https://discord.gg/jy6us48 \n ALSO: Steve will be on Twitch Stream tomorrow (Tuesday, April 7) at 4pm Central with his weekly Troll Talk AMA; and will be discussing the CKG KS among anything else you would like to ask! https://www.twitch.tv/trolllordgames/\nHere below is the full canvas of the covers (from left to right) Monsters & Treasure, Castle Keepers Guide, Players Handbook and Adventurers Backpack! We are working toward making these into one large screen\nEach chapter of the Castle Keeper\u2019s Guide explores new avenues to solve old problems, supplies frameworks for the CK and player, and adds optional rules for all modes of play. Many of these rules add a whole new layer, or several layers, of structure to a game whose true value lies in its rules light approach to role playing problems. In order to mitigate the potential for rule-clusters to overburden situational circumstances within a game properly governed from the hip by the CK, the Castle Keepers Guide takes an unusual approach. Where applicable, the CKG presents several different types of rules to expand the game. These options are very generally broken down into three categories: role playing, rules light, and rules heavy. \nThe Castle Keepers Guide is one of the most detailed reference books for game masters on the market today. It includes a plethora of material to help game masters run games, develop worlds, create NPCs, organize monsters, tips on how to run games, extra combat rules, army battle rules, and so very much more. Though designed for Castles & Crusades, much of the information in this book can be applied to ANY RPG. From the discussion on Biomes to the size of towns and cities; from cave types to critical hit tables; from types of ships and wagons to aerial combat maneuvers; from how much land to award a Knight, to what kind of order a druid has. The CKG is filled with mountains upon mountains of material.\nThe Table of Contents says it all:\nExpanding Characters\nMagic\nExpanding Equipment\nNon-Player Characters\nThe World\nThe City\nDungeons\nAir and Water Adventure\nEquipment Wastage\nLand as Treasure\nGoing to War\nMonster Ecology\nExpanding the Genre\nAdvancing the Game\nThe Siege Engine\nTreasure\nIron and Sulfur: Combat\nSkill Packages\nCharacter Death and Fates  \n WHAT\u2019S NEW\nThe Castle Keepers Guide is chock full of mountains of useful material, more than you imagine. But we want to make it even better. Whole sections of the book could use illustrations to better help the game master and the player understand what it they are seeing and doing and how best to do it. From types of ships and wagons to types of barrels and traps; from fortresses to towns from caves to dungeons. It's all in the CKG, now it's time to illustrate it. A sample of the Intended illustrations include the following:\nCarrying Items\nWagons\nShips\nBiomes\nSetting Age\nTowns and cities\nFortresses\nTypes of Houses\nCaves\nSample Dungeon map with all room types\nAerial Maneuvers\nCatapults\nArmor Types   \nTo make this happen we'll turn to a host of veteran illustrators and artists: Peter Bradley, Jason Walton, Zoe DeVos, Alyssa Faden and others!\n WHAT ELSE IS NEW\nWe are going to expand the classes presented in the Adventurers Backpack.\nThe Index will be overhauled and expanded.\nMany charts will be revised to include new information such as costs!\nWhat is the World of Aihrde on World Anvil?  \nThe World of Aihrde is our world of choice, created and developed by our CEO Stephen Chenault.  It\u2019s an amazingly detailed and vibrant world, full of history, timelines, lands, peoples, fiction, kingdoms, and more, including many, many, many maps. There is a Players Guide to Aihrde, a Monsters & Treasure, the Codex of Aihrde, tons of adventures, multiple short stories and collections all set in Aihrde.  In short, we believe it to be one of the most comprehensive and fleshed out RPG world on the market today.  \nWorld Anvil is a website that can bring that world to life.  The creators of World Anvil, Dimitris and Janet, have ingeniously put together a site where we can bring all of our world from our books to the screen.  Imagine all of the world at your fingertips\u2026 want to research an area and find an adventure to play?  It\u2019s in there.  Want to read about the All Father and Aufstrag and how the world was created?  It\u2019s in there.  Images, maps, a searchable database that can bring up any image, article, history you want.  And we are still growing.  Every day more articles are being put up.  Over 700 right now and growing.    \nWith your pledge, you will gain access to this world and all that it entails.  There are many different tiers that will be available, but you are getting a tier submission as part of your pledge.  And for now, at least for a short time, we are leaving the World of Aihrde on World Anvil open for you to get a look at what you will be getting.  Please check it out here and if you would do us a favor and follow us on there as well, we\u2019d sure appreciate it.  Here\u2019s the link:  https://www.worldanvil.com/w/world-of-aihrde-trolllordgames\nOTHER GAME SYSTEMS\nIn the CKG you\u2019ll discover the source of the success of Castles & Crusades, a game that has been on the market since 2004! The simplicity of the Siege Engine allows any game master to adjust the game to their style. The CKG only enhances that. Many of the sections in the book are system neutral, though some you may have to adjust to your game of choice!   \nAt the $99 pledge level you reap not only the Castle Keepers Guide but two resource books that will help you at the table and enhance play. \nCKG Chart Folio: This perfect bound and digital book includes all the charts and tables from the CKG in one small book. It includes player content like divine attributes and beauty as well as the game master's charts such as critical hit and human habitation sizes. It will also include all informational tables and charts like those on wagons and ships.\nC&C Master Index: This perfect bound and digital book will also be available in an online platform. It will include an index for all three of the core Castles & Crusades books. This is a massive undertaking but we hope to have a definitive resource for you table. We'll make the online version, as well as the digital version, searchable by word for quick and easy reference. The index will tell you what book and what you need for anything and most everything. The online version will be updated. What about other books? See the stretch rewards below!  \nRunning a game can be so very much more.

One of the greatest challenges we face is creating such a large book and maintaining the quality of the printing and binding. In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves. We are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur books have a long shelf life.

It's a fast-playing, wild ride into the world of the fantastic, with the same depth of play as its later-edition brethren. A fantasy role-playing game with a distinct feel to it, different from later editions of the game ... and now it comes in a box!\nWhat is Swords & Wizardry?\nSwords & Wizardry is more than a re-statement of the original rules that gave rise to 5e. It is fast-playing, easy to start, and easy to learn by anyone. Swords and Wizardry is  a snapshot of the rules as they existed in 1978 right before \"first edition\" was released. The fifth edition game currently played, watched and beloved by millions is great fun, but the structure of the rules has changed over the course of editions, and there's a unique feel to the earlier versions of the game which you may not have encountered before.\nThe rules in Swords & Wizardry are based on the original 1974 game, plus all of the supplements released from 1974 to 1978, articles in the Strategic Review and the Dragon magazine from that period, plus tips for house rules choices. The rules are organized in a more modern fashion than the original books, and are more accessible to those who started gaming after the 1970s. \nDistinct, Different Style of Play\nThese original rules are considerably different than the 5e version you may be familiar with. Here\u2019s a quick run-down of how the \u201cfeel\u201d of the game can be very different:\nCharacter generation is very fast, and contains less detail (and fewer choices to make) about specific skills or tailored options.\nCombat moves along quickly, and tactics are based on what the player describes doing rather than on anything listed on a character sheet.\nIn general, the \u201clighter\u201d approach of these rules leads to certain effects on game play:\nSince combat occupies less time, there is often more focus on exploration and puzzle-solving than there is in later editions of the game. You don\u2019t have to \u201creserve\u201d time for long combats.\nSince there are no established rules for noticing things, figuring out how mechanisms work, or interpreting language, there is more scope for presenting \u201cpuzzles\u201d as tests of skill for the players. Player problem-solving is more direct in earlier editions of the game.\nRole-playing is just as robust as in later editions of the game; it emerges from the players and the way a particular gaming group operates.\nSwords & Wizardry is about \u201crulings\" not \"rules,\u201d and a lot of players describe a test for whether it\u2019s working well: when the Referee describes a situation and the players don\u2019t immediately look down at their character sheets for their options, that\u2019s when they're in the \"Original D&D Zone.\"\n\nSwords and Wizardry Box Set Contents\nSwords & Wizardry Box Set\nFour Softcover Rule-books \nPlayer Book\nSpells & Magic\nMonsters\nReferee's Book\nAlso includes\nExtra height is reserved for dice,minis, adventures or ... expansions?\nBut wait, there's more! We are also offering a Collector's Box Set limited to 500 boxes.\nSwords & Wizardry Collector's Edition Box Set (Limited Quantities Available)\n All boxed sets will be shrink-wrapped and packaged expertly by our manufacturing partner.\nNote: The content of both box sets are identical. The boxes themselves are the same size but the collector box has a more retro image stickered outside, while the regular box has a full-color image printed on the box itself. The collector box is not a \"deluxe\" set; it is a variant box with a limited production run. It is not real wood - it is cardboard like the regular box.\n\nSwords & Wizardry Digital Pack\nSwords & Wizardry Digital Box Set\n\nSwords & Wizardry Extras Pack\nWe will NOT be using a pledge manager (like BackerKit) for this project. Therefore, there will not be add-ons available immediately after the project closes. Items unlocked MAY be available for purchase at the Frog God Games Web Store. They are only guaranteed to those who choose a reward tier that includes a box set. They can be added by anyone who purchased a box set at time of shipping payment (see shipping section below).\nSwords & Wizardry Box Set Extras\n\nDeluxe Referee Screen- We will create a four-panel deluxe GM Screen. The lay flat dimensions are expected to be 35.5\" x 5.5\" and will fold to 8.5\" x 5.5\" for storage. It will be the highest quality we can make it, since we already have the art and it's incredible.\nThe wonderful illustration for the Referee's Screen by Michael Syrigos\nSwords & Wizardry Supplement 1- MOAR Monsters. This monster book will be about 48 digest-sized pages, filled with monsters from Monstrosities and a few new ones. Monstrosities is too big to re-print, so we're going to work the monsters into these supplements for those who didn't get a copy of Monstrosities way back when.\nBaron's Gambit- An all new adventure module for Swords & Wizardry by Matt Finch.\nMaking it Better with Stretch Goals\n If project goals are exceeded everyone wins, thanks to the law of Kickstarter economics: more $$$$ = better stuff and more stuff for everyone.\n All stretch goals after the dice and character sheet pad are digital deliveries, not physical products.\n\nA few notes on the stretch goals:\n The digital spell cards include the name of the spell and the spell description, one card per spell. These are great for when players need an easy reference handout when casting a spell, or a way to keep track of remaining spells. Our spell-card stretch goals are broken up by class: Druid, Magic-User, and Cleric. Each deck of cards contains spells used for that class.\nDigital spell books contain the spells used for each independent class: for example, the druid spell book contains only the druid spells. This way the player doesn\u2019t have to search through the whole spell list to find the ones they can use. One version of the spell books will be organized in letter-size format and another version will be in digest-sized format for those who wish to construct their own booklets to match the size of the box.\nThe Future Crowdfunding isn\u2019t truly a stretch goal, but it means we\u2019ve hit a level where it makes sense to run an Indiegogo for the character reference cards in physical form. It doesn\u2019t actually add anything to the delivery for backers, but we\u2019ll let everyone know when it starts.\nThe 4 Useful Sheets are physical pages added to the Extras Pack, not into the boxed set. We haven\u2019t narrowed down yet which tables are the best candidates for inclusion here, because we\u2019re hoping to get all the way to the 16 page booklet.\nThe Ready Reference booklet is a physical booklet added to the Extras Pack. It will contain various tables and resources that a Referee might want to look up quickly.\n Note: Stretch goals are only added to pledge rewards that include a Swords & Wizardry Box Set or backers of the Swords & Wizardry Digital Pack. One Exception: the last stretch goals (Useful Sheets and Ready Reference Tables) apply to the Extras Pack, not to the Boxed Sets.\nFind out more in the Swords and Wizardry Communities\nFor the duration of the Swords & Wizardry Box Set project we will be having discussions, special videos, and other social media activities. These will take place on Discord, YouTube, and Facebook.\nDiscord\nDiscord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that\u2019s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.\nHow do I get to the Frog God Games Discord?

It will be charged right before the rewards are shipped on our web page. \nSome changes from our previous Kickstarter projects\n1. We will NOT be using a pledge manager (like Backerkit) for this project. All pledges are locked when the project ends, we will not have a method to change your pledge reward after the project closes.\n2. We will not be charging shipping until your rewards are packed. This leaves out guesswork and allows for maximum flexibility in selecting the carrier and packaging material for your reward.\n3. This project\u2019s rewards will all be shipped priority mail (or equivalent) to domestic and international backers.\nNote to international backers\nWe continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We actually have considered not even selling books and games overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. We cannot give an honest shipping quote until we charge shipping because we just do not know the costs for future deliveries in every country.\nRefunds and replacements\nWe will happily ship your game anywhere you indicate on your Kickstarter survey provided that regular service is available from the USA (e.g., to nations subject to trade embargoes or to other planets). If your rewards are damaged or missing after shipment we will replace the damaged or missing items.

The Grand Duchy of Reme is the region home to classic adventures released by Necromancer Games for D20/3.x and Frog God Games for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry and Fifth Edition. \nMore than 10 adventures have brought life to the Grand Duchy of Reme. The Lost Lands Campaign Sourcebook funded in January is expected to be over 700 pages and all of them are full of information. By necessity each region was described broadly, but there are still a wealth of history, politics and other details to be explored, experience and expanded in the Grand Duchy of Reme. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme is a system neutral hardcover volume designed to be useful for campaigns independent of system preference. Specific details that affect the characters in the Lost Lands there are System Encounter Books. These companion volumes are softcover (or PDF), that contain reference stats for use with the Region book along with detailed encounter tables for the region.\nAdditionally, 3 classic adventures previously unavailable for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry, and Fifth Edition are back. These are offered as either softcover add-ons in backerkit or as free stretch goals in PDF (see reward sidebar).\nMock-up of Grand Duchy of Reme. Final release will differ slightly\nThe city of Reme itself is ancient, with world-spanning trade \u2014 the eternal citadel of the Loreclans, where the ashes of legendary barbarian kings reside. This land lies near the slow collapse of the nearby Empire of Foere, and the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate to the East. The Rhemish watch these events with cold eyes rather than concern, for they live in vast regions that devour invaders. Their land is eternal; their people can be forced back to the plains, but in the plains they can abide for as long as need be. They are \u2014 as a people \u2014 the ultimate hunters. The fall of Foere is like the fall of an antelope upon the plains; the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate is little more than the stepping-up of jackals before the body. The Grand Duchy of Reme simply waits and watches \u2014 for Reme is the dwelling-place of the world\u2019s wolves.\nReme is a unique fantasy civilization whose structure is determined by the one overriding fact of its geography \u2014 the country is a vast, grassland plain. The realm is dominated by the culture of the ancient Loreclans: the urbanized and settled ones, and the nomadic clans of the interior. The Loreclans owe a certain fealty to the Dukes of Reme, who are the final arbiters of the ancient law of the plains, but between the Loreclans and the Dukes there are also the mysterious Pashtars: arbiters, judges, and mediators who roam the plains where their service takes them.\nThe city of Reme, of course, is one of the wonders of the world of the Lost Lands, home of powerful spell-casters and perhaps the greatest mercantile and war fleets of the Crescent Sea. It is also, however, steeped in the culture of the vast plains of the interior. It is a place where assumptions are dangerous, for it is no standard fantasy environment \u2014 it is a culture that will be entirely new and foreign to your players, a place to truly explore as well as adventure.\n***NPCs & Loreclan stretch goal(s) PDF rewards will be fulfilled as a single PDF volume as they are unlocked***\n$15,000 - Funded!\n$17,500 UNLOCKED- The System Encounter Book, the Tower of Jhedophar, the Grey Citadel and the Siege of Durgam's Folly will be added for Pathfinder version 1.0 as add-ons at additional cost.\n$20,000 UNLOCKED-  A detailed regional non-player character presented in an illustrated one-page PDF, for use in Reme.

First of all: All shipping costs are included with this pledge level. The Temple of the Frog Pledge gets you an invite to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2020 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2020 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Frog God at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con! \n\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live outside the US. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme will be included in the Frog God Games World Anvil project slated for 2020 release.

PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw, or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit, and Paypal.  \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70, or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books \u2014 and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. We hate to do this \u2014 but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (25!) Kickstarter projects. As with any crowdfunding program, the time-lapse between payment and delivery of a final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of a supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, and changes in the prices of materials and shipping. Experience gained over a number of projects makes us confident that we have contingency plans for the ordinary, foreseeable issues that might arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Our Heartfelt Thanks", "descp": "Just the free stretch goals!\nINCLUDES:\nAll Free Digital Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Digital Lore Clan Rider", "descp": "Get the PDF of Lost Lands: Grand Duchy of Reme (system neutral)\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Lost Lands: Grand Duchy of Reme\nAll Free Digital Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["144 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Lore Clan Rider", "descp": "Get the Hardcover Copy of Lost Lands: Grand Duchy of Reme (system neutral) plus PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nHardcover Lost Lands: Grand Duchy of Reme\nPDF Lost Lands: Grand Duchy of Reme\nAll Free Digital Stretch Goals\nShipping not included.

It has been a fantastic run and far exceeded our expectations! Trollzah and thank you again!\nCastles & Crusades: Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is the next installment in the Inzae adventure series by the co-creator of Castles & Crusades: Davis Chenault. Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is an  80+ page adventure module that plunges you into that city of thieves. With over 60 encounter areas, a hundred+ NPCs, and hundreds of adventure ideas, Raglesborg is a true treasure trove for your gaming table. \nWhy Kickstarter\nThree Years and Running thanks to your support! With this Kickstarter, we intend to bring to all fans of Castles and Crusades and especially those who have ravaged through the Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon series another installment in the line to more fully flesh out the Inzae setting. We proudly bring to you, the most dangerous city in the world, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity.\nFurthermore, all that content, needs its own box. With this Kickstarter we intend to raise funds to manufacture a box designed to contain all the Inzae material. Called Crucible of the Dragon, this box set will be large enough to hold Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night, Beneath the Black Moon and Raglesborg, as well as the world map and primer!\nThe City of Raglesborg\nLocated on the coast near Bergholt and south of Halpveg, Raglesborg is hidden in those deep and treacherous fjords of that untamed and brutal land, the Urstin Peninsula. Raglesborg, like the wild and treacherous lands about it, is a city like no other in the known world. \nPeopled with pirates, cutthroats, brigands, thieves, murderers and worse, this is a horrid city. Most of the wretched seafarers who pirate the turgid waters of the Interzae, the cruel bandits who roam darkened roads, and the malicious outlaws who prey on the weak eventually make their way to this city of thieves. They come to trade in ill-gotten goods, revel in sins with the plunder of their criminal labors or hide away from those who seek to impose upon them the laws and rules that bind other men together. Raglesborg is not for the faint of heart. Danger abounds! \nMountains of gaming material, NPCs and adventure hooks.\nRaglesborg is a completed manuscript. Its ready for editing and a little art. All we need to do is raise the funds to make it all happen.\nAbout the Crucible of the Dragon Box\nThe Crucible of the Dragon box set is the adventure arc that begins with Death in the Treklant and ends with Den of Iniquity. The box will be a sturdy game box and large enough to contain the adventure books Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity, the World Map and Inzae Primer.\nThough the box has not been made yet. It will follow the form and design of our previous Aufstrag and Canopy of Green boxes. Check out the video to see the quality. \nDo I need Inzae to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Though all of Davis\u2019 material is created and written for Inzae, it is easy enough to port to any homebrew or other setting. \nDo I need the other three books to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Raglesborg is only loosely tied to Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night and Beneath the Black Moon. Use it or ignore it as you see fit.\nDo I need the Castles & Crusades Rules Set to play Raglesborg?\nThat would probably be a good idea, however, C&C is an attribute-based RPG created in 2004. It is very similar to other RPGs on the market today, including the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s most popular RPG.\nWhat do I need if I want to start playing Castles & Crusades?\nThe cornerstone book for the GM (our CK) and the player is the Players Handbook. Scoop up the Monster book (any one of the three) and you have all you need. Check out all 100+ Castles & Crusades titles in our store here! \nWhat comes in the $10 Pledge level? Do I get the encounters?\nThe $10 pledge level comes with the Raglesborg book and any and all pledge levels that are included in that book. For instance, each of the Encounter Areas added via stretch goals are included in that level.\nWhat about an All Digital Level?\nIts already there! Pledge at the $10 level and add on the digital content from the list below to build it. For instance, if you want to add the Digital version of Death in the Treklant, choose the $10 pledge level and add $10 to that for a total of $20.\nI have some of these books but not all. Where do I get them?\nUse this list to ADD-ON to your pledge.  For those not familiar with Kickstarter, you simply increase your pledge by whatever amount you choose for the add-ons.  Then when the survey comes out, you will let use know what the extra money is for.\nADD ONS\nDeath in the Treklant, Digital: $10\nDeath in the Treklant, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Digital: $10\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Digital: $10\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Print & Digital: $30\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Digital: $10\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Print & Digital: $30\nDamnation & Desecration, Digital: $5\nDamnation & Desecration, Print & Digital: $10\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Digital: $5\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Print & Digital: $10\nBurning Firmament, Digital: $5\nBurning Firmament, Print & Digital: $10\nA Princely Heritage, Digital: $5\nA Princely Heritage, Print & Digital: $10\nInzae Primer, Digital: $5\nInzae Primer, Print & Digital: $10\nWorld Map, Digital: $5\nWorld Map, Print & Digital: $9\nSTRETCH REWARDS\n$1,000 Raglesborg Funds: FUNDED!If we hit our goal you'll receive this Den of Iniquity.\nEARLY BIRD ENDS: Back 128\n$5,000 Additional Encounter Area: UNLOCKED!

In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than the usual printing, so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves.\n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Only", "descp": "Don\u2019t want the hassle of shipping?

Best of all, domestic backers are guaranteed to receive these stockings in time for Christmas 2018!\nThis will be a short and direct Kickstart. There will be no stretch goals, but every backer receiving rewards will receive a set of dice which will be included in their shipment in addition to the items from their selected reward level. This should help 'kickstart' your stocking stuff efforts in style! See The RPG Sets section for more details.\nThe Dice Stocking is our highest quality and largest dice bag to date. That's right! It can serve as both a sturdy stocking to hang from your mantle and also as a dice bag complete with drawstring! These stockings are as tough as Yukon Cornelius and strong as the Bumble. They can hold a whopping TWENTY FIVE standard sets of RPG dice and the loop can take the weight. These are not the cheap stockings found on most store shelves - they are built geek tough and will last for many years!\nThe green exterior is a soft, low pile velvet material - not the stiff velvet you see in a lot of small dice bags. The red interior is smooth satin like all our bags. The red drawstring stays tight when pulled and the loop can take the weight. Put these out for the holidays and Santa will surely reward you and yours with loads of geeky goodness!\nAnd for those of you with a sharp eye, that glowing, oversized d20 on the mantle is made by none other than Jolly Blackburn over at Amber's Secret Cove. Check out their line of great products!\nThe stockings come in two distinct designs that backers can choose from during the pledge manager process. You can choose from the The Dice Stocking or The Geek Stocking for each bag you receive! Although the retail on these stockings will be $15, backers of this project will be able to purchase additional stockings in the pledge manager for $13.\nMany Uses!\nHere are a few of the uses we thought of!\nThe Reward Levels\nThere is a reward tier for each reindeer! More directly, there are 5 distinct reward levels of which four have an early bird level. This has led to more reward levels that preserves the theme and gives our backers greater opportunity to get a deal!\nThe RPG Sets\nThe dice are standard sized RPG sets consisting of 7 dice per set and each of the options feature a 'pearlescent' design that shimmers in the light. They are good quality and we are offering ten different color mixes that backers can choose from as part of the pledge manager process. You can pick the color for each and every set that you back for from the available colors! These are great dice and perfect for backers who like to customize their dice by re-inking.\nEvery backer receiving rewards will get one of these sets included with their rewards to help start the stocking stuffing properly! As with any set backed for or purchased in the pledge manager, backers can select the color option for this included set from the ten offered on the project during the pledge manager.\nThese dice will not not be offered by Black Oak on our web store - we are only offering them as part of this project. Backers will have the option of adding additional sets as part of the pledge manager at a cost of $5 per set.\nAdd Ons\nAll Black Oak Workshop products currently in stock will be available for purchase during the pledge manager, so you can be sure to pick up some extra geek and dice goodness to fill your new stocking with!\nRetailers\nWe would love to earn your business retailers! Verified brick and mortar stores are welcome to back at the single bag level and then contact Black Oak through the project or through our website here. Retailers receive a 50% discount with a 10 stocking minimum order. You can expect to receive your orders well before Christmas (just as all backers will). This will mean there will be enough time to get these in front of your customers!\nShipping\nWe have an excellent success rate at meeting or even beating delivery goals from all of our previous projects so you can count on these making it in time. If you back, you will receive these by Christmas of 2018. Our only exception here is international backers. We cannot guarantee shipments to international backers will arrive by Christmas. However, we can guarantee they will ship the first week of December which should allow plenty of time, but there is no way we can provide any assurance for those backers outside of the USA.\nThank you for checking out our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

All our Dungeon Tiles use 1\" squares.\nWe will also be able to produce these sets without the lamination, for people that want a matte finish to their tiles!\nThey have also been designed (where possible) to be as location neutral as can be, so you can mix and match sets and create dungeons for any part of your campaign world. We are launching with three sets of tiles but depending on funding and stretch goals there will be more to choose from.\nThe current Stretch Goal will unlock large wilderness battlemats that are each the equivalent of a single set of tiles. There will be three wilderness battlemats (plain grasslands, a single road and a fork in the road). They can be laminated or cloth topped and will be 27 1\" squares by 17 1\" squares. \nAdditionally if we hit this stretch goal, the KS exclusive detail tiles will be double sided and feature an alternate version of the same detail on each side, allowing for multiple colours and designs.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nEvery Backer will recieve the following tiles in the same format of their pledge (digital/physical).\nOne 4x4 Spell Circle Room\nEight 2x2 \"Extra Detail\" Tiles\nDungeon Realm Sets\nDepending on your pledge you will get to select 1 or more of the following Dungeon Realms sets. All Squares are 1\".\nThe Base Set: Everything you need for a basic Dungeon.\nThe Expansion Set: Larger rooms with unique details, perfect for adding interest and flavour to a basic dungeon.\nThe Sewer Set: Send your adventurers into the dark, dank depths of the sewers...\nThe Prison Set: This set adds plenty of extra rooms and passageways including Prison cells, a torture chamber, guard rooms and more. This set also works as a great addition to the base set allowing you to layout a huge Dungeon!\nThe Mansion Set: This set adds enough tiles to create the floor plans for an old mansion or town house. There is a mix of stone floors and wooden floors, allowing for these tiles to be mixed in with all our existing sets for maximum potential.\nLaminated Neoprene or Cloth Topped Neoprene? \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves. \nNeoprene is a wonderfully non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table. \nCloth topped neoprene gaming mats are usually quite matte with only a hint of shine from the printing process. By choosing a laminated finish instead you add a very definite shine but this creates the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.\nDue to the lamination process tiles with this finish do naturally have an ever so slight curl at the very corners as you can see in the pictures. I have found that this is almost completely unnoticeable when using the tiles on your tabletop during a game, but is accentuated when viewing photos online, taken at oblique angles... \n Hoe does Laminated Neoprene Behave?\nPLAY\n\nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nTile Sets  \n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:  \nCore Set: \u00a330  \nSewer Set \u00a330  \nExpansion Set \u00a330  \nPrison Set \u00a330\nMansion Set \u00a330\nIndustrial Fantasy Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.  \nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\n All rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly.

They have also been designed (where possible) to be as location neutral as can be, so you can mix and match sets and create dungeons for any part of your campaign world.  \nWe are launching with three sets of tiles but depending on funding and stretch goals there will be many more to choose from.\nDepending on your pledge level your reward will be a number of Dungeon Realms sets chosen from those listed below.\n1. The Core Set\nThis set of tiles should give you more than enough generic dungeon pieces to build hundreds of dungeons. These are our most generic tiles, designed to be the foundation that all other sets build from.\n2. The Sewer Set\nEveryone needs a good sewer to go adventuring in. This set was designed to let you build some dark, dank sewer encounters, maybe as part or a larger dungeon or as a dungeon in and of itself!\n 3. The Encounter Set\nThis set is designed to add a flourish to your dungeon with unique rooms and spaces. These tiles are far more decorated and detailed adding interest to your dungeon.\n\u00a35000 - 1 x Free Spell Circle Feature Room (LOCKED)\nThe first stretch goal is a free 4\"x4\" tile that can be used as a small room by itself or layered with many other rooms to create a new or different feature.\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tiles, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\n\u00a37500 - 4x Free 'Small' Feature Tiles (LOCKED)\nOur second stretch goal is a set of smaller 2\"x2\" tiles each with a small feature that can help drive your adventurers on to new goals or simply create an interesting feature. We have a mysterious trap door, a ornate pool of holy water and two as yet mysterious tiles...\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tile sets, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\nFurther Stretch Goals\nFurther stretch goals include new Add On items like a room expansion set, a passageway expansion set, a mansion tile set, a grungy sci-fi tile set, an industrial fantasy tile set, a second encounter set with new 'boss rooms' and if we get there a Japanese style tile set. There will be more news on these as the campaign progresses.\nLaminated Neoprene?  \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves.\nNeoprene is an incredibly non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table.\nNormally neoprene gaming mats are printed onto a cloth top so despite a slight metallic sheen, are usually quite matte. We have been able to add a layer of laminate to our tiles, removing the metallic sheen, enriching the colours and most importantly creating the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.  \nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nFinally... \nNeoprene tiles are much easier to store than any 3D tiles and yet with the laminated colour print still have a visual appeal on the same level (or better) than most 3D sets.\nTile Sets\n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:\nCore Set: \u00a330\nSewer Set \u00a330\nExpansion Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.\nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\nAll rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail. \nPledges for larger numbers of sets may need to be sent via Courier and so will usually be more expenisve than the listed prices here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly. I will be personally checking each order as it is dispatched for quality control.\n\nOur first Kickstarter, for card game playmats featuring Sumi-e artwork smashed its funding goal and was delivered on time without any issues!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "David Robotham\n3 created \u00b7 19 backed\nI'vebeen gaming for more years than I care to remember and have been actively producing design content for almost every game I have...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Level 1", "descp": "At level 1 you will receive any one Dungeon Realms set of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "All-In Digital", "descp": "At the 'All in Digital' level you will receive a high resolution digital copy of every Dungeon Realms set we are able to produce through this Kickstarter along with a digital versions of all stretch goals unlocked.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "Level 2", "descp": "At level 2 you will receive any two Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Level 3", "descp": "At level 3 you will receive any three Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Skulls and Flames!", "update_content": "Good morning everyone,\nI thought it would be fun to show off a few images of the Encounter Set rooms as they have some great details.\nFirst up we have the aptly named Skull Room, great when you want to add an extra layer of foreboding to the Dungeon..."}, {"status": [{"Project is canceled": "OCTOBER 15, 2018"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 9, 2018"}]}], "comments": [{"username": "Nathaniel Castle", "content": "Cancelled?

The books in this series are all about providing a basic, rules-light, gaming experience making it easy to get into and start playing.\nWith our CA $3500 reached, we are producing an additional adventure to the original 5. All backers who pledged CA $6 or more is entitled to a copy of this 6th (as yet unrevealed) Ballista release matching the formats of their pledge level.\nOn top of that, we have also reached our 74 backer goal unlocked access to the BETA copy of the Ballista Rules Companion to all backers once it becomes available.\nArcana Creations is a small hobby-publisher that has produced material for the Castles & Crusades role playing game from Troll Lord Games, as well as material for Swords & Wizardry from Frog God Games. We have collaborated with other publishers such as Brave Halfling Publishing in the past, but now mainly focus on growing and increasing our own product output. 2017 saw the launch of the Arcana Elements imprint to produce non-gaming related books as well as the launch of the new Ballista line in 2018.\nThe concept behind the Ballista line has changed a lot from inception to implementation. The purpose of this campaign is to properly launch a new gaming line which is compatible with various editions of the world's most popular RPG as well as its relatives and simulacra. With that in mind, the goal of this campaign is the publication of FIVE gaming modules which will need very little additional rule books to actually play.\nIt is important to stress that Ballista is not a new game system. As written, these modules are compatible with systems like Castles & Crusades, Swords & Wizardry, and many others. However, included in every book on the inside cover is a basic rule set to allow you to run the adventure WITHOUT the need of a rule book if one isn't close at hand. All you would really need beyond the book are some characters, dice, and some friends!\nWhen Arcana Creations started out, in partnership with Brave Halfling Publishing, we released three modules for Castles & Crusades and two of those were subsequently released for Swords & Wizardry in electronic format. These were The Secret of Ronan Skerry, The Ruins of Ramat, and A Trick on the Tain. When they were first released, they were well received but the release was small and limited.\nThese three modules have been updated and, in some cases, overhauled for the new Ballista line. In addition to these three, we are releasing two new, never-before-published, adventures to round up our selection of five adventures. These are Mystery at Morfurt and Hide in Plain Sight.\nThe great news about the production of the modules is that the majority of the work is already done! The first three modules are finished and ready to go. The last two modules have already had extensive editing work done on them and are in various stages of layout. Here are print samples of the first three modules:\nWith your help, we can add the final two modules to the line and get all of these out into the hands of gamers and into wider distribution!\nFor all the modules being produced, we offer both PDF and physical printed books. The format chosen for these are 6x9 inches and the finalized page count for the first three are 20 pages each. Page count for the last two haven't been finalized yet but they will not fall below 20 pages. In fact, it is probable that Hide in Plain Sight will exceed this page count.\nThe 6x9 size format was chosen for a few reasons. In terms of the digital format, it is usable on 7\" tablets though optimal on an 8\" tablet for reasons of portability. The physical format makes it smaller than a conventional book which, along with the softcover nature of the module, makes it light and easier to ship. In fact, all five modules will be shipped in a small box (to better protect the books), and the combined size and weight of the package makes shipping to elsewhere in Canada, the United States, or abroad reasonably affordable. After the exchange rate, it will cost less than $10 USD to ship to anywhere in the continental United States as an example. Prices are similar when shipping to Europe or Australia though it will admittedly take several weeks to reach their intended destination.\nEach print module comes with free PDF version of it as well and each module has a MSRP of CA $12.50 each (which works out to no more than about $10 USD). They are printed locally in Montreal, Canada in Pacesetter Silk 80 lbs paper.\nTHE SECRET OF RONAN SKERRY\nThe Secret of Ronan Skerry was written by Michael Davis and takes place on an island. It is an adventure which is largely overland and geared towards a party of lower level characters. In it, the party is called upon to investigate the disappearance of a group of monks who man the lighthouse on the other side of the island.\nTHE RUINS OF RAMAT\nThe Ruins of Ramat was written by John Adams and this version (based on the original C&C version) was expanded. It now offers additional and optional content in greater depth than the scenario's original concept of a group of adventurers out to help a little girl to rescue her pet and explore a local dungeon. While this version of the scenario can be run as originally intended, making it great to play with your kids, the added content adds more depth and throws a twist making it worthwhile to explore further. It is primarily a low-level dungeon crawl.\nA TRICK ON THE TAIN\nA Trick on the Tain was written by Keith Hackwood and is primarily a local-area overland scenario. The adventure takes place over a broader region and can firmly be classified as a low-level wilderness adventure taking place in a tundra environment. There are enough ideas in the pages of the module giving plenty of room for a creative GM to flesh out and expand if they wish leading to a larger campaign in the region.\nMYSTERY AT MORFURT\n Mystery at Morfurt was written by Todd Pote and deals with the children of the village of Morfurt that have suddenly gone missing. Fearing a great evil is responsible, the Earl of the region dispatches a party of adventurers to investigate. It is written as a low-level scenario with a mixture of overland and cave/dungeon exploration.\nHIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT\nHide in Plain Sight was written by Bill DeFranza and starts with a party of adventurers hired to rescue an Earl's kidnapped daughter but they soon realize that all may not be as they appear. It is written as a low-level scenario and is primarily dungeon-based.\nA NOTE ON THE SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe recently found a limited amount of old stock that was remaining from the Castles & Crusades version of The Secret of Ronan Skerry and A Trick on the Tain. This is a limited reward option and once these are gone, they will not be reprinted. If you are a C&C collector or fan, this might be one of your last opportunities to add these to your collection.\nUpon funding... all backers (CA $6 or higher) will receive an additional adventure becoming the sixth title in the Ballista Adventures line. The format of this additional adventure will match the format available in your pledge level. Title to be revealed later.\nUpon reaching 74 Backers... Each backer will receive a PDF copy of the Ballista Rules Companion (BETA). This reward will be delivered regardless of the success or failure of this project.\nNo significant stretch goals have been announced at the start of the campaign but that doesn't mean there aren't a couple surprises in store once we surpass our funding goal! There are things we have planned however, any stretch goals that may happen will be offered as digital options only. The choice is, in part, to keep the shipping costs on any physical rewards unchanged. If a physical version of a stretch goal is possible, an option to have this as a purchased add-on will be made available in addition to the free digital version.\nIn addition to the Ballista modules we have here, we are offering the three current titles published through our Arcana Elements imprint. Simply add the cost of the item to the existing pledge level. For example, if you pledged at the $48 level and wanted to add a copy of Mother of Mortals to your pledge, you would add $20 to the $48 for a total of $68 plus the shipping for your region. Add-Ons will be specified to us once the campaign is over and surveys go out.\nMother of Mortals ... CA $20\nStar Rover ... CA $16\nQuebec's Distinct Paganism ... CA $30\nAdditional Print Ballista Module ... CA $10\nAdditional Digital Ballista Module ... CA $5\nPlease note that, depending on stock levels and shipping destination, any the books could be shipped separately from the Ballista modules. If they do ship separately, they are likely to ship earlier than the rest of the rewards in this campaign.\nIn the Fairy Forest illustration \u00a9AtelierSommerland - Can Stock Photo Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the material written and the majority of the editing complete, we do not foresee any issues in fulfillment nor do we expect any. Electronic copies will be distributed online via Driverthru RPG (RPGNow) and the modules are produced locally at a reputable printer we've worked with before for other projects. The physical copies will be mailed out from Montreal, Canada.\n\nWe've done the necessary research regarding shipping and printing to know that there will be no cost overruns. With regards to shipping, while we managed to keep costs at reasonable levels, the time it will take to deliver packages will take longer if you are located overseas. Shipping can either be inexpensive or fast; it can't be both. For those who would like to expedite their shipping, this can be arranged at a higher cost. Please contact us through through Kickstarter to make arrangements.\n\nThe time for fulfillment, given where we are at in the production of these modules, is generous to anticipate any issues we couldn't otherwise foresee. The expectation is this will happen earlier than stated in order to complete this within the specified time frame. In the event that this campaign is more successful than anticipated, there will still be enough leeway to complete fulfillment on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 3 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Want to support Arcana Creations and the new Ballista line but not interested in any of the current offerings?

A Role Playing Game.\nCastles & Crusades is a rules light fantasy RPG, powered by a simple mechanic called the Siege Engine. First published in 2004, the game quickly became a staple in the RPG market, leading the way and influencing a whole generation of RPGs. The Castles & Crusades Players Handbook, the cornerstone of the game, is on its 7th printing and headed toward an 8th. The line itself consists of a host of source books, monster books, setting books, and adventures. (For a brief overview of how to play, see the bottom of this page).\nToday, more than ever, people are enjoying the pure joy of role-playing games. New players by the scores, and older players who are rediscovering the fun of role-playing games.\nWe want to introduce them, and you, to Castles & Crusades. To do that we want to make an affordable, fun to use, and fun to have entry point into the game.\nIf this project funds we\u2019ll produce Classic Castles & Crusades as an affordable introduction to the genre and the game, bringing you the true spirit of Role Playing, in a simple, fast-playing and fun attribute-check-based rules system. \n In this Kickstarter we are offering up THREE special collector's products for fans of the game. These three products are as follows: \n C&C Classic Basic Boxed Set: This digest-sized boxed set is an \"old school\" presentation of the game, in a white box just like the original D&D rules, with saddle-stitched booklets containing a complete, but streamlined version of the game, with four character classes, four races, and magic to take your game all the way to level 10. Plus, a complete introductory adventure module! This box will be different than the Advanced and it will not be exclusive to the Kickstarter, it will eventually land in retail shops.\n C&C Classic Advanced Boxed Set: A True Collector's set, this limited, signed and numbered set will include everything from the Basic set, plus two additional books of character classes, equipment, monsters and gods; a full set of dice; character sheets; a pencil and more. This box will be different than the Basic box, sporting  a wood grain cover similar to the original OD&D box. It will be available in this Kickstarter and any left over from the very limited print run will be put in our store.\n C&C Complete Digest Rulebooks: These are the complete rulebooks for our seven core books: the Player's Handbook, Monsters & Treasure, Castle Keeper's Guide, Codex of Aihrde, Player's Guide to Aihrde, Adventurer's Backpack, and Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde. Each is the complete rulebook, exactly as you'd see it in full-size hardcover, but shrunk to digest size, softcover and printed in black and white. You can build your own set or buy all 7. \nHere's more information about each individual product, in detail. \nPRODUCT ONE: Classic Castles & Crusades Basic Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will be a standard white box and eventually it will be available in retail stores.\n Classes & Races: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\nThe below picture is of the C&C Black Box we did a few years ago. The Basic Box will look similar to it, final cover and image to be determined. The books as well.\nPRODUCT TWO: Classic Castles & Crusades Advanced Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will sport a wood-grain print cover that pays homage to the original D&D box set. It will be available in this Kickstarter only, aside from any unsold from the limited print run, which will eventually be available on our store.\n Characters & Magic: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\n Adventurers Backpack: excerpts from the recently released ABP, some classes, backpacks and other material\n Of Gods & Monsters of Aihrde: A second look at the gods of Aihrde.*\nCharacter Reference Sheets\nDice\nPencil\n*This book will contain different material than that which appeared in the original Black Box.\nThe below picture is the wood grain look that we will strive to replicate.\nPRODUCT THREE: Castles & Crusades Complete Digest Rulebooks\nBUT that\u2019s not all! We want to pay homage to the full and complete game. And what better way to do that than to release digest sized complete rulebooks for the game! In the pledges to the right you\u2019ll see digest versions of each of the core C&C books as well as the Setting material and books written by Stephen Chenault (CEO and lead author at Troll Lord Games\u2026. Jason Vey might dispute the lead author title).\nEach of the digest books is a shrunk down version of the hardcover copy of the latest printing (the CKG will sport the new cover). They are printed in black and white. Each set will be cut and trimmed to match a perfect set for your book shelf.\nWe\u2019d love to redo each of these books with special layouts for digest form, but that is two steps from impossible. If we took this approach, each of the books would require three times the pages, which would make the larger books like the Castle Keeper Guide unwieldy and weak in the spine. \nSo do keep in mind that these highly collectable books are shrunk down versions of our wonderful game. They are the same books, same page counts, same layout, etc. They are just smaller. On the left you'll see the regular Players Handbook, on the right the digest size Players Handbook.\nThe titles in the set include:\nCastles & Crusades Players Handbook (7th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure (5th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Castle Keepers Guide (3rd Printing Cover)\nCastles & Crusades Adventures Backpack (1st Printing)\nCodex of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Players Guide to Aihrde (1st Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nWe are offering several pledge levels.

Each of these PDF will be made available for all backers $20.00 and above.\nWhat is Towers of Adventure???

These include all the books from the digest version as well as extras of the C&C Classic Set.\nCastles & Crusades Players Handbook: $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure: $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Castle Keepers Guide; $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Adventures Backpack: $15.00\nCodex of Aihrde: $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Players Guide to Aihrde: $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde: $15.00\nCastles & Crusades Classic Collector's Box Set Basic: $50.00\nCastles & Crusades Classic Collector's Box Set Advanced: $99.00\nCastles & Crusades Beneath the Canopy Green, Digest: $15.00\nAmazing Adventures Digest: $15.00\nHow Castles & Crusades Plays\nIt\u2019s simple, elegant rules system allows you to develop your own stories, to take control of the game like never before. There are six main attributes: strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, charisma and constitution. There are standard classes like wizard, fighter, rogue, etc. and races like human, elf, dwarvf, gnome and halfling.\nWhen designing your character, you roll 3d6 six times for your attributes (this is one method) and assign the totals to each of the six attributes however you desire. You then assign each attribute a primary or secondary status. Humans have three and demi-humans 2. These attributes are the cornerstone of the Seige Engine. You will use them to solve any problem or overcome any challenge except for combat. To do so the Castle Keeper will ask you to roll an attribute check. You will roll a d20, add your level and you attribute bonus to the number rolled and tell the CK the total. THAT number determines whether you succeed or fail. Primary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12, secondary attributes a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK will adjust that with a level of difficulty, or challenge level, and you must beat that number. \nExample: You want to swim a river. The CK asks you to make dexterity check. Dexterity is a prime, you are 3rd level and have a +1 due to attribute bonus. You roll a 14+level+attribute bonus. You inform the CK that you rolled an 18 prime. Because it\u2019s a prime, she knows the base is 12. She has assigned a challenge level of 4 to it. Meaning you need 12+4 for a total of 16. You made it. HAD dexterity been a secondary ability you would have failed, as the base chance to succeed is 18+4=22. You would have missed by several points.\nThat\u2019s the Siege Engine in a nut shell. Its very versatile, easy to use and adapts to ANY style of play. The true hidden joy of the SE is the CK controls what attribute you roll. Swimming a river? That can be ANY attribute the CK desires: dexterity, intelligence, strength etc. \nThe mechanic is designed to tailor to YOUR game.\nPlay it. You\u2019ll love it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's always difficult to create collector's material. Items meant to be displayed, not used. Determining whether enough people are interested or not is no easy matter. Kickstarter offers the perfect vehicle for that.\n\nHowever, creating digest books is always a challenge. Their size alone makes managing the production process time consuming and difficult as we must balance a readable manuscript with a small one, all the time making certain it is useful to the end user, as many will want to play using these books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Standing to Arms", "descp": "You may not be interested in the digest set, or the collector's box, but you can still show your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Build Your Own Pledge", "descp": "With this pledge you secure 1 digest book of your choice.

Those who were once disparaged and forgotten now wield power unlike anything seen before. Rulers and sages turn a blind eye to the disturbing events unfolding around them. In every corner of the Lost Lands, the Cult of the Veiled One spreads unchecked.\nProphesizing a cleansing jihad of flames and the coming of the Burning One, the cult has erected its brazen spires in every land. What follows depends on the wit and courage of mighty heroes who must rise to the occasion and take the fight to the enemy in its very stronghold.

The gleaming towers and floating platforms of the city hold terrors and wonders such as the Great Repository and the Minaret of Screams. Characters may choose to take a turn in the Circus of Pain, raid the floating Pyramid of Set, or join the resistance to the Sultan\u2019s oppressive rule and lead an assault on the palace itself!

Featuring high-quality art from the book.\nNote from the CEO\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\" So, what does this mean to you? Well first, you will note that our books cost a little more than others. That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. We feel strongly that book production quality is king. After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). It costs us a lot of money to do this, and our margins are somewhat lower than they could be as a result. Frog God Games stands behind our product (and sometimes on top of it when we need a ladder), and believe that the improved quality and durability of our work is well worth it.\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through Backerkit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during Backerkit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive, expect to pay between $50-80 to ship your reward. This cost is based on the ACTUAL SHIPPING COST plus $5 and is calculated in Backerkit.\nBuilding the City of Brass\nClick the image to watch!\nIt has become traditional for Matt Finch to make a model of some part of our bigger adventures while the Kickstarter is live, and then make a video in which you see the model from miniature's eye level, walking through the adventure and seeing it through the eyes of the adventurers. Matt, Zach, and Jim are making one of the city's Black Magic Bazaars as the model for this Kickstarter. Keep track of their progress as the Kickstarter rolls forward. Here is a link to the first video, with special guest star Casey Christofferson, the author of the book! There will be lots of \"secret\" information about the city coming out in these videos, as well as tips for painting minis and terrain and how to make good scenery for city adventures! Don't forget to subscribe to Matt's channel if you want to get notifications of each video's release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (19!)

I\u2019m not sure where to post this, but the website is directing everyone who mentions Pathfinder to Mike, whom I believe is of Tenkar\u2019s Tavern (which I frequent) who has always had a negative stance of that system. I say this as a person who plays 5th, S&W, and Pathfinder amongst many other games. I usually get multiple systems of FGG products because I have multiple groups playing in those different systems, and have created Rappan Athuk as a place that intersects these worlds and systems. Pathfinder is the easiest to convert from because it has the highest amount of information, and the most difficult to convert to because of the lack of info in other systems. This was touched on in the Environment books discussion when they were kickstarted. Ok, here is my concern: what happens to the years of work Greg Vaughn poured into the upcoming (fall) Lost Lands Campaign setting books and Tom Knauss\u2019 upcoming Environments book(s)? I would love to have access to all of the specific Pathfinder rules these gentlemen created if possible. Where is Vaughn btw? The last I saw was of Matt Finch and he discussing how he was almost done and showing off the (then) only copy of the world map. I recognize there have been personal reasons and business reasons to walk away from Pathfinder. Personally I am Thankful Lisa Stevens of Paizo got you to start your 1st Kickstarter (still have my letter from Bill to her that came with RA), and also don\u2019t agree with leaving FGG in the dark about 2nd edition. Please don\u2019t make Pathfinder fans pay for these difficulties. Heck, it seemed the work (other than formatting, which is important Mr. Wright) is pretty much done, written by Greg and Tom already. I, and I believe others, just don\u2019t want to see what we have waited years for vanish. Heck, isn\u2019t this one the reasons that Zach came on board, to make a box set of awesomeness like Plots and Poisons or Death and Taxes. It\u2019s already been stated that a bevy of old Necromancer Games writers are working on the Campaign now, and I actually applaud that, but not at the cost of Vaughn\u2019s work.

Fans have been asking for this for several years, and it is my pleasure to make it happen! All of the basic and advanced options, magic items, and monsters will be brought together under one cover for easy reference.\nHere are some facts about the combined book:\nThis is not a new game.\nThis is simply a combined book.\nYou will still be able to separate \"basic\" from \"advanced\" game options.\nMuch interior art will carry over from the original books, but new interior art will be featured in addition.\nThis combined book does not replace the current separate books. Those books will remain in print.\nCover Options and Realms of Crawling Chaos\nThere are 4 cover options available to backers. The first two will be available after this Kickstarter campaign is over, but the other two are limited and available in this Kickstarter only! These last two covers hearken back to earlier cover versions of Labyrinth Lord.\nIn addition, for the first time ever and only available now, Realms of Crawling Chaos is presented in hard cover format as a backer add-on!\nCOVER 1, Artist Jeff Ward\n Cover 2, Artist Joshua Stewart\nCover 3, Artist Steve Zieser, LIMITED!\nCover 4, Artist Jason Braun, LIMITED!\n  Realms of Crawling Chaos Limited Hard Cover!\n\nImportant Backer Instructions\nYour backer pledge is for a link to print your book(s) at RPGnow.

The printing and shipping expense comes later when you order your print products. The PDF eBook will be delivered by download link.\n\nWHEN YOU PLEDGE\nSelect your reward. If you would like to add one or more copies of the limited hard cover edition of Realms of Crawling Chaos, add $25 to your pledge per copy.\n\nIf you would like to buy more than 4 copies of rule books (any combination of covers), select the Rule book x 4 option, and add $25 to your pledge per additional book.\nStretch Goals\nPeople familiar with my crowd funding projects know that I like to keep them simple. It is easy to over commit and cause unforeseen difficulties in fulfillment. However, I have two reasonable stretch goals in mind as the project launches.\nFunding Level\n\n$8,000 - A solo adventure will be added to the rule book!\n$12,000 - Three full-color landscape art panels!

Enter the world of Harvesters, where badgers, rabbits, squirrels, and otters launch into adventures of epic wonder. Here, the smallest of creatures take on the roles of the greatest heroes: Knights, Druids, Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, and Fighters. Together, they tackle the greatest of exploits, from rescuing the princess to finding lost treasure. You'll find no humans here, only animals. They live their daily lives and do work just like humans do in your world. You may find a rabbit as a local constable, or a squirrel as a baker or a mouse as a black smith.\nArt by Jim Holloway!\nChose from one of five animals to play: rabbits/hares, squirrels, badgers, otters, and mice. Each can be a fighter, wizard, rogue or more!\nHarvesters is a game for all ages. It uses the time honored Siege Engine, an insanely easy to learn game system that focuses on story over mechanics. It generally takes only 15 minutes to pick the how's and why's of a Siege Engine RPG.  \nIf you are familiar with any of our other games (Castles & Crusades, Amazing Adventures, Victorious) you'll be able to pick it up and play it immediately. You can even bring your characters over from one world to the next, and play that star-finding and slightly funny and a little obnoxious racoon in your own game!\nMore on the Animals!\nYou can choose from the following classes: fighter, ranger, rogue, cleric, knight, wizard and druid. In its current edition you can play 1 of 5 animals (More have been added to the game, see stretch rewards below). They are: Badger, Rabbit, Squirrel, Mouse or Otter. Each comes with their own special abilities. VERY Briefly they are:\nBadger: Along with your CLASS abilities, the badger has twilight vision, digging, enmity toward wolverines, primal fury and special languages.\nRabbit: Along with your CLASS abilities, the rabbit has twilight vision, burst of speed, unarmed combat, camouflage, and special languages.\nSquirrel: Along with your CLASS abilities, the squirrel has climbing, fall, camouflage, special languages and is highly skilled with the bow and sling.\nMouse: Along with your CLASS abilities, the mouse has twilight vision, move silently, enmity toward rats and special langauges.\nOtter: Along with your CLASS abilities, the otter has swimming, twilight vision, underwater weapons and special languages.\nHarvesters is a role playing game specifically designed for family play. Using the wildly popular and easy to use Castles & Crusades Siege Engine, players choose any one of the listed animals to play, in any of the classes provided. Designed for children ages 6 and up, Harvesters is the perfect game to bring everyone together. Children delight in taking on the roles of their favorite animals and parents find the role of Castle Keeper easy and fun!  \nWHAT YOUR PLEDGE EARNS YOU\nWe have only two pledges: a digital version or the full boxed set!

It is the heart of a country that includes The Quacking Woods, Black Midge Swamp, Linden Forest and so much more. Here you can wander the wilderness in search of adventure, glory, fame or gold! It all takes place on the western banks of the lake.\nWheat Hollow: The starter adventure begins when we learn that old Farmer Thistledown's farm has been burgled by an unknown beast that haunts the environs of Wheat Hollow. Plunge into the wilderness to face down the villains who bring terror to the good creatures of Wheat Hollow.  \nLost Fang's Gold: Over the last many seasons, the Southern Road has been plagued by the Long Fang rat gang - they have been hijacking goods and stealing every little bit of gold that has passed their way. The surrounding communities have been trying to track them down without any luck. All the clues lead to the Linden Forest, but nobody is overly eager to step foot in it \u2013 beside the Long Fang gang, there\u2019s been tales of nasty critters and the ghost of a long lost wizard. Anyone who is stalwart enough to enter the woods will be richly rewarded - for to find the hideout and all the gold that has been taken will make that person wealthy indeed.\nBlack Tim's Prize: Pandin and his crew sailed north, carrying a map that charted the treasures of Tamias the mad fox squirrel of legend. But the map was not Pandin's, it belonged to a pug-nosed pirate named Black Tim. And Black Tim is none too happy. Expands Wheat Hollow in the town of Thimbleberry and beyond, includes the water shrew village and more.\nSTRETCH REWARDS\n$1000: Harvesters Funding Goal: Funded!

Only the most gifted students received instruction within its walls.\nIn time, HighFell was deserted and fell into ruin. Its towers, battlements, citadels, and catacombs became home to all manner of wandering monsters. Adventurers and dungeon explorers began making the dangerous trek up the mountain in search of arcane lore and magical treasures.\nIn recent months a strange green light was seen emanating from the ruins at midnight. The light slowly intensified until a great explosion rocked the Dwimmerhorn. HighFell pulled away from the mountain and now slowly drifts - and occasionally phases in and out of place - over the Great Steppe of The Northern Reaches.\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to explore the ruins of HighFell - The Drifting Dungeon?\nWHAT IS HIGHFELL?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure called HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon.\nHighFell is designed for Labyrinth Lord but can be played with any Old School Role-Playing Game (or their clones) from the 70s and 80s such as B/X, First or Second edition, OSRIC, or Swords and Wizardry. This scenario can also be played with the DCC RPG with conversions.\nThis new megadungeon adventure is designed to support a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years. HighFell will support low-level to high-level play.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 180-250 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover). Forbidden Caverns, my follow-up project, was 293 pages, PDF poster maps will be done in both black and Old School blue.\nHighFell opens with a gazetteer that outlines the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history as well as the detailing of several small villages that can provide a base of operations for an extended campaign. Like the mounds in Barrowmaze, or the caves in Forbidden Caverns, HighFell also provides some low hanging fruit above-ground to get (wise) players started. The dungeon proper will be leveled in a traditional style, albeit in a floating dungeon context with twists and surprizes. This approach merges my own particular vision with inspiration drawn from modules like The Village of Hommlet, Dragons of Desolation, and The Ghost Tower of Inverness.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so there's AWESOME SAVINGS for all my peeps in the United States and abroad. If you are unfamiliar, the 2017 average conversion for the year was $1.00 USD = 71 cents CAD. (citation: bankofcanada.ca).\nHere are some past layout samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect with HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon\nCover and Layout Samples\nWHO AM I?\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am an Associate Professor of Popular Culture at a university in Ontario, Canada. I regularly teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games (for realz). I am also the author/designer of two very popular Old School megadungeons called Barrowmaze Complete and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia. You can read widely about Barrowmaze on the internet or on rpgnow.com. Through my professional expertise, I know how to create, manage, and deliver outstanding game projects on time.\nART AND THE OLD SCHOOL\nIn my opinion, crafting an OSR dungeon is about much more than creating an adventure. It is about celebrating the origins of the hobby, the classic fantasy gaming experience, and understanding that dungeon crawling isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in my design and aesthetics. Just like Barrowmaze and Forbidden Caverns, HighFell will place a premium on amazing art. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Trevor Hammond, Stephen Thompson, and others.\nSimilar to past projects for Labyringth Lord Rules, every monster in the monster section will have its own illustration. In the past I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, and Tim Truman. I hope to work with these and other TSR illustrators again on this project for a colour cover and also interior art. Erol has already agreed to illustrate the cover for HighFell. We will ensure the colors and aesthetic chosen compliment Barrrowmaze and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (so they will all look super swank on your shelf).\nIn terms of mapping, those of you will a close eye will notice my published dungeons are slowly filling in a certain old school wilderness board game map that serves as the basis of my Northern Reaches homegame (we affectionately call it...Greghawk lol). HighFell will continue this tradition as a tip of the cap to Gygax's original homegame.\nCory Hamel and Peter Pagano have created some fantastic preliminary illustrations to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the monsters. There's more to come!\nTHROW-INs and ADD-ONS\nLike my other projects HighFell will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, have old school charm, and be super fun for your gaming group. There is no list of stuff to add persay, rather the more funding the campaign receives the more I can invest into and develop the final product. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete or Forbidden Caverns of Archaia, you already know what to expect.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always potential challenges to any large project.

Even though we had Joe Dever\u2019s detailed descriptions from his books, his elaborate sketches and detailed input, it took a lot of time to get them finalized. Much thanks to the attention to detail by Francesco Mattioli and his beautiful penmanship. The style, the architecture, the flavor of each city is unique and carried through in his beautiful hand drawn maps, inspired by an old medieval map of Bologna.\nWe decided early on to make the maps justice by printing them in poster size. Holmgard is the most detailed map, and thus the largest of the ten. Some, like The Kai Monastery is considerably smaller. However, they all came with the same challenge. How do you keep them as gorgeous as they deserve when packed? Our solution was the specially made map tube. That allows us to roll up the maps instead of folding them, which makes them all so much more beautiful and easy to hang on a wall.\nThe Sommerlund City Maps contains the following 10 maps in full color \u2013 and with the most gorgeous illustrations on their back:\nHolmgard\nToran\nTyso\nAnskaven\nMoytura\nRuanon\nSilvershore\nSommerlund with Detailed Information\nThe Kai Monastery\nThe Sommer Isles\nHolmgard (90 x 66 cm)\nHolmgard was one of the first major settlements established in Sommerlund and became its capital during the reign of King Braern I (MS 3445-3472). In ancient Sommlending, the word Holmgard means \u2018Strong of Heart and Mind\u2019. Holmgard was built with the blood, sweat, and tears of its people as countless battles were fought to secure the lands against marauding bandits from the Wildlands and incursions by raiders from the Darklands. King Braern I chose a perfect location for the Sommlending capital. It had a natural protective harbour, fertile arable farmland, a temperate climate and a reliable source of fresh water. In MS 5000, Holmgard is the seat of power for the King of Sommerlund, King Myranar III. There are two river gates and five grand gates in the encircling city wall. The gates permit easy road access into the capital from all four compass points, but they can be locked down and made totally secure during times of war. The two rivers that enter the city are wide enough to be navigated with ease.\nAnskaven (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Anskaven prides itself on being the oldest settlement in Sommerlund. In MS 3434, it was here that the Sommlending made landfall after their Great Voyage across the Northern Void from their ancient homeland islands of Tay Solobo. In MS 5000, Anskaven has the most expansive docks and quayside facilities of any Sommlending city, boasting three dry docks and several shipbuilding and refitting yards. It is home to the Northern Fleet, has a large fishing fleet and processes the cargoes of merchant ships.\nToran (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Toran is undeniably beautiful, a marvel of Sommlending architecture and design, a perfect combination of elegance and strength. The foundations of its curtain wall were laid in MS 3448 and completed in MS 3455. It is located on the northern coast of Sommerlund, on the east side of the Toran Sound, at the point where the River Tor flows out into the Kaltesee. It is dominated by a vertigo-inducing tower that serves as the seat of power for the Guildmaster of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.\nTyso (70 x 50 cm)\nTyso is a flourishing city port situated on the eastern seaboard of Sommerlund, north-east of Holmgard and south-west of Anskaven. Two major overland routes connect it to these cities, and road traffic of all kinds passes regularly along them. Tyso has a thriving fishing industry and benefits greatly from the production of grain and arable food crops in the fertile plains due west, north and south of its coastal location. Tyso has long been a vital base of operations to protect the Holmgulf from attack by sea.\nMoytura (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town of the Southland Marches, of significant strategic and economic value to the Crown. The strong stone wall was constructed following the Drakkarim occupation and the Battle of the Pass of Moytura in MS 3799. Moytura is situated on the East Border Turnpike and benefits from the natural protection afforded it by the Wildlands Range to the east, and the Southlund Hills to the north and west. It is within sight of the permanent encampment of the Army of the South.\nRuanon (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town and trading centre of the Baronial Province of Ruanon. Originally, it was sited close to the Baron\u2019s Castle. In MS 4552, following the discovery of gold in the Maaken Mines, a mass exodus occurred. Nearly all of the inhabitants of the old town moved east and settled near to the mines. An underground river was discovered and a new town sprang up and rapidly expanded, fuelled by the migration of prospectors and entrepreneurs looking to make their fortune in the mines.\nSilvershore (35 x 50 cm)\nThe first Sommlending settlement on the Kirlunidin Isles. The early settlers subsisted on fishing, sheep-farming and agriculture. The discovery of mineral resources prompted fierce rivalry and led to outbreaks of violence, until a lasting peace was achieved in MS 3470. Silvershore grew steadily over the following centuries. A small fleet was created, made up entirely of caravels. The protective wall has proved its worth, assisting the townsfolk to defend their home from pirate raiders and attempts at conquest by the Vassagonian Empire.\nSommerlund (50 x 70 cm)\nThis is more than just a map over Sommerlund. It also contains a multitude of detailed information about the nation. In the frame, you will find mini maps containing historical maps of Sommerlund down the ages, information on the Kai Protectorate, flags and emblems showing the political hierarchy of the Kirlundin Isles, Southlund Marches, Barony of Ruanon, The Baronial Confederation of Toran, Barony of Anskaven, County of Tyso and finally a Political Map of Magnamund.\nKai Monastery (50 x 70 cm)\nA detailed map over the Kai Monastery, where all young Kai selected get a chance to enhance their gifts and train under the supervision of their teachers. This is the very first location you get to know during Flight from the Dark, and it is the home of the Kai when you play the multi player game of Lone Wolf.\nSommer Isles (50 x 35 cm)\nA map of Tay Solobo, the ancient homeland of the Sommlending that undertook the Great Voyage across the Northern Void. Here you will get a chance to see all of the isles the sommlending stem from, and even get some translations of their language.\n\u00c5skf\u00e5geln is the Swedish publisher of Lone Wolf (Ensamma Vargen in Swedish), so we will not only make this gorgeous map collection available in English. It will be printed in Swedish as well, for all who so wishes. The translations can take a few extra weeks, but we have the best team possible on the project. Choose the Reward Level of the language you want.\nAlla ni som \u00e4lskar Ensamma Vargen och hellre vill ha era kartor p\u00e5 svenska ist\u00e4llet kan sj\u00e4lvfallet f\u00e5 det.

We only got four different Reward Levels to choose from. Here you can see what is included in each of them.\nWhen your Reward includes one or maps in print, you will get the same maps in PDF as well. If you only select the map of Holmgard, you will get Holmgard in PDF. If you select The Sommerlund Cities, you will get those seven maps in PDF. Finally, if you select the Complete Collection, you will get every map included in PDF as well.\nThank you so much for backing this Kickstarter Campaign. Francesco Mattioli\u2019s maps are gorgeous artwork, made by a skilled cartographer paying attention to details. The extra value stems from Joe Dever\u2019s dedication to Lone Wolf and the world of Magnamund, where all fans of Joe Dever\u2019s epic Lone Wolf saga will recognize the iconic places we present here. We were fortunate to work with Joe on this map project, and the result is in our mind stunning.\nYou get out gratitude for being part of making this beautiful map project take the last step from a wild dream to full color poster size maps in print.\nWe will send you the largest map of this entire campaign. Holmgard is the capital of Sommerlund, and the biggest and most detailed map of them all. It is also well known to all who played the very first book in the epic saga of Lone Wolf.\nThis collection consists of the 7 city maps included in this project, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. All of the cities have their own style and flare, and the architecture will vary some between them, due to everything from local resources to tactical position, fires, etc. The maps are all printed on separate posters, but the sizes vary. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, Toran, Tyso and Askaven are all 70 x 50 cm, while Moytura, Ruanon and Silvershore are 50 x 35 cm.\nThis Kickstarter special Reward Level includes all of the ten maps, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, while 5 of the other maps are 70 x 50 and the last 4 are 50 x 35 cm. All of these maps are delivered in a map tube specially made for this project, printed with a unique cover made for The Sommerlund City Maps Collection.\nThe better this campaign goes, the more good stuff we want to send your way. Since this is primarily a campaign to show some of the beautiful art developed for Lone Wolf and Magnamund, the Stretch Goals will come in 3 major types:\n1. Additional maps from Francesco Mattioli \u2013 these are typically smaller maps \u2013 A4, previously made for the Swedish Lone Wolf Roleplaying game. Will be sent to you with the maps\n2. Artwork by Lukas Thelin \u2013 typically printed in A4, still in the same movie poster quality as the maps of Sommerlund Cities. Will be sent to you with the maps.\n3. Commitment to develop new maps for the future. These will not be included in your reward, but you will have something to look forward to.\nAfter receiving some questions on how to go ahead and order more copies of the maps, we have decided to go ahead and make the following add ons available. If you have any other particular thing you would like to see, feel free to contact us and we will see what we can do.\nAdd the total amount for extra maps to your Pledge. After the campaign you will be able to tell us exactly what you want (which maps and language) in survey we send out to you.\nHolmgard Map \u2013 150 SEK\nSommerlund Map \u2013 125 SEK\nKai Monastery \u2013 125 SEK\nSommerlund Cities (7 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 500 SEK\nComplete Collection (10 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 750 SEK\nIf you decide to up your pledge from the Holmgard map to more, please increase your pledge amount with 50 SEK for the additional shipping cost.

We have been active in Swedish roleplaying games since the dawn of time, and involved in a multitude of successful games and magazines over the years, mostly in Swedish. 2018 is the year \u00c5skf\u00e5geln has marked for Creative Fireworks \u2013 the year to launch all of those great gaming titles that have been brewing for a long while. The Sommerlund City Maps are one part of the Creative Fireworks.\nFrancesco Mattioli\nFrancesco Mattioli is a cartographer and illustration artist best known for his work on Lone Wolf and various board games over the years. He is also the lead cartographer for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln\u2019s product line Freeway Warrior \u2013 the four choose your own adventure books by Joe Dever, as well as an upcoming roleplaying game in that post apocalypse setting.\nJoe Dever\nThe acclaimed author and game designer Joe Dever had a lot of gaming titles under his belt, but he is best known for the epic saga of Lone Wolf in choose your own adventure kind of play. The Sommerlund City Maps are all from that wondrous setting Joe Dever created, based on his texts, ideas, sketches and not least detailed discussions as Francesco made the map drawings. Joe Dever will not be around to see these maps in print, but we know for certain that he loved the result and was looking forward to them. Now both Joe Dever and his creations belong to the ages.\nVincent Lazzari\nWhen we at \u00c5skf\u00e5geln started our collaboration with Joe Dever back in 2013, he described Vincent as a real life Indiana Jones. That is a both cool and apt description for a man that has the responsibility to uphold the integrity of all things Lone Wolf. Every detail is fact checked, in order to be consistent with all descriptions from official Lone Wolf material from all platforms. We are fortunate to have Vincent aboard as part of our Lone Wolf team.\nOlle Sahlin\nOlle is one of the true icons of the Swedish Gaming Scene. He worked as an editor at \u00c4ventyrsspel, the company that made roleplaying games as hit in Sweden as Dungeons & Dragons made them in the rest of the world. Before Olle took on the full time gig of editing all of their prestigious titles, Lone Wolf included, he was tagged for the translation of the choose your own adventure books for Lone Wolf that Joe Dever conquered the world with back then. Now Olle has gone full circle, translating Lone Wolf for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln. But rest assured, almost any high profile Swedish gaming project is bound to have Olle somewhere in the credits. He is one of Sweden\u2019s best and most beloved translators, LARP photographers and so much more.\nLukas Thelin\nEven though The Sommerlund City Maps at its core is all about the maps Francesco Mattioli creates for Lone Wolf, we would be amiss not to mention Lukas Thelin. Lukas is an integral part of \u00c5skf\u00e5geln and has been our in house lead illustration artist for many years now. He has made so many stunning illustrations for Lone Wolf over the years that we might just include a few of them as stretch goals or add ons during this campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project the risks are primarily time related. The good news is that the maps are already drawn and the English editions are ready for print, and we have a good idea of how long it will take, from the printer to your home. The Swedish editions will take a few weeks longer, since they require attention to detail when Francesco makes the changes in the text layers. \n\nWe are aware that add ons and stretch goals are possible time sinks, so we will make sure not to add anything that will require a lot of additional extra work at this stage. Since we do not want to slow the delivery down in any way, you will instead be facing possible add ons in the form of additional maps or artwork, already made and thus just as ready for print. Or, if this campaign goes really well, our commitment to stay focused on producing more gorgeous city maps for other parts of Magnamund in the future. If we do, those stretch goals will not affect what you receive for backing us this time around, but it will give you something to look forward to!\n\nThis project is basically printer ready. We are so close to print that we are even prepared to jump the gun if we are off to a flying start. It would be spectacular to give all who come to the GothCon gaming convention in Gothenburg, Sweden, the chance to get their maps signed by Francesco Mattioli.

For some reason it is not the hour long one.  You can view that HERE.\nRundown #14: THANK YOU ALL for your support! Each of you has made this a far better project than we ever hoped and shown once again that Castles & Crusades is the go to RPG! This turned into a fantastic success! Now to get to work! Lots of hard, wonderful work. Thank you again!\nBONUS: This past Saturday we did some warehouse/mailroom cleaning and we have a few hundred Classic Monsters left. Everyone who pledges $75 or more, receives one in your package!\nCastles & Crusades has enjoyed 14 years of continuous publication. In that time, you\u2019ve seen a mountain of books, adventures and supplements roll across your table. Of them all, two stand out as essential (four if you are a die- hard fan): The Players Handbook and Monsters & Treasure. We recently reprinted the Players Handbook (seventh printing) and now, Monsters & Treasure is up for its fifth printing.\nThis time we would like to do something a little different, but to do that, we are going to need your help.\nIn our 14 years together, Castles & Crusades has created a mountain of monsters, and a smaller mountain of treasure: the majority of which lie in published works outside Monsters & Treasure. This makes playing the game a little more challenging, and sometimes, just a little aggravating. CKs (GMs) have to struggle with a veritable mountain of books to track down and find the monster they seek. Some have entered the digital age, using these books on a tablet, or phone or on the TLG Portal and are able to access them a little quicker, but for many the hunt has become time consuming and distracting. Too many RPG books makes for difficult play.\nTime to Tighten Up the Game!\nOur goal is to tighten things up just a little and make one massive reference book for you to use at your table. To do that, we need to round up all the monsters from the extensive C&C library and bring them into one book. This is what we have in mind: Monsters & Treasure, Classic Monsters, Mystical Companions, published adventures like Shadows of a Halfling Hall (looking at you, Bag-o-Bones!), Amazing Adventures Manual of Monsters, Codex Celtarum, Codex Germania, Codex Nordica, Codex Classicum, Codex Slavorum, Haunted Highlands and all the other manifold publications where monsters creep and crawl, fly and charge from the pages and put them into one monstrous Full Color book.\n But Wait? Aren\u2019t you Missing Some books?\nWhat about the Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde? This book will remain its own publication. Though the monsters in it are designed for everyday use, it is tied to the massive Aihrde world setting (Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde). These need to remain in a book with ease of access for those who brave to adventure in the Lands of Ursal.\nWhat about Tome of the Unclean? This book will also remain its own stand-alone product. We prefer to keep the filth of hell and unhinged chaos of the Abyss in their own realm, to be pulled out when your table slides into the madness of those insane worlds.\nSo why do we need your help? Aren\u2019t you going to reprint the Monsters & Treasure anyway?\nYes. There will be a fifth printing, no matter what. However, we don\u2019t want to simply reprint the book. We want to make it better.\nThis is where you come in. This is going to be a massive task. Right now, Monsters & Treasure is a color book, and needs to remain one. However, all those monsters that we want to include in it are black and white, we need them to be given the full color treatment. This means lots of work for several artists. Monsters that are duplicates or near duplicates will have to be reconciled. This is a lot of work for content editors. Everything will need to be laid out again. This is lots of work for graphics guys! And we want to include more art, some of these pictures need replaced, others need art!\nAll this added content will increase the Monsters & Treasure, 5th printing to a whopping 350 pages, at least.\nIts going to be a herculean task. And to bring it to pass, we are going to need your help!\nTo that end we are calling for a muster of Knights, Gamers, Enthusiasts, Grognards, Trolls and all the great hosts from all across the community to join us, pledge and help us make your game even better!\nWhat Rewards Your Pledge Reaps!\nPledge $19 and Receive\nMonsters & Treasure, 5th Printing, 350 pages (est.), Full Color.

Two monsters per sheet.\nOriginal M&T Poster! Signed by the Troll Lords!\n A Note on the Binder\nRemember AD&D 2nd Edition? Remember your binder full of monsters? Those were the good old days. Well, not entirely, as you\u2019re still in the good old days! Brought to you by Castles & Crusades, the first RPG that worked to capture the essence of play that Mr. Gygax and crew managed to do back in the 1980s! Well, we are following in his footsteps again with the C&C Monsters & Treasure Compendium/Binder. This 3\u201d binder will reflect the same quality that all TLG products do, and be manufactured of stout board, with 2\u201d slant d mounts that will hold up to 480 sheets of paper! Its going to be a keeper!\n A Note on the Special Collector's Books\nThese are highly crafted books, with dual embossed foil stamps, raised hubs on the spine, page marker, \"onion\" type page insert, with your names stamped on the front cover. Some of you may have picked up the Players Handbook in the PH7 Kickstarter, for a little less than we are asking here, but as you know from that Kickstarter we ended up upgrading from a different style of book.\nYou can see more about what this book will look like here in this video. You can purchase them here (there are only a few left).\n  We know diving in and supporting the 5th printing of any book\u2026even one that is going to be double its normal size\u2026is a tough decision and a heavy commitment. So, we want to make this worth your while. If you pledge now, and help us spread the word, as soon as we exceed out target goal, we\u2019ll include the following items!\n$10,000: Monsters & Treasure: Achieved! We are going to roll out the new, expanded Monsters & Treasure.\n$14,000: Appendix A Encounter by Terrain: Achieved! We will include an appendix of Encounter Charts by terrain. This will make encounters far easier. Available to all levels.\n$18,000: Appendix A Encounter Chart Expanded: Achieved! We will detail the encounter chart, staggering it by level/HD. Available to all levels.\n$20,000: Secret Chamber: Achieved! Steve Chenault will continue the adventures of Eurich Gunshoff in a second series of short stories. Join Eurich and Ave as they wander north into the Shelves of the Mist. This is a direct follow up to A Houseless God & Other Tales, just published and available here as an add on or, through our Store. A digital copy for $45.00 backer level, print and digital for $75+ backer levels.\n $500: Encounter Challenge: 17 Encounters Achieved! For every $500 we raise from this point going forward (starting at $20,000), we will take one monster from the Monsters & Treasure and design and write an encounter for it. We'll compile these into a PDF and release a digital version to everyone at the $19 level and above. If there are enough of them, we'll print it and ship it with your book for those who pledge $45 and above! Each encounter will be 1-2 pages long, include lead-up to, events surrounding, the monster and its peculiar habits, treasure and experience point value.\nBonus Book: Achieved! This past weekend we cleaned out the warehouse and mail room (way overdue) and have found that we have a few hundred Classic Monsters book left. As this book is being absorbed by Monsters & Treasure, we will discontinue it. So everyone who pledges $75 and above receives a free copy of Classic Monsters. It is hardback, black and white and will be on a first come, first serve basis, while supplies last. IF you have already pledges at 75 and above, you are already getting one!\n$22,000: Monster List Supplement: Achieved! Remember the DMG Monster List and the Monster list that appears in Classic Monsters? We'll bundle all this up into one nice little softcover book for you and send it your way! Digial copies for pledge level $45. Print and digital copies for pledge levels $75 and above.\n$25,000: The Siege Engine Book of Character Classes: Achieved! We are going to compile all the classes from the many books into one 40 page soft cover tome. Digital copies for pledge level $45.

If you are, the quick down and dirty is this: Castles & Crusades is an easy to learn, fast paced, table top role playing game that allows you to play one of 13 classes and any one of these races; dwarf, human, elf, halfling, half elf or half orc. It's stream-lined attribute check system (the SIEGE Engine) is the driving mechanic that allows your character to try almost anything they want to try with a simple role of a d20! It's fun for all ages, requires almost no set up and playable by anyone, almost anywhere (we wouldn\u2019t recommend playing on a surf board for instance).\nIf you want to know more follow this link: Castles & Crusades!\nYou can also join the Society and the Knights of the Crusade by following this link: SOCIETY.\nYou can also download the quick start rules that we released at ReaperCon last year.

In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in.

(Pledge manager will be available for backers.)\nWe at Black Scrolls Games are working on our products because they make our work easier as a Game Master, and game sessions are more enjoyable with them. We\u2019ve forged all of our experience and knowledge we collected as Game Masters and 3D artists in the past years into these tiles and we hope you will enjoy them at least as much as we enjoyed working on them. If you still have questions, please read the FAQs or write to us in the comment section, we will try to reply you as soon as we can.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nAlthough we funded Black Scrolls Games, our own company, a year ago, we have eight years of experience in the tabletop game business. We know that making a set takes time and releasing a new product is very risky for a small business like us. With the help of Kickstarter, it will be easier for us to manage our work and our other processes because we will see how many customers are interested in our gaming tiles and how many pieces we have to produce exactly. Also, with the help of the comment sections, we will know what you need.\n\nShipping \nIf you select a reward level that contains printed physical tiles, too, then there will be a shipping fee on the tiles. Although the best option would be a free shipping, unfortunately, these tiles are not lightweight things. We use the printing and shipping service of OneBookShelf (we worked with them many times before), that is why we can keep our price low and provide you the best quality in the meantime. \nBecause the tiles will be printed in the U.S., the fee will be the lowest for U.S. and Canadian customers, and a little bit higher for everyone else. If you select a higher reward level and/or more add-ons then we will ship the sets together and shipping fee will be lower per set (compared to separate shipping). \nWe have wider space to manage our revenue with the digital releases, so we can offer free shipping to the U.S. and even Canadian customers (and lowered shipping to everyone else) at higher reward levels!\n  We hope that with your help we can make those products you deserve as a Game Master.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already released 25 larger and smaller products as Black Scrolls Games since we started our company one and a half year ago and more than 100 products working with other publishers in the past eight years. We managed long projects, too, (some of them were 2 years long) and learned how to deliver on time and how to develop a product from scratch. Our experience of publishing and releasing products will help us to bring these products to you after this Kickstarter campaign. \nFrom the other side, we are working with proven printing and shipping service together which guarantee that there will not be any problem with the fulfillment process. \nMany of the elements of this project are already tested and designed and because of this, we don't see any reason for delay. If anything comes up we will let you know and tell you how we will handle and solve it. \nWe would like to tell you while this is our first self-run Kickstarter project here, it is not the first we helped to design and manage, so this process is not unfamiliar to us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE WATCHER", "descp": "Welcome aboard!\nSelect this reward level if you would like to support this campaign.

You have made the book far more than we ever had hoped! Trollzah!\nWHAT IS TOME OF THE UNCLEAN?\nTome of the Unclean is a monster source book for Castle & Crusades that includes a host of evil creatures. Divided up along the traditional lines of demons and devils, the Tome includes all your favorites and more. From the Demogorgon to Asmodeus and all the cohorts of hell and the abyss. Also included are a host of devils and demons from the world of Aihrde.\nAll with the amazing art of Jason Walton and Peter Bradley.\nSpecs: Right now the book stands at 112 pages, with about another 10 pages of monsters forthcoming and will eventually retail, in hardcover format, for $29.99.\nPURPOSE OF THE KICKSTARTER\nRight now, we intend to print this book in house as a softcover book. However, we would love to see this book join the rest of our books in the C&C line as a full hardcover book and expand aspects of the book we never intended, turning it from a simple monster book into something much more (see below).\nWHERE WE ARE TODAY\nThe book is largely written and much of the art is finished. We have only a dozen or so monsters to add. Creatures like the Lemure, the Solicitor and others. These will all be added to Tome regardless. One a day for each day of the Kickstarter (weekends might get muddled).\nWHAT WE WANT TO ADD\nSteve took up work on the Tome about mid-stride, while he was re-writing the Codex of Aihrde. What unfolded in the Codex opened up new vistas for him while thinking about the Tome. It occurred to him that the Twin Planes need to be more approachable, to allow players to dig into them and CKs to run them like never before. With that in mind, he's penned notes on just how to do that:\nThe Twin Planes both need to be expanded, with appropriate descriptions and the role of demons and devils that dwell there. We would like to expand on the roles, armies, designs and fortifications of the major devils and demons of both planes.\nJust surviving in the Twin Planes is never easy. How does one find food, water, or shelter? What are the mundane physical aspects of the Twin Planes.\nThe Flora of the Twin Planes, with a discussion on druids.\nClimate and Environs.\nTraveling.\nHow encounters might unfold and what it's like to adventure there. How to bring the chaos, madness, and suffering of hell to the game table.To include effects on the abyssal chaos.\nIt was suggested to him by multiple people, including Mark Sandy and Torsten Olafi, that the book needs a random demon generator, allowing for the chaos of the Abyss.\nWith another great suggestion, Torsten Olafi suggested expanding on the role of demons/devils in the campaign, what are their motivations, how to integrate these highly intelligent creatures into the game.\nPlayable Map of hell.\nABOUT THE TOME OF THE UNCLEAN\nTome of the Unclean has been available in a digital format for some time, or at least sections of it. The book originally penned by Kim Hartsfield and was released in serial digital format. Stephen Chenault (C&C PhB, CKG, all things Aihrde) took over the writing last year, adding a host of demons and devils, some traditional, others of his own creation (echoes of his dreaded campaigns in Aufstrag). He is presently going over the Tome revising monsters (making them a little more powerful), adding content and reorganizing some of the entries.\nMINIATURES\nThis is the prototype of a series of downloadable miniatures designed for your 3D printer, that we are working on. They are based on monsters from Tome of the Unclean. It has a ways to go, but we will get there. This Kickstarter is the perfect place to showcase it and the other nefarious beasts of the Twin Planes! It is available in the $59 and $125 pledge levels.\nLEATHER VERSION\nWe've altered our process from the previous leather versions. We are now included embossing, stamped, marker and more. Our first and recently shipped turned out beautiful. Tome of the Unclean will receive a similar treatment. The $125 level only.\nSUBSCRIBERS AND OBS BACKERS\nCheck your email. Check your email.

Fans of every fantasy game system will now have a common world to share.\nIn the future we hope to support more game systems. Loxley welcomes contact with all fellow creators and publishers.\nWhen you have the same scenery, it's easy to try the Intro version of another game system. It's a big world of tabletop gaming out there\u2014take a look around!\nYou\u2019ve seen the core team of 16 and the amazing list of legendary guests, 11 authors and 9 artists. You\u2019ve heard about the plan to provide game specifics (\u2018crunch\u2019) for 10 game systems. But what IS the Setting really? What\u2019s there now, and what\u2019s happening soon? Good question. It\u2019s complicated. For the long version click HERE; summary below.\nHistory: This continent is the original home of all demi-humans, who know how to get along with each other and with nature. Humans arrived, tried to conquer the place, but were forced to compromise because they didn\u2019t have an edge. Their realm, Empyrea, has evolved for 3 centuries. Their kings followed a three-prong strategy of cooperation: Minimize technology, promote magic (obeying the gods), Work with nature and the planet for long-term stability and health, and Support knowledge, the arts, and quality of life; avoid misuse of wealth and power.\nPlace: Empyrea is a rectangle. The left side is a coast with sea monsters. Mountains north, with giants. East is blocked, impassible terrain. Deepwood south, with creatures, then tribes, then evil armies -- and they\u2019re planning to visit soon.\nBelow is the primitive digital map that has been available to online players since 1992. Darlene is now rendering it in her unique style, Anna is transforming that into 3D imagery, and Alyssa is detailing cities and towns. Guest authors are detailing locations... Inns, ships, shops, and more.\nOnline campaign map 1992-present\nPeople: The dwur claim the land below, but most dislike sunlight, so noniz handle their surface business. The olve claim the woodlands, and many hobniz are in the gourmet trade near towns. Other \u2018niz (brownies and sprites and many more) are about, as are the Others, various odd monstrous races and variations.\nAction: Upcoming issues of the realm will emerge as time passes. The call to arms will sound, and the fate of the realm will be decided \u2013 perhaps by your characters! Will you run and hide, or are you a real Hero?\nHow To Play\n\nStart: Either your characters grew up here, or they popped in from another place. We\u2019ll provide guidelines for both, and three kits for suggested local character backgrounds (urban, farm, borderlands). In a starting adventure the characters meet and head out seeking fame and fortune.\nYour Stuff: You bring your characters, your game system, your style. Magic, monsters, gods? Use whatever you like. Empyrea will be the backdrop to your stories, just some new names at first. More is there when you\u2019re ready for it.  \nYou seem to be a serious hobby gamer. Consider this a useful tool, a 'second home'. This is a complicated fantasy campaign world, and we can only describe a small part of it in advance. So if you have questions, please post them on any of several sites available. We\u2019re still building that part of things, so bear with us, and help us grow!  \nQueen Nuana and King John IV\n  With the Quick Start Guides (presenting character backgrounds from city, farm, and wilderness life) and starter Adventures, you\u2019ll be playing immediately and learning fast. Supporting materials include the Empyrea Core Book, Player\u2019s Handbook, full color Darlene maps, 3 \"Little Brown Books\", and a System Book with your preferred FRP rules.\nImagine a game world that we all share, and one that you can shape. All subscribers can add their own designs to the official Worlds of Empyrea\u2014realms that are mostly empty, waiting for you.\nSee your own inn or tavern come to life! Or is it a shop within a Royal City? Maybe it's an entire dungeon! (Guidelines coming soon.)\nWith names like Darlene, Elmore, Easley, Jaquays, Otus, Dee, and more, you know the artwork will be of the highest caliber with that \"old-school\" feel. Speaking of Darlene, here's the Empyreal Valley, newly rendered in her famous style (caution, flashback to 1983):\n  You will receive at least 350* pages of goodness: \n \nEmpyrea Core Book (perfect bound softback, full color, UV laminated) \nEmpyrea Player\u2019s Guide (perfect bound softback, full color, UV laminated)\nFull Color 2-part Darlene Map detailing the entire Realm of Empyrea\nThree \"Little Brown Books\" with special details for players and game masters\nA System Book** with rules for playing in Empyrea using the RPG of your choice\n* 350 pages or more; we reserve the right to add more cool stuff if we can.

As you begin to step onto the trail, you hear a guttural and deep laughing sound followed by a scream.\nAnd thus with such simple beginnings, the characters find themselves embroiled with deific wars which have raged since the fall of the Dragon.\nAn adventure designed for 3-5 player characters between levels 4 and 6.\nWhat is Beneath the Black Moon?

At which point do the pawns control the board or fall, as sacrifice, to protect bishops, knights, kings and queens. Navigating the miasma of Bergholt\u2019s avaricious and power hungry denizens is a precarious balancing over pits of fire and brimstone. Tread carefully for every friend is an enemy and every enemy a friend.\nYour Game, Your World, Inzae, Aihrde\nDavis has created the world of Inzae. This is where all of his adventures take place. Much of that material was released in the first Kickstarter and the primer is below, you can download it for free. Beneath the Black Moon takes place in the city of Bergholt. BUT if you want to play Beneath the Black Moon in your home brew world or even in the world of Aihrde, all you'll need is a city to move the adventure to...but it should be a pretty violent city.\nThe series so far:\nDeath in the Treklant\nBy Shadow of Night\nBeneath the Black Moon\nAbout the Inzae Castle Keepers Screens: These screens are made with our signature board, and consist of 2 two-panels screens.

Forefront is the home of the Agleburstin Konzern. A wooden sign has been hammered upon the lintel above the door. Upon this are painted a shovel and pick, crossed and poised over a talus mound. A row of windows stretches up above the door, all shuttered, as if several one-eye beasts sat atop one another and shut their eyes to the world.\nMinfrit de Balgusser had been expecting someone to answer his request.

Bring him back - alive. Simple. Real simple.\nAbout the The Burning Firmament\nMore adventure in the Halptier! A swarm of those fiendish zjerd have descended upon Volfzberg in a fury. Taken completely by surprise, the town\u2019s soldiery scrambled to action, manning the walls, calling the citizens to arms and setting their defenses in order. The desperate actions of these brave soldiers prevented the city from collapsing immediately and the walls and gates were held. But before the sun set, the flaming kettles of oil descended upon the city like a fiery rain. Panic ensued!\nThe characters are caught in a hellish inferno!

You\u2019ve probably played several of them, if not a veritable host of them. You\u2019ve hacked your way through the simple, and you\u2019ve trudged your way through the complex. They all offer a little something, it's why you keep playing.\nAs you know, all FRPGs are driven by some mechanic. Some are highly intricate, others very simple. You use them to establish the game you want to play. From fast paced to high tactical combat rules to opposed checks on interactions with NPCs. It\u2019s all part of the gaming landscape you\u2019ve helped create.\nI\u2019m the same as you. I\u2019ve tried a host of games and a host of rule sets. My game of choice was always AD&D\u2026I played it even after we released Castles & Crusades. I only stopped my AD&D game when the designers (both regular players at my table) revolted and said no more AD&D until I at least tried C&C once. I reluctantly agreed.\nI\u2019ve never gone back.\n*The above photo was taken at All Things Fun in West Berlin, New Jersey, a fantastic store! Check it out if you are in the area.\nIt\u2019s Your Game! Take it!\nYou\u2019ll find with C&C that the game is easy to play, but more importantly is its versatility. You can take your house rules and drop them right on top of the C&C mechanic (the Siege Engine) and keep on playing. You are in control. Take the advantage/disadvantage system from 5E and use it with C&C. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\nWhat\u2019s even better, because the whole game is driven by attribute checks that have only loose guidelines, the game master chooses what attribute check the player rolls. If they want the wizard to swim better, make the character roll an intelligence check to swim the river. It\u2019s your game. Take it.\nHow does the Siege Engine Work?\nYou are already familiar with Castles & Crusades.\nYou\u2019ll find the same classes, races, attributes and many of the same monsters as in most other games.\nTo succeed at any action, you need to make an attribute check (unless the CK deems it doesn\u2019t need one)\nThere are two types of attributes: Primary & Secondary\nPrimary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12 on a d20. Secondary have a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK adds a challenge level based on hit dice and other circumstance. The character adds their attribute bonus and level to their roll.\nYou are playing C&C.\nIt's fast, versatile and open. Allowing you to make it as complex or as simple as you desire.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt\u2019s easy to use for the whole community. This cuts out you having to set up accounts on the TLG website. Reserve your copy today with one easy step.\nENJOY PETER BRADLEY'S ART? Check out his coloring book! On Kickstarter NOW!\nCollector's Cloth Edition\nWe are going to print a collector's edition, signed and numbered on onion skin inside the book. Produced with a Skivertex Vellin Cloth Cover, with Embossed titling. Also has an embossed silk screen depicting art from many editions on the cover, a ribbon marker and your name stamped on the front cover!\nAbout the Alternate Cover\nWe are going to give Jason Walton a shout and to do a new, alternate cover for us. He's the guy who brought you this cover:\n What is Castles & Crusades? \nCastles & Crusades is one of the longest running Table Top RPGs on the market today. Castles & Crusades is a fantasy role playing game where players create characters based on the very simple easy to follow rules of the C&C Players Handbook and conduct adventures run by a game master, the Castle Keeper. It's fun, easy, and offers countless hours of entertainment from role playing to magic wielding and sword swinging...all from the comfort and safety of your dining room table! Learn more HERE!\nA Little Background\nThirteen years ago, in 2004-2005, we launched what was then a ground-breaking fantasy RPG. Going against a decade of game design, that saw fantasy RPGs develop ever more intricate rules systems, we decided to turn the horse around. Desiring a simple, fast-paced game we developed an attribute check system (first called the EGG system, but later renamed to the SIEGE Engine) that was just that. Everything non-combat related was solved by attribute checks, frequently chosen by the Castle Keeper (GM). What followed was an insanely easy game, that one could learn to play in a matter of minutes. It allowed for rapid play, particularly in combat situations, but more importantly by releasing the constraints of rules it opened up the table to the imagination of all concerned. Now, anything was possible.\nSix printings later\u2026not including the starter sets, White Box, Flip Books and countless digital copies sold\u2026Castles & Crusades is going stronger than ever.\nWe\u2019ve sold out of the 6th printing and moving on to the 7th printing.\nThis book will go to print in the next few weeks, but we are here offering it to the Kickstarter community for as low a price as we can manage. This allows our old guard to pick it up if they desire, and new people to buy in if they\u2019ve always wanted to or are just hearing about us. It\u2019s our way of thanking the gaming community all for these years of support!\nWHAT\u2019S CHANGED?  \nThat is the inevitable question that many long-time fans are going to ask. Almost nothing. We\u2019ve corrected a few typos, put some class lists in alphabetical order and moved a little text. But beyond that this book will be the same book as the 6th printing. The cover itself is part of a larger 4-panel piece that includes the Castle Keepers Guide, Monsters & Treasure and Adventurers Backpack, so changing it is not in the cards.\nHowever, to mark this momentous occasion we are offering an all Cloth Edition of the book. This will come with onion skin signing page signed by Stephen Chenault, Davis Chenault and Mac Golden. It will also include some very nice design work. These will only be available through this Kickstarter. It will not be sold separately.\nADD ONS\nAs you can imagine 13 years of game publishing have created a mountain of support material.

They look so great all together on the shelf.", "time": "about 4 years ago"}]}}, {"backer": "Omote", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Perilous Vistas \nThe latest additions to the Perilous Vistas: Mountains of Madness and Marshes of Malice are environment sourcebooks that delve into the foreboding mountains and explore the mysterious wetlands respectively.\nThe Perilous Vistas line brings the great outdoors to life. Like their predecessors, the highly acclaimed Dunes of Desolation and Fields of Blood, Mountains of Madness and Marshes of Malice are black and white, 225+ page supplements that build upon real world details and their gaming applications to provide all of the essentials and extras to run campaigns set in one of these remarkable biomes.\nThese huge Tomes are all well-researched and use real-world information tailored to meet fantasy roleplaying rules that create a feel of \"really being there\" in each terrain type. For example, we engaged a professional mountain guide, Nate Paul, to work with us on Mountains--so the travel and skill rules were in part developed by a real-life mountaineer!\nThe two new books include:\nMountains of Madness\nMountains of Madness naturally focuses its attention on mountains, the mighty, stone behemoths that soar into the heavens. In particular, it details the Stoneheart Mountains, renowned as the spine of the Lost Lands Campaign Setting and the backdrop for other legendary adventures including The Slumbering Tsar Saga and Sword of Air, all from Frog God Games. \nMarshes of Malice\nMarshes of Malice examines the semi-aquatic world that straddles the open seas and the wholly terrestrial with special emphasis on previously unexplored or underdeveloped regions in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting. Both supplements introduce new natural and manmade hazards, innovative feats, equipment, alchemical substances, magic items, spells and archetypes that can aid or hinder brave mountaineers aspiring to conquer the majestic peaks and intrepid adventurers endeavoring to tame the feral wetlands. Wondrous illustrations accompany the frightful, new denizens that call these lands home. \nWhat you get inside\nMountains of Madness features an expansive prologue that describes the rustic town of Miners\u2019 Refuge along with four interconnected adventures that take characters from 3rd to 9th levels and flesh out the Stoneheart Mountains region with extensive details about the fabled Dwarven strongholds of Erod Flan and Tyr Whin. Although designed as an adventure path, the quartet can be run independently as well. \nMarshes of Malice, on the other hand, include three completely autonomous adventures that take the characters on terrifying journeys into the depths of the bleakest swamps and the bottomless chasm of the darkest souls. These horrific tales occur in the dreaded Dyrgalas Fens, which appeared in the Quests of Doom adventure \"Death in Dyrgalas\", the Dragonmarsh Lowlands, which is touched upon in Rappan Athuk and the introduction of the previously unexplored Wytch\u2019s Bog. Despite the fact that the adventures take place in locales that appear in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting, the extensive scientific and game mechanics regarding these two environments can be applied to all mountainous and wetlands campaigns regardless of their setting. Likewise, with a few minor adjustments, the adventures can be effectively run anywhere.  \nWith the release of these two sourcebooks for Pathfinder, GMs and players alike can incorporate a wealth of knowledge and groundbreaking ideas to breathe fresh imagination and insight into any excursion to the summits of the highest peaks and the bowels of the dreariest swamps. All it takes is one courageous first step. \nSo pledge to today help Frog God Games provide your players some unsafe spaces!        \nADDED BONUS\nAt funding all backers get a the PDF that started it all, Glades of Death!\n\nA Druid's Revenge Can your PCs make it through the forest on the way to their final destination? Will they be ensnarled in the mystery of dreaded ghoul wolves, or become entangled in a battle between druids and insects that is slowly destroying a small logging village in their way? Are your PCs strong enough to enter the Canyons of Arcuri? Perhaps, they are even bold enough to enter the private, forested demiplane of the mad druid Niavark.  \nRead the Leaves Make PCs fear the forest! Glades of Death\u2122 contains new spells, new feats, and a new look at skills and how to use them in the wilderness. Guidelines for the rapid creation of new fantasy forests are also provided along with new monsters and four generic forest-based adventures designed to help bring a campaign out of the dungeon and into the wilderness.  \nGetting Your Rewards\nPDF Reward Distribution  \nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your pdf; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers. Our process is what gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.  \nShipping for Physical Products \nThe shipping is collected in Backerkit. When our backerkit site for the project is ready you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards and checkout through their system. It is during this checkout that shipping cost is calculated and charged. \nAdd Ons\nOther books from the Perilous Vistas seemed appropriate, so we decided to discount the existing ones!\nFields of Blood-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only add-on.\nThe endless fields of waving grains and scrub brush\u2014many see them as featureless wastes, places to be crossed in a journey with little to catch the eye or divert the attention, but these vast seas of grass play home to many terrible beasts, deadly challenges, and amazing tales all hiding just beneath the thin veneer of featureless expanses. Fields of Blood takes a close look at these lands often taken for granted as realms of excitement and mystery and injects them with new life.\nWith cultural elements and traditions taken from the American Great Plains, the African Savannah, and the Mongolian Steppes, Fields of Blood provides new rules for plains environments, hazards, travel, skills and feats, equipment, monsters, deities, spells, and archetypes. In addition, Fields of Blood includes three ready-to-play adventures for introducing your players into the endless expanse of the grassy sea with \u201cFeast of Fury\u201d, \u201cRed Wedding\u201d, and \u201cMadness Grows\u201d.\nFields of Blood provides rules and options for any plains campaign. While its adventures can easily be set in any plains campaign, they are, however, official Lost Lands setting adventures intended for characters of levels 1\u20137+. They include plains terrain, dungeon, and village encounters and are written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nDunes of Desolation-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only-add-on.\nIn a land where the sun relentlessly bakes its sandy surface, water is king. In the desert, the life-sustaining fluid is more valuable than the most precious metals, desirable gems and mightiest weapons. Most adventurers believe that the scarcity of water makes the desert an\ninhospitable place devoid of life, riches and challenges.\nThe incessant glare of a distant, roiling inferno, the intolerable heat of day, the monotonous expanses of sand and the fierce winds are enough to break the will of any man or beast, but natives and experienced adventurers know that the dunes conceal many secrets and treasures. Scratch a few feet beneath the surface and the wondrous ruins of lost cities miraculously come to life. Some of these settlements succumbed to the natural forces of the desert, while vengeful deities, demons or spirits condemned others to an eternity beneath the dunes.\nMarvelous oases abounding with life and mystery also dot the forbidding landscape. Those fortunate enough to discover these refuges are delighted to find fresh water, but danger often lurks amid the lush vegetation or beneath the surface of the water. Those intrepid souls hardy enough to brave the elements and explore the wonders of this harsh terrain are well-rewarded for their efforts.\nDead Man's Chest \n($40K stretch goal for hardcovers to be unlocked)-$28 Softcover/$10 PDF unless we hit the hardcover stretch goal!  \nNo place offers more adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper surface. Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling. Dead Man's Chest lays bare the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration, and three complete maritime adventures. At last there is a comprehensive source for sailing and the sea-packed with over 100 new magic items, monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells.\nRazor Coast Party Pack Plus Dead Man's Chest!\nThe Razor Coast Party Pack (includes the softcover Pathfinder Dead Man's Chest) - $120\nIncludes the following-\nRazor Coast Hardcover Book  \n4 copies of the Freebooters Guide to the Razor Coast  \nHeart of the Razor Hardback Book\nPLUS Softcover Dead Man's Chest (this is Kickstarter exclusive and does not come with the party pack at the web store for the same price)\nFire as She Bears  \n$9 Hardcover, $5 PDF Add-on\nBuilding on the winning entries of a contest to create new rules, authors Lou Agresta and John Ling, with contributions from James MacKenzie, wrote a book to empower players and GMs to fight cinematic \u201cMaster and Commander\u201d style ship battles in Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry that stay true to the spirit of history and Age of Sail realities. This complete 96 page subsystem of ship-to-ship combat, includes over 35 new magic items for characters and ships, new feats, new uses for familiar skills, new weapons and equipment, new spells, and best of all? Roll up and equip an Age of Sail warship just like you\u2019d design a new character \u2013 in as little as 30 minutes.\nStoneheart Valley $13 Hardcover/$10 PDF\nFrom Bill Webb and Clark Peterson's home campaign comes the old-school setting of The Lost Lands: Stoneheart Valley. For over a decade, fans of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games have been asking to see the world behind the adventures. And at long last, here is where it all began, in the Stoneheart Valley near the town of Fairhill. This mini-campaign was originally presented to the fans of Necromancer Games in three separate modules: \"The Wizard's Amulet\", \"The Crucible of Freya\", and \"The Tomb of Abysthor\". Frog God Games has taken the full series from the 3E version plus supplemental material previously available only online, and converted it all to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous Kickstarter programs in the past, including projects involving printed cards.

I started with the 1982-1994 carded figures (which can be viewed on the Yearbook page) and then moved into documenting the vehicle boxes, catalogs and offers, books, newsletters, puzzles, posters and more. All are accessible via the print and licensed tabs at 3DJoes.\nOnce the art is photographed and scanned, we digitally restore these files by removing creases, tears, price tags, hand writing and the like to create as clean an image as possible.\nDigital Art Restoration\nEnter 3DJoes posters.\nBefore long, I had collected and documented enough carded figures to start making posters. Back in 2014 I ran a kickstarter and funded printing of 3 new posters! These posters are still for sale, and proceeds help cover the $1,750 a year it costs to run 3DJoes. You can pick these up for $10 each through this kickstarter!\nEnter Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volumes 1 \u2013 3!\nI fielded countless requests for a G.I.Joe art book since the first carded figure poster debuted. Most often people tell me they love the posters but they are running out of wall space. So, over the last two years I ran three kickstarters to print Accufoil Softcovers of Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 1 (1982-1983), Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 2 (1984-1985), and Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 3 (1986-1987)!\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volumes 1\u20133 (1982-1987) with Accufoil covers\n We delivered all three volumes on time as promised, thanks in large part to some fantastic print vendors and my local Triangle Joes who pitched in and helped me with fulfillment.\nTriangle Joes to the rescue!\nNow it\u2019s time for Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volume 4!\nFlash forward a few months and thanks to Chad Hucal, we are ready to go to press with Volume 4! Volume 1 featured 62 unique pieces of art, Volume 2 featured 95, and Volume 3 featured 126. Volume 4 is bigger than ever, featuring 147 unique pieces of art! You can preview the entire book here. \nThe cover will once again be card stock with an AccuFoil print, and the 80# pages will be saddle stitched, so the two page 11x16\u201d spreads can lay flat and art will not be lost to the gutter! You\u2019ll be glad to know the price hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019re holding the line at $35 for the Accufoil Softcover.\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 4 (1988\u20131989) is ready to print!\n  The 3DJoes poster series continues!\nNow that all of the 1988-1989 artwork has been restored, it is time to continue the 3DJoes poster series! We will produce two new 24\u201dx36\u201d posters, one featuring the figures and another featuring the vehicles.\n1988-1989 Vehicles and 1988-1989 Figures\nHow about some pristine Catalog Art posters too?! \nThese two posters are very special. They feature the 1986 and 1987 catalog art like you\u2019ve never seen them before! We were able to secure two original Kodak Ecktachromes of the original catalog paintings. These are basically two super high resolution transparencies used back in the analog 80s to deliver high resolution artwork. We\u2019ve scanned these Ecktachromes and restored the scans to remove dust and any other unintended artifacts. The resulting posters will be a centerpiece of your collection.\nCatalog Art from 1986 and 1987!\n  STRETCH GOAL! Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant!\n Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant offset lithograph print! \nMany of you have asked for a life-sized Defiant box art print, so that's what we are going for next! The life-size Defiant print will measure 28.5\u201dx47\u201d just like the original box art. It will cost $4,558 to print. Add in 25% for shipping and 10% for Kickstarter fees and we'll need to raise another $6,276.25 to get there. Oversized lithographs are terribly expensive, but we are happy to try to make this happen. If you want to see this poster come to life, add $30 to your poster pledge and tell all of your like-minded friends about this project. Thanks and Yo JOE! \nPROJECT EXPENSES:\n$7,605 Volume 4 (offset interiors, foil cover, bagged, 650 copies) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $10,456.88\n$5,792 Four 24\u201dx36\u201d posters (1000 of each) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $7,964\nGOAL: $18,420.88 \n$4,558 Life Size 28.5\u201dx47\u201d Defiant (1000 prints) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $6,276.25\nSTRECH GOAL: $24,688.13\n*Surprise* Your reward for scrolling to the end is the stretch goal spoiler! I'm setting the goal for this Kickstarter at $18,420, and have offered rewards featuring the first goal's deliverables. If we approach the third goal, all poster backers will be allowed to add a life sized Defiant poster to their order for just $30!  \nPlease have a look at the rewards, back this project today, and tell your friends to jump in too.\nThanks and Yo Joe!\nCarson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges \nI have already successfully produced the Volume 1 book and six 24\u201dx36\u201d offset posters with two very reliable local vendors. I do not foresee any issues with getting all three of these new posters and books produced quickly and to the highest quality.\n\nTo see the progress of a previous poster, have a look at this album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=569139369809294\n\nA note about quality: these posters, like the six previously produced, will be professional grade. You will not be disappointed! Check out the specs below and my eBay feedback.\n\nPaper details: All 3DJoes posters are printed on 65 lb. sterling premium gloss paper stock. According to my printer, 65 pound paper is the thickest you can use and still roll them without creasing or damaging. It wont easily crease, pinch, or wrinkle. These posters are definitely frame worthy, but the paper is thick enough that if you just want to tack them up, that will work too.\n\nPrinting details: We use a four color printing process (CMYK), not digital. Four color prints are much higher quality than digital laser prints. To see behind the scenes at the printer, check out my \"3DJoes of the 80s\" album on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=488035281253037\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "\"1988-1989 POSTERS\" (vehicles+figures)", "descp": "The 3DJoes poster series continues!

From the core of a raging storm you appeared\u2014a human child, ship-wrecked and orphaned, a gift of hope to the exiled Shianti sorcerers. Ever since that fateful night they have raised you as one of their own, teaching you the mysteries of their magic in preparation for an epic quest. The time has now come. You must find the legendary Moonstone and with its power crush the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki.\nFor only you can save the land of your birth from the cruel grip of his empire. But be warned! Ahead lies a terrifying journey into the unknown where survival or death confronts you with every turn of the page.\nGrey Star the Wizard was originally published in 1985 as the first gamebook in a mini-series set in the world of Lone Wolf, created by Joe Dever and written by Ian Page.\nThe series plays for the most part at the tip of south-eastern Magnamund, in the land then known as the Shadakine Empire.\n\nLone Wolf cartograph Francesco Mattioli has been commissioned by Megara Entertainment to produce an all-new map of this Empire, available as a laminated full-colour map in the 50 euros pledge level.\nNew Collector's Edition laminated map by Francesco Mattioli for Megara Entertainment\nA tyrant called Shasarak the Wytch-King has subjugated the people and with the help of seven Shadaki Wytches is ruling with an iron fist.\nThe Shianti, members of a mystical race, wish to help, but because of their exile on the Isle of Lorn they are forced to remain neutral in the conflict. However, one night the situation changes when a storm wrecks a vessel near the island, with a human infant being the only survivor.\nIn this child the Shianti see a chance to help the people of Magnamund without breaking their vow to Ishir, and they raise the boy in the arts of magic, giving him the name Grey Star: the star as the symbol of hope, and grey for the white-grey streak the boy has in his dark hair.\nOnce his training is complete, Grey Star is sent out to retrieve the Moonstone, an ancient Shianti artefact, from the Daziarn, for only with its power can Shasarak be defeated.\nSOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 1) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\nThe first book of the series details Grey Stars travel to the Shadakine Empire and his desperate attempt to find a guide to lead him to the Shadow Gate.\n\nNow, more than 30 years later, this first gamebook is back with this deluxe, enlarged, hardback Collector's edition by Megara Entertainment we hope to fund on Kickstarter.\nAs the original pocket-sized interior 1985 illustrations by Paul Bonner could not be retrieved from the original publisher or from Paul himself, we decided at Megara Entertainment (with Joe Dever's blessing) to contact the mythical (and original) Lone Wolf artist Gary Chalk to re-illustrate the whole gamebook at a higher resolution (the Collector's Edition being larger).\nTo our pleasure, he agreed to re-illustrate entirely the book with all-new  interior drawings and a brand new cover for this Collector's Edition.\nThe result is truly amazing.

Leather copy of the book\nWhat is the Adventurers Backpack?\nThe Castles & Crusades Adventurers Backpack represents the largest expansion of the Castles & Crusades RPG since its inception with what is essentially a second Players Handbook and a deck of Equipment Cards.\nThe Castle Keepers Guide delivered a voluminous amount of gaming material to the CK. The Codex of Aihrde and Players Guide to Aihrde brought the world of Aihrde to life in amazing detail for all players.\nBut now The Adventurers Backpack is presented to the player with content to match -- if not exceed -- that of the original Players Handbook.\nNew classes include:  archer, avatar, oathsworn, magic user, thief, urban ranger, primal druid, milesian bard and more!\nNew spells, for all classes whether in the ABP or the PH, based on an old twist. Equipment revisited. Other notes and observations all designed, we hope, to speed up your game. With the main game book come the Equipment Cards, all designed to speed things up and make game play all that easier.\nFunding Goals: This project has already funded and will appear as a 150+ page full color hardback book. If we hit $26,000 then we'll expand the Equipment Deck by 2 Joker Cards, these will be signed and personalized with boons and discounts on them (Kickstarter backers only). $59.00+. \nNever  Played C&C? Download Under the Blood Red Moon for a free copy of one of our Open and Play books. This one has all the rules you need to play written into the adventure. It also doubles as an Amazing Adventures Open and Play as well.\nThe Dice Bag\n Equipment Cards Front and back.\nHere is an update video that explains a little about the backpack from the $200 level!\nPLAY\n\nNew to Castles & Crusades? You can purchase the whole game down below in the Ad On section! And if you request it we can make arrangements with you to ship the game as soon as the Kickstarter closes and your pledge is confirmed!\nEarly Bird info: Brett Bolan dove in at the last minute and closed out the early bird backers with pledge #172! Trollzah!\nMore on the Adventurers Backpack\nThe Adventurers Backpack first appeared in the C&C Black Box on the 40th anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons. In it we presented some new spells, and some new classes. This was only a teaser for future endeavors.\nThe future has arrived. Stephen Chenault finalized the content for the ABP September, 2016 and enlisted Peter Bradley to begin working on the art. What the book holds, and promises, is both a massive expansion of player-based content (classes, spells and more) as well as a new look at equipment and with this new look comes a new tool: the equipment cards.\nWhat is in the Adventurers Backpack?\nBack in the day, we played AD&D like there was no tomorrow, often 2-3 times a week. When the AD&D Unearthed Arcana came out, it gave our game a rush of adrenaline. The new content\u2026classes, spells, equipment, etc\u2026offered just what we needed, just when we needed it. That is the goal of the Adventurers Backpack. Castles & Crusades has been out for 12 years, and as good as it is, it could use a jolt of adrenaline.\nThe Adventures Backpack will include the following\n13 new classes\nNew Non-derivative spells\nA new approach on counter spells and canceling spells\n34 different backpacks offerings an easier and faster way to equip\nA fresh easier to use approach to Unarmed Combat\nMagic Items for classes who have few to choose from\nA look at the Archetype\nThe End Game, why old characters never die\nA note on the spells. The spells presented in the ABP will be non-derivative spells (all new, not based on others) and many will follow the level-growth concept that drives the SIEGE Engine. In other words, there will be far more spells that spell-casters can use at lower levels, but that grow in power as the caster grows in power.This gives the spell-caster far spells to use when they begin, making play much more enjoyable.\nWhat are the Equipment Cards?\nDuring the creation process equipping a character can be a time-consuming task. To speed the process up, the ABP will include 34 different backpack options that include basic and expert dungeon backpacks, basic and expert overland backpacks and class related backpacks. Each backpack comes equipped with what your character needs to plunge into a world of adventure.\nFor ease of access, we\u2019ll supply a deck of cards (34 right now) with all the backpacks and their contents set before you. All you need to do is buy weapons and armor, and a backpack and your character is equipped and ready to go! There will be multiple of some cards, allowing for repetition between players.\nPLEDGE LEVELS AND REWARDS\nPledge Levels\n$1: Join the fun.\n$20: PDF of the Adventurers Backpack\n$40: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack\n$59: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch\n$150: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book\n$200: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book, Leather copy of the book\nPledge at $59.00 and above and receive this dice pouch:\nPledge $150 and above and receive this back pack and the contents within:\n   STRETCH REWARDS\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED!\n$11,000 Print ABP: Achieved!

But what does their future hold? To escort the royal envoy to the Horasian Empire, the heroes must plan the travel route, but are the roads passable at this time of year, or should they risk a voyage by sea? The Cyclopes possess ancient secrets of the forge, which they sometimes share with fellow smiths, but would a curious dwarf be welcome on their island home? The last of Borbarad\u2019s lieutenants has been defeated at tremendous cost, but does this mean the heroes may safely explore the Shadowlands, or does some malignant force still hide there, biding its time and waiting for the world to grow complacent once again?\nThe Aventuria Almanac answers all these questions and more!\nChapters explore such topics as the land and the various races that dwell therein, the means of travel by road and water, the tumultuous history of Aventuria, the distractions of peace and the horrors of war, the trade routes and economies that support the wealth of empires, and the omnipresent faith of the gods, which so strongly shapes the lives of everyone on the continent. New monsters crawl forth from their lairs to claim the unwary, and the archdemons, the implacable enemies of the Twelvegods, finally show their true faces.\n  The fantastic world of The Dark Eye has been evolving for more than 30 years, and much has changed. Explorers have even discovered a few new continents, but Aventuria was where it all started, and Aventuria remains the centerpiece of the game. The Aventuria Almanac is your passport to this exciting world.\nThe Aventuria Almanac gives your roleplaying group a common starting point for adventure. It allows new players to quickly get their bearings in the game world, while the comprehensive index and clear organization let experienced players catch up on current affairs and rediscover a long-cherished game setting. With one exception, players may read freely, making this the perfect sourcebook for players and GMs alike!\nAs a GM, let this book serve as the foundation for your campaign and a springboard from which to create new adventures. Game masters will appreciate the Almanac\u2019s special GM-only chapter, which includes game stats and introduces new mysteries and locales for the heroes to explore.\n  Fans of The Dark Eye know to expect deep content and evocative art from our books, and the Aventuria Almanac more than lives up to expectations. Highlights include the following:\nChapter 1: The Continent of Aventuria takes a closer look at the geography of Aventuria, the effects of weather, and the rigors of travel by sea, land, and even magical roads.\nChapter 2: Races explores the nature of the dominant intelligent races dwelling on the continent, namely humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and lizardfolk. This chapter also offers a tantalizing peek at beings that prefer to remain elusive.\nChapter 3: The Land and People goes into great detail on the many kingdoms and realms of Aventuria and their greatest cities. This chapter also takes a look at other continents, such as Gyldenland, the ancestral homeland of the Thorwalers, and Uthuria, the mysterious jungle continent that is sometimes referred to as Land of 12,000 Gods.\nChapter 4: Culture and Science explores the many languages, writing systems, and secret tongues encountered all across Aventuria, as well as the origins and use of common idioms, superstitions, and forms of greeting. Peruse the calendars and dating systems by which most Aventurians measure time, plan for holiday celebrations and feasts, study the origin myths of the world, learn the stars and constellations in the night sky, and find your place in the feudal system (or try to purchase the rights of a free citizen). Join the army and serve god and monarch, play a round of cards, darts, or other games of chance at the local pub, invent a new telescope and dare to look up at the realm of the gods, compose a new opera and gain the favor of the crown, seek knowledge in the incredible libraries of Hesinde, plumb the depths of alchemy, and learn to recognize and treat deadly and fearsome diseases before its too late.\nChapter 5: Trade and Commerce examines the coinage of the various realms, policies of international exchange, and a new invention called the Promissory Note. Make plans to attend the local trade fair or market, but first, brush up on your knowledge of weights and measures to ensure you get what you pay for. Last but not least, this chapter takes a closer look at taxes and levies, two of the most important aspects of life in the realms.\nChapter 6: Flora and Fauna explores the myriad creatures that live in the waters, forests, mountains, and deserts of Aventuria. Entries include ancient enemies such as orcs and ogres, lurking threats such as cave spiders and crypt louses, the deadly krakennewt, feared by sailors above all else, and also several mundane (but by no means harmless) creatures such a giant black bears and wild boars. Plants get their due as well, as these pages delve into herb lore that some agencies have tried to suppress.\n Chapter 7: Gods and Demons takes a look at the mighty Twelvegods, exploring their histories, creeds, Churches, and relationships with the other religions of Aventuria. Not to be ignored are the archdemons, the eternal enemies of the Twelve, and the entity known as the Nameless One, perhaps the most dangerous foe of all.\nChapter 8: Magic and Witchcraft delves into the nature and history of magic and its many forms, and introduces the workings of the secretive sumu, sometimes referred to as druids. Topics include new Traditions, magical artifacts, magical creatures, and the role of magic in everyday life.\nChapter 9: Fame and Infamy introduces the reader to some of the most famous and infamous personalities in Aventuria, ranging from the exalted Empress Rohaja of Gareth to the dreaded night elf sorceress, Pardona. The voices of power and wisdom speak from within these pages, and it would serve you well to listen\u2026\n Chapter 10: Myth and History covers the history of the world of Dere and the continent of Aventuria. It starts by examining various creation myths and what little is known of prehistoric times. The chapter then discusses the first human kingdoms, the rise and fall of the Empire of Bosparan, and the realms and events shaping the world today. The capstone is a summary of the extraordinary and earth-shattering Starfall, which heralds a period of change that will shake Aventuria to its foundations.\nChapter 11: Mystery and Arcana is for GM-eyes only, so we won\u2019t spoil anything here. Suffice it to say that, if one were to look within these pages, one might learn much about the hidden servants the Nameless One and the secret history of Borbarad. This chapter expands on the material from other chapters and contains stats, secrets, and mysteries enough to keep your games running for years.\nA Look Inside\n(Keep an eye on the Ulisses North America blog for more detailed page previews!)\nSupport the Aventuria Almanac Kickstarter today and get ready for adventure!\n  Our intention with the pledge levels is to keep them as straightforward as possible.

Talanian (Castle Zagyg, Charnel Crypt of the Sightless Serpent, Mystery at Port Greely). It is a role-playing game inspired by the fiction of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith, with rules descended from the original 1974 fantasy wargame and miniatures campaign rules as conceived by E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. \nThe heroes of an AS&SH game delve dungeons filled with horrifying monsters, lethal traps, and bewildering puzzles; they explore savage wilderness frontiers and hostile borderlands; they probe ancient ruins and investigate cursed tombs; they match steel against sorcery and sorcery against steel; and they plunder for gold, gems, and magical treasure.\nAS&SH art by Johnathan Bingham\nHYPERBOREA is the default campaign setting for Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea. This \u201cflat earth\u201d realm is hemmed in by the mystical boreas (\u201cNorth Wind\u201d), and under the scarlet light of a bloated, dying sun, its roiling seas spill eternal over the world\u2019s rim. Hyperborea is in a perpetual state of decay, populated by disharmonious men, hostile monsters, and weird, alien beings.\nAS&SH art by Jason Sholtis\nWhat Kind of Character Can I Play?\nAstonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea embraces traditional character archetypes with subclasses thereof.

Some examples include Amazons, Atlanteans, Esquimaux, Hyperboreans, Ixians, Kelts, Kimmerians, Lemurians, Picts, and Vikings. These are inspired by pulp fiction, mythology, and history.\nAS&SH art by Del Teigeler\nFor What Awards Has AS&SH Been Nominated?\nAfter the original boxed set edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea was released in 2012, it was nominated for several awards.\n   North Texas RPG Con 2013, Three Castles RPG Design Award\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Best Game\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Best Production Values\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Product of the Year\nTell Me More about This New Edition!\nThe Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea will be presented in sturdy hardback format, with Smyth-sewn case binding and cardinal red end sheets. The cover will be full colour, interiors black and white. The pages will be thick, durable 70# paper. Current estimates range from 420\u2013500 pages. This will be an all-in-one presentation, a single tome containing the following volumes:\n     VOLUME I: Swordsmen & Sorcerers\n     VOLUME II: Sorcery\n     VOLUME III: Adventure & Combat\n     VOLUME IV: Bestiary\n     VOLUME V: Treasure\n     VOLUME VI: Hyperborea Gazetteer\nMock-up picture of AS&SH 2nd Edition hardback\nEach book will include a 32 \u00d7 40-inch full colour map of HYPERBOREA, folded to an 8 \u00d7 8-inch square and tucked behind the cover. The map was hand-created by Glynn Seal of MonkeyBlood Design. Glynn drew the map to actual size\u2014a massive undertaking. He penciled, inked, and coloured the entire thing. Then, he used graphics software to render final embellishments.\nMap of HYPERBOREA by Glynn Seal\nThis is the whole of HYPERBOREA, an hexagonal \u201cflat earth\u201d realm hemmed in by the mystical boreas, whose seas spill to the infinity of the Black Gulf. It is attended by oddly shaped moons, and its sun is a red giant that sheds little warmth. Saturn is prominent in the sky, and celestial phenomena are often. At the centre of the realm rises Mount Vhuurmithadon, an extinct, treble-peaked volcano said to be home to d\u00e6mons, monsters, and gods.\nAdditional Art!\nWe have brought in several new artists whose work will join the well-received art of Ian Baggley as published in the original edition of AS&SH. Some of these artists have worked with us before on other projects, and others are new to AS&SH. New artists include Daisey Bingham, Johnathan Bingham, Charles Lang, Peter Mullen, Russ Nicholson, Glynn Seal, Val Semeiks, Jason Sholtis, Logan Talanian, and Del Teigeler. \nAS&SH art by Russ Nicholson\nSo, What\u2019s Different about This \u201cSecond Edition\u201d?\nOne of our slogans for the Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea is \u201cSame Game, Same Rules, More Content!\u201d\u2014and we really mean that! In the words of editor David Prata:\n     \u201cThe hardcover Second Edition includes new classes, spells, monsters, and magic items. Errata have been incorporated, and ambiguities clarified, but no substantive rules changes have been made. This Second Edition is not a wholly new game to be learnt; it remains fully compatible with the AS&SH original edition boxed set.\u201d\nIn other words, one can bring his original edition boxed set to a game of AS&SH, and it will work seamlessly with the new Second Edition hardback.\nPledge Level Rewards\n$1 TIP JAR.

Choices include the following:\n- Beneath the Comet\u2122 (Ball) \n- Forgotten Fane of the Coiled Goddess\u2122 (Salvador)\n- Ghost Ship of the Desert Dunes\u2122 (Talanian)\n- The Mystery at Port Greely\u2122 (Talanian)\nWant more than one of these titles? Simply add increments of +$20 per title, and we\u2019ll ask you which ones you chose when we survey you after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nADD-ON BOOKS\n+$59 ADD AN EXTRA AS&SH 2E BOOK (S&N). Add a signed and numbered (by AS&SH creator, Jeffrey Talanian) hardback book to your pledge. The book will include a 32 \u00d7 40-inch, full-colour map of HYPERBOREA. \n+$99 ADD AN EXTRA BLUE FOIL AS&SH 2E BOOK (S&N). Add a signed and numbered (by AS&SH creator, Jeffrey Talanian), foil-stamped hardback book to your pledge. Metallic, ice-blue foil will be stamped on the masthead and the spine. The book will include a 32 \u00d7 40-inch, full-colour map of HYPERBOREA.\nADD-ON MAPS\n+$15 ADD AN EXTRA MAP (FOLDED). An extra 32 \u00d7 40-inch, folded map of HYPERBOREA.\n+$20 ADD AN EXTRA MAP (UNFOLDED). An extra 32 \u00d7 40-inch map of HYPERBOREA, unfolded. This map will be rolled up and placed in a mailing tube or triangular container. \n+$99 ADD A CANVAS MAP. This gorgeous, high-end cloth map (also 32 \u00d7 40-inches) of HYPERBOREA on heavy canvas will be rolled up and placed in a mailing tube or triangular container.\nADD-ON T-SHIRT\n+$25 ADD A T-SHIRT. This will be a grey shirt featuring the stunning artwork of Val Semeiks and the beautiful colours of Daisey Bingham. You will be surveyed for your shirt size following the campaign.\nCanvas HYPERBOREA map held by Jeff T.\n  Mock-up of new AS&SH T-shirt\n  AS&SH adventure modules\nShipping\nShipping fees will be billed after the campaign (later in 2017 when it is time to fulfill) through PayPal. If PayPal is not a viable option for you, please don\u2019t be deterred from pledging. We have other billing options, such as Square. Here is a breakdown of estimated shipping fees in the USA, Canada, and the rest of the world. (See note below on estimates.) You must pay your shipping fees in order to receive your item(s)! \nAS&SH 2E BOOK (Standard or Blue Foil Edition) ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES\n- USA SHIPPING = $6 (Media Mail) or $12 (Priority Mail)\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $45\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $56\nAS&SH ORIGINAL ART ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES (must ship in separate container; does not include shipping for book)\n- USA SHIPPING = $25\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $40\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $50\nOriginal art pledges are packaged separately and insured. \nESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES FOR ADD-ONS\nWe will attempt to work with you as best as possible. If you are in the USA and you wish to order, for example, an extra book and a T-shirt, you will not need to pay any more than the basic $12 Priority Mail fee, because we can put these items in the same box and send them at Flat Rate shipping. Other items (like an unfolded map) must be sent in a separate container. Note that shirts cannot be sent media mail, but books can. \nSimply put, add-ons add weight to your package and in many cases will affect your shipping rate. If you have concerns, do not hesitate to contact Jeffrey Talanian of North Wind Adventures through this Kickstarter page or through www.HYPERBOREA.tv.\nWe can, however, accurately estimate the cost to ship an unfolded map or a canvas map, because these require their own separate (triangular prism) container to ship.\n\nUNFOLDED / CANVAS MAP ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES\n- USA SHIPPING = $13\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $35\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $45\nNOTE ON ESTIMATED SHIPPING: The above shipping fees are estimates based on current USPS rates. We reserve the right to alter these fees if USPS implements a new pricing structure before we ship.\nFINAL COMMENT ON SHIPPING FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: North Wind Adventures is a small company run from the home office of Jeffrey Talanian, the creator of AS&SH. Our products are not in the distribution chain at this time, and we do not have global print partners. We do short print runs on all our gaming products, here in the USA, and we have a hands-on approach, aiming for the highest quality in production values. We understand and sympathize with the concerns of our international customers: Shipping is dreadfully expensive, in some cases more than the cost of the product itself. The AS&SH Second Edition book will weigh over 4 pounds. This means it cannot be shipped First Class International; it must be sent Priority Mail International.\nOur advice to international customers who can\u2019t afford the shipping fees\u2014or who simply can\u2019t justify the expense\u2014is this: Pledge at our PDF level. Print the PDF, have it hole-drilled, and place it in a three-ring binder. We intend to explore the prospects of print on demand (POD) in foreign countries, but it is not something we intend to pursue at this time.\nFinal Word!\nThank you for considering pledging your support to the Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea. I hope you enjoy the game. Maybe we will have the chance to roll some dice together at a future gaming convention.

However, please consider that this game is already written. Indeed, it is going through various revisions: New classes, spells, monsters, and magic items have been added, and some of those monsters and items are still in progress, but 95% of the writing is complete. In fact, a good third of the editing already is done, too. We waited to launch this campaign until the bulk of the art was in, and the map was complete. These benchmarks have been accomplished. We\u2019re in great shape at launch, and we are setting a conservative fulfilment month. Our past campaigns were met with great success, and we expect that this one will be no different.

In point of fact, old-school games, with their light-rules aspect and emphasis on a game master\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d interpretation of situations, are actually a really good tool for anyone who feels like rules-lawyers may be spoiling the game by trying to be over-authoritative or even overbearing with a GM. But if the appearance and presentation make the game look like it\u2019s purely a throwback and not a modern tool for good gaming, then there\u2019s a real obstacle to the game\u2019s push into the mainstream gaming community.\nAs a result of this analysis, we engaged Stacy as a designer to produce an edition that\u2019s no less appealing to older male gamers, while being MORE appealing to younger and to female gamers. Stacy put together a team, all women, to address this dual objective. We think her team has done an awesome job, and when you see the design results, we think you\u2019ll agree.\nUnfortunately, we think there may be some controversy about the fact that the design team here is made up entirely of women. We\u2019ve already heard a couple of comments that generally turn on the idea of \u201cWhy restrict the project to women designers? Shouldn\u2019t the objective be to pull the best talent whether male or female? What a gimmick.\u201d We\u2019d like to address that out front, rather than have it turn into a back-channel controversy in the halls of the internet. The missing piece of information is this: there are so many different directions that a project can take that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cthe best talent.\u201d Given our goal of making the game more accessible, we hired \u2013 through Stacy \u2013 talent that coordinates with the goal. We asked Stacy to put together an all-woman team not as a societal goal, but because she had the chops to assemble the kind of team we wanted. This isn\u2019t a \u201cpink\u201d edition of the rules. It\u2019s the more-accessible next printing that we are targeting toward the mainstream market. It has always been our goal to get the open-ended rules of 1974-78 gaming into the mainstream, and this is our objective here. We think that Stacy\u2019s team has hit this goal out of the ballpark, and we think you\u2019ll agree.\nStacy writes: \"I am Stacy Dellorfano, the Project Manager for Frog God Games on this project. I\u2019m going to lay out this Kickstarter by walking you through what we\u2019ve done, why I\u2019m passionate about it, and why this work is important. I\u2019ve gotten a great deal of support and advice from Bill Webb, the main force behind Frog God Games, and the author of Swords & Wizardry, Matt Finch.\"\nOur cover artist, Kaos Nest, painted the cover by hand - in ink, watercolor, and ballpoint pen. I asked for something abstract, dark, and gothic, giving her hints like thorns and blood and bones and leaves.\n  For the interior, Frog God wanted to keep the artwork black and white like it is for the current printing of the book. Kaos also provided us with plenty of the in-book artwork, adding in more of her killer pen work. Kaos hails from a small town in Italy, and travels the world picking up new skills and working on her illustrations (many of ours were done while she was visiting Ireland). Though her work has graced the covers of fantasy novels, Swords & Wizardry was her first tabletop RPG project, but surely not her last!\n   A total of seven illustrators put together all the artwork you\u2019ll see in the book. Wherever possible, we had the same artist handle all the illustration for a particular area. For example, Abigail Larson, whose most recent work is a fully illustrated version of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s \u201cThe Cats of Ulthar\u201d, added her gothic ethereal look to our class illustrations.\nGennifer Bone, who\u2019s worked on OSR titles before, did all our monster illustrations. She specializes in monsters, and runs a Patreon where she creates gaming illustrations each week. Her beautifully hideous monsters grace the pages of the monster section, which opens with a full-page all-out monster brawl also illustrated by Gennifer.\nJenna Fowler, whose work has graced the pages of many RPGs since she started her freelance career in 2010, did a fantastic job illustrating our spell section as well as adding several other illustrations to the book\u2019s interior.\nAnother newcomer to RPGs, Angela Rizza, illustrated a few of our full-page images, and created 10 separate inside borders for the pages - a different border for each section of the book. Her classical storybook illustration style provided rich depth to our borders, and her attention to detail means you\u2019ll see something new every time you look at the page.\n          For layout design, Sydney-based illustrator and graphic designer Leigh Tuckman has taken the reigns. Of the many things she\u2019s created for us, my favorite by far is her re-creation of the character sheet. We were able to make a PDF you can get for free including ten versions of the PDF - one of each border as they appear in the book only set as a frame for a full page.\nWhat\u2019s Different?\nJust the artwork and layout! The text of the book is exactly the same as it was in the 2nd printing save for some minor adjustments to the gameplay example.\nWhy The New Design Team?\nThis project came out of a discussion largely about how to get more women interested in OSR games, and evolved into a request to create a product that would appeal to all genders and challenge the idea of what an OSR game should look like. For many of the women who illustrated the book, this is their first foray into freelancing in the tabletop RPG industry. By participating in this project, we\u2019re raising their visibility and adding more female voices to the industry.\nWhat this is not is an \u201cRPG for women\u201d. This is Swords & Wizardry the same as it\u2019s been for the last two printings, just with new artwork and layout for the new printing.\nAdd-Ons\nBut Wait, There\u2019s More! In addition to redesigning the book for the 3rd printing, we\u2019ve designed two whole new adventures that utilize the same layout and features more of Kaos Nest\u2019s fantastic work.\n$12 Softcover ($6 PDF) of The Five Maidens by Elizabeth Chaipraditkul - Liz brings us this fantastic city-based adventure set in a unique fishing village caught in a perpetual nightmare of a storm. The people there have lost the capability to dream, and it\u2019s been gone so long they can no longer even remember dreaming. Now, a sleeping sickness has swept over the city, and it\u2019s up to you and your party to find out what\u2019s going on and tackle the beasts, storm, and sickness to save the city\u2019s inhabitants. The Five Maidens is half mystery, half city-crawl. Figure out why the inhabitants are suffering, decide what to do about the problem, then fight your way through the consequences.  \n$12 Softcover ($6 PDF) of Zaya\u2019s Promise by Stacy Dellorfano - Buried under miles and miles of twisting vines and poisonous thorns lies a long-forgotten city destroyed in a long-forgotten war. Beneath the city\u2019s ruins there reportedly lies a vast maze of rooms and corridors containing wonders never seen before, and treasure beyond description. The only problem is that for as long as anyone remembers, no one who has gone in seeking said wonders and treasure has returned. This adventure is more of a classic dungeon crawl, themed around the accidentally terrifying dreamscape of an elven girl trapped in a nightmare of her own making. The dungeon shifts and exits move about as the party explores, making each run through the dungeon a unique experience and allowing for infinite replays of the same adventure. \n$30 Swords & Wizardry Complete Rulebook (2nd Edition Printing) - Limited Quantity Erol Otus Cover Book\n$50 Monstrosities Hardcover ($25 PDF) - The perfect companion to the Complete Rulebook!\n$12 Deck of Treasures - Treasure items to use in your S&W games!\n$10 Hex Crawl Chronicles 1-7 Softcover ($4 PDF) - each sold separately, collect the entire set!\n$9 Bill Webb's Book of Dirty Tricks Softcover ($4 PDF) - Learn all the secrets of Dungeon Master Bill Webb with this excellent Softcover which can be utilized for all RPG systems! \n$15 Bill Webb's Deck of Dirty Tricks - 52 cards to aid your players during the most perilous adventures, written by Bill Webb himself!\n$7 Grimmsgate - What great evil and what fabulous treasures are to be found in these lands?

It is a second introductory module to Matt Finch's First Introductory Module, Grimmsgate.\n$10 Against Tsathogga - Kickstarter Only Limited Edition Print - Deep in the heart of a forsaken and filthy mire, a great amphibious foe awaits.

Nice addition.", "time": "over 4 years ago"}]}}, {"backer": "Omote", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the kickstarter for Interface Zero: Cyberpunk action for the  Pathfinder RPG! We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the final development of the book, and we need your help raising 10,000 dollars, which will cover the final development costs for the book.\nThe  manuscript is finished. All that\u2019s left is to begin final layout and art direction, proofing of the finished book, and this puppy will be ready for release! We anticipate the final book to 400+ pages in length!\n   Interface Zero 2.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026Sort of. Interface Zero is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre.\nThe result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games, but focuses more on geopolitical intrigue and action rather than the familiar roles of megacorporations as the major antagonists. That doesn\u2019t mean that corporations aren\u2019t powers unto themselves, with their own agendas, both altruistic and nefarious, however.\nThe characters you play in Interface Zero take on a variety of roles. Hackers, drone jockeys, government agents, bounty hunters (just to name a few) generally act as private operators; people with the skills, ability and will to do jobs nobody else can. The jobs often skirt the edges of legality, and can push your moral compass away from true north, if you let them.\nAlternately,  you might work exclusively for a corporate entity, a world government, or even as special operations teams similar to Ghost in the Shell\u2019s Section 9, working to protect the citizens of the sprawl, or even corporate assets. For the military-minded player, characters might become mercenaries working in war zones with occupying armies or resistance movements.\n  Set in the year 2090, Interface Zero 2.0 peers into a dark future, imagining a world changed by Eco-terrorism, unimpeded global warming, and nuclear war. Chinese imperialism has erased national boundaries from Eastern Russia all the way down to Vietnam and Thailand. The world has seen the rise and fall of global super powers. China, Brazil and the Central African Union have risen to global prominence, while the United States has disintegrated, splitting into five new nations; Atlantica, the Great Lakes Union, the North American Coalition, the Republic of Cascadia, and the Republic of Texas.\nIn this grim reality, we have colonized the solar system and sold it to the highest bidder. Colonies and orbital habitats on other planets, while claimed by nations on earth, are in truth the property of massive, multi-planet corporations. Commonly known as \u201czeroes,\u201d many people living in the reaches of space have seen their adventurous spirit, their hopes for an exciting life beyond the confines of Earth, crushed under the weight of indentured servitude after signing on with these corporations. The corps promise to pay relocation expenses and living expenses, and then use technicalities and clauses in the contracts to recoup those expenses.\nThe corporation owns everything; even the air zeroes breathe comes at a cost, deducted from their weekly paychecks. There are those, however, who have found ways to survive, and even thrive in the outer-reaches of space, living on the fringes of law and civilization. Will you join them?\nScience has hacked the genome, unlocking the secrets of DNA to facilitate the creation of new breeds of human; genetic hybrids, human 2.0, and even simulacrum\u2014a slave race grown in amniotic vats and sold on the open market.\nCybernetic technology has reached the point where those with the credits and the will to do so, can become living machines.\nComputer science has grown rapidly as well. Dubbed Interface Zero by those who created it, the Tendril Access Processor\u2014or TAP\u2014downloads the Global DataNet and Hyper Reality directly into the minds of billions of users across the solar system, bringing the world an unparalleled level of inter connectivity, and danger. Malware plagues the Deep, and black hat hackers manipulate the Tendril Access Processor to upload malicious Virii, steal secrets, and even the identities of the unwary.\nWelcome to the future. Let's hope you survive it.\n This project has been in development for two and a half years, and we believe the new rules for hacking, combat, and piloting drones are innovative, uniquely reflect the setting and highlight the power of the Pathfinder game system. With 16 character classes, seven races that redefine what it means to be human, new feats, tons of gear and cybernetics, your options for character creation are endless.\n   Starfinder is coming next year, and we can\u2019t wait to see the awesomeness that the Paizo crew are developing! But what does that mean for Interface Zero? Greatness, to be sure. You can rest assured that once the rules for Starfinder become available for licensed publishers, we will work to ensure that Interface Zero: Cyberpunk action for Pathfinder is fully compatible with that rule set. Indeed, this book is already compatible with the Technology Guide.\nThe only question is exactly how to go about it. We are, of course, printing Interface Zero. Logic would dictate waiting until we can update the book with the new rules, but I don\u2019t want you to have to wait to get your rewards until after Starfinder has been released. That leaves me with another option; releasing a conversion document that gives you everything you\u2019ll need to make characters with the Starfinder rules.\nThe conversion document will initially be a free PDF that you\u2019ll all get standard with your rewards, and depending on how things go, I may offer it as a Print on Demand product at DrivethruRPG. I haven\u2019t decided yet. Either way we\u2019ll have you covered!\n  In this book you'll find:\nA detailed look at the dystopian future that is Earth in the year 2090.\nSeven core races, including androids, cyborgs, and the genetically superior human 2.0.\nSixteen core classes. Dominate combat with the mysterious cybermonk. Use the hacker to lay bare the secrets of corporations and governments. Play a zeek and use your psionic powers to wipe out your enemies, or steal their thoughts.\nA streamlined alternative combat system based on the rules in Ultimate Combat that offer a gritty, cyberpunk play style.\nNew rules for hacking and dealing with Hyper Reality, a virtual overlay of the real world you can use to hack the world around you.\nA plethora of high-tech gear for your characters. Guns, armor, vehicles, cybernetic implants and more are available, if you've got the creds.\nRobots and other technological horrors, designed by RPG Superstar Mike Welham.\nRules for drones, and remotely piloted robotic armaments.\nWe\u2019re keeping this project very simple. To start, we\u2019ll have four pledge levels you can choose from, but as the kickstarter progresses and we unlock more stretch goals, I\u2019ll add special pledges which allow you to back for extra stuff and become a part of the setting!\n           Here's a list of the available add-ons: If you want to grab these, just add the extra dollar amounts to your pledge.\nPrint book: You can get an extra copy of Interface Zero: Cyberpunk Action for the Pathfinder RPG for 20.00\nMiniatures: You can grab a mini for 4 dollars a piece.\nPrint Vouchers: Print vouchers allow you to get a copy of the Print on demand versions of any books we unlock in our stretch goals. Here's how it works:\nBy pledging an extra 10 dollars, you get a Print Voucher to buy the book at cost +shipping. Once it's ready for Print on Demand, I'll send you a discount link you can use to get your copy. At 90 pages, the books will cost $4.61 (plus shipping) to print in full color, soft cover.\nHere are the available books we have so far.\nThe Golemmech Creation Rules: This book will give you everything you need to use battle mechs in your game. We'll have combat rules, customization rules, plenty of mechs to choose from, and possibly even a character class: The mech pilot.\nThe Malmart Catalog: This book will provide tons of new gear, weapons, armor, drones, and vehicles for use in your Interface Zero campaign.\nThe Zero's Guide to the Solar System: This book will flesh out the solar system, providing tons of information on colonies, orbital habitats, and the people who live on them.\nThe New York Reclamation Zone: Once the greatest city on earth, New York was abandoned in 2038 after terrorists blew the levees protecting her from rising sea levels. Forgotten by America, the Big Apple became soggy, slowly rotting away, with only a brave few remaining within its bounds, refusing to give up their once-proud home. Yet in the half-century that followed, New Yorkers proved time and again just how adaptable they could be in the face of disaster, natural or otherwise.\nNow, the waters may still hold the Big Soggy hostage, but its denizens reject any notion of surrender. The city has changed, with flooded streets and ancient subways teeming with aquatic predators while human colonies scrape out a brutal existence on those skyscrapers that haven\u2019t collapsed into the sea. As corporations turn their hungry eyes on the forgotten city, it\u2019s time to rediscover the Big Soggy, where new territory is being fought over, new hybrids are emerging from the waves, new technology is being manufactured in the blackest labs, and new secrets are being dug up from the ocean floor\u2014or buried there.\nThreats of 2090: This source book will give you tons of new threats to include in your game.\nOur stretch goals are designed to improve the quality of the book, add more artwork, and more content, including source books for the setting! Here\u2019s an outline of what we have planned.\nAdversaries: Need I say more? RPG Superstar Mike Welham will create more threats to use in your games!\nHot Spots: Hot Spots introduce a unique location to a given city across the world. They provide you with places to go, new NPC\u2019s to meet, and sometimes even special items, like weapons, tech, or even cutting-edge cybernetics! Each Hot Spot will also provide adventure seeds. Hot Spots will be available for backers as individual pdfs to start, but once we get enough (minimum 24 pages worth of material), I\u2019ll compile them into a single printed book. All backers at 40.00 or higher will get a print copy of the book!\nSource Material: We're going to be doing source books, and rules supplements that give you more content!\n     Shipping costs to regions outside the United States can be extremely high in most cases, which makes it tough to successfully fund a kickstarter or hit stretch goals. I completely understand the dilemma International backers face. You love the project, and want to pledge, but you don\u2019t want to take out a second mortgage on your home just to pay the shipping costs.\nI\u2019ve been doing my due diligence, and I\u2019ve found a solution: Gamesquest!\nHere's their bio:\nGamesQuest is one of the fastest growing Fulfilment companies in the EU, offering a great a service for a competitive price. At GamesQuest we pride ourselves on being hobbyists, with a real passion to see the industry grow and prosper. With years of experience shipping games and collectables worldwide GamesQuest are committed to offering a reliable and safe shipping solution for Kickstarters large and small alike!\nJames Mathe, of Minion Games, recently reviewed us as:\n\"These guys have been very friendly, very responsive, and obviously, speak very good English.\" \"Their customer service dealt with customers directly in a timely manner and they helped quickly resolve the issues we caused ourselves.\"\nBacker Kit\nFor this kickstarter, I'm going to be using Backerkit to collect shipping fees after the kickstarter ends. The reason is simple. Kickstarter has not yet found a way to separate the funds that actually go towards the money we need to raise, and the shipping costs needed to send out the finished product.\nThe result from this oversight, is an artificially inflated \u201ctotal\u201d amount of money raised, which causes huge problems when determining which funds go where. Money which is dedicated towards the development decreases because we suddenly find ourselves compensating for shipping and handling. As an example, the Interface Zero Savage Worlds kickstarter lost over 16,000 dollars because of shipping costs, which resulted in a reduced budget! It hurt me financially as I struggled to compensate for the lost funds.\nBy using Backerkit, I can avoid this by keeping the shipping fees held separately until I'm ready to ship. Once I'm ready to ship you will be charged for shipping one last time, and rewards will be sent.\nClick here for more information about Backerkit.\nCheck the following chart to see the estimated costs for international shipping. The estimated costs for shipping, based on a 3lb package (1.36 kg). All prices for countries outside the United States are in British Pounds.\n   Digital Titles will be fulfilled through DrivethruRPG!\n  Andreas R\u00f6nnqvist\nAndreas R\u00f6nnqvist, co-owner of Dreamscarred Press has spent more than 10 years writing and designing RPG books for a variety of systems, lately focusing on Pathfinder and their own Dawnborn RPG. Amongst his books are Psionics Unleashed, Ultimate Psionics, Path of War and many more. He has worked on the psionics rules for Interface Zero Pathfinder Edition.\nDavid Jarvis\nDavid has been working in the table top industry for just over 11 years. During this time, his company\u2014Gun Metal Games\u2014has produced over 140 books in both print and PDF. Interface Zero was nominated for an ENNIE in 2015 for Best Interior Artwork, and in 2011 it was nominated for Best RPG of the Year at the U.K games expo. He\u2019s successfully funded three previous kickstarters, and has learned from each of them. Two have seen fulfillment of base rewards, and the last one will be fulfilled before the end of 2016!\nJeff Lee\nJeff Lee has been a freelance writer for RPGs for the last four years. He has an extensive list of writing credits with Frog God Games, Kobold Press, Legendary Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among others.\nMike Welham\nMike Welham been gaming off-and-on for over 30 years but only recently gave back to his beloved hobby. He has freelanced for Kobold Press, Paizo, Raging Swan Press, and Rite Publishing, and he won Paizo\u2019s RPG Superstar contest in 2012. Mike lives in Kernersville, North Carolina, with his ever-patient wife, a puggle, too many cats, and a turtle. He believes the solution to his current empty nest syndrome is to allow more creatures of his imagination to make themselves at home. He was delighted to have the opportunity to design bizarre technological horrors for the Interface Zero project.\nRobert Hudson\nRobert H. Hudson Jr is a two-time ENNIE nominee game developer and writer who has worked in the industry since 2005. Besides his work on the Interface Zero 2.0 Pathfinder project, he has done work for Green Ronin, Misfit Studios, Kobold Press, Danny O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Grande Temple of Jing, HERO Games and others. He lives in Alabama, where he works, runs games, writes, and ponders the mysteries of the universe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. Writers and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed.\nThese things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

I was diggin' some of the things you had going on like gear tiers, armor degradation, races, classes, and so on. You wanna make sure that your game is still it's own stand-alone game when the day is done. Maybe have some little excerpt at the end of each race and class that'll show how to quickly convert them into Starfinder? And/or a chart for the gear to convert, lets say, the armor to have the item levels and KAC and EAC like they do in Starfinder? Or maybe just have a whole chapter around the end showing all of the conversions. I don't know, just some food for thought I guess lol.

There will be an inclusive system for hacking, surprise, surprise hacking rules in a cyberpunk setting, but unlike in other games the hacking aspect doesn't have to be one on one session with the hacker and the GM while everyone else goes out for pizza and munchies unlike in certain other systems. In most other games the only magic is psychic magic, if that changes at all here, I am on a wait and see basis like everyone else. There has been comparisons of this to Shadowrun in the past and a lot of the concepts of the setting are much the same. Only usually in IZ the monsters are the result of super science gone amok rather than the return of magic to the world. I've always liked the setting because as a GM I can use it as a base line to run something like Shadowrun, as close as I dare to go. It's a great cyberpunk setting, one is on par with the two giants in the genre, Cyberpunk 2020 and Shadowrun.

To give folks an example of how well this setting is regarded there, in their own Sci-Fi companion book the people who make Savage Worlds refer to Interface Zero as the go to setting for this specific sub-genre of science fiction. For Pathfinder, Legendary Games successfully kickstarted their own cyberpunk setting a ways back, I should know I am going to be in that book like I am in the latest version of IZ for SW, and when all is said and done I as a GM will probably be looking to see how much work it will be to combine the two. But I am someone who is kind of a fanatic when it comes to cyberpunk. It's one of three subgenres that I simply can never get enough of and will support as much as I can with the other two being post apocalypse and space opera.

By Zhu Bajie\nINTRODUCTION\nLong ago, an ancient people, the Archians, built a thriving civilization in the shadow of a great mountain. Among their many accomplishments, they studied the dark mysteries of arcane energy. Through knowledge of the cosmos, they harnessed their innate magical abilities. They also created new types of magic and created extraordinarily powerful, and sometimes unpredictable, spells.\nFor a thousand years the Archians ruled their world. Until a great cataclysm befell their civilization. Some say they became reclusive, selfish, and lost themselves within the eldritch energies they studied. Others say that some Archian sorcerers grew in power and challenged their gods. One thing is known for sure -- their grand civilization came to an end. Lightning wracked the city from above and great earthquakes split the ground from below. The quakes swallowed the city into the ground and created a labyrinth of canyons and sunken ruins where a thriving civilization once stood. Finally, the great mountain exploded in an erruption of fire and brimstone that bombarded the city ruins and turned the once fertile region into a barren wasteland.\nIn the centuries that followed, the land remained lifeless.\nRecent rumours suggest the desolate expanse around the lost city of Archaia has become a home for bands of orcs, goblins, and worse. They use the ruins to strike at nearby villages and raid caravan routes. Others think there is more to these groups than meets the eye...\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to enter The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia?\nWHAT IS THE FORBIDDEN CAVERNS?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure called The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (Forbidden Caverns or FCA).\nForbidden Caverns is designed for Labyrinth Lord but can be played with any Old School Role-Playing Game (or their clones) from the 70s and 80s such as B/X, First or Second edition, OSRIC, or Swords and Wizardry. This scenario can also be played with the DCC RPG with conversions.\nThis new medgadungeon adventure is designed to support a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years. FCA will support first through high level play.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 180-250 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are unfamiliar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover) and well over 600 encounter areas (excluding the barrow mounds). PDF poster maps will be in both black and Old School blue.\nForbidden Caverns opens with a gazeteer of the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history as well as the detailing of several small villages that provide a base of operations for an extended campaign. Like the mounds in Barrowmaze, Forbidden Caverns also provides some low hanging fruit above-ground to get wise players started. The project includes a large outdoor map of the canyon ruins with individual encounter areas broken down. The dungeon proper will be leveled and connected to the great mountain that looms on the horizon above the canyon ruins. This approach merges my own particular style with inspiration drawn modules like the Caves of Chaos and Night's Dark Terror.\nMy local gaming group is playtesting this adventure.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so there's AWESOME SAVINGS for all my peeps in the United States and abroad. If you are unfamiliar, the 2015 average conversion for the year was $1.00 USD = 70 cents CAD. The average for the last year (June 2015 to June 2016) was $1.00 USD = .67 cents CAD (citation: bankofcanada.ca). \nHere are some samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect with The Forbidden Caverns of the Archaia:\nBarrowmaze Complete Samples\nWHO AM I?\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am an Associate Professor (Tenured) of Popular Culture at a university in Ontario, Canada. I regularly teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games (for realz). I am also the author/designer of a very popular Old School megadungeon called Barrowmaze Complete. You can read widely about Barrowmaze on the internet or you can find it here.\nI have a very successful, crowdfunding track-record. I completed three crowdfunding campaigns over the last four years either on-time or ahead of schedule. You can find them on Indiegogo. Through my professional expertise, I know how to create, manage, and deliver outstanding game projects.\nART AND THE OLD SCHOOL\nIn my opinion, crafting an OSR dungeon is about much more than creating an adventure. It is about celebrating the origins of the hobby, the classic fantasy gaming experience, and understanding that dungeon crawling isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in both gameplay and aesthetics. Just like Barrowmaze, Forbidden Caverns will place a premium on amazing art. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Zhu Bajie, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Trevor Hammond, and Stephen Thompson.\nSimilar to Barrowmaze, every monster in the monster section will have its own illustration. In the past I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, and Tim Truman. I hope to work with these and other TSR illustrators again on this project for a colour cover and also interior art.\nCory Hamel has created some fantastic concept illustrations over the time we have worked together to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the humanoid monsters. There's more to come!\n  Troll by Cory Hamel\n  Bugbear by Cory Hamel\n  Orcses by Cory Hamel\n  Owlbear by Cory Hamel\nPLAYTESTING\nHere's a pic from our recent playtesting session. The group had their two men-at-arms killed on the way to the canyon and so had to fight off these skeletons down a couple sword arms. I painted all the figures (Cleric by Otherworld), bases by Dragon Forge Designs, and terrain (Dwarven Forge):\nPlaytesting Forbidden Caverns\nMINIATURES\nThe miniatures package add-on includes five old school froglings, three turtle shields, and two bricked-up walls. Bases are not included. The froglings appear in both Barrowmaze and in Forbidden Caverns and are reminiscent of an old Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s. The miniatures will be cast in metal by RAFM. All sculpts are complete and in-hand.\nFrogling I\n  Frogling II\n  Frogling III\n  Frogling IV\n  Frogling V\n  Bricked-Up Walls\n  Scale with Citadel miniatures\n  The Greens\nSo the full miniatures package includes what you see above: 5 froglings, three shields, and two bricked-up walls. Each miniatures package is $50 CAD (approximately $38 USD) and the price INCLUDES shipping around the world.\nThis add-on is open to all backers and you may add as many as you wish. The miniatures will not be sold individually. A miniatures only pledge level is available at the same prices noted above.\nTHROW-INs and ADD-ONS\nThis project will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, and be super fun for your gaming group. There is no list of stuff to add persay, rather the more funding the campaign receives the more I can invest into and develop the final product. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, you already know what to expect.\nORIGINAL JIM HOLLOWAY COVER ILLO\nThis is TSR-ex Jim Holloway's original \"Mummy Attack\" from Barrowmaze II. This piece of art was beautifully and tastefully framed. I spared no expense. See rewards.\nThe Mummy Attack by Jim Holloway\nSUMMARY\nForbidden Caverns is my next sandbox-style dungeon adventure. Similar to Barrowmaze, FCotA will employ the fun (and lethal) design principles essential to the Old School Renaissance. Of course, you can expect the unexpected in my design style and the continued emphasis on traps, tricks, puzzles, logistics, resource management, time, and mind-teasers that make the game worthwhile...and drive your players crazy.\nThank you for taking the time to read this campaign. Those of you who supported Barrowmaze in the past know that it was a labour of love and can expect the same level of enthusiasum and creativity in The Lost Caverns of the Archaia. If you have any questions leave a comment or get in touch. Please be sure to spread the word via your social networking outlets - blogs, forums, facebook, twitter, G+, etc. The grapevine is the best way to spread the word to the OSR community.\nThank you, Greg \\m/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always potential challenges to any large project.

Hundreds of shops and merchants populate the city, and adventure lurks behind every corner. Full-color illustrations of Bard's Gate's notable inhabitants, along with beautifully illustrated maps and a 6-panel poster map enhance the sense of wonder the city brings. Bard's Gate also features eight different adventures in and around the city, taking characters from 1st level to 10th or higher.\nThe city of Bard\u2019s Gate sits at the heart of the The Lost Lands campaign setting. From here trade routes connect to the north, south, east, and west and gold flows through the fingers of the corrupt and the righteous. A city of artists, thinkers, and innovators, Bard\u2019s Gate stands at the very forefront of civilization and is seen as a shining example of human endeavor by some ... and as a stinking cesspool of greed and manipulation by others.\nSometimes known as the City of Thousand Gods, Bard\u2019s Gate has no less than two High Altars to major deities of the Lost Lands, yet both are in decline, and small shrines or street chapels to countless other deities, some of whose rise to popularity has put them on par or even ahead of the old gods of the city. At the same time some of the most powerful cults of evil deities and demon lords thrive within the city under the very noses of their bitterest enemies.\nKnown alternately as the City of Bards or the City of the Lyre for its famous Bard\u2019s College, many of the greatest heroes of the lands got their start in Bard\u2019s Gate or at least passed through it at some point in their careers. And the many bard\u2019s tales and songs that were first penned within the city prove the truth of these claims.\nIf Rappan Athuk has been the foundation and Barakus the bricks of the Lost Lands from its beginnings with Necromancer Games, then Bard\u2019s Gate is the mortar that has held it all together and given GMs the means to both connect the many, many adventures and game products of the last decade-and- a-half and from which to launch many a campaign.\nNow with the release of The Lost Lands: Bard\u2019s Gate, the original Bard\u2019s Gate book by Necromancer Games is updated to Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry, and 5e rules and is greatly expanded with new city areas, new adventures set in and around the city, and a ton of new background information including internal and external politics, military influence, and a Lost Lands timeline of the area that extends back almost 10,000 years and firmly cements numerous Frog God Games and Necromancer Games publications into their place in the Lost Lands.\nAdd Ons\n$12 B&W Player's Guide\n$12 Bonus B&W Modules #1\n$15 Full Color Vellum Map of Bard's Gate (LOCKED)\n$40 Full Color PDF\n$100 Full Color Hardcover Book\n$200 Full Color 77\"x71\" Bard's Gate City Map\n$325 Full Color Leather Book\n$1750 Full Color Metal Book - Custom Blacksmith Forged Cover on your full-color Bard's Gate book: add this to your pledge and you'll receive one of our incredible custom blacksmith forged cover which are hand sewn bound with thick rough leather bound spine.

We have decided to collect shipping fees through BackerKit for the following reasons:  \nCollecting shipping fees during the campaign artificially increases the funding level of the campaign. \n Collecting shipping fees through BackerKit prevents our backers from having to pre-pay for shipping months in advance. \n By collecting shipping fees shortly before fulfillment, we will be able to most accurately determine shipping costs based on actual book weights instead of estimating.\n All backers are required to pay additional shipping charges beyond their pledge. Please refer to FAQ at the bottom of the page for estimated shipping charges. These charges will be assessed for payment upon completion of a BackerKit survey which will sent after the successful conclusion of this Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only foreseeable risk is if our production facility gets backlogged or if there is a production delay. Our printer is a large producer of college text books and yearbooks, so depending on the time of year they can have a suddenly busy production schedule. We have been using them for our big books for the last 5 years, and they have always been reliable, but if our order gets caught in a text or yearbook crush it can cause delays in the printing. This has not been a problem to date but is always a remote possibility.\n\nA production delay could include lost files due to a computer crash (we have backups), or if one of our key people suffers real-life difficulties such as illness, etc. The books are already written, so this risk is mainly at the layout and shipping phases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "New Humble Bundle for Pathfinder", "update_content": "FGG has just opened the 2018 PF Humble Bundle.

The largest margin of error was about 30% if you measured Fairhill to Bard's Gate (mid-river, not city symbol) using a ruler, but on a map with 50 mile hexes and only a 3 hex distance, that's understandable, especially as placement is pretty tight for labels and symbols in that area of the larger scale map.

Trollzah!\nWHAT IS MONSTERS & TREASURE OF AIHRDE?\nA bone stomping, flesh grinding, blood splattering monster book, filled with all manner of creatures, from lesser dragons to eldritch goblins, from the whip wielding weevil to the devil lord mogrls. It's a veritable host of death and destruction.\nMT of A has over 150 monsters and a small mountain of specialized magic items that originated in the Troll Lord's Aihrde campaigns. Each entry is a complete monster, playable in any setting, but is followed by an \"In Aihrde\" section for those who wish to know more about it in the World of Aihrde. This book was originally release in 2011 as a softcover book. It was re-released as a hardcover book in 2012. The original print runs at 176 pages.\nNOT FAMILIAR WITH CASTLES & CRUSADES? SEE BELOW\nNOT FAMILIAR WITH WORLD OF AIHRDE? SEE BELOW\nIt's plain and simple. If we hit our goal of $2,500.00, we'll re-print this book in softcover form (perfect bound). A small hop and a skip to $5000.00 and we will print it in hardcover; $15,000.00 and we'll do a full color version. Furthermore, if the project grows we'll add more monsters (some new, some from other Aihrde sources), more magic and monster player character classes.\nWe are down to a few scant copies of this book and we want it to stay in print. We really want to expand it, make sure it stays in hardcover, include monster player classes, more monsters (new and from other sources), magic and if possible, if we can get enough backers to bring it out in full color.\nMonsters & Treasure of AIhrde was written by Stephen Chenault of Troll Lord Games. One of the three original partners of TLG, he took over the helm in 2003 and has been General Manager ever since. You may have met him an any number of gaming conventions from Gencon to Garycon!\nHe is the author of a host of RPG material and books: The Andanuth, Codex of Aihrde, Mortality of Green, Shades of Mist, Giants Rapture, Castle Keeper Guide (with others), Monsters & Treasure (with Robery Doyel), Players Handbook, and a host of other adventures, articles and short stories.\nSteve will write any additions to the MTA that the Kickstarter may call for.\n$2,500 UNLOCKED: We print the book as is in soft cover format. The book will be 176 pages.\n$3,500 UNLOCKED: We will add an additional 20 monsters to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line. The book will be 200+ pages.\n$5,000 UNLOCKED: We will print the book in black and white, but in hardcover.\n$6,000 UNLOCKED: We'll make two playable classes derived from the monsters in the book. These will appear in an appendix in the book. Probably the Ungern and the Koth.\n$7,000: SECRET DOOR REVEALED! Monster cards. We'll produce 10 cards with all the relevant stats on them. Digital copies available to $20 and $25 dollar backers. An exclusive signed and numbered deck to $40, $45, $65, $75 backers. Five exclusive and signed decks for Retailer Sponsors.\n$7,000: More Monsters! If we reach 7K, we will add 1 monster to the book for every $100 dollars pledged! \n$7,500: Monster musings by Steve Chenault. He'll put in a 20 odd page appendix that covers where many of the monsters came from, whether fevered dream, something he saw on the back of cereal box or his anger at the powers that be. Informative and amusing (well, to Steve anyway). The book will be 220+ pages.\n$9,000: We will add an additional 10 magic items to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line.\n$11,000: We will add an additional 10 magic items to the book.

These immortal creatures were created in the early days of the world by Ornduhl, the Red God. In their youth they were dwarves, twisted and bound to a path of the Red God's choosing. They became goblins. Though immortal, each was cursed, and their immortality laid bare by one particular action. For instance the thief Arcnur was struck by a blade that pierced his throat, and as he died the Red God found him and gave him new life. But he knew that if any pulled the dagger free it would kill him. But to do so requires a critical hit (natural 20) on a strength check. Read his complete story on THE PORTAL (Free 10 day Trial).\nWe are offering you a chance to create your own goblin and submit it. All the submissions will be compiled in an Appendix in the back of the book. You will be given writer credit as well. Name them how you will and make up their story as you desire.

Please Note:  We try to keep shipping costs at a minimum.  While this is mainly a book oriented Kickstarter, any add-ons or extra books or merchandise (if any is offered) may cause the shipping price to rise, especially if the order is international (out of the US).  Please contact productsupport@trolllord.com if you have any questions about shipping before you pledge.\nTrack us to our goal and beyond!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoving a product line from black & white to color is a huge risk. The costs associated with the improvement are large. The interior pages need redesigned, the art converted from black and white to color, the whole of it needs to be integrated. Paper concerns in the actual printing play a role, as some papers absorb color better than others. The cost of printing the physical books is large as well, usually double what it costs to print in black & white.\n\nTo bring all three main C&C books out in color is a large leap for TLG and will take a pretty penny to do so. But with this Kickstarter we hope to fund the expansion and place C&C on the top shelf of retail shops across the country and to Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Demons Unbound!

We want you all to recover from the fall 2015 lineup, and decided to produce a smaller book this time around. Our focus this time around is on 5th Edition and Swords and Wizardry.\n\nWith pride and fanfares of trumpets we introduce Quests of Doom 3, another volume of adventures worth winning, from the incomparable and brilliant minds behind Frog God Games. (That\u2019s us! See what we did there?). With this trove of places and challenges, you can explore the perils of the Maighib Desert, or the druid Niavark\u2019s forested demi-plane of vengeance, and many other locations where only brave-hearted adventurers would want to set foot.\n\nEach chapter of the book is a stand-alone module that can be placed anywhere in your own campaign world, wherever you need it. The adventures are not a series, and are not linked to each other. So pick and choose them in whatever order you want, switch them up, break them into parts and reassemble them \u2014 this is a free-form resource for the resourceful game master!\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Lost Lands world setting by Frog God Games, each chapter contains information about where it is located in the world. Like we said, though, don\u2019t feel constrained by the way we organize our campaign world, because we\u2019re talking about your campaign world.\n\nThe adventures are converted from ancient manuscripts written in the arcane languages of Pathfinder or 3rd Edition and we have converted them to 5th Edition and Swords & Wizardry, re-crafting them as if they had been written with the 5th Edition and Swords & Wizardry rules from the beginning. We convert adventures for the system, not just by the numbers, and we\u2019re very proud of the results here. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy running these adventures as much as we enjoyed writing them.\n\n\nThis new book is a hardcover compilation of 6 adventures for $32 (retail later is $35). These include:\n\n1) King of Beasts\u2014by Tom Knauss\n2) Child's Play\u2014by Tom Knauss\n3) Canyons of Arcuri\u2014Jeff Harkness and Gary Schotter\n4) Madness Grows\u2014by Tom Knauss\n5) My Blue Oasis\u2014by Tom Knauss\n6) Niavark's Revenge\u2014by Patrick Lawinger\nStretch Goals\nAt $12,000, we will add a 7th adventure to the main book, at no additional cost to you! Red Wedding by Tom Knauss. Red Wedding is a 4th-level adventure of forbidden passion and its unintended consequences. Though love creates life and beauty, its denial sows anger and hate. When young lovers are forever separated, one turns to a dark power for vengeance, and the other rises from the netherworld as a frightful monstrosity.\nAt $15,000, we will add an 8th adventure to the main book, at no additional cost to you! Howl of the Wolf, by Bill Webb and Clark Peterson. The Howl of the Wolf is a short adventure designed for 4 to 6 characters of 3rd to 5th level, but can be modified to accommodate higher- or lower-level characters by using the \u201cScaling the Adventure\u201d sidebar.\nAdd-Ons\nQuests of Doom 1, Volume 1\u20145e $30\nQuests of Doom 1, Volume 2\u20145e, $20\nQuests of Doom 1 (volumes 1-2)\u2014SW, $45\nQuests of Doom 2\u20145e, $20\nBook of Lost Spells\u20145e, $40\nFifth Edition Foes\u20145e, $40", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only foreseeable risks are if our primary production facility is unable to fulfill our order.

The crooks are a little ticked off to find out that Bean's flat rate fee accounts for almost all of the proceeds, but business is business.\nShe's gonna need a bigger stun-gun...\nThe next day, Bean and his heavily-armed assistant, Rally Vincent (deadly with both gun and frying pan), receive a visitor with a young girl in tow.\nMinor character Morris gets Majorly Messed Up\nThe visitor barely has time to beseech them to return the girl to her father before a hit-team swiss-cheeses Bean's apartment. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't have Bean's taste in clothes (all Kevlar, including his underwear!)\nProfessional Driver... Do not attempt!\nBean and Rally bundle little Chelsea into the car and make tracks. Alas, what they don't know is that the kidnappers have already made off with the $2,000,000 ransom, leaving them to take the rap. Will Bean discover the ruse in time and get the money for himself? Will he be able to evade the relentless pursuit of Inspector Percy? And most importantly, how much will the Chicago P.D.'s insurance company raise their rates?\nThis limited-edition Blu-Ray release is a \"High Octane Edition\" for a reason. We will be using the same uncompressed HD transfer as the recent Japanese release, but using a BD50 instead of BD25 for a higher bitrate. It will contain both the original Japanese soundtrack and the English dub, plus English subtitles in multicolor, greyscale and SDH variants (or you can watch with no subtitles if you prefer). The disc will not be region-coded, and we can ship it anywhere in the world except for Japan, China and Taiwan.\n(possible poster image; backers will vote on which one we use)\nOther bonus materials include a 9-panel insert sheet with mini-poster, printed program notes and other cool stuff, as well as color artwork, line art (settei), after-recording script, and more. As much as possible, everything will be available both on the disc and online. And of course, all backers will be credited on the disc!\n(Actually, we prefer credit cards and PayPal)\nThe High Octane Edition will only be sold via crowdfunding and direct sales on our website. It will never be available for less than the crowdfunding price. While we currently do not intend to release a regular commercial version of Riding Bean on Blu-ray, if we do it will be in different packaging and will not include any extra physical stretch-goal bonuses.\nRegular Reward Levels\nDigital backers ($5) get access to the data archive, which includes high-resolution graphics, settei, and the original after-recording script.\nRegular backers ($25) get the basic Blu-ray in a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve, so there will be two cover variants to choose from, and a 9-panel printed insert with liner notes and a mini-poster. It also includes a custom embroidered patch. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nPatches we did for the first two kickstarters\nPremium backers ($50) get everything in Basic, plus a packaging upgrade to a chipboard case with new original art by Mr. Sonoda and an artbook (approximately 180 pages in color and black&white) that fits in the case with the Amaray.\nSupreme backers ($75) get everything Premium backers get, plus a keychain designed by Mr. Sonoda and a personalized on-disc \"Rally Vincent Gun Safety Course\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code.\nThe embossed keychain we did for Bubblegum Crisis\nHere's a demo of how the custom easter-egg works on Otaku no Video:\nNitrous-Injected backers ($110) get everything the Supreme backers get, plus two additional rewards: a 30mm-scale polyurethane garage kit of Buff the Roadbuster, and a personalized on-disc \"Bean Bandit Offensive Driving School\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code. Note that Nitrous-Injected backers get both certificates!\nOriginal design drawing of Buff the Roadbuster\nPatron backers ($200) get everything Nitrous-injected backers get, plus their name also appears on a startup screen every time the disc is played (as part of the copyright screen; you can skip right to the menus).\nInspector Percy backers ($300) get everything Patrons get, plus they will receive one of the actual production check discs to test and keep -- and thus, be the first to see the (hopefully!) finished Blu-Ray.\nNote about Extra Copies: If you want an extra copy or two, don't worry; we will make addons available after the campaign ends (it's just simpler to do it that way rather than have a ton of different reward categories).\nSimilarly, we will be able to provide a limited number of assembled and painted car models -- and since we're making a 3D model as the first step in the production process, we may be able to do some custom 3D prints as well.\nSpecial Limited Reward Levels\nWe also have several special support levels that will gradually go down in price until someone snaps them up.\nCel backers get everything a Patron gets, plus one of 9 original Riding Bean production cels. Here are the cels:\nCel #3 was signed by Mr. Sonoda in 1996! (Click for larger version)\nSonoda Sketch backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they get a sketch of their favorite Riding Bean character or scene -- personally inscribed if desired.\nHere's an example of one of the sketches Mr. Sonoda did for backers of the Bubblegum Crisis set. Note that these kind of rewards will be shipped from Japan and customs duty may apply.\nIllustration backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also get a full-color B4-size (250 x 353mm / 9.8 x 13.9\") original illustration Mr. Sonoda is creating for this release -- personally inscribed if desired. The number of rewards in this category will depend on what stretch goals are chosen and achieved -- see below for more details.\nHenchmen backers get everything Patrons get, plus have characters in Mr. Sonoda's manga modeled after them. Similarly, Innocent Bystanders have background characters modeled after them.\nAnd finally, the Criminal Mastermind backer gets everything a Patron gets, plus he/she gets listed as the Criminal Mastermind on the packaging! And we'll include 4 extra sets as well.\nOur shipping department will treat your rewards with great care...\nShipping Details\nOn this project, we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is EU and Canada-friendly.\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU). The extra cost of doing this (and the customs fees we pay upfront) have been baked into the shipping charge on a country-by-country basis:\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $5 shipping.\nEverywhere else: $15 shipping.\nPremium Sets (and higher levels or multiple sets):\nUS: $7 shipping.\nCanada/UK/EU: $20 shipping.\nElsewhere: $25 shipping.\nShipping costs have had to rise since our previous projects because of increased costs. In particular, USPS First Class Mail International rates have hugely increased for packages over 8oz (and the Premium Set will be over 1lb).\nNote that the shipping cost is a flat rate; if you later add on extra sets or other goodies, the maximum shipping cost is the Premium Set cost.\nWe will ship to non-CA/EU international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. Backers in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway should not have any extra fees because the price of the basic set ($25) is below the personal exemption for those countries.\nWe will check into possibly doing local fulfillment for countries with significant order sizes (based on previous projects, the most likely candidates are AU/NZ). Whether or not it is cost-effective depends on a lot of factors, but if it can save some money we'll either refund the difference or give credit that can be used for addons.\nWe have created a Customs Estimator spreadsheet that backers in other countries can use. If your country is not listed, we would greatly appreciate it if you could research how costs are calculated in your country and let us know so we can update it.\nYou can help tune this project...\nCrowdProduction\nAs with our previous limited-edition releases, there are going to be opportunities for you to get involved in the actual work of producing the set. Backers who do substantial work on the project will get credit on the packaging and on the disc, an IMDb listing, extra copies of the set for family and friends, and a special CrowdProduction bonus item.\nCrowdProduction opportunities include (but are not limited to):\nCleaning up and curating the images.\nTranslation of the commentary track(s).\nSubtitle proofreading.\nPackaging, Disc Art and Logo design.\nLiner Notes Research.\nArtbook Design.\nContact us when the project makes its basic goal if you're interested in taking on the challenge.\nHow it feels to manage a crowdfunding project...\nAchieved Stretch Goals\n$40,000 - REACHED IN 2 HOURS! New Sonoda artwork for the Amaray case sleeve. Mr. Sonoda will create a new cover illustration for the Blu-ray case. This stretch goal unlocks an \"Illustration\" reward that delivers the original artwork.\n$60,000 - REACHED IN 8.5 HOURS! New Riding Bean Manga. Mr. Sonoda will create a new 4-page manga ministory for the insert and artboook. This stretch goal unlocks 3 \"Henchman\" rewards -- backers will be used as models for characters in the manga (and knowing Sonoda, will probably die horribly) -- these rewards will go live at 4pm ET on Monday, March 7th.\n$90,000 - REACHED IN 3.1 DAYS! Japanese Commentary Track featuring Mr. Sonoda and 1-2 other Japanese commentators.\n$110,000 - REACHED IN 21 DAYS! Expanded Sonoda Riding Bean manga - 8 pages instead of 4; unlocked additional \"Henchman\" rewards\nRemaining Stretch Goals\n$130,000 - English Commentary Track with Anime Historian Gilles Poitras\n$135,000 - Reprint of Riding Bean Manga (in both digital form and in the artbook) - Reduced from $140k as a special thank-you!\n$170,000 - New Riding Bean Song by David Garfield and Phil Perry!\nYou've got questions... we've got answers...\nCan I sign up using PayPal?\nNow that the campaign has reached its basic goal, PayPal signup is available on our website. We ask that people only use this if they cannot back the project via Kickstarter.\nWhat about subtitles in other languages?\nA major reason the Bubblegum Crisis set had authoring delays was that it had so many subtitle tracks (6 languages x 2 variants) that it caused the authoring system to crash! So we'd prefer to keep it simple(r).\nCan I order extra copies?\nWe will make additional copies available (at a discount) as an add-on after the campaign ends.\nWhat about doing a Challenge Coin?\nWe love the challenge coin we did for Bubblegum Crisis, and we'd like to do one for Riding Bean as well, but we think it's best to do it as a separate add-on. After the campaign is over, we'll poll people to figure out how many would like a coin, and if it is feasible, we'll do one. Note that we are definitely doing a keychain, and the Bubblegum Crisis one came out great!\nCan I get one of the previous Limited Edition Kickstarter Blu-rays?\nYes! We still have a few of the Bubblegum Crisis Utimate Edition sets left, and you can still sign up for the Otaku no Video Otaking Edition, which is about to go into production!\nWho is running the project?\nRobert Woodhead is one of the founders of AnimEigo, one of the original wave of Anime releasing companies. Over the years AnimEigo has released hundreds of Anime and Samurai film titles in both dubbed and subtitled form. He's the creative and technical guy.\nUEKI Natsumi is Robert's wife and partner. She's a level-headed businesswoman who describes her career as \"a quarter-century of successfully preventing Robert from bankrupting the company.\"\nTrivia: Okada Toshio of Gainax once told us that \"Everyone wants to be the second person to do business with you.\" Riding Bean was the first title AnimEigo licensed directly from Japan; its success paved the way for everything that came later.\nCredits: Thanks to Google, Freepik, Vaadin, Dot on Paper, and Flaticon.com for icons used in the campaign graphics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident that we will be able to meet or beat the December release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays. In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nWhat we can promise is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- the Bubblegum Crisis project had over 50 project updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Kenichi Sonoda\u2019s Bean Bandit New Anime Project", "update_content": "Just wanted to give everyone a headsup that Mr. Sonoda has launched a kickstarter project for a new Bean Bandit anime.\nCheck it out here!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Gunsmith Cats Explosive Edition Campaign is Live!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nI completely forgot to post an update when the campaign went live!

At its core lie the descriptions of pantheons for the main races and cultures of the Great Caldera, their individual deities, their mythologies, alliances, and foes. Each chapter reveals the history of the ancient peoples who summoned these gods into existence and established their cults. A significant part of this compendium details special powers mortal followers and priests can earn, based on the strengths of their piety. \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d goes on to flesh out myriad servants of the gods, demons, demigods, divine cabals, the politics of pantheons and their internal rivalries, the bond between tribal shamans and Calidar\u2019s World Soul, the spirit lords of the Dread Lands, secret societies and knightly orders among mortals, right down to death and what lies beyond. This book provides quite a lot of mechanical bits to enhance the game in addition to mythologies, secret plots, and the floor plans of temples and secret brotherhood lairs, each an invitation for encounters and adventures.\nMuch like those of ancient Greece, gods interact with mortals and epic heroes in game of chess reaching past nearby planets and outer planes. However powerful they are, they face a world of dangers including another universe whose monstrous deities seek to devour all: from the masses of mortals to their divine patrons. They will not relent until, perhaps, they gobble the World Souls themselves\u2014the magical core and the source of life of the planets in Soltan\u2019s ephemeris. As bleak as Calidar\u2019s future may seem, the gods fear that their deaths aren\u2019t the worst of fates. This aspect of their peril-fraught existence is one element contributing to the dynamics of this fantasy setting, as it directly affects the players\u2019 heroes and the realms in which they go on adventuring. This compendium is crucial as it will influence all future titles published in this series.\nAll told, this book includes a minimum of 220 color pages, up to 260 with all stretch goals unlocked, approx. 8.5\u201d x 11.5\u201d. Text comes close to 200,000 words, tightly fitted. It provides at least 10 geographic maps showing the extent of cults in the realms of the Great Caldera, 10 full-page floor plans depicting the temples of leading deities, 11 more floor plans for the lairs of secret societies, and 8 diagrams detailing the personal relationships of the gods within their pantheons. A team of illustrators stands at the ready to produce matching illustrations, which is the main purpose of this crowd-funding effort. The more successful it is today, the more art will grace the pages of this compendium, with an end goal of one illustration for each of 89 gods.\nImportant: Ownership of the first title, Calidar \u201cIn Stranger Skies,\u201d is recommended to better enjoy this book (see add-ons, later on this page--the PDF is available there for just $6). \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d does not demand any specific role-playing game system, as all provided materials are designed to be easily converted.\nWant to know more? Click here for a detailed overview of \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d\nDirectly inspired from the Princess Ark\u2019s popular medieval-fantasy stories, adventures in the World of Calidar focus on a flying skyship and its heroic crew as they became stranded in Stranger Skies. Much like TSR\u2019s original D&D Gazetteers, the first Calidar book fleshed out the wayward crew\u2019s new home, the Kingdom of Meryath. It was nominated for the 2014 RPG Geek Awards\u2019 Best RPG Supplement. It also is a top rated RPG accessory on EnWorld.  A number of gazetteers are intended to follow, each depicting a realm of the Great Caldera, Calidar\u2019s \u201cknown world.\u201d\nFrom Neuroglyph on EnWorld: \"In Stranger Skies is a really fascinating and unique world setting offered to the gaming community by a veteran RPG designer. The details about the Soltan Ephemeris and its planets and moons really transports the heroes to a wondrous new world where the sky is no longer the limit, and multiple worlds offer potentially unlimited exploration and questing opportunities.\"\nFrom the Other Side blog: \"In a sea of \"grim dark\" settings Calidar brings back magic, fantasy and adventure to \"D&D\" and any game you care to use it with.\"\nFrom Dreamlands:  \"It is a very successful introduction to a setting, and a brilliant way of conveying the mood and feel of the setting that Bruce is aiming for much more compellingly than a mere description could.\"\nFriedrich Ulf R\u00f6hrer-Ertl \"They are too beautiful. The cloth map of [Thorfinn's] work is the main reason I will back the Kickstarter at Admiral level.\"\nMany thanks to the original backers of \u201cIn Stranger Skies,\u201d who made this world come to life! Thank you!\nOur objective today is to commission quality art for the cover and internal illustrations, as well as editing and layout. Text is already written. Maps and diagrams are done. As stretch goals are met, more art will be added with the final ambition of one illustration for each of the gods, pushing the book\u2019s page count to 260. Subject to the success of this crowd-funding effort, several artists have stepped forward to illustrate \u201cBeyond the Skies.\u201d\nDen Beauvais is one of the most prolific and versatile artists in the field of Fantasy/Science Fiction today or in any venue he passionately explores. He has won numerous awards for his cover art for books, magazines, game boxes , comics books and a host of other mediums. His artwork is widely sought after by collectors and has graced classic book covers by such renowned authors as Isaac Asimov, Margaret Weis, Piers Anthony and Gordon R. Dickson. Den\u2019s imagination knows no borders. Today, he is a highly sought after artist in the field of fantasy and Science Fiction art.\nJoe Garcia -- \"Hey everyone! I'm a family man, sequential artist, and published gaming illustrator from Henderson, Nevada. I specialize in high contrast, grayscale, pencil drawings, and pen and ink line-work. I took some general high school art classes, however most of my training came from emulating the styles of comic and fantasy artists who could tell a story with a single image. As much as I love illustrating, I always aim to be a storyteller first.\"\nEric Lofgren was born and lives in Western Canada. He's had a long history of working in one graphic field or another. Beginning with two years working in a commercial sign shop and 10 years running his own sign business. Also one year as a digital photo-retoucher, a year full time as a landscape painter and two years as a tattoo artist. And finally, a recognized freelance illustrator in the RPG and CCG markets since 1999.\nBradley K McDevitt -- A 25 year veteran of the gaming industry with over 500 published credits, having done artwork work for WotC/TSR, Goodman Games, Atlas Games, and many more. Additionally, he has been an Art Director for GDW, Dark Skull Studios, and currently works with FASA on the Fading Suns TTRPG. He lives in Ohio with his wife Jessica, and when not drawing monsters, enjoys a wide variety of styles of music, surfing the 'net, as well as writing short stories and role-playing games.\nSimon Todd --  The British artist and writer, Simon Todd, has been involved in fantasy role playing games since he first encountered a box set of Dungeons and Dragons in a post office on Rhode Island in 1979. Although trained as a sculptor specializing in large scale wood carving, Simon turned to writing and illustrating in 2002 and is currently busy developing his own company, MontiDots Ltd, producing new adventures, game settings and board games. Simon has already worked for the likes of GP Adventures and Dungeon Crawl Classics and is becoming a regular feature at Gary Con. Simon lives in Yorkshire with his family.\nThorfinn Tait:  \"I'm a Brit living in northern Japan. My association with Bruce Heard began with my hex maps of Mystara, for which I am well known in the Mystara community. Just over two years ago, he asked me to take charge of Calidar's maps, and I have been assisting his work on Calidar ever since. I have a great passion for maps of all forms, both real and fantasy, which I am now applying with great earnest to my mapmaking efforts.\"\nAlso key in this book\u2019s success are editorial guru and mistress of scrolls, Janet Deaver-Pack, along with website wizard and fearless father of fireworks, Leland Schaidle, without whom many a thing might have fallen apart.  To Leland's credit also are this page's presentation video and its animations.  And yes, there is an author (the guilty party hiding behind everyone)\u2014you might have heard of me as the lead creative and manager of Mystara\u2019s D&D Gazetteers in the 80s and 90s. I also authored the \u201cVoyage of the Princess Ark\u201d series in Dragon Magazine during that time. Luckily, most of my job\u2019s already done! \nImportant: The \"Stranger Skies\" PDF add-on is available with any pledge level.

As they are unlocked, each will add more internal art to \u201cBeyond the Skies.\u201d Stretch goal benefits are included in the backers\u2019 core rewards.\nTier 1\u2014Peaceful Chinook: $14,500... UNLOCKED!\nThe initial funding accounts for just one illustration per pantheon, truly a minimum. The Peaceful Chinook carries instead up to 2 illustrations per pantheon. Make sail, says I, for our journey merely begins!\nTier 2\u2014Fitful Levanter: $16,500... UNLOCKED!  \nThe Fitful Levanter brings the number of illustrations to a precious 3 per pantheon.

More artists may climb aboard, with a rolling broadside to greet them!\nAnd one more for the dream goal to follow in due time...\nBruce Heard:  I write books because I have a passion. It brought me to TSR in my twenties. Today I do what I do because it is what I wish. Leaving a few more things behind to be best remembered by is my purpose. A rich man I am not, but an older one certainly. If you can help make my dream come true, then I say to you, \u201cBless your heart, my friend, and happy gaming!\u201d\nJust like all of you, we are fans of the product we are designing, and we stand behind it. We are as excited and eager as you to see it succeed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a general note, this is the second Kickstarter event for the Calidar series, the first one being highly successful with all or most of its stretch goals unlocked. The link to the first project is located in the author's bio.\n\nDesign and Editing:\n\nThe book itself is written and awaiting final editing. Those of you who have backed my first venture (thank you) are familiar with my writing style and design abilities since the 1980s. The writing in the first book was clean and solid. My long-time partner in life, Janet Deaver-Pack, is a published author and a professional magazine contributor. She has produced and edited a number of anthologies along with much of what I\u2019ve been writing during the past decade. We\u2019re confident that \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d will be as good as \u201cIn Stranger Skies.\u201d\n\nArt, Maps, and Layout:\n\nAll artists involved in this project are long-time professionals in the industry. A substantial part of funds raised in this Kickstarter are intended to finance their work. Thorfinn Tait has already produced geographic maps in his own outstanding style. Thorfinn will also handle the final product layout as he has done already and quite well with the first book. I\u2019ve completed floor plans and diagrams. Leland Schaidle will also bring to life more than a hundred color symbols, badges, and coats of arms which I\u2019d originally drafted. The video on this page speaks highly of Lee\u2019s professional skills.\n\nPrinting & Shipping\n\nAs with the first book, printing will be handled by DTRPG, ensuring the same quality and choices that \u201cIn Stranger Skies\u201d offered. The publisher\u2014me\u2014will handle fulfillment personally, as I did for the first book (successfully I might add). This also means that core rewards for backers in the USA may be bundled with their add-ons, save for the PDFs. All rewards will be printed in and mailed from the United States or the UK. Depending on the contents of rewards, especially at Admiral level, Priority Mail is possible. Hardcover books are intended to be packed in rigid mailers for better protection (an improvement from the first book). Many of the add-ons already are in existence and only require shipping.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "New Project -- On Wings of Darkness", "update_content": "Hi all,\nIn case you missed my first announcement, here's a link to the video presentation for my next Calidar project.
