Jake brews at least once a week. At least.\nJay Darden\nProviding support with warehouse planning and logistics, Jay managed a branch of a national retail/warehouse business.\nWe've been busy laying the foundation for a successful launch - here are some of the wholesale accounts we hold which help make this all possible.\nBSG Handcraft\nBrewcraft USA\nFermentap\nSeven Bridges Cooperative", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a few major challenges that we have to designed around in order to get Kit Lab off the ground.\n\nStock - We're essentially creating a marketplace that will allow you to upload any recipe you can think of, which could lead to unmanageable stock needs. The plan is to launch with a base set of ingredients (for instance, only one or two brands of grain, DME, LME etc) and expand the ingredient selection the instant we can. In the rare cases where a kit uses a very unique ingredient, the plan is to source the ingredient as quick as possible and ship the kit the second the ingredient arrives to the warehouse.\n\nPlagiarism - The recipes will be screened through the same sort of tools that college professors screen term papers through. It's actually really easy to spot direct rip-offs in an automated fashion, so that will keep the plagiarism down for sure. As far as small tweaks and changes? That's a bit of a gray area, but our feelings are if you've taken a recipe and put your own spin on it, you've added something original to it and its ok to call it yours. We also believe that the home brewing community is proud of their original creations and they kind of self police when someone does try to say \"Hey look at this new IPA I made. It's call Bliny the Belder.\" That's usually shamed out of existence pretty quickly :)\n\nIt's also worth mentioning as well that strictly speaking, you can't copyright a recipe. Nor can you copyright/patent a common production process. So really, its not actually illegal to represent someone else's recipe as your own. Just a super dick move. And something we will not tolerate as moderators.\n\nAnywho, the TLDR on the whole question is we'll have a very public frowny face regarding plagiarism, tools in place to screen the most obvious copies out, human moderators, and we'll feature the folks doing the best original work.\n\nTransparency - How will authors know that we are being honest about sales numbers? Each author will have their own dashboard when they log in so they can view every sale they've ever made, how much profit they've earned in a given period, etc. So the platform, which is made from open source pieces (so not secretive and specific to us) is pretty darn transparent. That, and we're looking to foster an awesome community of happy, engaged homebrewers, and stealing from them would kind of run counter to that goal :)\n\nEfficiency - Since each kit will be made to order and it will be impossible to pre-make any part of the kits, efficiency of employee processing could be an issue. We've designed recipe/order sheets that will help kit packing to happen as quickly as possible.\n\nShipping Rates - We'd like to offer the fastest and lowest shipping rates we can to all our customers, but until we start actually shipping kits out the door, we're not going to be able to negotiate better rates with the shipping carriers. This isn't as much of a challenge as it is just a reality that we've planned for. Shipping rates will start around $15 for a five gallon kit and drop soon after we start shipping at volume.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ryan Sanders\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nKit Lab is designed and built primarily by Ryan Sanders, owner of betterbeerkits.com, Web Design Lead at Lulus.com, and adjunct professor of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Kit Lab Passes $3,000 and Appears In Slate.com", "update_content": "Evening Labbers,\nJust a quick update for you to let you know that we've passed $3,000 and that we got a cool little write-up in Slate today!

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Nick will be displaying his series of Brew Master portraits in our Tasting Room space during our Grand Opening month. Support Nick's Kickstarter (California BrewMasters) as he strives to reach his funding goal by Tuesday evening, March 18th!\nA little over a year ago, I was enjoying a weekend BBQ at our home with our family and friends. It's in our nature that where ever we live, our home becomes a gathering place. You know, the house on the block where everyone hangs out. On that beautiful Saturday afternoon, we were all enjoying the day. As I paused and looked around the BBQ, I saw my one-year-old use my sister as a monkey gym. I watched my three-year-old stare in wonder into her Godmother's eyes. I witnessed my 76-year-old Dad having a deep conversation with a friend, 40 years his junior. I watched my husband race my five-year-old, serve ribeye to our friends and enjoy a glass of craft beer, all at the same time and never spilling a drop.\nAs I took it in, I realized that our friends \u2014 from school, from our new neighborhood, and from the old \u2014 were family. All as important to us as our parents, sisters, brothers and kids. Just as I smiled, my husband Jonathan looked at me, handed me a glass of beer and gave me a little wink and smile. I took a sip. At that moment, I knew what I wanted to do. What I had to do. In that pint glass was no ordinary craft beer. It was actually my beer. A beer that I brewed myself just a few weeks before. And in that moment, I founded Three Weavers Brewing Company.\nNow one year later, I am so excited that I can barely find the words I want to share with you. Three Weavers Brewing Company is no longer a proud idea on the tip of my tongue. It is my new passion. It is my friends, my family, my hard work and my creative soul. All bottled and ready to share. Three Weavers is more than a beer, even more than a brewing company. Three Weavers is the very embodiment of our kids, our family, our friends and our community. It embodies all that we share our lives with. \nToday, Three Weavers Brewing Company is proud to be among the first woman owned craft breweries. And we are even prouder to have our very own brewmaster, Alexandra Nowell, at the helm. Alexandra, at only 28, is an award winning brewmaster and together we are excited to bring our Three Weavers community to you.\nIn our very important first year, Three Weavers has embarked on the constuction of a production brewery and tasting room in Inglewood, California. We even got to brew some collaboration beers with our friends at Noble Ale Works in Anaheim, CA and Golden Road Brewing in Los Angeles. \nWith our passion, our ideas, and of course, our amazing beer, I hope you, the Kickstarter community, will join us in building our dream brewery.\nThree Weavers Brewing Company. It\u2019s more than beer. It\u2019s community.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nThree Weavers was created with one goal in mind: create a community through beer. Our community is not defined by physical walls, but by gathering with friends and family over Three Weavers' beers in our backyard, at our kitchen table or even in our Tasting room.\nFrom the beginning the tasting room has held the heart of our brewery along with our notion of community.  We want to give our community a place to gather.  We envision a space that nurtures all friendships, old and new. A place that allows us to support local artists and non-profit organizations. Our tasting room will weave together our beer, our community and the arts. \nNon-profit Night\nOne Friday night a month we will sponsor a non-profit organization selected by the Three Weavers staff and Three Weavers Imperial Pint Glass holders. Check out our website for details.  \nLow Cost Gallery Space for Artists\nWe want to promote local artists through our brand and tasting room. The large walls of the tasting room will be designed to showcase art. Three Weavers compensation as a gallery will be a fraction of what today's galleries charge. We want the artist to be compensated for their art. \nAdditionally, we will be holding an annual art contest for local artists to create artwork for our beer bottles. The winning artist selected by Three Weavers staff and the Three Weavers Imperial Glass holders, will receive compensation for their artwork as well as kick off the current year's art shows. Runner-ups in the annual art contest will be given an opportunity to have art shows throughout the year. Check out our website for details.  \nThe Design\nWe've acquired the equipment and the team necessary to make our brewery successful. We have dedicated 1200 sq. ft. of our 11,300 sq. ft. production facility to the brewery's tasting room. Three Weavers will begin brewing in May and the tasting room will be ready to serve you in June pouring the freshest Three Weavers beer you can get. In addition to our core line up of beers and seasonal releases, we will also have offerings that will only be found at the tasting room. \nFunds will be used to implement the design by Jeremy Taylor Designs. We asked Jeremy to use as much recycled and repurposed material as possible. The minimum of $25,000 will allow us to get a great start on the space. It will fund the construction and installation of the bars, taps and cold storage. It will also cover the cost of lighting and construction of our tables and benches. Lynne just got a great deal on beautiful vintage bowling lanes that will be incorporated into light fixtures and table tops. Jeremy is stoked!\nStretch Goals\nDid we mention that we plan to have some outdoor space? Almost unheard of in Sunny Southern California, right?!? If you find us worthy and we fund more than our initial $25,000, we plan to spend the money on:\nExtra special design details like recycled doors for wall texture.\nConstruction of our outdoor seating area/deck.  \nOutdoor Picnic tables and chairs.\nCool landscaping to make the area lush and nice.\nRewards\nWe have some really great rewards heading your way, check them out!\nThree Weavers hats and bottle openers!\nThree Weavers founder made keychain (not kidding, Lynne made them by hand.)\nThree Weavers wool socks for men and women (Lynne did NOT make these by hand.)\n64 oz. glass growler\nThree Weavers t-shirts for men and women\nFlowy Circle Top Heather Grey\nCircle Top Black\nMen's Coffee\nMen's Grey\n64 oz. ceramic Founder's growler from Portland Growler Company\nCheck out Jonathan's BBQ skills here. \nThe Three Weavers Team\nCurrently, we are a small team with a lot of drive and big dreams. Lynne Weaver is the founder of Three Weavers, with a background in finance and a passion for craft beer who has decided to turn her love of homebrewing into a business. Lynne has the dedication and energy that is crucial to building a craft brewery, but sought someone with experience in the brewing industry to join the team. Enter Alexandra Nowell, a seasoned brewer with west coast flair, drawn to the Three Weavers project by a desire to build something great in an emerging craft beer scene. She's worked in craft breweries of all sizes, and even has a few national awards under her belt. All Alexandra really wants to do it create great beers, and if she can make a few people happy in the process, then that's awesome too.\nChris Gonzales, Assistant Brewer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're covering all the bases.

For production, we will increase the size of the metal surface amplifying the attraction effect of the magnets located in the charger. These magnets drive the charger into position allowing the charging of the battery. In the video you will notice the charging icon of charging turning on when the charger is engage and off when the charger is been remove from the Pebble.\nI proudly supported the Pebble watch through its Kickstarter campaign a few years ago. The love for my pebble watch has motivated me to create a custom armor system to protect and enhance it. I have dedicated a significant amount of time over the past few months designing; engineering and prototyping this protective armor for the Pebble and have recently coordinated production, quality control and logistics through an expert partner, Align Machine Works (www.alignmachineworks.com).\nI NEED you, Pebble lovers, to help me get the initial manufacturing started by becoming a backer for my project and by sharing this project with every single Pebble lover that you know.\nGet it Knighted\nPRODUCTION PLAN\nWe are working with Align Machine Works to produce Production Level Tooling, Manufacturing, Quality Control, Freight Logistics and Distribution in the US.Align Machine Works' specializes in helping companies with international manufacturing and supply chain management as well as quality development and enforcement. Align Machine Works' expertise in manufacturing will ensure the seamless and timely development of the Pebble Knight, from Tooling Ramp Up through inbound Freight and Distribution to our backers.\nFor this project: We will make the tooling from production steel, using both EDM and CNC milling. EDM stands for Electical Discharge Machining. EDM is an efficient way to make high quality, precision tooling. EDM is a manufacturing process where a desired shape is obtained using electrical discharges (sparks). (The files are engineered and ready to go)\n Material is removed from the tool by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid that is subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the \u2018tool\u2019 or \u2018electrode\u2019, while the other is called the workpiece-electrode.\n In addition to EDM, the tooling will also be produced through CNC milling.The CNC (Computer Numeric Control) mill process is another way to make high quality/precision tooling.A mill machine takes computer code from a CAD file and interprets that in to a number of coordinates, or paths, that the mill travels to cut out the desired shape.\nThis process is going to take close to 4 weeks.\nBelow is a photo from Align Machine Works of EDM in action:\nAlign Machine Works of EDM\nBelow is another photo from Align Machine Works of a CNC milled part.\nAlign Machine Works CNC milled part\nOnce the tools are complete, the parts will be made from a Die Casting process. Die Casting is similar to injection molding, but where injection molding processes plastic, die casting typically processes aluminum or aluminum alloys. For the Pebble Knight, we are Die Casting a material called ADC12, which is a high strength, high definition Aluminum Alloy. Align Machine Works has produced many Die Cast parts made from this alloy and they have the expertise to manufacture the Pebble Knight and complete the finishing (polishing, anodizing, packaging).\nThe Die Casting of the parts will provably take 3 to 4 weeks depending on the quantity.\nOnce the tools are complete and the parts are manufactured, Align Machine Works will put the parts through a statistically significant, 15 point quality check. The quality check will ensure that the parts being manufactured and shipped are exactly what we need. Align Machine Works will check the fit and function of the parts, ensure the materials and finishes are correct and will check the packaging and export requirements to ensure the parts are shipped to the US effectively and timely.\nQuantity control will take approximately 1 week.\nAlign Machine Works global freight forwarding network will then transport the parts from Asia to the US.\nShipment from China to US 3- 5 weeks (In this way we can keep our shipping cost low)\nOnce parts arrive in the US, Align Machine Works' Freight Forwarding Network will process the parts through US Customs and deliver them to the Align Machine Works distribution center. Align Machine Work's distribution center will handle all of the shipping and outbound freight to our backers, getting parts shipped out in a timely and efficient manner.\nUS Customs & Shipment to backers in the US 1-2 weeks\nProduction plan schedule.

Now it's ready for a smooth transition in to manufacturing. After SLA models, we evaluated the performance and tolerances of the part in order to create the metal components. We collaborated with ours supply chain to create 2 sets of prototypes: one made of aluminum and one made of stainless steel. These metal prototypes have given us an immense advantage to learn about final assembly and durability as well as testing the KNIGHT in the field. The feedback that we have received has been very positive and that is why we have decided to make this project. \nOur manufacturer has tremendous experience in die casting as well as finishing and anodized processes.

It takes homebrewing to the next level giving you ultimate control over your brewing, any time any where.  \nIts hardware and software are open source so you can hack it and modify it all you want to meet the needs of your brew system, fermentation system or any other project that requires precise control of temperature.\nHow can it help me make better beer?\nTemperature control is often overlooked by many homebrewers, but is actually one of the easiest things you can do to make professional quality beer.\nThe Model-T will help you keep your fermentation and mash temperatures where you want them to be. Resulting in beer that you can be proud of!\nI'm not a brewer, why do I want one? \nThe device is currently marketed towards brewers but can be used to control power to any electronic device from the unit itself or through BrewBit.com.  You do not have to use the temperature probe to control the outputs if you don't want. You can have the outputs turn on and off manually via your command, or even based on time of day etc...  With our open source hardware and software architecture the device is extremely hack-able, making the possibilities endless.  \nSome of the cool non-brewing project ideas that we thought of, several that we have even tried, are:\nSolder re-flow oven controller using a toaster oven or hot plate.\nFish tank heating/cooling controller.\nReptile terrarium heating controller.\nControl a Crockpot, BBQ, oven, or even a George Foreman grill, helping you cook your meats to perfection.\nMake your own electronic meat smoker.\nMake your own Sous Vide machine.\nControl fans and AC units in your house, workshop etc.\n\nWhat can it do?\nSample Temperature Profile\nDual outputs - control multiple devices with a single Model-T\nDual temperature probes - control one or both outputs independently\nSupports Wall Mounting\nSupports Panel Mounting\nHow does it compare?\n(\u2020) Up to 20 A with a NEMA 5-20 cable and power outlet. Unit ships with a NEMA 5-15 cable rated for 15 A.\n(*) Denotes the estimated true cost of shipping, handling and completing the unit with similar features to the Model-T.  Most of the units above require electrical wiring for the unit to make it operational, which would include at least the following items (not to mention the skills to do it without electrocuting yourself or starting a fire!):\nelectrical wall plug with cable\nsingle or dual electrical outlet \nelectrical box\nelectrical box cover\nromex\nwire nuts/crimps\nwire cutters/strippers \nmultimeter\nThe BrewBit Model-T requires no wiring and is ready to hook up and go right out of the box.  There are no hidden costs or extra work!  The price you see listed includes shipping and handling fees (within the US).\nWhere is the money going?\nOur Vision\nOur goal is to build a family of devices that all work together to give you a unified picture of what\u2019s happening to your beer through all stages, from mashing to fermenting. We want to give everyone affordable tools to brew better beer and the Model-T is the first step towards that.\nWhere are we now?\nWe have produced several working prototypes of the final product using 3D printed plastics and PCBs from a manufacturer in the USA.  We hand placed all the PCB surface-mount components and soldered the through-hole ones ourselves.  We have gotten the units fully working and operational.  We have been using one of our prototypes to control our keezer and fermentation cabinet and another as a solder reflow oven controller to help us manufacture our PCBs. \nSome of the features of the Model-T currently include:\nOpen Source hardware and software.  You\u2019ll get all the code, schematics, drawings and software. Hack away and share your work with the BrewBit community!\nWireless connectivity over your WiFi network\nExecute temperature profiles loaded via WiFi connection from your account on BrewBit.com.\nControl from anywhere with Internet connection\nSleek, intuitive user interface\nSelf tuning PID control\nDual independent outputs\nDual independent temperature probes\nControl one, both, or none (logging only) of the outputs\nAssociate your data with a defined brewing session.\nWirelessly upgrade your unit when we roll out new software.\n\nFrom our website, you will be able to monitor and control the unit.  Some of the cool features that we have added, or currently working on, for the website are:\nFree API for your data and device. Develop your own killer features!\nModify all of your Model-T\u2019s settings and have them applied over WiFi\nCheck on the units status and readings\nLog the Model-T\u2019s data\nDisplay temperature graphs that are updated in real time\nAssociate temperature readings with a certain brewing/fermentation session.\nGet email or SMS alerts when something happens or the unit is having issues\nCreate and save unique temperature profiles\nLoad a temperature profile and send it to your device over WiFi\nSet the Model-T to ferment/mash your beer for any duration at a set temperature\nStep the temperature up or down automatically\nAdd as many temperature/time steps to the temperature profile as you need.\nIf you have other ideas or suggestions for a killer app please feel free to let us know, or you can implement them yourself via our open source software and easy to use web API!\nWhat's next?\nOnce we are funded, we will be able to immediately start production.

Or that guy that hosts a show about Android. Or that guy who's really, really tall (or so they say. And they would be right.)\nBefore all of this podcast stuff, I was a musician and certifiable audio nerd. I'm a multi-instrumentalist and I've written music covering a number of genres throughout my life: Punk, Rock, Industrial, House, Trance, and Folk to name a few. But Yellowgold has always been my solo rock/indie project with over 20+ years worth of original material, all written, recorded, and mixed by yours truly.\nIn 2009, I decided to release my then latest album, The Mellower, on Bandcamp for free with the option to pay what you want, and demand was much more than I ever anticipated. Enough people chose to pay for the album that I was able to put that money back into my music and buy a new Les Paul guitar. Music funding more music.\nWhere is Yellowgold now?\nI've spent the past year writing, recording and mixing nine new tracks for an upcoming album which I've called Ever One. I've spent countless hours perfecting these tracks and I'm incredibly proud of what I've created. Truth be told, I'd be writing music whether I ever intended to release it unto the world or not, but enough people have asked about it that I again plan on releasing the album for anyone interested.\nBut I've always wanted to get my music professionally mastered. And this album feels like the right album with which to finally do so. Mastering means I hand over the finished recordings to a trained professional with an impeccable studio designed to pay attention to the sonic elements within the tracks and treat them so they sound good in all environments: Your stereo, car, headphones, laptop speakers, everywhere. It's the icing on the cake, and that's one cake that isn't a lie.\nWhy are we here right now?\nMastering isn't cheap. Neither is a nice run of CDs for those who aren't ready to go full-on digital with their music purchases. The beauty of this Kickstarter is that I've already done a bunch of the work and the recordings are pretty much complete. I just need help bringing it to the finish line.\nWhat is in it for you?\nIf you were planning on picking up a copy of the album already, this is your chance to score some cool and unique swag along with it. I've worked hard at offering a number of different funding price points and each offers a healthy dose of extra cool stuff, including even more music! Who doesn't love more music!  There is even an album art poster done by the one and only Scott Johnson that I think is super cool.\nOr, maybe you aren't in it for the music. Maybe you are an aspiring digital online media baron. Hey! I do digital online media for a living! (minus the baron part.) I might be able to help you in your quest of world (wide web) domination.\nTake a look at all that I offer and I'm confident there's a little something for everybody.\nWhat if it goes beyond the goal?\nThat's where the stretch goals come in and though I'm not listing those in advance, rest assured that I'll have some cool stuff to toss into the ring if this project goes above and beyond the initial goal.\nWhat happens once the album is officially released?\nI should be upfront with this so there is no confusion: Ever One will be available FOR FREE with the option to pay what you want, once the album is released for reals. So, if you are pitching in here, I hope it's because you want to see my project come to fruition--and see the goodies as a nice bonus. Cause I know I do!\nThanks for all of you support in advance.

We needed suitable and widely adopted devices to pair with the keyboard\n2. There was no easy way to connect the keyboard (writing and maintaining separate drivers for all the different devices was very painful and expensive)\n3. Mobile internet didn't exist, substantially limiting the usefulness for such devices\nHewlett and Packard famously started in a garage, as did the two Steves of Apple fame. We didn\u2019t have a garage \u2013 only a carport. We bought a small, numerically-controlled milling machine and started trying to make working prototypes. We used wood, metal and cannibalized commercial keyboards for parts. We could only use the \u201cfunction\u201d keys, as they were the only ones thin enough, so we needed a lot of keyboards. Brunn's oldest son would acquire and send us broken keyboards from his college IT department.\nEarly Prototype with Cannibalized Keys\nEarly Prototype in Metal and Wood\nIn 2001 we found and contacted George, a local Phoenix keyboard specialist, and arranged for the creation of a prototype. However, we could not overcome the obstacles mentioned above, and there the matter sat for nearly a decade until late spring of 2010. At that time we reconnected with George, essentially on a social call, and considered that the conditions had changed: smartphones (with their clumsy thumb boards) had become powerful computers and were widely adopted; Bluetooth had become a standard protocol for connecting to wireless keyboards; and mobile internet was quickly becoming fast, affordable, and ubiquitous.\n2001 Prototype with Custom Molded Keys and Palm Cradle\nWe began development on what was to become the myType Keyboard in the summer of 2010. By December of 2011, after about 10 iterations including a complete redesign, we had ordered and had received 50 units in five colors from our initial 1,000 unit proof of concept beta (1,000 being fewer in quantity than what the factory was willing to provide in production runs). They worked well, and we were thrilled, so we gave the green light to produce the remaining 950 keyboards. We received the 950 in January of 2012. The keyboards worked but did not meet our expectations. This was devastating. We spent the next approximately 9 months working closely with the factory to address these issues and make further improvements.\n2010 Early Prototype in Silicon Rubber\nAt this stage the factory agreed to provide us with another proof of concept beta run of 1,000 keyboards in our five colors. We tested the keyboards. They worked beautifully. However, given the history, we wanted more data points before launching our campaign. As part of our testing program, we marketed and sold a limited number on Sky Mall (132 units). The fact that the keyboard was well received and that we received very limited returns (1 before the start of our campaign and 1 subsequently) gave us the comfort and third party validation that we wanted before launching on Kickstarter. The myType Keyboard is not currently available on Skymall. It is still listed on the website, but is on back order until January of 2014 and will remain on backorder until all of our Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled.\nWe are a small organization and have put in a tremendous amount of effort and resources to get myType to a stage where we are confident that we will be able to deliver a quality product on schedule to our backers. We are especially thankful to both Kickstarter and our many backers for helping us get over the hump and by raising the necessary funds to get the myType into production and bring it to the world.\nEarly Prototype in Wood and Paper", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have followed many projects on Kickstarter, and have seen many of them struggle to deliver on time - or at all. We know, first hand, how frustrating this is for the backers, so we made a strategic decision to launch only after we had worked through the challenges most likely to cause delays. \n\nFor us, this meant securing and building relationships with suppliers, finalizing the product design, securing proof of concept beta run in each color giving us confidence that this process is repeatable.\n\nThat said, there are still risk factors that could impact our ability to complete our project, but we have identified alternate manufacturing channels, and are confident that we will be able to deliver our rewards on time.\n\nIf the project substantially exceeds expectations (what Ben's mom would call \"a nice problem to have\"), it could introduce some delays in fulfillment and potentially manufacturing. We have identified fulfillment partners, and are confident that we can get rewards shipped out in a timely fashion. The factory has assured us that they are equipped to handle large order sizes into the 10,000+ range quickly and efficiently. \n\nClaims and Disclaimer: Roysden Innovations, LLC, dba myType Keyboard and myType Mobile, claim a trademark for purposes of electronic devices on the name \u201cmyType\u201d and the phrase \u201coffice in your pocket\", and claim a copyright \u00a9 on this material, 2013, all rights reserved.

Though we are the only one, we're still fantastical! We are going to be one block from the bustling downtown area of Pomona, near the Fox Theater, The Glass House, and other awesome stuff. Pomona has recently dedicated itself to rebuilding, repurposing and redefining itself as a haven for art, music and crafted goods; we're excited to contribute to that goal. The first piece of our gorgeous building was constructed in 1916. The building is now undergoing a complete renovation and update! Check it out here Our unit specifically has a still-functioning scale dating back to when peaches were packaged there! Peachy! We're extremely excited to open our doors and let people experience our unique craft ales in a place that mirrors the spirit of our business! \nWe believe that beer should be a creative expression from us to you. As we mentioned in our video, we will be offering many different varieties of fresh craft beer available at our tasting room and through local distribution. \nOur goal is to provide the most unique, creatively crafted ales possible. Mixing different ale styles, ingredients and unique fermentation practices, we're constructing the most unique lineup of beers we can. We are always open to trying new things but never about being different for being different's sake. Some of the beers we make are out there, but we never compromise flavor, or magic...or deliciousness. Whether we're throwing lavender in a Strong Scotch Ale (bad idea that tastes like vapor rub) or putting maple syrup in a Belgian Trippel (which is amazing!), we're constantly trying new things and keeping what's worthy. \nFor a preliminary list of what we'll offer when we're open, scroll down to the bottom!\nWASTE NOT, WANT NOT\nOne of the coolest things about the craft beer industry is a dedication to limiting waste and maximizing efficiency.

We are making every effort to innovate, cut down and limit ourselves without limiting the vision of our company. We're asking for $40,000 to ensure that we have everything we need. Even though this is a lofty goal, it is still only a portion of what it takes to succeed as a company in this industry. Despite that, we believe that with your help we can easily make this a reality. \nThe funds will go toward building modifications (plumbing, gas lines, floor drains), licensing, brewing equipment essentials and the construction and decor of our tasting room. Meeting, or exceeding our goal will allow us to remain debt free and focus on bringing the most excellent instance of our brewery to life.

Though it technically has 115 IBU's, it is remarkably smooth and easy to drink!\nHEATHER THE STORM: Strong Scotch Ale brewed with heather tips and smoked barley. This amazingly malty, smooth and smokey beer makes us wonder why Scotch ales aren't more popular!\nBARLEY ROSE: Belgian Golden Strong Ale brewed with distilled rose water and rose petals. This beer is very easy to drink, but complex and interesting with flower and rose notes in the bouquet and finish.\nBROKEN BREAD: Colonial Pale Ale brewed with toasted squaw bread. We call this colonial because it's a mix of English and American pales. We throw the bread in for bready sweetness to compliment the generous amount of Falconer's Flight, Bravo and Pilgrim hops!\nRYE'DIN DIRTY: Brown Ale brewed with rye malt. A delicious take on a favorite style. The rye magnifies perceived bitterness and gives a smooth earthy kick in the pants!\nCATHEDRAL DUBBEL: Belgian Dubbel brewed with dark candy syrup. This delicious beer has a wonderfully complex malt profile with delicious under tones of raisin and plum. A very easy drinker for a 9.3 percenter!\nWINNIE THE BLONDE: Blonde Ale made with honey malt. This brew is extremely enjoyable. It doesn't challenge the pallet, but neither is it simple. With complex honey, malt and champagne characteristics, this is a real winner.\nCREATIVE NAME IPA: This IPA is a clean, crisp wonderful beer that is balanced. Using Simcoe and Falconer's Flight, it has a wonderful aroma and delicious hop flavor.\nBEERANOSAURUS REX: Imperial IPA that consists of only two malts for the entire grain bill. The simplicity of the grain bill lets the purity of hop flavor and aroma shine through. Copiously dry hopped, it is a wonderful addition to the Imperial IPA cannon.\nDARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL: Imperial Stout brewed with Dutch-process chocolate. This deeply dark and satisfying stout is both intense and smooth. Rich dark and milk chocolate flavors mix in the mouth-feel of the beer to finish satin-smooth.

Regular classroom disruptions fall away as students become engaged in learning about astronomy in a new and exhilarating way. Kids relate to the fun and interactive medium of a portable planetarium in a manner that no other astronomy instruction can match.\nAccording to the Resource Area for Teaching (RAFT), students retain learning longer when that learning comes from an engaging, hands-on activity. When they are captivated by a unique opportunity such as an inflatable planetarium, they are more likely to share what they've learned with family members and friends, deepening their understanding with each repitition. These activities also transcend language barriers with their visual appeal.\nWe need more exciting educational activities in order to fight the intellectual apathy so common in our students today (what RAFT calls \"the engagement gap\")! As the pace of scientific research advances, the average person is faced increasingly with science and technology in his or her daily life. Yet, a study done by the University of Sciences in Philadelphia indicates that American students' interest in science is drastically waning.\nMy inflatable planetarium offers kinesthetic and visual learning to students who are hungry for stimulation. The wonders of the night sky can be brought right into the classroom! Right here, you have the opportunity to help bring science to life.\nThe Story\nFive years ago I was a middle school science teacher working at a Title I school. The school (and its students) had little money for field trips or fancy science equipment, but I longed to find a way to bring Astronomy to life for my seventh graders. Through much trial and error with my crappy sewing machine, I created the magnificent monstrosity you see on my cover photo.\nUsing a box fan (for inflating) and a $150 \"toy\" projector from Japan, I've given planetarium shows to thousands of students over the last several years. Even when I left teaching to become a mom and foster parent, I continued to give presentations to schools, youth organizations, and clubs. \nThe Goal\nTo build a bigger, better planetarium! Planetarium 2.0 will be able to fit 30 students instead of 15. It will be made out of more durable fabric. And it will be a golden yellow to represent our Sun! This way, the half-sphere shape of the planetarium serves a second purpose - to be part of a scale model of our Solar System (with the planets being represented by sports balls). \nIf I were to purchase a boring, black inflatable planetarium from a commercial company in the United States, it would cost at least THREE TIMES as much as my Kickstarter goal! By creating a planetarium myself, I am able to make the planetarium more fun AND more economical.\nThe Rewards\nSimple Science\nAt one point in my teaching career I had this grand aspiration to make each of my students a book of simple science experiments they could do with their family over the summer. This book turned out to be over 80 pages long and includes all of my favorite experiments to do with kids using common household materials, as well as a loooong list of science fair project ideas, and some of my favorite science websites. This reward comes in the form of a digital copy. (Please note that this is a collection of ideas I gathered over my years of teaching, most of which are NOT my own and I claim no ownership of the ideas or pictures in this book.)\nGeek Astronomy\nWhen I found out I have been invited to present at the Phoenix Comicon (one of the largest pop culture events in the world!), I totally geeked out! Not only did I create presentations for my scheduled shows, Harry Potter Astronomy and Star Trek Astronomy, but I also created several more shows for use at future Comicons. I have turned my notes into \"guides\" for your benefit. Each of these guides includes a labeled star chart, which corresponds to descriptions of your favorite pop culture characters, places, or events that share their name with a certain star or constellation. Imagine going outside on a clear night and using your guide to find the constellation Draco Malfoy was named after, or the star system in which someone stole Spock's brain!\nHere is a complete list of the planetarium shows I have created so far:\nAnime/Manga (29 constellations, 11 stars)\nDr. Who (10 constellations, 12 stars)\nHarry Potter (13 constellations, 8 stars)\nHitchhiker's Guide (8 constellations, 10 stars)\nMiddle Earth (10 constellations, 5 stars)\nStar Trek (22 constellations, 35 stars)\nMarvel Comics (23 constellations, 3 stars)\nVideo Games - includes both console and PC games (33 constellations, 55 stars)\nTV/Movies (27 constellations, 34 stars)\nEach of these comes in the form of a digital copy. To use the star chart properly you must print it out and you'll need scissors and a small amount of tape/staples to put it together.\nPlanetarium Party!\nI'm thrilled to have the opportunity to do a presentation for you, so I can show off my planetarium! Each presentation is fully customizable to your interests and needs. School presentations cater to the science standards for the grade I am presenting to - not only the science standards, but all cross-curricular standards that may tie into my show. Your show could also be used for a birthday party, science nights, scouts, youth organization, or any other social gathering you might think of! (If you have more than 30 people at your event, add $30 to your pledge for each each extra presentation you want on that same day.)\nSimilar Science Outreach Programs in Tucson cost $120-$150 each, so $79 is a steal!\nIf you do not live in Southern Arizona, you can STILL contribute for a planetarium presentation, and the presentation will be given at an organization of your choice! Think urban schools, boy scouts, girl scouts, boys and girls clubs, church functions, fundraisers, YMCA, group foster homes, clubs...the starry sky is the limit! Each presentation will be individually documented in your name, and posted in a Kickstarter update.\nI will be available for scheduling every day of the week except Sunday. I anticipate the planetarium to take 3 months to build, so please expect to schedule your planetarium presentation between September 2013 and June 2014. (If you would like to redeem your reward before September I can do a presentation with my old planetarium for you).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy first task (which I have already started) is to collect fabric samples and determine which type of fabric will work best for my needs. After ordering the fabric, I will use geometry to determine the measurements for each piece before sewing them together to make the dome shape and tunnels. Afterward, strips of fabric must be glued over the stitching due to the holes the sewing process creates, which lets light into the planetarium.

Until I developed this cutting-edge industry-first design, draft beer stored in a growler could not retain its optimum freshness and the brewer's intended carbonation levels, especially after the growler's original seal was broken. Now, thanks to the Growler Saver, beer drinkers no longer have to consume an entire growler once they open it for the first time, or otherwise risk their beer tasting old, under carbonated, or full of off-flavors. With the Growler Saver, beer drinkers can open their growlers again and again, with the confidence that the beer inside will taste just as good as it did when it left the tap.\nThe Growler Saver\u2122\nWhat is the concept behind the Growler Saver, and How Does it Work to keep beer fresh and carbonated?\nThe Growler Saver applies similar principles and processes that brewers and home brewers use when they fill kegs. The simple design of the Growler Saver first allows consumers to inject CO2 directly into their growlers. After injecting their growlers with CO2, users then manually open the built-in relief valve and discharge all of the air and oxygen out of the growler's head space. CO2 can then be re-injected as necessary. This process creates ideal conditions for storing the beer inside the growler, and will ensure lasting freshness and carbonation. The Growler Saver's relief valve will also prevent the Growler from being over pressurized, while at the same time working as a safety valve that will relieve pressure that exceeds a preset factory setting.\nThe Growler Saver\u2122 System\nCan the Growler Saver re-carbonate flat beer or a growler that was not filled to optimal conditions?\nYes, in addition to ensuring lasting freshness and carbonation, beer drinkers can use the Growler Saver to re-carbonate beer inside their growlers. Most of us have experienced a flat growler, even upon its initial opening. The trusted principles behind the Growler Saver's design will allow users to re-carbonate their beer and turn it back into the beverage that was intended to be enjoyed right out of the tap.\nBefore and After comparison of an improperly filled growler that was then re-carbonated using the Growler Saver.\nHow has the Growler Saver been tested?\nThe Growler Saver was first developed roughly two years ago, and has been put through a series of rigorous tests since it's original prototype design. These tests include side-by-side comparison studies with growlers using a standard cap versus growlers using the Growler Saver.  I have also performed many hourly interval tests. These interval tests include pouring 12 ounces of beer each day from a growler with a standard cap and a growler with the Growler Saver at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-fill. Each growler is opened side-by-side at each interval and are stored under identical conditions, except for the difference in cap. The results of these interval tests have demonstrated again and again that the Growler Saver keeps growlers significantly fresher than a standard cap. In fact, such tests show a significant difference in taste and carbonation after only 24 hours. My testing indicates that beer stored in a growler with a standard cap begins to break down and oxidize as early as a few hours after the initial seal is broken. Beer stored in a growler utilizing the Growler Saver tastes fresh and properly carbonated for weeks.\nSide by side comparison 48 hours later, and opened 3 times since filled\nIn addition to conducting freshness and carbonation tests, I have put the Growler Saver through a series of rigorous mechanical tests that have helped to ensure that the device is easy to operate, safe, and will consistently perform it's intended function. I have incorporated both medical and industrial technology into my design, and have strove to source nearly all components that are manufactured in the USA. Much the same, all Growler Savers have been prototyped and will be fully assembled in the USA.\nWhat materials are the Growler Saver made from and Is it easy to maintain and keep sanitary?\nThe Growler Saver has been designed for optimum function, with medical-grade and food-safe components. Essential to the Growler Saver's ability to keep a beer as fresh as it was out of the tap is the fact that its design eliminates any materials or hoses coming into contact with the beer inside the growler. This design feature is critical to ensuring that the beer is not contaminated or infected. It has the added bonus of making the Growler Saver very easy to keep clean. The Growler Saver can be hand cleaned with soap and water, or most beer sanitizing solutions or any other readily available food-safe sanitizer.\nIndependent Growler Saver Review:\nhttp://www.homebrewfinds.com/2013/05/hands-on-growlersaver-pressurized.html\nTravel case shown below\nBONUS OFFER- Anyone that increases their pledge by a minimum of $2 or more will receive the Growler Saver tote shown below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have conducted extensive networking that has lead to the development of many great relationships with local facilities.

Veritas will be the place where the Southwest valley of the Phoenix metro area gathers to do life together. Veritas Brewing Company will be the first local brewpub in the area, and we will deliver the highest quality, freshest local food and beer in a family-friendly, authentic atmosphere that you will never want to leave. And we will do it all at an affordable price.\nVeritas will combine the classic sense of the pub as a community and business center with a setting that is all about our place in the Southwest. We will be open, light, and comfortable, while focusing on the things that bring people together around our shared values of quality, authenticity, and real community.\nIn many ways, the local pub is the ideal gathering place for the community. It is the place where people can relax, partake of quality food and drinks, and get to know their neighbors in a context that is comfortable and fun. Over a pint or two, friendships are made, business deals are closed, and hot topics are discussed. Unfortunately, this ideal seldom finds expression in the Southwest. Veritas Brewing Company will exist to meet this need. As a central fixture of the community, Veritas will live or die by the quality of our fare, the service we provide, and the setting in which we deliver both. Quality, authenticity, purity, and purpose will define and guide every aspect of the business, with the customer experience always at the forefront of every decision.\nVeritas Brewing Company will strive to be the premier gathering place for the community; a pub in the classic English sense but with a southwest twist, where locals, especially families, can feel welcome and comfortable as they get to know their neighbors. We will offer the freshest craft beer, locally sourced, fresh food, and an atmosphere where the bonds of community are forged. Veritas will accomplish this by basing all we do on the following core principles:\nDeliver the highest quality food at an affordable price, utilizing as many fresh local ingredients as possible\nBrew craft beer with the finest ingredients, serve it at the peak of its quality, and always have something new and exciting on tap\nFoster an environment where everyone is comfortable and has the opportunity to \"do\" community\nOffer spaces that can be used for community, civic, church, and club functions in addition to a more formal restaurant space and an informal bar/lounge space\nKeep our focus on purity, quality, authenticity, and simplicity in all we do\nAttract and maintain the highest quality staff that will deliver the highest level of service and product\n\nIt takes a lot of money to open a brewpub like Veritas, certainly more than what we are attempting to raise in this campaign. The funds that we raise here will be primarily used to pay the legal fees that are required to create the private placement memorandum (PPM) that will enable us to attract equity investors to fully fund the company. \n\nBeer\nSample beer list (an example only, nothing's set at this point):\nCore\nAmerican Pale Ale - $4/16oz \nAmerican IPA - $5/16oz \nAmerican Red - $5/16oz \nOatmeal Stout - $5/16oz \nWit - $4/16oz \nRotational \nSaison - $5/12oz \nAgave IIPA - $6/9oz \nEnglish Bitter - $4/16oz \nImperial Red - $6/12oz \nEnglish Porter - $5/16oz \nGuest\nFour Peaks Hop Knot - $6/16oz \nStone Arrogant Bastard - $6/16oz \nMaui Coconut Porter - $6/12oz \nSan Tan Devil\u2019s Ale - $5/16oz \nFirestone Walker Pale31 - $5/16oz\nFood\nSample Menu (quality will be assured by the use of fresh, local, high quality ingredients, combined with a focus on doing a few things well):\nCommunity\nVeritas will function as a third place by being a space that people of all walks of life enjoy and never want to leave. We will utilize design elements such as seating arrangements that bring people together rather than separate them, and will encourage families to make Veritas their home away from home. Instead of having many TVs that shut down real conversation, we will offer couches, picnic tables and games that bring it to life. By dividing our space into distinct lounge and restaurant areas, we will be able to give everyone the setting they need to feel that they belong.\nFinally, our outdoor patio space will enable people to enjoy the valley\u2019s wonderful weather... at least when it\u2019s not summer. But even when it\u2019s warm out, our mister system will keep folks cool. We will also feature a dedicated cigar patio, and will have a stocked humidor and top shelf spirits to compliment our beer for those who wish to enjoy a cigar or pipe. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStaff/Customer Service: Finding and retaining competent and enthusiastic staff will be one of the most significant ongoing challenges that Veritas will face. Service has been the downfall of many otherwise good businesses, and we are committed to ensure that this does not happen at Veritas. Through continuing education in beer and food, fun incentives and challenges, and cultivating a positive workplace, we will minimize this risk as much as we can.\n\nRestaurant Failure Rate: Although the failure rate of new restaurants is often exaggerated significantly, reliable studies still put it at around 60% in the first 5 years. But Veritas is not a restaurant, it's a brewpub, and the failure rate of brewpubs is much lower, and though data is hard to find, seems to be between 12 and 17%. Veritas will not fail, not only because we are a brewpub, but because we are committed to delivering the highest quality, local beer and food in the Southwest valley in a truly enjoyable community setting.\n\nContaminated Batches of Beer: The first 3 rules of brewing a quality product are sanitation, sanitation, sanitation. If beer is contaminated by wild yeasts or other bacteria, it often points to a deeper problem with the brewing process. Although contamination is always a possibility, Veritas will minimize this risk in two main ways. First, we will buy new brewery equipment, designed for us, and installed in a professional way that will minimize exposure to contaminants. Second, we will hire an experienced head brewer that will be knowledgable in commercial brewing processes and procedures, and will run a clean, tidy operation in the brewhouse. If the worst happens and we do end up with a contaminated batch, all is not lost, since the size of each batch we brew is relatively small (7 barrels, or 210 gallons), accounting for about $1000 in lost revenue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Disappointment", "update_content": "I've been waiting for this week for the last several months. My partner/investor was finally going to come through with the funds to get Veritas off the ground. So when he invited me over to his house last night, I thought that we would be discussing the presentation of an offer on a property that we both liked. To my surprise and disappointment, he instead told me that, although the financing did come through, he could not risk the (large amount of) money right now. The economic conditions in the US and AZ are just not favorable to a startup business at this time. Although I think a brewpub can be successful even in difficult times, I get that he has a lot more to lose than I do if things didn't work out.\nWhat does this mean for Veritas then? Basically, we're on hold while I try to either significantly decrease the needed startup capital without sacrificing the core vision of the business, or find more investors to spread out the risk. Bob (my current partner) knows the restaurant industry and has many decades experience in it. He is a good, honest man and I'd be foolish to take his position lightly.

Scroll to the bottom to see our stretch rewards!\nTHE PROJECT\nLos Angeles Ale Works is a brewery based in Los Angeles, California.  For over 3 years we have been hard at work business planning, refining recipes, designing our brand, and acquiring the proper licenses for the first phase of our project, gypsy brewing.  After purchasing our kegs and marketing material and paying for the initial batches, we are ready to take this project to the next level.  \nThe contract or gypsy brewing phase demonstrates that our business is real and beer is salable but it is a means to an end.  In order to bring the operation to the next level we will need to secure equipment, a location, commercial licenses, and sizable capital that will allow us to build out our brewery.  Here's where you, the craft beer drinker, come in.  We will be doing a combination of private and Kickstarter fundraising.  This will allow the community to be involved in the project from the ground up.  After all, what is beer if there are no people to drink it? \nAll money generated through Kickstarter will go towards securing brewery equipment and fulfilling the various rewards for backers.  If we meet our goal of $25,000 by the end of our campaign, your donations will then go through. Hypothetically, if we don't reach $25,000, your credit card will not be charged. To pledge your support all it takes are following these four easy steps!\nCreate a Kickstarter account\nLog in using your email and password (or Amazon account information)\nDonate! Select your reward level. $1.00 minimum; no maximum.\nShare our project with your friends online and in person! \nWho Are We?\nWe are enthusiastic, dedicated, and award-winning homebrewers who love brewing beer and bringing it to the people we care about.  \n- John Rockwell comes from a business finance background in commercial real estate.  He currently works at an energy audit company that focuses on making businesses run more efficiently in their work spaces.  John is a certified BJCP judge, which makes him a serious quality control specialist.  Nothing gets by his palate.\n- Kristofor (Kip) Barnes works at a major film studio as a business analyst in customer relations.  He's learned the art of building relationships with his clients.  He's an accomplished gold-medal-winning home brewer who focuses intensely on new recipe creation and managing the brewhouse.  Kip founded Bierkast.com and is also a founding member of the LA Beer Bloggers.\nBoth John and Kip spend 99.9% of their free time brewing beer, tightening the business plan, studying the science of brewing, and getting involved in LA Craft Beer events!\nFun Fact: Both John and Kip met each other in the USC Marching band\nWho Do We Look Up To?\nOne of Kip's favorite breweries in Los Angeles is Eagle Rock Brewery.  \n\"It's hard to pick a favorite because there are so many awesome places, but Eagle Rock Brewery and the ERB team have been at the forefront of LA Craft Beer for the last 3 years.  Their mix of creative brewing, positive community action, and love of craft beer is a serious boon for all of LA.  Plus, they are just plain nice!\" - Kip\nJohn's favorite brewery in Los Angeles is a toss up between Craftsman and Taps Fish House & Brewery.\n\"Craftsman is a pioneer in the LA beer community and was here before the boom.  They are extremely creative and have consistently great beer.  They are a true small batch brewhouse.  Taps has an amazing respect for the classic styles.  They are one of the more underrated brewers in the area, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better kolsch or cream ale.  Good food too!\" - John\nWhat is our Goal?\nOver the long term we plan to raise enough capital so that we can make beer for a living.  We are currently balancing gypsy brewing with our day jobs, which is exhausting, but still awesome.  If we can raise enough money (beyond Kickstarer) to open a brewery of our own, we can focus full time on making tasty beer for the awesome Los Angeles beer drinkers!  \nRealistically, we need to raise a lot more than we\u2019re asking for here to execute our dream brewery.  We will be reaching that goal through private equity investment, personal and business loans, fundraising events, and social media fundraisers like Kickstarter.  \nOur goal on Kickstarter is $25,000, which is and isn't a lot.  In this situation we have to buy very expensive equipment. While this goal is modest compared to our total financial needs, it is a huge step in the right direction, as equipment purchases are some of the largest expenses when opening a brewery.   \nOur dream floor plan\nWhy Donate?\nWhy should you donate when you can just go down to the supermarket or pub and get your favorite beer?  Several reasons: \nDrinking, eating, listening to music, and filling growlers at a brewery is awesome! \nThe Karma you get for supporting a local brewery is incredible!  All backers, who pledge $25+, will be permanently recognized on a laser engraved plate on our fermentor.\nYou want to be a part of the magic!\nIt creates Jobs! Maybe even your job!  \nLos Angeles Ale Works will focus on not only getting the surrounding community involved with the brewery, but will also get involved with local philanthropic organizations.  We want everyone to not only like the beer that we make, but believe in the brewery and the people that are making it.  What better way to do that than to get everyone involved?\nBrewing the first batch of Gams-Bart at Ohana Brewing - (Left to Right) John Rockwell, Sean Inmann, Chris Walowski, Kip Barnes, Andrew Luthi\nWhere will my money go?\nYour money will go towards the following:\n15 BBL Fermentor $10,500 + tax\nCommercial Keg Washer $7,450 - $14,450 + tax (Manual vs. Semi-Auto)\nFreight & Installation $4,000 - $8,000 (vender estimate)\nKickstarter Rewards\nAs we said before, we are ramping up by gypsy brewing.  By aiding us in securing equipment early on, you'll be helping us grow.  We plan on sharing space in an existing local brewery until our facility is built.  Sharing is caring and also means we can brew our recipes, collaborate, and get our product to you sooner rather than later.\nStretch Goals\nIf we manage to raise more than we plan, here are a few other things we'll be spending the money on:\nSemi-Auto Keg Washer - This is a top of the line Keg Washer.  It's twice as expensive as the manual one, but the semi-auto feature allows kegs to be automatically cleaned which cuts out the otherwise time consuming manual washing process.  More time = more beer focus.\n15 BBL Jacketed Brite Tank - This is used to store and carbonate the beer after fermentation.  This will free up fermentation space to allow for more beer production.\nEducation - There are a number of brewing certifications and classes out there we want to take.  Certification means more knowledge.  More knowledge means better beer.  We know a lot already, but you can always learn more.\nREWARDS\nWhile we can't give away free beer, per California State & Federal Law, we can entice you with backer-only parties, swag, and exclusives. You\u2019ll notice that some of our rewards can be fulfilled immediately (swag!), while others - that need us to open a brewery first - require a little more patience. Either way, rest assured they are all fantastic!\nCommunity Tap\nThe community tap will be a handle dedicated to serving community voted beer.  Think of it as another seasonal that gets voted on by the people.  If everyone wants a triple Belgian IPA then that's what we'll make! If everyone is tired of palate-obliterating hoppy-ness and would rather spend the evening with the charming Queen Elizabeth, then English-style bitter it will be. These beers will be small releases that will be available to our backers first!  Consider it an extra thank you for all the love and support.\nEach reward level has a specific number of votes attached to it.  Each vote can be used to make various beer related decisions that we open to the public. It's simple, really - the more you pledge, the larger your say.  We will open up voting to all backers and members of the Shangri-LAAW club - 1 vote per person. By pledging to our Kickstarter, you will have extra say because you believed in us early on.\nAdmittance into SHANGRI-LAAW\nOur mug club.  An Eden in a concrete jungle.  Entrance to Shangri-LAAW has been shrouded in mystery, but you'll have first dibs as a backer at the $350 level.  Space will be extremely limited, first come first serve, and invite only.  Experience coveted bottle releases, rare tastings, special guests, unending happiness, and discover the undiscovered truths of Shambhalaaw.\nAdmittance to Shangri-LAAW is marked at specific reward levels.  Years do not compound. Please keep in mind that this membership will not commence until our brewery is open, so patience is key.  That being said, we will work to include the group in as many of our preliminary events as we can.\nSWAG\nBOTTLE CAPS: Los Angeles Ale Works bottle caps! We'll give you one for every vote you have - depending on your reward.  Hold on to these, you'll find out later!  These beautiful caps are made by our friends over at BottleMark.\nSTICKERS: Another locally sourced piece by one of our favorite craft beer supporters - Stickerworks!  We have tons of these cool stickers and would love to give them away to people that want to contribute!\nCOASTERS: Double-sided coasters that look friggin' awesome! Tired of that nasty ring you leave on your nice teak coffee table? Look no further than our fine coasters.\nT-SHIRTS: We are starting out with hand silk-screened shirts, which are locally sourced by a screen printer in Los Angeles, Mischief Brigade.  Why aren't we going with the big guys? Because the little guys rock!  Each shirt is unique and hand made.  Consider it the homebrew equivalent of T-Shirts.\nGROWLER BAGS: These bags are awesome.  They are insulated and screen-printed with our logo!  They are designed to fit the 64 oz growlers that we will eventually have, but hold up to three 22oz bottles right now! We are sourcing this through a small family run business called GrowlerCooler.com.\n*4-PACK BEER HOLDERS: These hand crafted wooden carriers are designed to hold four 22 oz. bottles.  They are LAAW branded and made with love by skilled woodworkers that we are lucky enough to be able to bribe with beer.  There are only a few of these in existence.\nLA BEER HOP: An exclusive party with Kip and John and the guys at the LA Beer Hop, the premier beer tour company in Los Angeles.  Come see LA through our beer colored glasses.\n*BEER BOXES: These beautiful hand crafted wooden boxes are designed to hold twenty-four 12 oz. bottles.  They are painted black and have our logo on them.  There are only a few of these in existence, in fact we love these boxes so much a small tear will be shed with each box we give away, thus they are a high level reward for our most dedicated backers.  Our handy friends Mike and Dan put these babies together, and boy are these boxes sick.\n*TAP HANDLES: You need to pull the handle to get the beer.  Think of it as a unique trophy given to you for the awesome contribution you made.  Hey, if you have a kegerator, you can even use them.  This was a team effort.  The whole LAAW crew assembled these by hand; they are each unique and not made in a factory.\n*Please keep in mind that some of these reward levels require extra shipping, which will be calculated when rewards are ready to go out.  These costs will be dependent upon your location.  International backers are welcome, but extra shipping will be required.  If you are local, we can more than likely get it out to you sans shipping.\n*Please note that some rewards are experiences in Los Angeles and travel and lodging are not included.\n*Please note that some rewards are specific to the reward level as there limited quantities.  These rewards are denoted with an *asterisk*\nTHE LAAW CARD: It's exclusive. It's unique. It's the Golden Ticket.

We love you guys! Keep up the great work!\nBe sure to keep up to date with all the news on our Facebook page, twitter, and Website so you don't miss a chance to experience Gams-Bart with your own palate. #FollowtheLAAW\nLA ALE WORKS BEER\nOur first gypsy-brewed beer is GAMS-BART, our Bavarian Style Roggenbier.  It's one of our favorites, and we hope it becomes one of yours too. Here\u2019s a summary of the rest of our line-up:\nGamsBart - Bavarian Roggenbier - This multi award-winning beer is an intensely traditional German style ale similar to a Bavarian style Hef.  We use rye and roasted rye and ferment on the colder side which brings out the clove flavors from this traditional yeast.  \nDampfmaschine - California UnCommon - This is a classic California \"steam beer\" style ale, only it's accented with rye and late hopped with magnum hops.\nLievre - French/Belgian Saison - This multi award-winning saison is brewed will seasonal citrus peel, spices, and Indian sugar.  Funky and friggin' tasty.\nButtress of Windsor - Coffee Rye Porter - This porter has a generous portion of rye added to its grain bill and is cold infused with locally roasted coffee.  It's complex, hearty, but also incredibly soft like a feather duster.\nDas Kolsch - German Kolsch - John is a Kolsch nut, and this is his baby.  A well made Kolsch is hard to find, and this one is as traditional as we can make it without being in Cologne.  Soft water, perle and hallertau hops, German pils, and a splash of wheat.\nKarma Kolsch - Thai Tea Infused Kolsch - We take our Kolsch and infuse it with traditional restaurant style Thai Red Tea.  The tea and spices are assertive, but also blend nicely with the delicate style underneath.\nKetsara Soda - Thai Tea Soda - That's right, soda.  We want to have something for everyone.  We love beer, but we also want to have something for those of you trucking your friends around during brewery tours or those that just appreciate craft soda.  Palm Sugar and Thai Tea - Sweet and Simple.  \nFUN FACT: Soda played an important role for breweries trying to figure out what to do with themselves during Prohibition.  We want to make a point to pay homage to that time in history, but put a spin on it and produce small batches for the tap room.\nMugen Kurosake - We also hope to brew a black rice sake.  We'll need a commercial wine license for this one because the government has mistakenly identified sake as wine when it is, in fact, beer.  \nPhoto courtesy of Bernie Wire at \"Friends of Local Beer\"\nAnd More: Imagination is the limit.

A medal from the NHC, part of the Brewers Association and National Home Brewers Association, is the highest possible honor a home brewer can receive.  \nWe recently took home a two gold medals at the Pacific Brewers Cup 2012, one for whiskey barrel aged Roggenbock and another for our California Common, Dampfmaschine.  \nWe've also received numerous first place medals for our Lievre Saison and sodas.\nHere are some other awards \u2013 Local, California & National:\nOUR BRAND\nLos Angeles Ale Works is fortunate to have on our team one of Seattle\u2019s premier Branding and Design experts, Ken Barnes.

If the total pledges don't reach the goal, then the project is not funded at all.\nThe pledges aren't an investment in the business in a traditional sense (sorry, no company shares being offered here!) but you do get some cool stuff for helping us out (check out the list on the right hand side). Not to mention you\u2019ll be instrumental in ensuring that there is LA Ale Works beer on tap for years to come!\n**STRETCH GOALS & STRETCH REWARDS**\nStretch Rewards\n*Cardinal & Gold - Some of you may have seen that we added a new reward level called Cardinal & Gold at the $117 level.  This'll snag you a limited edition Cardinal & Gold version of the LAAW shirt.  What we failed to mention was that it also gets you a Cardinal & Gold sticker.  All those pledging above the $117 level will have the opportunity to choose which one you want.\nStretch Reward #1 $26,000\nUNLOCKED: LAAW Voting Event for Glassware\nAt $26,000 everyone at the $50 dollar (and up) pledge level will be getting a pint glass.\nWhat will they look like? You\u2019ll decide with your voting power at the end of the kickstarter. We\u2019ll provide several different choices and you can all vote and decide what our next glass is! How cool is that?! It\u2019s all about working together to make this brewery happen.\nNow this is where it gets fun!!\nStep 1, we open up new donation levels:\n$75 Pledge - get a classic keychain bottle opener printed/engraved with LAAW\n$150 Pledge - get a fidel/steamer hat with LAAW embroidery\nStep 2, set stretch rewards that take these new reward levels and make them ridiculously awesome!\nStretch Reward #2 $30,000\nUNLOCKED: Custom LAAW Professional Bottle Opener\nAt $30,000 everyone at the $75 dollar (and up) pledge level will be getting a customized LA Ale Works bartender style bottle opener. Forget that keychain bottle opener, this is no toss away trinket! It will become your household go-to bottle opener. There\u2019s a reason all professional bartenders use it. A true collectors item, these will be a small batch orders only made for the kickstarter.\nIn addition to this, everyone at the $75 and up level gets an extra bottle cap (+1 vote)!\nStretch Reward #3 $35,000\nUNLOCKED: Custom labeled LAAW Growler\nAt $35,000 everyone at the $150 dollar (and up) pledge level will get a 64-oz screw top amber glass growler. Custom printed with the LAAW logo in white. These babies will be awesome and we can\u2019t wait to give them out. The only catch is that you\u2019ll have to be patient. These will be given out next year prior to our facility opening. Think of it as your own private mug club in a bottle.\nIn addition to this, everyone at the $75 and up level gets 2 extra bottle caps (+2 votes)!\nAlso!!!! KARMA KOLSCH. Our Thai Tea Kolsch will be released along side Gams-Bart.  Having 2 fermentors will give us the ability to have two simultaneous beers.\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE! WE  COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU! CHEERS! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are very familiar with the brewing industry and have taken great lengths to immerse ourselves in both the culture, consumer arena and the manufacturing side. That being said, even those who are most prepared may face difficulties. \nOn the Gypsy side of brewing, finding a willing partner is always an obstacle to overcome. Expansions, facility upgrades, or other issues having to do with the host brewery could lead to production delay. Brewing with new facilities is like dating, you have to find the right fit and our beer ideals need to line up. \nAs we move from Gypsy brewing to our own facility there are many potential roadblocks along the way. Permitting through the city and state can take anywhere from 6 - 24 months. If we are unable to secure private fundraising our journey will also be delayed. We will still plan on moving forward, but at a slower pace.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 24, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/laaw/los-angeles-ale-works-0", "project_name": "Los Angeles Ale Works!"}}, {"backer": "John Holzer", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Drink Careers 101: How To Get A Job In the Beverage Industry\nWe are creating a printed how-to guide dedicated to helping students pursue a career in the beverage industry, covering job opportunities working with: wine, beer, spirits, coffee, tea, and soda.\nThis comprehensive guide will explore:\n\u2022 Insights, and resources for securing employment in the beverage industry\n\u2022 A wide range of beverage professions in full detail\n\u2022 Information on education and certification options\n\u2022 Current industry trends\n\u2022 Interviews with beverage industry professionals, many of whom are already involved with this project\nWhat your investment goes towards:\nAll of the work for this printed guide will be done in-house, with Mutineer Magazine\u2019s seasoned editorial and design teams handling production.

Many recent graduates are burdened with large amounts of student debt and are finding it increasingly difficult to secure quality employment after leaving school.\nBeverage careers represent a largely overlooked employment solution for millennial college graduates. It is one of only a few industries that has experienced consistent growth during the recent recession, and one that offers a diverse range of amazing and creative career options for qualified college graduates entering the workforce.\nUnless you have a personal interest or connection to the beverage industry, it is extremely difficult to be aware of beverage careers and academically prepare to compete for those opportunities, especially with many college undergraduates being under the legal drinking age when they begin their studies and select their major. Furthermore, the beverage industry \u2013 particularly the wine sector \u2013 is traditionally exclusive, making it inaccessible to women and minority students and creating yet another barrier for college students who might otherwise consider a beverage career.\nOur Drink Careers 101 printed guide is the perfect solution to educate and inspire millennials in a creative and practical way about the many exciting professional opportunities in the beverage industry.\nClick here to see the full trend analysis.\nClick here to meet our advisory board.\nCheck out Drink Careers 101 on Facebook and Twitter.\nExamples of included careers:\nWinemaker\nBrewer\nDistiller\nLaboratory Technician\nViticulturalist\nPackaging\nBeverage Director\nSommelier\nBartender/Mixologist\nTasting Room Manager\nSpirits Producer\nBeer Producer\nWine Producer\nImporter\nDistributor\nOn-Premise Entrepreneur\nOff-Premise Entrepreneur\nBeverage Tourism\nOnline Entrepreneur\nSales\nTechnology\nBrand Ambassador\nMarketing\nWriter\nPersonality\nEducator\nPublic Relations\nWine Club Manager\nSocial Media Manager\nCoffee Roaster\nEvent Production & Marketing\nWhen will the project be fulfilled?\nThe Drink Careers 101 Guide will be released in fall of 2013.\n\nWhy are we raising funds via Kickstarter for this project?\n\nWe are a small, independent media company trying to make big changes with this grassroots campaign. Kickstarter is the vehicle that lets both industry professionals and students get involved with Drink Careers 101 in a meaningful way.\nFor those of you in the industry, you know this project is bigger than Mutineer Magazine. You have firsthand experience with why this industry is so amazing, but more importantly, you see the enormous potential we have for the future. We believe that the full creative power of this project can only be realized through inspired collaboration with you, the beverage industry and culture that we so humbly serve.\nFor those of you who are students or just getting your feet wet with drink careers, you are the absolute future of the industry. We believe that this guide will be the path that so many of you are looking for, and we invite you to start that journey today. Your backing, no matter how small, will bring this project to life.\nTo all our amazing supporters out there, we want you to have a vested interest in this project, because it's as much yours as it is ours. Whether you're a student with a knack for beverages or a marketer working in PR for a large spirits brand, we need your backing and belief in this project to make it a success!\n\nWhat will we do with any excess funds raised?\n\nFunds that are raised beyond our goal will be used to strengthen each aspect of the project \u2013 from expanding the guide to increasing its distribution \u2013 and ensure that this project is as successful and impactful as possible. The more we raise, the more we can bring this project to life in the most creative way imaginable.\nWhat is Mutineer Magazine?\n\nMutineer Magazine is a nationally distributed publication covering beverage culture with an emphasis on wine, beer and spirits, while also covering coffee, tea, soda, water, juice and other delicious beverages. Released in July of 2008, the 44-page magazine quickly doubled in size and grew to achieve national status with its fifth issue. As informative as it is approachable, Mutineer Magazine wants to change the way you read about fine beverages.\nWho are the Mutineers?\nTeam Mutineer is made up of a group of mildly insane, yet insanely creative individuals who regularly geek out over things like barrel aged bitters, and have a deep desire to express the amazingness of beverage culture through creative mediums. We are dedicated to being champions of beverage culture, and those within it. In order to do this, we need to take an active hand in the enrichment and growth of the industry, which is why we believe the Drink Careers 101 guide needs to be brought to life.\nPush Goals\nWhat do you get if we exceed our goal? \nIf we exceed our goal by $50,000\nMutineer Creative Director Julie Hadjinian will create a special, screen printed poster for all backers that contribute at least $50.\nIf we exceed our goal by $100,000\nWe will create an iPad version of the Drink Careers 101 Guide, which all contributors will have access to.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an experienced production team, work with a reliable printing company, and have access to Mutineer\u2019s extensive beverage industry and culture network.

When I returned home to LA I continued to brew because at the time there weren\u2019t many micro brews on the market and I found that the beer I made was better than most commercial beer available. Years later I started getting questions about where my beers could be purchased.\nI decided to take a leap of faith and start a commercial brewery, but, that takes a lot of money. So I found a way to brew at another facility and then sell it myself around the Los Angeles area. For the last two years I have been pounding the pavement with beer in hand selling it to bars, restaurants and retail stores throughout Southern California.\nIn Good Company!\nMy brand has reached a point that it is time for us to grow. We have over 400 accounts and we are opening more every day. We have just made our first nationwide shipment to Chicago and have orders for Arizona, New Jersey and New York!  In the last few months I have worked a beer festival every weekend serving over 10,000 beers to a wide range of beer lovers. The main question on everyones mind has been \u201cWhere is your tasting room?\u201d That is a good question. Our plan is to build a nano brewery and tasting room in the Marina del Rey/Playa Vista area of Los Angeles.\nPrime Location\nJust north of LAX. The location is a prime spot with the movie studios within walking distance, Facebook and Youtube now moving in nearby, about 5000 new condos in the area not to mention Loyola Marymount University just up the hill. I should also mention the 405 freeway is blocks away. In business they always say location, location, location. So I believe we have found the perfect home for Cosmic Ales. \nWHAT WE BELIEVE:\nThere is a craft beer movement happening all across the United States and especially here in Los Angeles. This is the perfect time to open a new brewery. A few have launched already and have already made an impact on the LA craft beer culture. \nWine and other spirits have always been known to pair well with food and to make a statement of great occasions. I believe that beer is the same, if not better in some ways. With so many styles and flavors, beer has become the new wine. Why not drink an incredible brown ale with a steak or a burger or a pale ale with great cheese platters or chicken dishes. A perfectly chosen beverage with a meal can taste like an ingredient that was meant to go with that dish. Great beer can be had on any occasion and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. Choosing the right beer for your meal should take as long as it does to find the right food.\nI brew by hand, not computer, and I carefully craft each one to be as flavorful and enjoyable for every moment of the day. Quality and excellence is our foremost goal. You will never have a Cosmic Ale that isn\u2019t up to our standards. If for some reason something happens to a bottle we guarantee it for 100% money back, better yet, come to the tasting room and we\u2019ll give you another pint straight from the keg. \nOUR DREAM:\nWe wish to someday have a large brewing facility that can help LA grow as a beer town. With so many people trying to get started in Los Angeles as new brands there are no real locations that can contract brew for them. This is how we started and we want to give back to our colleagues and help them succeed as well. But for now the next stepping stone is a nano brewery and tasting room. \nA nano brewery is this, a small scale operation brewing batches under 5 barrels at a time. The purpose is to be able to brew many different styles that we have created to share with the local community around the brewery. We will continue to brew on a larger scale at a facility in San Jose where we brew now for our commercial line of products. The nano brewery will be our tasting room and test kitchen where we will create the next great beer from Cosmic Ales. This will help with word of mouth around town and help to grow our brand and increase demand of each of our great products. Once the brand grows enough and word of mouth spreads and our sales hit another growth point we will be able to secure financing to build the ultimate brewery where we can brew, keg and bottle everything on site.\nTHE DONATIONS - Oh Where Your Money Will Go!\nYour donations will help us to grow and to succeed. Let\u2019s build a great gathering place for craft beer enthusiasts to come together to discuss and enjoy great drinks as well as sample from gourmet food trucks and cool live entertainment on a daily basis.\nIf you are interested in funding the larger of our projects, building the ultimate brewery, we are willing to sit and have a tasting with you and share our business plan and discuss the possibilities. But for now, help us to reach or small goal of opening a fantastic new hot spot for locally brewed beer in Los Angeles! Make sure you take a look at our website cosmicales.com and like us at Facebook.com/cosmicbrewery and follow our tweets twitter.com/cosmicales and #launchthespaceship; so you can learn more about us and what we are planning for the future.\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nWe have some great things we would love to do with this new facility.  First we need to open the doors, get licensed and all the legal stuff.  We already have a small nano system in place but we would love to upgrade.  This means more fermenters, a larger brewing system, more tables and chairs, etc.\nFor an extra $5000: We can buy two more 20 gallon conical fermenters.\nFor $5000 after that: More fermenters, or an upgrade for our draft cooling system and cold box. And some barrels for aging these great beers.\nFor every $5000 after that we will purchase new fermenters to be able to produce more beer for the tasting room and to sell specialty batches to local bars around us.\nTHE REWARDS:\nI figure you probably need a little clarification on some of the rewards we are offering.  I didn't want you to see another campaign that was full of stickers and t-shirts, sure we have those, but I have added a few new items to make it even more exciting.\nFIRST OFF: Let me make sure you know that EVERYONE that pledges money to help Launch The Spaceship gets enrolled in our Cosmic Kickstarter Coalition which gives you access to our private stock available to MEMBERS ONLY!\nFor instance: \nThe Cellar Club (tm)\nThis is like one of those exclusive cigar humidors only with beer.  Who has the time or money to build a cellar for the awesome beer you collect.  And why drink it at home?  Make our place, your place.  We will be offering a locker style system for you to store your precious barley pops, come to a great atmosphere and drink it here with your friends, or us!  With our reward we will give you a year membership and we'll stock it with great brews from our brewing friends like Drakes, Eagle Rock, Strand and more.\nThe Collaborators (tm)\nThis is another membership opportunity where you will collaborate with our brewmaster and help to brew beers throughout the year.  If the tasting room thinks it's a beer that needs to be out in the world commercially then we will do just that AND we will credit you on the bottle.  Talk about ultimate bragging rights!\nWe are also giving away tap handles both the new version and the classic as well as a barstool that is yours to take any time you are there.

Lurking underground for years, they risk throwing open fresh wounds in communities which are just beginning to heal.\nAfghanistan, a country with a long history of war, is dotted with these subterranean dangers. According to one report, about 1 million Afghans live within 500 meters of areas expected to contain landmines. Recently, a group of 10 girls lost their lives when they encountered a hidden mine on a routine outing to gather wood. On average, landmines claim about 42 lives every month.\nThis \u201cMine Kafon\u201d is a spherical mobile made out of biodegradable plastic and bamboo. It\u2019s light enough that the wind would--in theory--push it around naturally. But it is also heavy enough to set off landmines as it rolls over them.\n\u201cWith each detonation the Mine Kafon loses just one or two legs so it could potentially destroy three or four landmines in one journey\nThe Mine Kafon, at this prototype stage, has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Milan Design Week, Helsinki Museum, Dutch Design Week, Lodz Design Festival and acquired by MOMA in New York.\nAlthough it's been a great experience to have the Mine Kafon exhibited, we really designed it with the hope of deploying it in an actual minefield.\nWe now need your support to take it to the next level:\nHow much will it cost?:\nWe are asking for \u00a3100,000.00\nThis will cover costs related to engineering, fabrication, transport and the creation of a short documentary.\nCOST BREAKDOWN\nEngineering\u2013 \u00a324,500\nThis includes brainstorming sessions with an engineering company, engineering of the pressure points, the core with a GPS, the software (gps and website) and bamboo connection points. \nMolds \u2013 \u00a332,500\nMaking the molds ready for production \nFabrication\u2013 \u00a38,500\nPayment of team to build, fabricate and crash test the new design in the workshop.\nProduction of Rewards - \u00a316,500\nPayment and manufacturing of the rewards \nFilm Production- \u00a3 18,000\nCrew travel and transport of the Mine Kafon\u2019s to the minefield, documentary film licenses and other film production costs.\nRewards:\nPledge \u00a35 or more for a formal thank you credit on the film.\nThe documentary will be produced and directed by award winning, short film maker Callum Cooper. The documentary about the prototype is currently a finalist in the Sundance Focus Forward competition, so if you like that film, expect to see a longer, more involved movie.\nPledge \u00a37 and we will send you 3 very special Mine Kafon postcards.\nplus the thankyou credit on the film\nThese aren't just your typical postcard, they are way better, because they are augmented reality!\nSo when you point your smart phone or tablet at these seemingly normal postcard you will see things happen.\nThe first card is a video card, you see the kafon explode in super slow-motion. The footage is from the military tests we did last year that Callum documented and used in the short film.\nThe second card is a 3d model card, you see a 3-dimensional Mine Kafon move around ontop of the card.\nThe third card, we think is the coolest, it is the portal card.

I have turned the Mine Kafon feet into a lamp. The diameter is 30cm and it's height is 20cm, it comes with a black cable (150cm in length) and black plastic screw fitting. It is suitable for a 60 watt bulb.\nUpon request we can offer the plug as European, North American or British.\nA Pledge of \u00a395 Lamp + Ferfrak \n+ the thankyou credit and the 3 postcards\nA Pledge of \u00a3165 or more gives you a set of Mine Kafon Lamps\n3 lampshades.

This will be added to the film production costs and offer the backer an insiders connection to both the overall project and the film production and release. The short film Callum made last year is a finalist at this years Sundance Film Festival Focus Forward competition.\nA Pledge of \u00a35000 (or more) gives you a scale model of the current prototype.\nWe have made 10 scale models at roughly 1:4 scale of the Mine Kafon, a miniature version of the one we presented in Callum's film. We think it would make a great art piece or talking point for any lounge room like this:\nMine Kafon 1:4 Scale Model\nhere is a video of us constructing them:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course with a project of this scale there will be some obstacles:\n\n1. We need to install the Mine Kafon with a specific GPS that has a higher than normal level of accuracy. We hope to develop this aspect with the engineering company that will partner the project. We will then need to develop the software which will allow this information to be mapped.\n\n2. We will need to engineer more advanced pressure points to detonate the mines more precisely.\n\n3. We will need to work with the engineers to improve the construction so it has higher durability. \n\n4. We will need to work with engineers to plan for mass production.\n\n5. We want to design a retrieval system for the Mine Kafon, which will possibly be a motorised system within the core. This will allow it to move out of, or away from undesired positions. We still want to fabricate it as cheaply as possible.\n\nSpecific Location of Mine Field for the field test and filming:\n\nSome of my family are still in Afghanistan so we have a fairly clear understanding of the stability of the region. If however, by next year it is too unstable to travel there, we will release the Mine Kafon in a a similar but less dangerous location, such as Western Sahara or Southern Lebanon.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Special reward tier made for you", "update_content": "Hey guys,\nAs you know our new Mine Kafon Drone campaign is coming to an end in less than 55 hours.

As a result of being laid off, home brewing took on an entirely new meaning, and what started out as a, \"Wouldn't that be cool to do someday?\" conversation, has slowly turned into a reality. Yes, sometimes we have to pinch ourselves to see if this is really happening. Yep. It's real. Well, almost real. And that's where you come in.  \n\nOUR LOCATION \nWe are thrilled to be located in the heart of historic downtown Escondido. Our building dates back to the early 1900's, and if you are a lover of all things old like we are, it just adds to the buzz of it all. Along with the charm comes an abundance of improvements. Currently the space is completely empty. We are literally building this brew pub from the ground up. That means we will be needing to purchase everything from lighting fixtures, custom bar, brew house, cold boxes, kitchen equipment, seating, kegs, glassware, not to mention the construction, plumbing and electrical work required to bring this building up to a standard that can accommodate the needs of a small brewery and restaurant.  \nOUR GOAL \nOur goal is to raise at least $40,000 to help us with some of the expenses already mentioned. Truthfully, we will need more than this, but if you're not familiar with the way kickstarter works, it's an all or nothing deal! That means that we must make our goal or we don't receive anything at all. We can go over our goal, but not under it. And just in case you're wondering, your credit card information is securely handled by Amazon and will not be charged until after our goal is reached. We can't do this without your help.\nGIVING BACK \nAs a way of acknowledging the generosity of those who have given to help make our dream a reality, we want to commit up front to give back a percentage of our profits to help serve and improve our local community. Whether it's an individual in need, a school project that needs funding, or a park that needs sprucing up, we want to find ways to help make Escondido and the surrounding area a better place to live.  And for you, our supporters, well let's just say we're about to make your day seem a little brighter. We've got everything from T-shirts, stemmed glassware, exclusive growlers, tickets to our VIP celebration, and more to show our gratitude to you. Check out our rewards to the right.

An 8bbl steam fired brewhouse!\nWhat is this \u2018Independence from boring beers!\u2019 all about?\nAnyone that has had a generic Indian beer knows the plight of a billion Indian beer drinkers. There are a handful of fizzy yellow beers available in India and not a single craft beer in sight. Calling the industrialized beers of India \u2018boring beers\u2019 is being generously polite! Independence Brewing Company wants to introduce the art, passion, boldness, innovation and culture of American craft brewing to our friends in India.\nJoin us on our journey to bring Independence from boring beers in India!\nCraft beer half way around the world! Why should I care?\nFor the same reasons you care about craft beer or any other artisanal product; A sense of passion, pride, and fighting the notion that beer is no more than fizzy yellow stuff. Your support will help us introduce world class craft brewing to India\u2026and once even a fraction of a billion people start demanding better beer, the change will be dramatic and historic.\nTrue, Our cool gifts don\u2019t hurt either.\nDo Indians even drink beer?\nYes! The fizzy yellow beer industry in India is worth $7 billion. Scorching sun and hot food\u2026you need beer. Now imagine beers that rise to the level of the intensely wonderful flavors of Indian food, and we have the stuff of culinary glory.\nWhat\u2019s the plan?\nWe will be starting a brewpub in the city of Pune, a two hour drive east of Mumbai. Pune is an upcoming IT, Biotech, Manufacturing and Education hub. There are lots of students and professionals; the very people that are open to new ideas and will soon be demanding better beer. We will have at least six house brews on tap, with the addition of guest craft beers/special releases to keep things interesting. There will be some food served but our focus will be beer!\nThis will help us set up a base, get some cash flowing and begin to create a brand.\nOur ultimate goal is to establish a production craft brewery to reach a much wider audience. Bringing Independence from boring beers! \u2026one step at a time.  \nDo you guys know what you are doing?\nShailly has been home brewing for over 5 years, in California, and picked up awards on the way. He has also interned in brewpubs and brewed on professional equipment. His main job will be to brew awesome craft beer and keep the innovations flowing. Avanish is a business and finance guy and his main job will be to keep the business sound and healthy. \nAs Indians who have had their craft beer education in California, Shailly and Avanish became appalled at the industrialized beers being sold in India. Much as America has made a dramatic transition over the past three decades, growing from 42 breweries in the US, and flourishing to a robust 2,200+ today, the opportunity to change the landscape exists in India today.  As Indians and rabid craft beer enthusiasts, we started carefully researching the craft brewing industry, developing our business plan and raising funds to get started. Along the way we managed to convince craft beer visionary Greg Koch (CEO, Stone Brewing Co.) to come on as 'Chief Adviser,' and we have raised some money from Angel investors.\nAt this point, we\u2019ve spec\u2019d out our brewing equipment, shortlisted locations in Pune and hired key team members there, so we\u2019re well poised to get this project going!\nOver the next 6-9 months, we will be working hard in Pune to get this thing off the ground. Sure, we will have our challenges, but then great beer is all worthy of great efforts and we\u2019re up to the task!\nHowever, our goal needs your further support to become a reality.\nWhere will the money be spent? What if you exceed the funding goal?\nMost of the money will go into purchasing an 8 bbl (1 US bbl = 31 gallons) brewing system from North American suppliers. Some money will go towards purchasing malt, hops and yeast also from North American suppliers. If we exceed our funding we will have greater financial security till we break even. We would love to upgrade / upsize our equipment! \nIf we greatly exceed our funding goal (dreaming! dreaming! dreaming!) we might directly start a production brewery. Our goal will be to make you, as a craft beer enthusiast, proud of our efforts (and to supply a home base to your future travels in our great country)!\nAre you sure you are raising enough?\nBootstrapping is not an option for us. Considering that all our equipment and most of our supplies will have to be imported from North America our setup costs are substantial, plus we need some cash to fund operations till we break even. We have raised key funding from Angel investors, and that covers most of our costs. But we need a little more to get going and ensure success! Our goal on Kickstarter is the minimum we need to close the gap in our funding. But hey, we really could use all the help we can get!\nBe assured that bringing Independence from boring beers to a billion people is a great responsibility and we take it very seriously!  We certainly won\u2019t hit them all at once, or even a fraction of them, but we promise you one thing: We WILL be a success, and we WILL be an important part of the craft beer revolution in India!           \nHow do I Pledge?\nSimply select the reward on the right and follow the steps to complete the process.

Jon's new film is being shown at a festival in Lansing, Michigan, and Vince has come from Oakland to see it. Over the course of the evening, Vince finally gets Jon to admit that ten years ago he date-raped Amy Randall, a girl whom they both dated in high school - only then to reveal that he has taped their entire conversation. And not only that, he's invited Amy to have dinner with them that night. Beneath its suspenseful, high-stakes surface, TAPE examines questions of motive, memory, truth, and perception.\nBIOGRAPHIES\nLindsay Frame\nDirector\nLindsay Frame earned her MFA in Theatre Arts from the University of California, San Diego and has been a master instructor at Anthony Meindl\u2019s Actors Workshop since 2004.

We hope you are as excited to be a part of this project as we are. Please show your support and help spread the word about Jakarta Punk: The Marjinal Story. \nAbout the film:\nAnyone taking a taxi cab in Jakarta , stuck in a traffic jam, will have noticed 'street kids' coming up to the window appealing for money, often playing ukeleles and singing. Offering a few dollars worth of currency might leave one wondering -  'is this going to make a real difference?'\nIn Jakarta, there's a punk rock movement that established itself over a decade ago. Marjinal is one of Indonesia's original punk bands. The band quickly became popular because their songs offered hope for kids with few opportunities. Our film, Jakarta Punk: The Marjinal Story, is our way of spreading the message of change for those who cannot easily help themselves.\nPunk attitudes gave Marjinal the impetus to demand change against frightening odds. On the streets of Jakarta in the late 1990's, mass public protests brought about the end of authoritarian rule by then President Suharto. But Indonesia still has many social ills to heal, with around 50% of the population still living in poverty. Marjinal continues to sing about the injustices and corruption they see every day. Punk and its radical attitude is a cry from the streets. \nOur documentary has Marjinal at its core. It tells their story, as the voice of the street kids. Marjinal are inspiring a social and political revolution in Indonesia, helping directly through sheltering these homeless children, and teaching them creative ways to earn money. Punk gives these kids an identity, hope, a family. We look into the reasons why the punk community is a substitute for family and state support.\nFor your pledges to this Kickstarter project, we are offering you merchandise that is handmade by Jakarta's street punks, buying each item at a premium from the artists, providing them a means to earn a living. The remaining funds go to help cover the basic costs of making this film, dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of the marginalized in Indonesia. \nBeyond the documentary:\nWe have big plans for exhibits, bringing Marjinal on tour outside Indonesia, a photo book on Marjinal and Jakarta's punks and much more. Any additional funds we raise will improve our production standards for the film, and the better it does, the better position we will be in to achieve these future goals, raising the awareness of this dynamic and powerful punk movement in Jakarta.\nYOU CAN ALSO PLEDGE IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE U.S.A. !\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/JakartaPunkTheMarjinalStory\nREWARDS OFFERED WITH YOUR PLEDGE / ALL REWARDS BOUGHT FROM AND MADE BY PUNKS.

It's as Easy as Downloading an App.\nPebble is the first watch built for the 21st century. It's infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and useful internet-connected apps. Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. While designing Pebble, we strove to create a minimalist yet fashionable product that seamlessly blends into everyday life. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH APPS\nApps bring Pebble to life. We're building some amazing apps for Pebble. Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Don't worry about the rain, Pebble is water-resistant! If you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course. We're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more in the works!  \nCUSTOMIZE WITH WATCHFACES\nPebble can change instantly, thanks to its brilliant, outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) display. We've designed tons of watchfaces already, with more coming every day. Choose your favourite watchfaces using Pebble's iPhone or Android app. Then as the day progresses, effortlessly switch to the one that matches your mood, activity or outfit. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you need to stay on top of things, Pebble can help with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts. Dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Don't worry, it's easy to disable all notifications.\nIncoming Caller ID\nEmail (Gmail or any IMAP email account)\nCalendar Alerts\nFacebook Messages\nTwitter\nWeather Alerts\nSilent vibrating alarm and timer\nAndroid users can also receive Text Messages (SMS) on their Pebble. Unfortunately iPhone does not expose this data. Have any suggestions for other notification types? Leave us a message in the comments! \nCUSTOMIZE BY CODING\nWant your watch to tell you when your next bus is leaving? Maybe you're jonesing to see your compile status or recent github commits.. Think push notifications, directly to your watch using the data connection on your phone. Want to check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep? Pebble can send data from the accelerometer and buttons back up to the internet. \nPebble can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web-facing RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Pebble SDK, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain full control of the watch. Multiple apps can run on Pebble, along side watchfaces and regular notifications.\nLoad apps using Bluetooth \n144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper\nBluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)\n4 buttons\nVibrating motor\n3 axis accelerometer with gesture detection\nDistribute apps via Pebble watchapp store\nDetailed SDK specs are available on our Pebble Dev Blog.\nHow does it work?\nPebble connects by Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up Pebble is as easy as downloading the Pebble app onto your phone. All software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Pebble.\nCompatibility\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5.\nAndroid devices running OS 2.3 and up. Works great with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)!\nUnfortunately Pebble does not work with Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, or Palm phones at this time.\nWhere we're at\nWe\u2019ve been working on smartwatches for over 3 years now. The Pebble that you see in the video is a real, working prototype.\nWith your support, we can bring Pebble onto wrists worldwide. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund:\n- Production tooling\n- Large component order\n- Global Bluetooth certification\nREWARDS\nEach Pebble has a textured plastic case, shatter resistant lens with an anti-reflective optical coating and a custom-designed 22mm rubber strap. You'll also receive a special USB cable that recharges the watch.\nColor Option: Voter's Choice You're part of the design process! Three color options are already set: Arctic White, Jet Black and Cherry Red. If you back any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new, 4th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from Red/White/Black.\n$99 - Early Bird: 200 Black watches available.\n$115 - One Black Pebble.\n$125 - One Color Pebble.\n$220 - Two Black Pebbles.\n$235 - Prototype Pebble for early app development + one Color Pebble.\n$240 - Two Color Pebbles.\n$550 - Five Color Pebbles.\n$1000 - Ten Color Pebbles.\n$1,250 - Custom watchface + five Color Pebbles.\nFAQ\nQ.

We've burned through 10 oil changes, 3 engines, and 2 transmissions. We've shoveled 56,000 pounds of ice, refilled 43,000 gallons of water, and washed & chopped 3,000 bunches of local kale. We've had first degree burns, third degree burns, bumps, bruises and sprained ankles. Life on the road has been fun, but we think its time to plant some roots and have a place to call home.\nWHY A RESTAURANT? \n1. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD keeping up with our ever-changing schedules and twitter feeds. It's time we offer them a reliable spot and provide an actual roof over their heads, with tables and chairs as apposed to curbs and parking lots. \n2. With a motionless kitchen we would be able to offer ELEVATED MENU ITEMS, cooked to order, in a MODERN, INNOVATIVE and COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE.\n3. WE'RE SET BACK BY BREAKDOWNS. It's tough to feed people and run a business when our mobile kitchen blows a gasket...\nSo...How's the food?\nWe have 4.5 stars on Yelp!

It was an honest effort to help people healthy and feeling their best.\nSupporting Local Farms:\nWe stand behind our slogan of \"Local, Fresh Organic.\" It has always been extremely important to us to source from local farms whenever possible. Our sweetheart farm- Tanaka Farms- is located less than 5 miles from the truck in Irvine. Tanaka Farms is a true gem and grows amazing organic produce that we feature in each week's menu. We've built a strong bond with the Tanaka family, the farmers, and the produce stand operators and send business their way whenever possible. We believe that SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMERS and other small businesses is the best possible way to do business and reinvest in our COMMUNITY.\nSo, WHAT'S THE $100,000 FOR!?\nWe need to turn a SHOE SHOP into a RESTAURANT. The project actually costs $200,000, but we are only asking for half. The location is on the promenade pictured below, to the right of the umbrella. \nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why dont you just find an existing restuarant that went out of business instead of bulding out a kitchen?\"  \nGreat Question! The answer is because we FELL IN LOVE with Downtown Santa Ana and see an opportunity to get into the most UP & COMING AREA of ORANGE COUNTY at the GROUND LEVEL. A lot of effort is being put into restoring this area and we would love to be able to help build the COMMUNITY  and offer a much needed healthy dining option.\nHere is a breakdown of where the $200k would be going:\nConstruction $90,000, Kitchen Equipment $44,450, Front of the house $20,000, Profesional Design & Plans by Architect $14,000, Licenses/Permits $12,950, Insurance $1,500, Inventory $2,000, Misc $5,000, Professional Fees $1,500,  Rent & Deposit $4,400, 90 day working capital $15,000.\nHow many seats?\nAnother great question! We're estimating there will be 30 indoor seats and another 15 on the patio.\nWhat's the menu? \nThe restaurant menu will be an extended version of the truck menu, including some elevated dishes that aren't possible to execute on the truck. We will be keeping true to our slogan, \"Local, Fresh, Organic\" by continuing to source from local farms and using organic ingredients whenever possible.\nWe also plan to obtain a Beer & Wine license and feature Organic Wines, Gluten Free Beers, and Mimosas with WEEKEND BRUNCH!\nWhat about the truck?\nThe truck will continue to roam the streets of Southern California.\nBirds preppin on the truck\nWHO is in CHARGE HERE?\nShe is...\n\n\"Hi! I'm Stephanie Morgan, the owner/founder/chef of the Seabirds truck. I would be the one managing the restaurant and creating the menu. I also do most other things (since this is a small business and all). My background is in sales, customer service and finance and I've been successful in managing the truck for the last 20 months so I know I would be successful in managing the restaurant.

It is one of the longest established spirits in the world with a rich and turbulent history and it is exclusively associated with Ireland. The origin of distilling in Ireland dates back over 1,000 years. Before there was Irish whiskey there was poit\u00edn \u2013 a clear Irish spirit famous for its strength and \u201cmedicinal\u201d qualities. The word itself is Gaelic for \"little pots,\" which is derived from the small copper pots used by home distillers. It is an un-aged sprit that is traditionally made from potatoes or barley. Its taste varies by producer, but it generally has a somewhat herbal nose and is great as a replacement mixer in most whiskey, bourbon, or vodka cocktails.  It is also great neat or with a dash of water.\nNEW PLEDGE!! YOUR NAME HERE!!! INSTANT 'COOL' STATUS!!!\nThe name 1661 Poitin comes from the fact that the English Crown outlawed poit\u00edn in that year because of difficulty taxing it and as part of a larger effort to quash Irish culture. This ban lasted for more than 300 years. Recipes were handed down generations, and poit\u00edn was secretly distilled and shared throughout that period. Over time it has become a symbol of Irish pride and independence.\nWith your help I want to revive this age-old traditional Irish spirit. I want you to be able to taste and share this piece of Irish heritage. \nI plan to craft 1661 in a small batch Irish distillery and use only Irish ingredients, differentiating from most of the products on the international market that add \u201cpoit\u00edn flavor\u201d to a neutral grain spirit. 1661 Poitin will be a handcrafted, small batch, pure pot still spirit using locally sourced Irish ingredients. I have consulted with different brewers and 1661 will reflect both its heritage and have mass appeal.\nKickstarter allows people with great ideas a chance to execute them with help from supporters like you, i.e. a small donation.\nKickstarter will only charge your card and disburse the money to us if we reach the $40,000 goal by the deadline!!\n1661 Poit\u00edn is a spirit that is both historical and looks forward to the future.  I want to create a bridge between the Ireland I grew up in and the modern palate.  It is intensely personal to me because it reflects my own story.  I emigrated from Ireland, but I never want to forget what makes that place so special to me. Growing up on a farm in the heart of Ireland has given me a love and respect for truly Irish products because there was simply no alternative. Working as a bartender in the U.S. taught me that, although Americans love Irish spirits, they didn\u2019t have access to the most Irish of them all.  1661 was born out of my desire to share something uniquely Irish with the rest of the world.\nIn homage to this ancient Irish Spirit, 1661 Poit\u00edn will produce its first batch of poit\u00edn to revive the traditional Spirit of Ireland! \nThe money from this campaign will be used:\n- To work with the Poit\u00edn maker and the distillery\n- For bottling, label and packaging costs\n- For shipping, customs brokers and warehouse storage in the US\n- For distribution and licenses\nPlease remember that you won't be charged if we don't reach our goal. So click the \"pledge now' button and help revive poit\u00edn!\nWhy I am the person to make this happen:\nI have acquired my Federal Importer's Basic Permit and Federal Distributor's Permit from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the federal government. I have incorporated my company, traveled to Ireland to compute logistics, sourced distilleries, customs brokers, shipping merchants, labeling and bottling companies. I am now ready to produce my first batch of 1661 Poit\u00edn with your help! I have also worked in the bar industry since I was 15 when my parents bought a pub in the Irish Midlands!\nPlease take the time to watch my short video, to get to know me and learn more about 1661 Poit\u00edn! \nPlease remember that you won't be charged if we don't reach our goal. So click the \"pledge now' button and help revive poit\u00edn!

Through Hallyu, many countries in Asia have sparked wide interest in South Korean television series referred to simply as Korean Dramas, which are dramatic love stories that rely heavily on character development, a complex plot, and intelligent script-writing. \nEducation Abroad hopes to contribute to the Korean Wave in America and other English speaking countries by attracting a wider audience to seek interest in Korean Dramas, and therefore start to seek interest in other forms of South Korean culture down the road. \nThe Story:\nThe show is about Danny Han and Heejung Kim. Two seniors who meet in high school and fall in love. Though Heejung is a new foreign exchange student from Korea, Danny is able to make a connection with her. However, when Heejung's father finds out that Danny is from a poor immigrant family with no high ranking name and can't even speak Korean, he quickly rejects their love and sends Heejung back to Korea. Although she cannot forget about Danny, she does as her father wishes, but returns to America for college at a prestigious international university. Danny, heart-broken, vows to never let something like this happen to him again, and goes to Korea himself as soon as he graduates. There he gets a tutoring job teaching English. He returns to America for college about a year later with a firm grasp of the language, culture, and even a Korean name. But what the two never expected was seeing each other again, as they both happen to attend the same prestigious international university! \nWho is in charge of the series?\nThe series will be headed by Terry Song, a Korean-American filmmaker. \nTerry Song is a part-time model and actor from Pittsburgh. After a while of being in front of the camera, Terry found a greater interest behind it. During his later years in high school he took advanced TV production courses where he was trained by Doug Martin, a national award winning teacher of video production and teacher of the year finalist. By the time he graduated, Terry learned to write, produce, edit, and direct the daily news coverage show through the schools full featured TV station.

The other Michael Jackson. But who was Michael, and how did he inspire a worldwide revolution?\nBeer Hunter: The Movie is a documentary film about the British journalist and author Michael Jackson, who's books and television series about beer inspired the global phenomenon that is the craft brewing renaissance. An intimate portrait based on over 60 hours of rare, recent video footage, Beer Hunter sheds insight into the life and contributions of this brilliant and beloved man, who, while quietly battling Parkinson's, became the leading voice and inspiration behind the craft brewing movement. For those who had ever met Michael Jackson, or were deeply inspired by his work, it's hard to imagine that he is no longer with us.\nBased on the huge success of his books and magazine articles about beer, Michael wrote and starred in a six-part television series, called The Beer Hunter, which was released in 1989 by Channel 4 in the UK, and aired in the early 90's on the Discovery Channel in the U.S. While the show became an instant classic and has since aired in over 30 different countries, Michael was never able to get another episode produced before he passed away suddenly in 2007. Now, with the help of the international craft beer community, we can produce another beer hunting adventure in his honor.\nBeer Hunter: The Movie is our attempt to follow up the original Beer Hunter series with a rare library of more recent footage, showing Michael on - and \"off\" camera throughout the great beer cities, breweries, and pubs of Europe and the United States. The footage will form the basis of a movie about Michael's life, with the remaining footage edited into a series to be released as an open-source public resource. The unprecedented growth and popularity of craft brewing and distilling, and the ever-expanding field of beer and whisky writing, would never have been possible without Michael's ground-breaking efforts and uniquely engaging voice. It's important that we tell his story and recognize his contributions before his memory fades.\nMichael especially inspired renewed interest in the creative and complex beers of Belgium. In honor of that, and as a tribute to his inspiration, the Beer Hunter movie will incorporate never-before-seen footage of five young American brewers, who in 2006, led by Sam Calagione and the Italian beer expert Lorenzo Dabove, (and also featuring Rob Todd of Allagash Brewing, Vinnie Cilurzo from Russian River, Tomme Arthur from The Lost Abbey, and Adam Avery from Avery Brewing) visited the inspirational mecca of Belgium on a trip they dubbed \"Belge-a-palooza.\"\nFor the past three years, through many hours of donated time, and with the generous support of a few sponsors, we have put together the basis of a film from our existing library of recent beer-hunting footage. News of the film, as well as the trailer, leaked out very early on in production, and there are now thousands of people around the world eagerly awaiting its release. While a bit premature, it's testament to Michael's influence. We have potential screenings set up on virtually every continent, and it is our hope that all screenings will be fund-raisers for Parkinson's organizations. Though we have momentum, we have exhausted our personal resources, and need some outside help to see this project to completion. We are hoping the craft brewing community can come together to help us finish this tribute to Michael, and in the process help raise a lot of money for Parkinson's research. \nYOUR INVESTMENT\nWe are seeking funding to accomplish the following goals:\n1. Gather current interviews from leading brewers, distillers, and writers telling Michael's story, how he influenced them, and their personal view on the evolution of craft brewing and distilling.\n2. Pay for a soundtrack, graphics, post-production, and global distribution. \n3. Edit a series from the all footage not used in the film, to be included on a special collector's edition DVD for die-hard fans (check our rewards!).\n4. Create a public archive from the entire library of footage used to produce the documentary. This will be submitted to the existing Micheal Jackson Collection archive at Oxford-Brookes University, in London.\n5. Set up the non-profit Michael Jackson Memorial Foundation, with the goal of organizing annual fund-raising events in Michael's memory, with proceeds to benefit Parkinson's Research.\nCAN WE EXCEED OUR GOAL?\nAlthough $30,000 seems like a lot of money, it will barely accomplish the goals listed above. As always, the production team will be donating most of their time and effort, but film production can be surprisingly expensive, especially at this stage. Legal and copyright expenses, insurance, post-production, music, distribution, and marketing add up very quickly. Most documentaries of this scope can easily exceed $200,000 in total production costs. But by calling on favors, self-distributing, and using the beer community to market the film, we can substantially reduce our costs and finish the film on time.  If we exceed our goal, we will be able to license archival footage, specifically footage from the original Beer Hunter TV series, which will not be possible within our current goal. Simply put, the more money we raise, the better this film will be, and the more people that will be able to see it and appreciate Michael's life and work.\nMORE ABOUT MICHAEL\nIn 1977, British news journalist Michael Jackson published a groundbreaking book called The World Guide to Beer. It was the first time someone had attempted to categorize every known style of beer in the world, and the book inspired a revolution of sorts. People started talking about beer with the same respect previously granted only to wine. Michael's books and writing introduced brewers and beer enthusiasts to a whole new world of beer styles, particularly the great beers of Belgium. His writing was particularly well-received in the United States, where he quickly became the Godfather of the American microbrewing movement. But Michael didn't just write about beer, he wrote about people, and was fascinated by the story of the brewers behind the beer as much as he was the beer. It was this approach, combined with his uniquely engaging style of writing, that made him the world's most beloved and influential beer writer. He also became the world's most successful writer on the subject of distilled malt beverages, and his books on whiskey have sold more copies than even his books about beer.\nMichael's sudden passing on August 27th, 2007, at the age of 64, rocked the beer world. The Godfather was gone.\nMORE ABOUT THE FILM\nI started shooting video tastings with Michael in 2003 for the Rare Beer Club. But as we traveled to various tastings and events, and witnessed the rock-star status to which Michael was treated by the craft brewing community, the project quickly took on a greater scope. For the next three years, I followed Michael around Europe and the U.S. on what was ostensibly going to be a documentary, or even another Beer Hunter series. Most of the footage I shot by myself, on the fly, although towards the end I was fortunate enough to have audio and lighting help from my good friend Clarke Paschall. In all, we gathered over 60 hrs. of rare footage of Michael in Ireland, England, the Czech Republic, Paris, Belgium, and throughout the U.S. But no sooner had the project begun, than Michael's health started to fail. In 2006, he suffered a heart attack, after which it was revealed that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, a fact he had kept secret from even his closest friends and colleagues for over a decade. But, in typically self-deprecating fashion, Michael embarked on his final book, entitled \"I'm Not Drunk\", a humorous account about being a famous drinks writer suffering from Parkinson's.\nOn August 27th, 2007, however, the sad news of his sudden passing rocked the beer world. The Father of the craft brewing Renaissance was gone.\nOver the past three years I have gone through my existing footage, logged everything, released short segments for our Facebook and YouTube subscribers, and gotten together the basic story of the film. Our Kickstarter funding will go towards adding new interviews from leading brewers to the existing footage, purchasing a soundtrack, and will hopefully cover most of post-production. At that point we plan on self-distributing the film, primarily through the craft beer community network. We'd like to launch the film on August 27th, 2012, on the anniversary of Michael's passing, so we have a lot of work to do. We are also planning on having the World Premier in conjunction with the 2012 GABF, which is currently the largest gathering of craft enthusiasts on the planet.\nWe can't possibly tell all of Michael's story, but we hope that, by establishing an annual event in his memory, we can continue to carry his spirit. He was the pioneer that opened up a new frontier for so many in the craft beer industry. Incidentally, Michael hated that word - industry - when speaking of craft beer. My apologies for lack of a better synonym.And, we want your content! If you have photos, videos, stories, anything related to Michael and his role as an inspiration to you, send it along. Go to our website (www.beerhuntermovie.com) for contact info.\nI am hopeful that we can reach our fairly modest goal. Whatever the outcome, I am resolved to see that this project reaches the eyes, ears, and hearts of those who will appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your support, your donation, and for helping spread the word.

(And get some cool stuff like this growler, see the list to the right!)\nWe need your help to Kickstart Mississippi's 2nd Brewery!\nLiving in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country \u2013 but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world\u2019s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. For those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.\nAt Lucky Town, we\u2019ve assembled a team that has the skill set, the knowledge, and the passion to bring our beer to you. We not only want to provide the craft beer community with beer that they will love, but to challenge the rest to:\nBe Bold. Rediscover Beer.\nWhat are we doing?\nOpening a microbrewery in the Jackson metro area!\nLucky Town\u2019s ultimate goal is to stay true to our homebrewing roots by producing unique, artisanal, handcrafted ales and lagers. We intend to offer at least four year round beers that will roll out in pairs, but we also will be releasing small batch brews throughout the year that will be available in smaller quantities. Small batching will allow us more freedom to experiment with ingredients not normally found in beer that you find in Mississippi, providing for an ever-evolving product range rather than a fixed seasonal schedule. Examples include the southern pit barbeque inspired stout called \u201cStout of the Rising Sun\u201d which uses smoked grains combined with roasted jalapenos and Lucky Town\u2019s unique take on a winter warmer called \"What the Elf?\" that has cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel, figs and vanilla in it to give it a wonderful holiday flavor. Along with these will be the small batch Kaizen Saison, an ever evolving beer used to explore new flavor profiles and push the limits of what beer can be. We will never shy away from using non-traditional ingredients. Expect plenty of things aged in unique barrels, including sour beers that will spend as much as 3 years in the barrel getting funky.\nWhat do we need money for?\nWe can't wait to start brewing commercially so that you can finally have a taste of our hard work, but we need some start-up funds to do it first. We are asking for $20,000 but have a higher goal of $40,000 for initial funds, and of course the more we get, the faster we get started. With help from you we can move our vision from dream to reality!\nWhat Lucky Town will be...\nOur ideal space would encompass a tasting room with a broad selection of our beer on tap for patrons to enjoy, including growler fills and six-packs for sale so you can take our beer home with you. Unfortunately, the State of Mississippi doesn\u2019t allow for any of this to take place - we intend to change that. Lucky Town is devoted to modernizing our state\u2019s beer laws so that residents and visitors to our state can enjoy and appreciate a local handcrafted beer the freshest way it was intended to be appreciated, which is from the brewery taps.\nWe love Mississippi, and we plan on giving back to the local community once we are up and running. Lucky Town will produce exceptional beers within the brewery, but we intend to reach out and enhance the Jackson area by hosting craft festivals - music, art, and beer. We will also have space in the brewery that will be available for the public to use as a studio, meeting or gathering space for special events.\nSl\u00e1inte,\nLucas, Chip, Brandon & Angela\n\nLinks you should CLICK\nVisit our Facebook Page!\nFollow us on Twitter!\nCheck out our beers and learn more about us: www.luckytownbrewing.com\nClick here to listen to an interview we did with Aleheads.com.\nHere\u2019s a local pub run that we host every month that promotes running and craft beer!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Journey to Open Jackson's First Post-Prohibition Microbrewery", "update_content": "...and what a journey it has been.\nThe last few years of chasing our dream to start and grow Lucky Town Brewing Company has been full of ups and downs (and thankfully way more ups than downs).

But, I'll say it\"  -KC Beer Blog\nWe are passionate about better beer and the artistic expression present in the creation of the many beers we have brewed at home.  We want to create a wider network of friends, family, and local community who can enjoy our artisan beer. In order to create that network we need to brew more than the five-gallon amounts that we currently make on the stove at home. Our project is to buy all the necessary equipment and obtain all the proper licensing we need in order to artistically brew our beer in 60-gallon amounts, known as \"Nano Brewing.\"\nWe love brewing and sharing our delicious beer, so much so that our friends and family are asking us to make more available to them. So that is exactly what we are planning to do. It is our goal to make some more friends in the process and keep brewing as the demand goes up and move our equipment into a space that could one day be called a brewery.\nWilderness Brewing Co. is an art project.  It is no different than the creation of a fine painting; only, instead of a canvas we'll use a kettle.  Instead of blending different shades of paint, we'll blend unique varieties of grains, hops, yeast, and water.  Instead of staring at the finished work of art, you will drink it!\nPlease take time to watch our short film, as you  will get a much better feel for what Wilderness Brewing Co. is all about.  Please remember that you won't be charged if we don't reach our goal.  If we do, you will be charged in August when the project ends.

Thanks for your support and patience as the campaign just passed the three year mark. We certainly expected to be up and running by now.\nThree years ago my wife (Andrea) and I uprooted life in Southern California to pursue my (and Nate\u2019s) dream. It wasn\u2019t a simple decision to leave the stability of life we had to pursue a passion\u2026but it was the one that we made. We made that decision because the dream of opening a brewery was one worth pursuing. It\u2019s been a long journey.

But after two months of negotiating the terms of our lease, working out the specifics of building codes required of us, determining our plan to move forward, and waiting on our potential landlord to get back to us concerning various topics, we regret to inform everyone that we had a verbal contract broken on us (verbal contracts are legally binding in Missouri).
