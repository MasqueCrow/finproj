We design and make products. To preorder this Travel Tripod and bring it to life, click Back This Project. Or scroll on, scroller. \nTake a closer look at the Travel Tripod with Lawrence, Peak Design's boy genius:\nAnd, check out the host of optional accessories that you can add onto your pledge (instructions at end of video):\nSo why redesign the tripod? Because traditional travel tripods have a critical flaw: tons of wasted space. The result is a tool that is inherently difficult to carry with you into the field. We fixed that, and more. \nWe spent 4 years redesigning the tripod from the ground up to eliminate dead space and minimize packed-down size. \nBut we didn't stop at space savings. \nWe made a tool that deploys and packs down rapidly\u2014nearly twice as fast as a traditional tripod. We made it intuitive and delightful to use. We engineered professional-quality stability and performance. And we added thoughtful features to help you get the shot\u2014 with any gear, in any environment, from any point of view.  \nWe built the Travel Tripod around the photographer's workflow. How? We are photographers.\n\nWe loaned pre-production samples of the Travel Tripod to some of our favorite creatives on Youtube. Here's what they had to say:\nPeter McKinnon compares the PD Travel Tripod to the Gitzo Traveler:\nManny Ortiz goes ham on the Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod in downtown Chi-town:\nKitty Peters of Atola Visuals goes deep on the Travel Tripod and shares footage from our media unveiling event we hosted in San Francisco:\nTechCrunch interviews Peter Dering and Art Viger on the design considerations behind the Travel Tripod:\nAlright, let's dive deeper into every crevice of the Travel Tripod's functionality:\nPro performance. Half the size.\nThe Travel Tripod takes up half the volume of a traditional travel tripod. We also eliminated bulky, protruding knobs. The result? Every water bottle pocket on your bag is now also a tripod pocket, and you're carrying a full sized tripod with professional capabilities.\n\nSet it up (and pack it down) faster.\nWith traditional travel tripods, slow setup may mean a missed shot. Not with the Peak Design Travel Tripod. We designed strong, easy-to-use leg cam levers that can be operated together (no tedious twist locks!). With our architecture there's no need for the legs to flip up/down when packing and unpacking.  And, we topped it off with lightning-fast camera quick-attachment/release.\nCurrent office record: 9.4 seconds from packed to legs deployed.\n\nLove thy ball head.\nNo more guessing which knob to turn or how far to turn it: a single and precision-engineered adjustment ring gives total articulation. Our locking ring gives you further stability and vibration reduction. But even without it, your camera is locked securely in place. The unique head design gives you greater range of articulation, and incorporates 3 portrait mode cutouts instead of 1.\nMade for the camera in your bag.\nMake no mistake: the Travel Tripod is small, but it's ready for big jobs. High-performance materials and precision machined parts yield weight capacity, stability, and vibration dampening comparable to much larger, more expensive tripods. The Travel Tripod is designed to handle pro photography gear, easily handling a full-frame DSLR with a 70-200 lens. Combining a 20lb weight capacity with a 60\" max height, the Travel Tripod performs as well as any other in its class. \nAlso made for the camera in your pocket.\nThere's a reason that phones are already the most used cameras in the history of cameras: mobile devices take incredible pictures,  they're only getting better, and you always have it with you. That's why we gave the Travel Tripod a brilliant, stowable, universal mobile mount hidden in the center column.\nMore points of view. More environments. \nIt takes just seconds to switch to Inverted Mode, perfect for macro or product photography. Or, with a few turns of the included hex wrench, you can reconfigure into Low Mode. The Travel Tripod goes lower than any other tripod in its class, enabling unmatched ground perspective shots. Plus our separately available add-ons give even more versatility: the Universal Head Adaptor lets our tripod with any tripod head, our Spike Feet add grip in ice and looser terrain, and the Ultralight Conversion Kit removes the bottom 4 sections of each leg and takes almost half the weight off your tripod making it an incredible tabletop-sized backpacking tripod. Check out our addendum video for more info on the accessories. \nA zippered soft case from the legendary Peak Design soft goods department, plus all the tools to use and maintain your new tripod: our precision machined aluminum Standard Plate, a hex wrench for plate tightening and tripod maintenance, and the phone mount mentioned above.\nL-brackets and 3rd party tripod plates. Remove the pins on the ball head for longer plates. Compatible with most Arca Swiss plates. \nHow about the entire Peak Design Ecosystem. Secure Anchor connection points let you carry the Travel Tripod with any Peak Design strap. The Travel Tripod uses the same plate that comes with our Capture Camera Clip. Carry the Travel Tripod in (or on) any Peak Design bag. It's the size and shape of a water bottle, making it easy to carry in any bag you want.\n\n\nDurable, serviceable, and guaranteed for life.\nWeatherproof and impact-resistant, we built the Travel Tripod to give you years of joy. How many years? A lifetime. Like all Peak Design products, we guarantee the Travel Tripod for life (see warranty details in the FAQ). We made every part of the Travel Tripod serviceable, cleanable, and replaceable, to give it a longer lifespan and generate less waste.\nReady to take the plunge? Click Back This Project, and pick a reward.\nThen let's add on some accessories:\n\nPeep this sick vid for details on the above add-ons, and instructions on how to add them:\n\nAnd what if you're detail-oriented?\nTripod Specs, Materials & Performance Testing\nWe've been working with a Stanford physicist during pre-production to ensure the Peak Design Travel Tripod has pro-level stability. Well, he's not just any Stanford physicist. David Berryrieser is the founder of The Center Column, a site dedicated to scientifically testing tripods. David may be the world's foremost expert on tripod performance.\nIn short, the Peak Design Travel Tripod is as stable, if not more stable, than most other travel tripods in its class. That means you get extreme compactness without sacrificing performance.\nDavid tests tripods using harmonic oscillation. For more info on what that means and how the Peak Design Travel Tripod compares to others, read Update #8. Here's what the testing looks like:\nTesting of the PD Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod. Note how much less movement there is versus the otherwise comparable 3rd party travel tripod below.\nTesting of the MeFOTO Road Trip Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.\nAgain, read Update #8 for the full story behind our performance testing.\n\nEnvironmental & Social Impact\nMaking and selling stuff creates pollution. It is Peak Design's responsibility to clean up that mess, and find ways to make less mess in the first place. It is also our responsibility to look out for the well-being of the many people who contribute to Peak Design, ensuring that we succeed at the expense of nobody.\nBelow are the key sustainability and responsibility considerations in making the Travel Tripod. You can learn about Peak Design's company-wide sustainability plan here.\nTravel Tripod is carbon neutral. That means that zero net greenhouse gases are emitted when making/delivering the Travel Tripod. We achieve this by measuring the Scope 1-3 carbon footprint of the Travel Tripod, from raw material mining to manufacturing to shipping to the end customer. We then reduce or offset that carbon footprint in its entirety. Peak Design is fully carbon neutral, all the way back to the beginning of our company.\nTravel Tripod is fully serviceable, and nearly every single part is individually replaceable. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee. This means less material has the chance to end up in a landfill.\nTravel Tripod is built in factories that pay workers fairly and provide for their safety. Peak Design works with our partner factories to maintain a code of conduct for worker pay, safety, and conditions. We invest in 3rd party audits to ensure these standards are always met. \n1% of Travel Tripod sales go to grassroots environmental nonprofits. Peak Design is a 1% for the Planet member, meaning that 1% of all our revenue goes to protecting wild places. As of April 2019, we've donated over $1 million to environmental nonprofits.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe launch our products on Kickstarter because it gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds we generate on Kickstarter make it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking venture capital. That means we're not beholden to growth goals, revenue targets, or product timelines imposed by other people. Instead, we focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can possibly make, fueled by support from the best customers we could possibly ask for.\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. From the beginning, our backers have steered the direction of our product roadmap, both with their feedback, and with direct participation in our design process via surveys and focus groups. This close collaboration is made possible by communication and community-building tools of the Kickstarter platform.\nThank you for letting us continue on this incredible journey.\n\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. Through the years we've gotten pretty darn good at setting accurate expectations and delivering on our promises. But no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: Global shipping and warehousing logistics is mind-boggling. Hence we outsource that stuff to experts. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or a horrific avocado toast shortage.

Simply squeeze and credit cards emerge, perfectly arrayed for immediate access.  Release your grip, and the cards drop down, locking in securely.\nThe wallet is beyond tough. We built and tested the wallet to last over 100 years.  The internal lift system is tested to well over 500,000 cycles (and going), the wallet is corrosion resistant and thoroughly impact-tested.  We construct it right here in Utah out of American aluminum, stainless steel, and high-strength polymer.  In other words, it will last you your lifetime, backed by our Industry leading \u201cA3 Guarandamntee.\u201d\nThe wallet comes optional with a high quality leather sleeve for those of us who are \u201cminimalist-plus,\u201d  allowing you to store cash or just more cards.  Without the leather jacket, the GRIP6 wallet feels strong, sleek, and space-age.  With the leather, the wallet feels more traditional, but maintains strength and quality.  We\u2019ve also included the optional FingerLoop\u2122 at no extra cost, which increases control, pocket access, and is fun to use. \nMade poorly and wear out quickly\nOften bulky, thick and annoying\nDifficult to access cards you need\nDon't protect against RFID\nThe defining feature of the GRIP6 Wallet is the patent pending internal lift mechanism. With a simple squeeze, 6 cards emerge in an easy to retrieve stair step pattern.  This geometry leaves enough room between the cards for you to locate and grab the individual card you need. The cards can be put back in any order.\nWe spent a great deal of time testing and redesigning the wallet to last hundreds of thousands of cycles, simulating a century of use and abuse.  We don't believe in planned obsolescence.  We wanted a wallet to last longer than you. That may sound far-fetched, but it's true. We built a machine to cycle test the wallet half a million times before we stopped it, but it still hadn't broken. We took the wallet apart to see what damage had occurred, but almost none had; the wear was minimal. We feel really good about our final design and we think you'll love it.  You will be able to use your GRIP6 Wallet more than a dozen times per day, everyday, and it should last 105 years.  Because we're confident in our abilities and testing, we've also guaranteed them for life.\nWhen you're not actively using the GRIP6 Wallet, the cards automatically remain locked in by a patent pending mechanism.  In addition, the light, durable 6061 T6 Aluminum body effectively blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals used by the modern thief.  These features make sure the GRIP6 Wallet is both physically and electronically secure, and give you needed peace of mind.\nWe have a deep-seated belief that manufacturing is critical to the future of the United States' economy.  Many \"Made in the USA\" products are from materials and components from outside of the USA.  With the GRIP6 Wallet, we are able to source the high quality Aluminum, the top-grain Leather, and the glass bead-blasted injection molded plastic for the lever and internal lift mechanism all within the  USA.  The only thing we don't source within the USA are the stainless steel screws.  We're looking at bringing that home soon.\nAnd it's not just made and sourced in the USA.  We cut and build the wallets right here in Utah, at our in-house manufacturing facility.  Owning the production process of a product also allows us to: \nTightly control quality and consistency\nMake minute process and redesign changes immediately\nIncorporate customer feedback quickly\nProvide fulfilling local jobs\nProblem solve any issues that arise very quickly\nWe only use the best materials. The GRIP6 Wallet is wrought from 6061 T6 anodized aluminum, stainless steel screws, stainless steel springs, stainless steel pins and a high performance, glass bead-blasted, Bayblend\u00ae injection molded plastic. This wallet will withstand the toughest conditions and won't rust.\nThe FingerLoop\u2122 was created to enhance your interaction with your wallet. The unique loop design makes it a cinch to pull the wallet out of your pocket. It ensures a more secure hold on the wallet and, most importantly, it's really fun!  You can flip your GRIP6 Wallet in your hand like a wild west gunslinger all day long and people around you will wonder, \"What is that thing!? It's amazing! I want one!\" But in all honestly, it really is both functional and fun.  We do caution you is that it's likely to annoy people how much you take your wallet out of your pocket to sling it around!\n The optional Leather Jacket gives your GRIP6 Wallet a softer, more traditional feel and provides expandability. It can hold both cards and cash and doubles the capacity of your wallet. The prototype leather covers are laser cut, but during full production they will be cut with a die on a clicker press (i.e., the leather will be clean and consistent).  They are then sewn on our \"Boss\" leather sewing machine that is capable of punching through 3/4\" thick layers of leather or webbing. We will be converting the hand stitching machine into a fast, automated sewing machine for volume production.\nThe funds raised from this kickstarter will be used to purchase domestic plastic injection molds, all raw materials, equipment for cutting and sewing leather, and custom tooling for CNC machining the plates. We will literally be creating these unbelievable wallets with our own hands.  We've already done the hard work and know we'll be delivering you a one-of-a-kind product. We're excited to share the journey with you!\nBJ Minson was a regular, back-pocket-wallet kind of guy for many years. But one day in a fit of minimalist indignation he pulled his sloppy, misshapen, hideous wallet out of his back pocket and asked himself, \"Why in the world do I sit on this stupid thing all day?\" \nSo, he decided to put his cards in his front pocket and used a blue rubber band taken from a broccoli stem to hold them together. It was sooooo much better... for two weeks. Then the rubber brand broke. He bought more broccoli and a new rubber band, and the rubber band broke again.  This cycle happened several times. It wasn\u2019t a bad setup: BJ was getting healthier eating all the broccoli and at least he didn\u2019t have to deal with the ills of a regular wallet.  But it wasn\u2019t perfect. \nNext, he purchased a thin, simple, card-holding wallet. It was good, but it was difficult to find the right card and even more difficult to get the card out, and the wallet fell apart too quickly. He bought a different one.  Rinse and repeat, the same thing happened. \nAt the time BJ was studying mechanical engineering and he determined to design a better wallet. He got together with his friend Dan and over the course of several months developed the GRIP6 Wallet. \nAt the time, BJ knew very little about manufacturing and the wallet was going to be fairly expensive to produce. He decided to give it a try on Kickstarter in 2012 with an audacious goal of $100,000.  Even with a sale price of more than $100, the wallet did surprisingly well and got almost halfway to the goal! But, sadly, ultimately did not fund. \nBJ went on to finish school, get a day job as an engineer, and kept his prototype wallet in his pocket for the next 7 years (yes, the original wallet still works fine). During that time, he designed and produced a new belt that was innovative, simple, and amazing. He launched it on Kickstarter in 2014 and it funded! BJ founded a company called GRIP6 (check out grip6.com for more info). He started in his garage with the help of friends and since that time has made hundreds of thousands of belts. \nGRIP6 grew quickly and steadily and has become a company that prioritizes and understands the value and complexity of in-house production and manufacturing efficiency.  Even as GRIP6 grew to be a leader in belts, BJ\u2019s mind often wandered back to his beloved wallet, and he finally decided to bring his wallet to life. \nHe and his team of engineers at GRIP6 have spent thousands of hours, exhausting their experience and ingenuity to make the wallet better, stronger, and much more economical. In honor of the birthplace of the original wallet and the GRIP6 name, BJ decided to bring it back to Kickstarter to give it new birth and to give the Kickstarter community the first opportunity to join the project and share the journey of bringing the wallet to full production.  \nSo - Thank you kickstarter community for giving us a start we couldn't have found anywhere else! We'll always be grateful to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are no strangers to manufacturing and the difficulties and problems that arise.

We spent over a year sourcing 100% pesticide-free, heirloom cardamom that met our high standards of taste, quality and sustainability, and we\u2019re finally ready to share it with you!\n$25,000 allows us to purchase the entire 400 lb 2019 spring harvest, and package it in our beautifully redesigned recycled glass jars.\n Anything we make over $25k, will go towards purchasing milling equipment, sourcing Coorgi rainforest pepper, Gujarati sea salt, Rajasthani desert cumin and regional chill peppers from Karnataka and Andhra, coming end 2019!  \nThis cardamom has been a long time coming...\nI first tried to source organically farmed Indian green cardamom in the spring of 2018. I called all my contacts at the Indian Institute of Spice Research and the Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI), and put the word out amongst my network of South Indian farmers and their communities. \nBy summer 2018, I collected samples from several certified organic cardamom growers, but heard a very concerning story from the spice research community. Dr. Vijayan, a trusted resource and the deputy director of research at ICRI, bluntly explained to me how big commercial cardamom growers cheat the organic certification process to sell pesticide-ridden cardamom labeled as organic to the global market. Sure enough, every single lab result for the samples I received came back positive for pesticides.\nJust when I had given up on sourcing pesticide-free cardamom, I got a call from Mr. Abraham Chacko- a farmer bang the middle of the cardamom hills- the region where commercial and corrupt cardamom agriculture is at its worst. Shockingly, his sample came back 100% pesticide free. I booked a flight to visit him the next day. \nAbraham started farming over 20 years ago on his family estate with little success. In 2017, after adopting a new low-budget biodynamic farming method, he noticed some of his cardamom plants were faring much better than the rest. He began to selectively breed the older, hardier plants bearing healthy fruit and withstanding the pests that usually devastate organic cardamom. \nThe resulting cardamom seeds are fruity, incredibly potent, with a lasting fragrance. I could already imagine the kadak, spicy cups of chai, or the aromatic, heady pastries we could make with them! \nFrom left: The Princess (50g) and The Queen (100g)\nAbraham has tried to sell his cardamom at the local auction house for years, but commodity cardamom is chosen based on size and color alone, factors that have no relation to their taste or quality. His paler, smaller pods fetch a low price, and since the auction houses are usually financed in some part by pesticide and fertilizer companies, there is no market for anything grown organically.\nThe commodity price of cardamom is 15x the price of every other spice on the Indian spice market. After saffron and vanilla, it's the third most expensive spice in the country. So naturally, it is a game of big players with big cash, and whilst we're a small player with small cash we've always had big dreams, big impact, and big community :) \n WHO WE ARE: \nDiaspora Co. was founded in August 2017 to disrupt and decolonize the spice supply chain. Our first offering, a high-curcumin, freshly-milled, heirloom turmeric called Pragati, was born out of the idea that if turmeric was going to explode and have its \"moment\" in the U.S., we wanted to make sure that it was sourced equitably, transparently and sustainably. We've since become known as the highest standard of turmeric in the U.S., used in your favorite turmeric latte brands, restaurant menus and in over 15k homes across the country. \nOur business promise is to pay our partner farms between 2x-10x the commodity price (more on that below), and source the freshest, heirloom, single-origin spices from India.

Even worse, if you don\u2019t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink \u2013 taking your sanity with them.\nThe Equilibric colander reduces the amount of water needed to wash your fruits and vegetables by 60% - all while removing twice as many contaminants! You will never have to worry about items in the sink again because this design saves you time and frustration.\nIts ergonomic design keeps the vegetables upright and safe as the water bowl drains the dirty water away, cleaning your foods and keeping your clean items safe from spillage.\n\nThe colander also serves as a great serving dish for you.  You don\u2019t have to worry about using more dishes than necessary just because you need something to put them in afterwards.  Drain the excess water from your vegetables - and serve your fruits or salads in the same dish.\nTrying to defrost something at room temperature turns into a huge problem for most cooks.  Water often winds up all over the counter creating an even bigger mess, and more work for you.\nWith typical colanders, lots of dirt and other contaminates can transfer to your clean serving dishes.  But with the Equilibric colander, its washing machine motion helps remove 90% of the dirt and bacteria from your foods \u2013 giving you a healthier, more nutrient rich meal!\nAs you can see, the Equilibric colander saves you time and energy.  It\u2019s also incredibly efficient, sanitary, and environmentally conscious.  Moreover it saves extra money on your water bill.\nEquilibric has a very well considered hole slots pattern that allows to drain the excess water fast and simple. Equilibric Bowl is made from a high quality polypropylene which is an unharmful material to dine from. Equilibric Bowl design has a special spin system which uses the force of gravity to speed up all kitchen tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory. Team. Development. Future.\nMy name is Ann and I\u2019ve been working in design for eight years. I\u2019ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we\u2019ve come up with Equilibric.\nMe and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.\nFour years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.\n\nThanks to Tim, my sketches and concepts came to life as working prototypes.\n\n\nThe most problematic part was talking to various China-based factories. We were sending the design and info over, but struggled with communication problems. But ultimately, we found a manufacturer and a manager that helped us on this stage after it had stretched on for a while.\nTwo years ago, Sabina joined us as a co-founder, responsible for communications and marketing. Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to Kickstarter and organize everything.\nWe\u2019re really grateful to Inpixel, the company that took care of the video material for us, delivering calmly great results despite my quite extensive list of requests.\nOur future plans is to introduce a brand new type of colander for enthusiasts and kitchen professionals. I promise, you haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, and we\u2019ll be showcasing it on Kickstarter right from the concept stage! We\u2019re also creating a USB-powered heating food container, which might possible have its own battery.\nOur global goal is to create a brand of smart kitchen gadgets and food containers (both with and without heating) for carrying your dishes.\nPlease help us bring our plans to life, and become part of Equilibric!\n\nTIMELINE\n\nApril 24, Project ends\nMay 8, Receiving funds from Kickstarter\nMay 9 - July 10, Mass production\nJuly 10-20, Quality control\nJuly 20-25, Shipping to the fulfilment and logistics centre\nJuly 26, Shipping out\nEnd of August, All backers receive their Equilibric\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION \n\n+ SHIPPING ADDRESSES WILL BE COLLECTED VIA CROWDOX  \nhttps://crowdox.com\n\n+ LOGISTICS AND FULLFILMENT SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED BY SFC \nhttps://www.sendfromchina.com\nSHIPPING RATES\n1 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $5\nCanada - $5\nHong Kong - $5\nSingapore - $5\nChina - $5\nKorea - $5\nJapan - $8\nEurope - $8\nUnited Kingdom -$8\nAustralia - $12\nRussian Federation - $12\nRest of the world - $12\n2 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $9\nCanada - $10\nHong Kong - $10\nSingapore - $10\nChina - $10\nKorea - $10\nJapan - $16\nEurope - $16\nUnited Kingdom -$16\nAustralia - $25\nRussian Federation - $25\nRest of the world - $25\n 6 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $20\nCanada - $25\nHong Kong - $25\nSingapore - $25\nChina - $25\nKorea - $25\nJapan - $29\nEurope - $29\nUnited Kingdom -$29\nAustralia - $45\nRussian Federation - $45\nRest of the world - $45\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSomething can always go wrong especially when we are talking about worldwide shipping.

This time around, we wanted to design a more minimal pen that's sleek and pocket friendly. By incorporating the highest quality materials with subtle design elements, we were able to create a full size feel in a compact form factor. Whether you're in the board room or out in the field, the EP1 is the essential EDC pen for any occasion.\nWe designed the REFYNE EP1 around the Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 refill because we love the way it writes. Smooth and easy. Also, we knew that by choosing this style refill, it would allow users to swap out to literally dozens of other options because our pen works with any standard parker style refills (list of refills below). Who doesn\u2019t like variety, right?\nFeaturing a unique shaped bolt action channel, the bolt action mechanism was chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment. With the flick of your finger you can open or close the pen in a fraction of a second. We decided to add a subtle design element, by using copper for the internal barrel. \nDepending on your carry preferences, the sleek deep carry pocket clip can be easily removed with the turn of a screw. The integrated top cap allows this to be done seamlessly without showing any unsightly holes or notches when the clip is taken off. Additionally, the clip is keyed to keep it secure and in position. \nEach screw has been custom machined and accepts a standard Torx T6 bit. This makes tightening down the bolt or removing the pocket clip both effortless and secure.\nDimensions: 115mm x 10mm (4.53\" x 0.39\")\nPolished Titanium body: 24g (0.88oz)\nBlack PVD Coated Stainless Steel body: 36g (1.23oz)\nRemovable Custom deep carry pocket clip\nCopper Barrel Bolt-Action\nBlack Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 M refill (included)\nCompatible with most Parker style refills\nCustom Torx T6 hardware\nList of most Parker Style Refills:\nFaber-Castell Ballpoint Pen Refill\nFaber-Castell Scribero Gel Ink Roller Refill\nFisher Space Pen Refill, PR Series- Colors (Bold, Medium, Fine)\nFisher Space Pen \u2013 Universal Ballpoint Refill\nForay (Office Depot) Ballpoint Refill for Parker (Medium)\nItoya Aquaroller Refill (0.7 and 1.0mm)\nKaweco Soul G2 Refill 1.0mm\nKaweco Sport Roller Ball Pen Refill\nMoleskine Ballpoint Refill\nMoleskine Gel Refill (0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nMoleskine Roller Gel Fluorescent Refills\nMonteverde Ceramic Gel Refill (Broad)\nMonteverde Needle Point Refill (Fine)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- Colored inks (Medium)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- (Superbroad, Medium, Ultrafine)\nOHTO Needlepoint Ballpoint Pen Refill PS-807NP\nOHTO PS-205NP Extra-Fine 0.5mm Ballpoint Pen Refill\nParafernalia Ballpoint Pen Refill NO LOGO\nParker Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nParker GEL Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nParker Quinkflow Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium, Fine)\nPelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Broad, Fine, Medium)\nPentel KFLT8 Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPlatignum Standard Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPremec Parker-Style G2 Gel Refill (0.4, 0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nRetro 51 Tornado Roller Ball Refills (REF5P) (Made by Schmidt)\nSchmidt 9000M EasyFlow Pen Refill\nSchmidt P8126 Capless Rollerball (Fine)\nSchmidt P8900 Super Bowl Refill (Fine)\nSchmidt P900 B Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchmidt P950M Megaline Pressurized Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nSchneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchneider Slider 755 Pen Refill (Extra-Broad, Medium)\nSTABILO EASYgel Refill\nStabilo Ballpoint Refill\nTombow BR-ZLM Ballpoint Pen Refill\nVisconti Ballpoint Pen Refill AA49 1.4 (Broad)\nVisconti Gel Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs experienced and successful project creators across three brands, we're fully aware of all the different risks and challenges that could arise when bringing a product into reality.

With the use of basic tools, a simple design emerged from my hands.  A small and tactile object that has proven to be more useful in everyday life than I had expected. Along with many of the original adopters, I still use this little cutting tool on a daily basis. It really has withstood the test of time.\nClear and Cloudy\nRainbow and Midnight\nThe shape and name of the Tidashi is derived from a traditional Japanese utility knife, called Kiridashi-Kogatana; a design recognized by its long handle and short cutting edge. In Japan this tool is still relied upon for making accurate cuts or markings on wood. \nEDC\nReiteration\nOver the years, Tidashi users have provided me with feedback. A slight size increase has often been suggested, and I am glad to say that that is exactly what the Tidashi 2.0 is offering, resulting in a more confident grip when using the tool. \nEvolution\nA redesigned and more substantial silicone sheath provides just the right amount of friction for securely holding and releasing the Tidashi. It also allows for the use of larger diameter paracord and keyrings, both of which are included. It is still made from the same long lasting silicone material which has held my personal original Tidashi for all these years.\nDimensions\nTrue to its origins, the Tidashi 2.0 is cut from grade 5 titanium, known for its toughness and corrosion resistance. It is often used in diving knives, as it is lighter than steel and able to resist even the harsh environment of salt water. The fact that this particular alloy lends itself to easy sharpening is something that I have found useful, but not essential to the Tidashi design. It is not a tool for slicing tomatoes. The blade length is simply too short for that. Its forte lies in puncturing and shallow cuts, as done when opening packages. And of course its biggest strength, as with any tool, is the fact that its size allows you to have it on you when you need it. \nAlways with you\nEmergence\nIn order to increase the manufacturing accuracy and consistency of this new iteration of the Tidashi, I have decided to have its basic shape cut by CNC. This will allow me to focus more on the final finish of the Tidashi, including a unique anodizing method for bringing out the amazing colors of the natural titanium oxide layer that covers any titanium object.\nColors...\nThe decision to relinquish absolute control over the original Tidashi design by walking away from my computer, is also what guided me in developing a new coloring method for the Tidashi 2.0. I tried to put emphasis on naturally occurring patterns. By subtly controlling the flow of acid and electricity along the surface of the Tidashi, I was able to bring out some unique shapes and colors reminiscent of the cloudy skies over my home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although the process is repeatable, no two knives with this pattern will be exactly the same, just like the skies.  I was also able to recreate the original color combinations such as Rainbow and Midnight for a total of ten unique versions for you to choose from. I am showing all ten variations here, but please scroll all the way down for some more info about the new storage pouch.\n1.Natural\n2.Clouds\n3.Midnight\n4.Acid\n5.Rainbow Black\n6.Rainbow White\n7.Sky\n8.Black Gold\n9.White Gold\n10.Purple Rain\nPackaging\nIn the past I have often spent a lot of time and energy on the packaging of my designs. And although a custom box for your Tidashi would be nice, I was recently confronted with the sheer amount of waste I was producing by doing this. In response I have decided to package the Tidashi 2.0 in a more permanent and reusable zippered Cordura pouch. It is lined in a soft plush material to protect your Tidashi not only during shipping, but also if you should choose to store it. The design in not finalized yet, but it will most likely be just like in the picture below.\nStorage pouch included\nExperience\nAfter having fulfilled several campaigns and having shipped thousands of rewards, I would consider myself a veteran Kickstarter creator. I very much consider the Kickstarter experience a shared one between myself and the backers, which is why I am always very open about the project in regular updates. I also try to answer any and all questions asked in messages and in the comment section. My backers and I have traveled this path from inception to completion several times, and we have seen the highs and lows along the route. The previous project has been especially hard, and it has shown me which pitfalls to avoid in future endeavors, including the project we are embarking on now. I hope you will join us, and make the Tidashi 2.0 project another successful one. \nCheers,\nSander", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf there is one thing I have learned from my previous project, it is how the complexity of a design can exponentially increase the risk of something going wrong during production. It is the main reason why I chose to keep this design as simple as the original design. It is also why I chose to keep the anodizing process in house. It is a process too delicate to hand off. \n\nThe process of manufacturing the basic shape of the Tidashi 2.0 is done by an overseas manufacturer I have worked with in the past. They have been reliable and based on the samples they provided (which are in the pictures you see here) I believe they will provide an excellent product. As the project is going live we are discussing some final details about the cutting process and final finish of the shape. I plan to perform a thorough quality control on the initial small production runs, before increasing the production volume. And if for whatever reason the manufacturer cannot continue production, I can always fall back on the equipment I acquired for making the original Tidashi, and move production in house. \n\nThe mold used for creating the silicone sheath has already been made and paid for, because I wanted to show you the result in the pictures. This means that production of the sheaths should not be the bottle neck in this project.\n\nThe pouch design is based on an existing design, and the manufacturer has indicated that it is comfortable making it. If problems should arise with the manufacturing, I would not have a problem reverting to the exact design that the manufacturer already makes on a regular basis (the only difference is a slightly different size). \n\nI will be shipping the Tidashis anywhere in the world from the US, and although the declared value of the average shipment will be below the duty threshold of most countries, there is a chance that you will have to pay some import duties, especially on larger shipments. If you have ever ordered anything from abroad, you are probably already aware of this, and know that I have no control over this, other than keeping the declared value to a minimum.\n \nAlthough the cutting edge of the Tidashi is very short, I want every backer to be aware that there is always the possibility that the laws of your country do not allow you to carry it in public. As far as I am aware, it has never happened in the past. \n\nIn summary, I believe that the biggest risk would be delay in the expected delivery date. The reason for this is that definitive information about production quantities will not be available until after the campaign closes. This is a problem that is almost inherent to the Kickstarter system, and we'll work with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 26 or more", "title": "One (1) Tidashi 2.0", "descp": "This amazing deal gets you one Tidashi 2.0 in NATURAL color.

The Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini grips and holds screws in place, making fastening much easier in all aspects. You don\u2019t even need a second hand involved.\nThere are five total Magnet Driver\u2122 Minis \u2014 in two different colors signifying different sizes \u2014 that work with our 1-\u215b\u201d precision bits or standard 1-\u00be\u201d precision bits.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Full Set reward comes with 20 extra-long S2 Steel bits in eight different types, and bits are color coded to match with the appropriate Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini size.\nThis magnetic mat keeps your metal objects perfectly organized. Place small pieces and screws directly on the mat for guaranteed safety and security. Not to mention, it details the Moon and the place and date of the first man landing on the moon.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Carrying Case keeps everything safe and secure for easy portability.\n                       Michael Perez, the inventor of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, has had a lifelong overarching passion for technology and has always been fond of the milestones it has reached over time. Coupled with his passion for technology, developing a precision screwdriver in honor of Apollo 11 was always a lifelong goal he strived to achieve. He spent a lot of time seeking a way to combine his passions into one product. From this, he developed the idea of the Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, which perfectly merges a toolkit with space rocket and moon accents. The rest was history. For him, everything has to be related to this commemoration, as it is crucial to humanity. For this campaign, we\u2019d like to give special thanks to our friend, Rafael M\u00e9ndez Pe\u00f1a, who not only collaborated with NASA to produce documentaries and outreach videos, but also helped us with our video. He really knows how to rock it!\n  We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or purchase a Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, if you\u2019re a supporter of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

We listened to your feedback from the original Braza Bro Kickstarter and incorporated the improvements into this blade. Technically this is a Wharncliffe style blade, but it reminds us of a mini pocket cleaver.\nStart your morning off right!\nWe didn\u2019t set out to make the best mini pocket/keychain knife ever, it just happened. Mike at Bastion has been designing and making EDC blades and tools for a while, and he really knows what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s why when I was dissatisfied with all other mini knives, he was the first person I turned to when looking to develop the perfect mini folding EDC knife... the Braza Bro. \nMike on the right with the original Braza EDC knive, and Daniel on left with Braza Bro EDC mini knife launched on Kickstarter earlier this year. I swear that we are holding them the same distance from the camera, the size difference creates an optical illusion.\nBraza Bro was a hit on Kickstarter earlier this year! Read more about the Braza Bro story here.\nNow the duo have returned with an all new iteration of the Braza Bro. You may recognize the comfortable handle design, but that's where the similarities end. The blade is a completely new design, available in two different steels, stainless or titanium handle options, and other features that were highly requested by our backers.\nStylish & Versatile Wharncliffe Blade\nLooking like the mad child of a bone busting clever and a hair popping razor blade, the  Wharncliffe style blade offers good looks with mad functionality. It's almost straight edge makes it good for carving and slicing. The pointed tip is like having a pocket exacto.\nErgonomic Handle Grip\nThe handle provides an excellent grip fitting in your first 3 fingers. The shape and contour of the handle will ensure that your hand won\u2019t slip.\nThere\u2019s a choil for the index finger, and a slight recess on the spine of the handle for the thumb to sit on. The blade spine is jimped to provide a non-slip grip for your finger. When in use, the Braza Bro feels much larger than it appears.\nNot only is it extremely comfortable to hold and use, it\u2019s also a beautiful knife to behold.\nComfortable to use.\nNEW!!! Multiple Blade Metal Options\n S35VN Stainless Steel is the newest, coolest, most high tech, and toughest stainless steel alloy available. It's what everyone dreams of in an EDC pocket blade these days. It's harder than squirrel tits and keeps an edge better than a line of coke. No, but for real though, this is some tough shit. Made in the USA by Crucible, it starts off as a metal powder which allows better control over composition than the traditional mixing of molten metals. It's then sintered to bond the powders together into solid stainless steel.\n D2 Tool Steel is used in popular high-quality EDC tools. D2 is a high carbon and high chromium air hardening steel. Yes, that means it's harder than frozen t-rex shit, which then fossilized and froze again. The benefits that are offered from D2 steel are excellent wear and abrasion resistance which is provided from its large volumes of carbides in the microstructure. D2 is used in long production cold work applications requiring very high wear resistance and a high compression strength. D2 is harder than S35VN, but is susceptible to surface corrosion.\nWhich Steel Do I Want?\nIf you want a no maintenance blade that will never rust, then choose S35VN.\nIf you want the hardest and sharpest longester (yes, that's a new scrabble word, try it), then choose D2 steel. If you're afraid of a blade that may get a little bit of rust and forms a patina over time, then don't choose D2 steel. D2 is not for cry babies or those with weak hearts. It will cut you, and it will rust a little. The upside is that you'll never have to sharpen it. Ok, you will have to sharpen it if you cut rocks and fossilized shit with it, but you won't have to sharpen it as often as S35VN.\nNEW!!! Titanium Handle Option\nAn ultralight titanium handle is paired with the S35VN blade. The weight difference is surprising when you hold it in your hand compared with the stainless handle.\nNEW!!! Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nDeep carry pocket clip was a highly requested feature change from the OG Braza Bro. Whether it makes you feel more discreet, or it gives you some good vibes that its more securely clipped onto your pocket, the deep carry clip looks bad ass, and is a feature rarely seen in knives this small.\nNEW!!! Reversible Pocket Clip\nLefty's rejoice! The Braza Bro Cleaver now features a reversible pocket clip. The pocket clip can be put on the left or right handle scale, whatever you like best. There's even a tiny insert with torx screw that covers the hole on the unused side.\nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\n Cutting Edge Length: 2.12\u201d (53.9mm)  \n Closed Length: 2.75\u201d (70mm)  \n Open Length: 4.77\" (121.3mm)  \n Total Weight: 1.34oz and 1.48 oz  \n Handle Material: Titanium or Stainless Steel  \n Cutting Steel: S35VN or D2 Tool Steel - heat treated for optimal edge hardness, strength and durability, stonewashed finish before grinding  \n Spine Jimping: Spine is jimped for non-slip finger hold  \n Bearing: Ceramic Ball Bearing - buttery smooth opening with no play.\n Hardware: Torx Stainless steel  \n Frame-lock: Adds security and strength  \n Pocket Clip: Stainless Steel and removable if not needed.\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole\n Manual and Safe Operation: No spring, no assist, not automatic.  \nSpine Jimping\nJimping refers to the series of notches on the spine of the blade near the handle. These notches provide increased grip for your finger to improve safety and cutting precision. \nFlipper \nThe flipper allows for lightning quick, 1 handed deployment. A ball detent holds the blade securely closed, but a quick flick of your finger sends it flying out. Once open, the flipper acts as a finger guard.\nThe flipper is completely manual in operation. There is no spring and no assist, so the Braza Bro is not automatic. It follows the same manual opening and closing principals as a regular folding, locking knife. \nCeramic Ball Bearings\nCeramic Ball Bearings make the opening action super smooth and have zero play so the blade won\u2019t wobble when cutting. These bearings are more expensive than the commonly used phosphor bronze bushings, but they are totally worth it. You'll be blown away every time you experience how fast the Braza Bro blade flips out, and then feels as solid as a non-folding, fixed blade knife when cutting.  \nLook at those tiny ball bearings!\nLook Ma, No Play!\nCeramic Balls are suitable for applications where high loads, high speeds and extreme temperatures are factors. Long life and the need for minimal lubrication make this material appropriate for extreme applications. Ceramic is non-porous, non-magnetic, noncorrosive and lighter than steel. In ball form, ceramic balls are also harder than steel and because ceramic balls are non-porous they are virtually frictionless and capable of spinning faster than steel balls. \nUltra-Strong Frame Lock\nThe frame lock is an integral part of this the Braza Bro EDC knife. The lock is CNC machined from the frame. It\u2019s secure and easy to release using only one hand.\nOne-Handed Opening and Closing\nThe flipper and ceramic ball bearings allow for lightning fast, one-handed opening. The frame lock makes it easy to close one-handed also. The flipper serves double duty and protects your finger when closing.\nManual and Safe Operation\nThe opening and closing of the Braza Bro Cleaver are completely manual in operation. There is NO spring and NO assist, so it is NOT automatic. It is the same as a regular folding, locking pocket knife. It will only open with as much force as you can put on the flipper with your finger, so there's no danger of it swinging out unexpectedly. \nThe cutting edge length is 2.12\u201d (53.9mm), much smaller than normal blade length restrictions (the carry restrictions are usually about 2.5\" max length).\nA ball detent keeps it closed. Since there is NO spring, the cutting edge can't accidentally spring open in your pocket or on your keychain. \nIt is up to you to check that local laws allow you to own or carry this tool.\nStainless Torx\u00ae Fasteners  \nTorx\u00ae screws and fasteners are recognized by the six-point star design on the head. Created in 1967 these exceptionally secure high-quality fasteners can be found on a wide range of motorcycles, automobiles, and computer systems. Torx\u00ae products are known for their ability to prevent screw damage\u2014and enable someone to produce a high amount of torque without causing harm to the product.\nErgonomic Contoured Grip  \nSmall knives can be hard to hold onto, but this is not the case with Braza Bro. The contoured handle provides an excellent grip and fits perfectly in your first 3 fingers when holding it. The flipper acts as a finger guard, preventing your hand from sliding forward onto the cutting edge.\nReversible Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nThe pocket clip is an essential feature that is often left out of mini pocket knives. Braza Bro allows you to choose between pocket clip, keychain, or lanyard carry. The pocket clip is made of stainless steel and coated the same color as the handle. The pocket clip is very secure. If the pocket clip is not needed, it is removable by using a Torx driver to remove the screw. \nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole  \nThe Braza Bro is the perfect EDC tool to keep on your keychain. The keychain and lanyard hole is more than a drilled hole afterthought as seen on other mini keychain knives. It is purposefully designed into the shape of the handle.\nOpen a can of whoopass!\nWho cut the cheese? Again?\nPop a Cap!\nScrew it!\nSlice it!\nWhat's inside the box?!?\nBraza Bro Cleaver is the non-identical twin of the Braza Bro. It shares some of the same EDC genetics as the Braza Bro, but comes with a different blade style and many improvements.\nThe process of creating the Braza Bro was more than just shrinking the original Braza. We had to go back to CAD and layout the new smaller design. Everything was miniaturized, from the tiny ceramic ball bearings that make it open so smooth and keep it wiggle free, to the smaller pins, screws and pocket clip. \nWe took all the backer input from the first Braza Bro and added a new blade style to create the Braza Bro Cleaver\nYou will be able to select the blacked out option when you fill out the shipping survey through BackerKit after the Kickstarter ends.\nShare the Braza Bro Cleaver and Earn Cash!\nWe're looking for assistance to spread the word about this campaign!

No one knows the exact nature of those who built the Dome, but the founders of this advanced civilization have come to be called the Forefathers.\nClick to download ultra hi-res\nYou will discover miraculous technologies and weird artifacts in the labyrinths of the Dome, but that is not all the Forefathers left behind. Watch out for automated security systems, traps, and inexplicable anomalies.\nIn addition, the Dome itself is showing signs of consciousness. It has been reacting to the human presence since the first explorers entered its domain. Once inside, no one is able to leave. Uncovering the wonders and dangers of the Dome is a one-way road.\nExploration and exploitation of the Dome is carried out by the CRONUS Foundation, a massive organization founded by the world\u2019s most powerful governments.\nNarrative\nLearn more about the narrative of Encased - in KS-update #14\nWhat the press says\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want Encased to be just the way you see the perfect CRPG: a huge game, rich in content, sort of \u201cthe Fallout of our dreams\u201d, which all of us could be proud of. \nWe are developing the game for a while already. We have reached pre-alpha and we are confident that Encased could become a great game. But we are a small team, and there is a lot of things that we\u2019d like to add. With your help, Encased could become a way more ambitious, better fleshed out and polished project!\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money that could help us expand the game! One of our ground rules is to create games arm-in-arm with our community.\nA little bit about where the money will go\nKickstarter and taxes will take away about 10% of the funds. Part of what\u2019s left will be spent on actual implementation and shipping of all the wonderful rewards we\u2019ve come up with. All the rest we will spend on polishing, expanding, and improving the game. That includes a possibly bigger team - one more artist and several designers and scripters - which will spruce up the graphics and increase the number and quality of fights and story interactions. Also, the money will go towards voicework and localization which will make the game more fun and accessible for everyone.\nSocial Goals\nLearn more about social goals in KS-Update #11!\nFacebook likes: Like the Encased Facebook page and encourage your friends to do the same!\nFacebook shares: share the Encased announcement post on Facebook.\nTwitter followers: follow @darkcrystal_hq on Twitter and encourage your friends to too.\nTwitter retweets: retweet the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nTwitter likes: Like the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nDiscord fans: join our Discord group.\nThe Story\nAs a new recruit, the player must choose one of five Wings:\nBlack Wing - military and security forces;\nWhite Wing - scientists, medics and researchers;\nBlue Wing - engineers and technicians;\nSilver Wing - upper management;\nOrange Wing - ex-convicts who have exchanged their prison jumpsuits for the uniform of a CRONUS laborer.\nThough your selected Wing grants certain starting bonuses and opens interesting options, your choice does not lock you into a \u201cclass\u201d. You are free to develop your character, distribute skill points, and choose abilities as you wish.\nUpon completing character creation, you are summoned to Crystal Sands, a city built directly outside the Dome as a staging point for personnel and equipment.\nThe transition station mounted at the apex of the Dome, above the only aperture, is called the Spire. After basic training, you will descend from the Spire into the Dome to land at Magellan HQ. \nThere is much to uncover during your first mission underground\u2026. Relying on your stats and Wing training, you will find there are several ways to resolve each challenge. Replayability is one of our main goals for the game. After your briefing at HQ comes your first task: exploring a newly discovered Forefathers compound tagged Object O-12-Nashville.\nAfter a few adventures inside the Nashville object (which we don\u2019t want to spoil just yet), your group encounters an entirely new anomaly. You awaken something dreaming deep beneath the desert of the Dome. Your trespass has activated Maelstrom, a telepathic entity created to serve the Forefathers. \nAll connection with the world outside the Dome is lost and Maelstrom rages across the desert, infecting the minds of everyone it encounters. You and your group fall into a technology-induced stasis for five long years. And when you come to, the entire world has changed. \nEncased combat is inspired by classic, tactical turn-based systems, with a grid overlay, action points, cover system, special abilities, various ammo and damage types, many different resistances, and more!\nThe player has direct control over his character only. You will manage the behavior and tactics of their your henchmen but their specific actions will be guided by the game\u2019s combat AI system, introducing funny and interesting situations into your battles.\nThere are dozens of weapons to be found, many of which can be stripped and upgraded. \nThe world of the Dome has from its discovery been a place full of weird creatures and dangerous traps. There\u2019s no telling what lies around the next bend in the road, or inside the twilit cave, or beneath the murky waters of the swamp. But who knows? Perhaps humans are the biggest threat in this bizarre land.\nMaelstrom dominates everything. It's telepathic rage sowing chaos in the minds of everyone, trapped under the Dome. But the player, having \"freed\" the entity, enjoys a special relationship with it. The two of you have regular interactions and Maelstrom may even grant \"whishes\" to the player... but be warned: every call for assistance will eventually incur a price. \nMaelstrom's power grows stronger the closer you move to the heart of the Dome, and that's exactly where you must go to find the answers. There is a special stat influencing interactions with Maelstrom: Psyche. Resistance to Maelstrom's negative effect can be developed in several ways, and develop it you must before you may venture deeper into the Dome. There is also a special skill branch related to Psychic abilities.\nWe will talk about Maelstrom and gameplay related to it in the future updates.\nFollowing the devastating events of Maelstrom\u2019s release, CRONUS splintered into multiple other, often warring, factions. The world has changed while you were in stasis, but has the nature of Man? Trapped inside the Dome like spiders in a jar, these factions will show the worst and best of humankind. Will you join them, or strike out on your own?\nLearn more about factions in our Kickstarter Update #2\nIf the player chooses to commit crimes against the society, he will incur penalties to his reputation and earn titles ranging from 'Petty Thief' to 'Enemy of the State' or even 'Threat to Humanity'. Crime begets punishment. The player may be fined, imprisoned, and even executed. Luckily, there are several ways to deal with your arrest: bribe judges, organize a jailbreak or return alive from the Labyrinth of Death (this last one may be particularly challenging).\nEncased features a day and night cycle with accompanying lighting effects. It would be wise to study NPC routines while adventuring.\nThe Dome is huge and for the most part is an open sandbox (if you are able to resist the psychic presence of Maelstrom). The map consists of more than 170 sectors, each crafted by hand. There are abandoned bunkers, black caves, the complexes of the Forefathers, as well as wastes, swamps and other biomes.\nRandom encounters have been a standby of the old-school role playing game since the dawn of the genre. But Encased will bring them to a new level. Each encounter is a separate post-apocalyptic story, not just a bunch of critters attacking you. Want to participate in a game of Russian Roulette? Find a pathway through a deadly anomaly to find a rare relic? Defend an automated rail transport from raiders? Or end up a victim yourself. All this awaits you, in addition to more classic encounters.\nRead more about Random Encounters in our Update #5\nGuest Stars and Experts!\n  Platforms and dates\nEncased is being developed for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Early Access for the Windows version will likely begin in the first quarter of 2019, exclusively on Steam. The final version will launch during 2019 on Steam, GOG and other services. The console edition is planned for the winter of 2020.\nDigital Rewards explained\nCRONUS employee ID badge\n\nAn employee using your name set out on an expedition in the desert\u2026 and vanished. Nothing was found but their badges. The mystery must be solved before it happens again. Will you accept the quest?\n\nMap\n\nA detailed map of the known world under the Dome, showing all the cities and settlements of the Foundation, along with the entries to the \u2018objects\u2019, explored and unexplored. Restricted to higher ranks amongst certain Wings, the map also indicates some locations that the Foundation would prefer to keep secret. A gift for those with the time and inclination to explore 30,000 square kilometers of desert.\n\nLorebook\n\nA digital version of the lorebook, containing all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within. The story of its discovery, an atlas of its most interesting sites, and an insight into the CRONUS Foundation \u2014 including never-before-told stories of some of its more secret projects \u2014 this is the only book a dedicated digital Domehead will ever need.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe hum of a machine of unknown origin, deep beneath the shifting, singing sands. Undeciphered signals from the Tower, snatches of CB radio and a quiet guitar arpeggio in a sleepy roadside bar. In the hands and mind of the Mushroomer \u2014 composer for Pathologic 2 \u2014 the desert becomes music.\n\nA short story about the Dome\n\nCharlene Putney, writer on the renowned Divinity: Original Sin 2, spins a tale of the events that followed the discovery of the Dome.\n\nPortraits\n\nAn extended set of hand-drawn in-game avatars, exclusive to campaign backers.\n\nClosed alpha and beta access\n\nHelp test the alpha or beta versions of the game testing.

In random encounters, the game picks a random name from a database. Your nickname \u2014 on our approval \u2014 will be one of them.\n\nBaseball card\n  Pretty much everyone supports the Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise - at least until they lose - and the players\u2019 baseball cards are collected and traded across the Foundation. Recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent and application, under-performing gets you cut from the roster - and getting cut sees you sent into the Dome.\n\nLife Pass\n\nFree lifetime access to all projects released by Dark Crystal Games.\n\nDesign a non-generic NPC\n\nWork with the devs to build a character - come up with their name, appearance, and role in the story.\n\nPlayer portrait\n\nYour face here. We will add a character avatar drawn from your photo to the game, and also give you a digital copy of the image.\n\n\nAn episode of the story-based mini-game, dedicated to you\n\nGames are popular under the Dome too. Some of the miraculously preserved terminals house a popular text game, the hero of which bears your name. Coincidence?\n\nDevelopers stream\n\nWe\u2019ll join you on a livestream of the game, for your audience or ours.\n\nA cool in-game item, exclusive to and chosen by the backers\nA rare gun? Custom armor? An unusual combat stim? You, the backers, will decide. But remember, it won\u2019t break the game\u2019s balance. We\u2019re not that generous.\n\nPhysical Rewards explained\nBlue Wing Engineer t-shirt\nIn vivid antifreeze blue, this fine t-shirt is the favorite of CRONUS technical staff, from the lowliest technician to the chief engineer. While not standard issue, most Blue Wing employees have one. And now so will you.\nRogues baseball cap\nThe Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise is largely recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent, aggression, and a desire to avoid entering the Dome. Last year\u2019s was a winning season, and none of the players lost their places. But luck shifts like the sands, and this year may be different. And you, the fans, can be less than forgiving.\n Explorer hoodie\nThe desert is cold at night, so each CRONUS employee who must venture outside is issued with a sweatshirt. Soft and comfortable, it offers excellent protection against the cold, so at least you won\u2019t freeze to death while you die of radiation poisoning.\nCRONUS Badge\nPrinted Lorebook\nThis 70-page glossy volume contains all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within.

However, despite our experience and best efforts, there\u2019s always a chance that something will go wrong. \n\n1. Early access and release dates. All of the people on our team have already delivered commercially successful games on time and in great condition. However, no true professional will ever tell you, that he is fail-proof. There is always a chance Encased RPG will require to postpone it's set final release date. At least to get an extra coat of polish.\n\n2. We might have delays in delivering our reward promises. The reward delivery channels are extremely reliable, but, there's always a possibility that the reward delivery could be delayed due to technical issues.\n\n3. We are used to dealing with budgets large and small. Financially speaking, Encased RPG budget has been calculated precisely. We are also financing most of the game ourselves, calling community only to finance additional features.

Never leave your tripod behind again.\nA quick and simple setup will empower you to take full advantage of every photo opportunity....4 seconds and you\u2019re ready to go.\nWe got tired of carrying around heavy, bulky tripods that we never ended up using. Lumapod is specifically designed to be brought on all your adventures.\n Instantly capture and share your experiences in the moment.\nOf course a fast setup and ultra-compact design are great, but what good is a tripod if it isn\u2019t stable? We carefully selected premium materials like high-grade aluminum and kevlar ropes to ensure reliable stability.\nUse it with your Smartphone, GoPro, Mirrorless, DSLR Camera and more...\nEasily use it to snap a selfie and then quickly set it down to capture a self-portrait. Either way you can always be in the shot.\nWhen you\u2019re not in the photo, use it as a monopod to shoot lively Hyperlapses\nThere is more that separates Go85 and Go120 than just their heights (85cm & 120cm). We carefully optimized both models for specific demands.\nLumapod Go85 \nWe relentlessly designed Go85 to be as compact and lightweight as humanly possible without compromising on quality or performance. The result is a perfect travel buddy for your smartphone, GoPro and cameras that weigh up to 1kg / 2.2lbs.\nUnlike Go120, it does not have interchangeable legs. However, it is equipped with integrated terrain levelers to accommodate for those situations with uneven ground.\n Lumapod Go120\nGo120 has all the benefits of Go85 but with an overall larger height and build that will support cameras that weigh up to 2kg /4.4lbs.\nIn addition, Go120 has modular leg extensions which creates a wide-range of possibilities for adaptability. It currently comes standard with terrain leveling extensions.\nEasily turn your Go120 into a slider with the add-on dolly wheel extensions.\nOr utilize the stake extensions for soft grounds, sand and snow.\n                                             Breakdown - Choose Lumapod if you\u2019re looking for better speed, compactness, weight and the adaptability of different leg extensions. Choose a standard tripod if you need extra stability and additional terrain flexibility.\nLumapod is compact with more height, better stability and offers the benefit of having both tripod and selfie mode.\nLumapod offers the same selfie capability but with all the benefits of a stable tripod as well.\nHave you ever wondered why all tripods look the same? Is there really only one design that works? We challenged this theory and worked tirelessly to design Lumapod different.\nThere is a simple mechanical principle behind our design: replace compression parts (traditional legs) with tensioning components (Kevlar Ropes). Perhaps it\u2019s easier to understand when compared to something everyone knows:\nMuch like how the mast on a sailboat withstands wind with its tensioned ropes, we use the same theory to achieve stability. It\u2019s no rocket science but the key to our design is being able to lock and tension Lumapod in any position.\nLumapod\u2019s stability isn\u2019t just by luck. We did extensive research and testing to measure the vibrations and damping of many tripods. Our electro-mechanical test setup enabled us to optimize Lumapod and ensure it is as stable as possible.\n                                             Showing the bigger steps of lumapods development\nHey!

I'm back on Kickstarter now for my 6th international cookbook project. In 2012, I launched my first project with Kickstarter: The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures, followed by the German edition (Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden) in 2013. The series continued with English and German publications of: The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO (2014), SRI LANKA (2015), MALAYSIA (2016), and INDIA (2017).\nThis year I traveled to Ethiopia in the weeks before Easter \u2013 one of several special times of fasting, when the majority of the country eats entirely vegan! I explored the central cities, traveled overland to the north, went trekking in the highlands and stayed with families in remote villages. \nAs with all my travels and culinary research, I am extremely grateful for the privilege to learn, share & exchange, and be guided & supported by many families and professional cooks who invited me in their kitchens and shared amazing meals with me.\nSince returning to Berlin, I've been cooking Ethiopian and Eritrean food practically non-stop, recreating recipes and dishes, constantly inviting friends and guests to my cooking studio for lunch and dinner parties.\nAbebech showing me traditional village cooking in the Ethiopian Highlands.\nMaking injera with the family in Gonder, Ethiopia\nThe Lotus and the Artichoke - ETHIOPIA is my newest cookbook with original recipes, artwork, photography and stories inspired by these latest culinary adventures. It includes over 70 recipes based on the mouth-watering meals in bustling cities & towns, at road-stop eateries, and in rural highland villages.\nAs with my previous 5 cookbooks, I have written, illustrated, cooked, photographed, and designed this book myself.

Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarter backers, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nKickstarter LIVE cooking show. 2016.\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation.\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke \u2013 Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO which was published in English & German in 2014.\nThe following winter we spent 10 weeks exploring Sri Lanka. The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA was published in 2015, following a sucessful third Kickstarter project with over 737 backers from more than 30 countries worldwide.\nI traveled around Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo for 5 weeks in early 2016 learning to cook traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes from the locals. The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA was published that year, after another successful Kickstarter with support from all over the world.\nIn Autumn 2016 and Spring 2017 I went for my 7th and 8th trip to India to for six weeks of research and cooking on location in Kashmir, Ladakh, and the Northeast States. The Lotus and the Artichoke - INDIA was my most successful Kickstarter project, with support from 1,165 backers in over 40 countries.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations & shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nLagos, Nigeria (World Veg Fest 2014)\nPRAISE for The Lotus and the Artichoke\n\"The Lotus and the Artichoke spiegelt Justins Erlebnisse und seine Liebe zum Reisen und Kochen so nahbar und umfassend wider, dass man so manches Mal meint, selbst dabei gewesen zu sein!\" \u2013 Nicole Just, Bestsellerautorin von La Veganista\n\u201cThe Lotus and the Artichoke shares Justin\u2019s love for cooking and world travel with such intensity and passion that you really feel like you were there!\u201d \u2013 Nicole Just, bestselling author of La Veganista\n\"Unser allerliebster verr\u00fcckter Weltreisender ist wieder da!\" \u2013 Nadine Horn & J\u00f6rg Mayer, Bestseller-Autoren von eat this!

"project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi there, adventurer! Looking for more dice in some unique designs and colors? You're in a good place!\nSome of you may already know that Q WORKSHOP is the manufacturer of some pretty unique RPG dice. We've been around for 14 years now, and we've produced so many dice sets that we've lost count already ;)\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve also created some dice designs that we loved but didn\u2019t make for various reasons: too many already scheduled releases, license ideas that just didn\u2019t work out, and so on. It hurt us deeply to have them hidden - and now we can finally give them a chance!\nWe're starting with 5 designs in one color version each. More to come!\nNo, these are not black blank dice ;) We will ask you to choose the design and color of the dice sets after the campaign ends - in our Pledge Manager. You've got time until then to decide!\nThe mat's format is B3 (353mm x 500mm, or 13.9in x 19.7in), and it's got Emil's awesome artwork on one side and a solid rubber on the other.\nAnd yes, you can also follow him on Instagram :)\nAlso, he's the guy who invented the famous April Fool's prank with the Furry dice.\nHere are some pictures of the real dice!\nThe Arcade dice feel the game! This is a real pic, not a render :)\nArcade Dice - real pic detail\nThe Bloodsucker dice all ready! Real pic, not a render\nBloodsucker dice - real pic detail\nAre you joining the fight? The Dragon Slayer dice are waiting!\nDragon Slayer - real pic detail\nHalloween dice - detail\nHalloween is comiiing! Real pic, not a render\nWizard Dice - charming already!\nWizard Dice - real pic detail\nChoose the Pledge Level - at this point, you only choose the quantity of the sets that you wish to order. They all have the same price. You'll choose the designs and colors in the Pledge Manager AFTER the campaign. You can pay the exact amount needed, or add an extra for some add-ons. You can also increase your pledge in any moment of the campaign.\nYou can get one additional die at no extra cost, if you subscribe to our newsletter here.\nIf you want to get some add-ons, you can change your pledge during the campaign - either by jumping to a different pledge level, or increasing the pledged amount.\nYour credit card will be charged after the campaign ends. Kickstarter then has up to 14 days to collect the payments, and after that it transfers the money to us so that we can start the production.\nWell, we've had some experience with it, and it is really a great place to be 100% sure that our product meets the customers' requirements. In this project, we just give you the options - and you tell us what you want. Isn't that the perfect solution?\nAlso, we just love the community feeling that arises around the campaign. There's some magic in it!\nOur dice are made of polymer: injection-molded and then painted. Each die is then polished and undergoes a thorough quality control.\nThe design is engraved in the dice, not just painted on the surface :)\nSo, you've found the most interactive section in this campaign! As the funding goal is not so high, we wanted to spice things up a bit and to offer you some opportunities to have fun.\nSo here they are - our Community Goals!\nYou'll find all the links in the buttons below!\nHow does it work?\nOnce a Community Goal is reached, the dice set with a specific design gets the matching dice bag. It's that simple.\nA maximum of 1 bag of each design will be added for free to each backer order.\nYou don't need to pay any extra cash or advise us in any way, we'll add the bags automatically to your order. If we manage to reach the goals only partially, (for example, we unlock 3 out of 5), only these sets will get their bags.\nSo, for example, if you order 3 sets (and let's assume that all bags are unlocked during the campaign), here's what happens:\n- if you choose to have 1 x Bloodsucker dice set, 1 x Wizard and 1 x Halloween Pumpkin, you'll get a matching bag for each one of those.\n- if you choose to have 3 x Bloodsucker dice sets, we'll only add 1 Bloodsucker bag to your order. You can also purchase the bag as a regular add-on, of course.\nThe unlocked bags will also appear as add-ons, so if you like them a lot, you can get more!\nYou'll find the link to the newsletter here.\nAlready subscribed to out newsletter? That's cool. We will compare the two databases after the campaign ends and if your e-mail is there, we will add the bonus D20 to your pledge.\n You can find them here :)\nAugust-September 2018 - campaign\nSecond half of September 2018 - campaign wrap-up: collecting pledges and importing the data to the Pledge Manager\nOctober 2018: filling out the info in the Pledge Manager\nNovember 2018 - January 2019: production\nFebruary 2019: fulfillment!\nFor our US backers: In the Pledge Manager you'll be able to choose between the more economical USPS shipping or more secure Fedex. Both shipping methods will have tracking available.\nThe shipping rates might go up depending on the final weight of the pledge and/or the add-ons that you add to your pledge.\nPlease bear in mind that these shipping rates are orientative only. The exact shipping rate will be charged in the Pledge manager after the campaign.\nAs with the previous campaign, we will organize the shipping for all US pledges from a US warehouse. The goal is to spare our backers the unnecessary customs fees. Once we know the exact quantity and weight of the packages, we will crunch the possibilities and decide on a one that is both reliable and fast.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've created and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects so far - the first one was fulfilled within a year, and the second one in seven months.

We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   \nIt's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. \nThis material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  \nUsing a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.\nHave a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  \nThe tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  \nAt Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  \nThe earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.\nIn 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  \nWhen we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.\n   Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.\nAdd it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  \nNeed less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  \nNever lose your pen again.   \n      They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  \n     We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.\nIn order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  \n   SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nMEDIA KIT HERE\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Single Pack", "descp": "Single Pack = 3 NanoPens.

This project was created as my own personal reminder, and to \"hang\" on to the memories that pushes us forward.   \n\" To all you fathers and fathers-to-be, and to all of you, who dedicate themselves to the coming generations.  This project is dedicated to you!\" \nHi Everyone!  In the blink of an eye, over 2 year's have gone by, and I find myself back here on Kickstarter once more. With this new project, I decided to go with something simple.  Titanium and EDCs are still my obsessions, so that's where the focus will be. I hope the design of the HANDGREY\u2122 KIN will strike a chord with you all.\nDESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nThe HANDGREY\u2122 KIN is my take on the simple key hook EDC, for your pocket, belts, belt loop, purse, messenger bag, or pretty much anything you want to hook your keys on to.\nI still rely on the bauhaus philosophy as my inspiration.  From then on, I let the lines and functions evolves.  The \"feel\" of the materials and the functions it serves, guides me toward the final outcome.  In this case, it  took on the design cues and curves, that harken back to the industrial era & machinery of the 1960s. \nWith a number of variations & iterations on the drawing board, I narrowed the final design to 2 different versions / models:  KIN {No.6}, and KIN {No.9}  \nThere are no functional differences between the 2, only aesthetics.  I like how the 2 models feel in my hands.  No.6 felt more modern, and streamlined, while No.9 felt more mechanical and succinct.  \nThis new series will retain my signature unibody design, with precision details. Each piece is individually cut via EDM WIRE-CUTTING technology, solely from Grade 5 / Ti-6Al-4V Titanium. This the most detailed and precise production method available.  It is very expensive, and usually reserved for prototypes and precision tooling only.  You can't get much better than this when it comes to cutting. \n FEATURES\nSimple hook with semi flexible spring clip\nExtra large inner clearance for hooking on thicker objects\nUnique micro-grip design to create a subtle grip.\nPremium Grade 5 / Ti6AL4V titanium \nSLOW EDM wire-cutting for the finest precision details\nCombination of Machine & Hand finishing, for best appearance\nHandgrey KIN + the ORBITKEY {canvas}\n        I will also be offering the pledges with the option of adding my Handgrey KNOX custom Titanium Key Ring.  This will be available to backers after the project ends.  \nHandgrey KNOX\nFINISHING\nI will be making the KIN in 2 finishes:\nSheen - Stone Tumbled Finish \nBright - Hand Brushed Finish\nStone tumbling comes in many different interpretation.  It sounds very simple, but quality finishes are very hard to nail down, and the machinery needed are very expensive.  It takes a lot of time to do quality work.  I strive to find the perfect balance that gives good results, with a faster production time. \nI prefer the natural color of Titanium above all else, simply because it's everlasting. It's the way nature made it. Anodization, and PVD / DLC coating are nice, but not very durable, no matter what the marketing says. I've worn through them all.   In the future, if I manage to find a better long lasting coating, or finishing process, I will offer a larger variation of final finishing for my design.  \nDedication ~ Fathers & Kings ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been around Kickstarters for nearly half a decade with numerous project. You don't last this long by not delivering. The 10,000+ backers from my previous projects will attest to this.\n\nThe only risk I can foresee realistically, is TIME. There are factors that are beyond my control, such as delivery time for raw materials or turn around from our EDM manufacturers. Things happen, machines break, shipments get lost, etc., but we have enough experience to minimize and mitigate these factors to ensure that the project is not significantly affected. I will also get started much earlier than I did on the last project just to be on the safe side.\n\nI will be working with the same EDM and machining specialist in Thailand that I have worked with the last 4 years. These GURUs know how I work, what I need from them, and that I mean what I say. So I will continue to have them do what they do best: Exceptional Quality Work!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "In the Loop", "descp": "Just want to be in the loop, and keep up with the project !", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "Minos - Personalized / Stone Tumbled", "descp": "1 X Personalized MINOS - micro ID key tag for your EDC set up.

Transform regular mouth mason jars into a comfortable pouring pitcher without the mess!  Pour hot liquids safely!  Lift large jars easily!\nFirst invented and patented in 1858, the Mason jar is named after its inventor, John Landis Mason.  Originally used in home canning and preserving, the Mason jar has become ubiquitous due to its usefulness. The jar is used for drinking, storage, canning or crafts.  The one thing that sets the Mason jar apart is its standard mouth size.  The regular mouth Mason jar is 2.75 inches (6.985 centimeters) across the top.  The Ergo Spout will fit regular mouth Mason jars, from 12 ounces to half gallon volumes.\nThe Ergo Spout fits Mason jars whether they were recently manufactured or are of vintage age. This is only for regular mouth Mason jars. \nThe Ergo Spout with different sizes of jars.\nThe Ergo Spout has three physical parts:  \nThe lid is completely removable. It connects inside the spout, creating a hinge for flip-top functionality.\nThe main spout has a curved lip to reduce dripping and connects to a handle that is comfortable and non-slip.  \nA gasket is underneath where the jar comes into contact with the spout.  This provides a complete seal, so there is no leaking between the base of the spout and the top of the mason jar.  \nThe Ergo Spout could become your favorite kitchen tool because of its versatility.  Use it with pint jars to drizzle homemade salad dressings or breakfast syrups.  Add the Ergo Spout to a quart for easy pouring of juice or serving gravy to your crowd.  Attach one to your vintage half gallon jar to brew your sun tea or lemonade.\nThe Ergo Spout will be made of food-safe polypropylene, which is BPA and phthalates free.  The material provides the strength to lift heavy jars.  It will not warp in the high temperatures of the dishwasher and microwave.\nThe Ergo Spout solves three basic problems with Mason jars.  \nFirst, because Mason jars are glass, they become slippery when wet.  With the Ergo Spout you can avoid those slippery jars and pour without the risk of dropping it.  \nThe Ergo Spout also allows the possibility of pouring hot liquids such as syrup.  Because your hand need not come in contact with the jar, you can safely pour that hot syrup on your pancakes.  \nLast, the Ergo Spout prevents sticky drips down the side of the jar by guiding the liquid to the curved spout.  \nThe Ergo Spout makes for comfortable, safe pouring without the mess.\nWe have been showing off the Ergo Spout and its development on social media. We are so happy with the love the Ergo Spout has been getting.  Back us today to get your very own Ergo Spout for your kitchen.\nThe Ergo Spout will come in your choice of three colors: Vintage Blue, Classic White or Barn Red.\n                SHIPPING INFORMATION:\nFor those who live in the United States, shipping will be added to your pledge and charged upon successful completion of the campaign.\nInternational folks!  As of the launch date we have determined that we will be able to ship to the following other countries at the estimated shipping prices.  Shipping will not be charged as part of your pledge to Kickstarter, but instead will be charged after the campaign is complete and prior to shipping.\nCanada (estimated shipping ~$18 USD)\nU.K. (estimated shipping ~$25 USD)\nAustralia (estimated shipping ~$18 for 1 Ergo Spout, ~$25 USD for 2 or 3)\nIf you don't see your country listed, please contact us and we will review policies and costs for shipment to determine whether we will be able to add you to the list.\nIMPORTANT:  International shipping costs do not include custom fees, taxes, duties or other charges for the product to enter your country.  Please take into account any additional amounts that you may have to pay in order to receive the product and ensure that the imported product complies with your national and local laws.\nStretch Goal #1 Once we reach $30,000, we will add a fourth color option. Backers will be able to vote on this color choice. The top color by number of votes wins! Woot Woot!  \nStretch Goal #2 If we reach $50,000, we are adding two additional color options (for a total of six for the campaign)!  There will be a second round of voting with colors added from backer suggestions.\nStretch Goal #3 If we hit $70,000, we have a surprise for our backers.  We will reveal the surprise once we hit the $50,000 goal.  Don't worry, you're going to love it!\nWhen my oldest son was younger, he LOVED pancakes with syrup. It might be more accurate to say that he loved syrup with pancakes. We went though A LOT of syrup at our house.  \nMy mother-in-law had taught me how to make a simple syrup with maple flavoring. It became a family favorite because it's easy, delicious and economical. She also gave me a fancy syrup dispenser. I loved it and used it all the time. Until...  \nOne day I chipped the edge while washing it. I searched the internet for a replacement, but couldn't find one. \nThen came the light bulb moment: wouldn't it be great if there were a spout and handle for Mason jars!  I looked all over for that too, but couldn't find it.  My husband, Bryce, and I decided to make one ourselves. \nNow, after laboring over a ton of versions for the last 18 months, we finally have it ready to manufacture.  We are ready to bring you the Ergo Spout!\nWhy do you call it the Ergo Spout?  \n\nBecause of the unique ergonomic handle.  \nWhat about a wide mouth version?  \n\nDue to interest we have decided to launch the Wide Mouth Ergo Spout with it's own Kickstarter campaign.  After the design, engineering and prototyping is done we will be ready to launch.  Look for it Spring 2019! \nWhat will it be made of?  \n\nThe Ergo Spout will be polypropylene.  Polypropylene is a food safe, non-toxic, BPA-free and Phthalates-free plastic. It will also have a silicone grippy over mold on the handle.  \nIs it dishwasher and microwave safe?  \n\nYes. The plastic will not warp in the high heat of a dishwasher or a microwave.  \nIs it air tight or does it seal?  \nThe Ergo Spout includes a silicone gasket to make a complete seal between the jar and the base of the Ergo Spout. We are working to make it as spill-resistant as possible with our flip-top lid. \nIs it dripless?  \nThe spout's design reduces dripping and will help prevent drips down the side of the jar. \nAre there different colors available?  \nYes, we are offering it in Vintage Blue, Barn Red, and Classic White. We will offer another color as stretch goals.  If the campaign achieve a stretch goal of $30,000 Backers will get to vote on the extra colors.\n                                                     Do you like the Ergo Spout video?

And while most recommendations focus on how much water we need to drink, not enough is said about how often you should be sipping on your water. The frequency and even distribution of your water intake during the day is actually the key to preventing dehydration.   \nThe new EQUA Smart Water Bottle is here to take your water intake \u2013 and overall wellbeing \u2013 to the next level.\nIt glows every time you need to take a sip of water  \nOnce you\u2019re thirsty it\u2019s already too late. EQUA will make sure to send you regular reminders every time its needed in order to prevent your dehydration.\nKnows your optimal daily water intake\nYou\u2019re an individual and you need a personalised plan for your optimal water intake. EQUA\u2019s APP will do that for you and become your healthy lifestyle coach.\nTracks how much water you had\nOnce you start following your water intake you\u2019ll find that on the days when you reach your daily goal, you\u2019ll feel more energised and more friends will comment on your glowing skin.\nCommunicates with you, even without the use of your phone\nA gentle tap on the bottle will reveal how well you are doing - with a slow glow if you\u2019re on track or a quick glow if you need to catch up.\nA companion mobile app for the EQUA Smart Water Bottle will help you keep close track of your hydration. The app recommends your daily water intake according to your body characteristics and lifestyle. It tracks your water intake and offers you an insight look in your hydration habits and analytics. You can also control the frequency of glow reminders on the bottle that will remind you when you need a sip of water.\nHelp us spread the word about EQUA Smart Water Bottle among your family and friends. We will randomly choose 100(!!) of you that\u2019ll share our campaign on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and thank you with a free personalisation of your new EQUA bottle (please see FAQ section for terms & conditions).\nCombining smart technology with a sleek, attractive design, EQUA is crafted in three color options: Snow White, Dark Grey and Pink Blush.\nUsing EQUA bottle will not only have an amazing impact on your wellbeing, but will drastically improve your environmental impact. While bottled waters are conveniently available at our every step, too often we\u2019re not aware of the scary fact that plastic has been mass produced only since 1950\u2019s but we already have a mere 9.2 billion tons of plastic waste to deal with. A switch from disposable to reusable water bottle is a simple step with a big impact!\nThere are many possibilities how to measure your water intake with the help of the bottle and the app. For us the real challenge was to build the right technology with the best user experience. Our goal was to make the hardware part small, durable, functional and packed in a beautiful design. Our choice of technology was the motion sensor (accelerometer). The accelerometer is able to recognize your movements and calculate the amount of water you drink.\nHow it works?\nPLAY\n\nThe main innovation is in its software. We have developed a clever algorithm to understand specific bottle movements. We then use machine learning technology to translate these movements into useful data.

We've been developing award-winning products that push the boundaries of ergonomic mouse design and function for over a decade. This is our third Kickstarter, and thanks to our incredible supporters, we've previously raised over a million dollars in pledges - bringing our products to life.      \nWe\u2019ve gone back to the drawing board on our ergonomic pen grip mouse (Swiftpoint GT), improved everything that people loved, and added more innovative features. We're starting production and are super excited to announce Generation 3 of our pen grip mouse, called ProPoint\u2122\nKickstarter Exclusive Bundle - unbelievable value! \nWe want to launch the product with a huge splash and reward our early supporters. So to get it into as many hands as possible to spread the word, we\u2019ve put together a bundle that is surely the craziest and best offer Kickstarter has ever seen (short of giving it away!)\nUPDATE: Due to the amazing support, we've also been able to include a USB-C to USB adapter, free of charge to ALL backers!\nDouble up, and save even more...\n                                      Do you feel discomfort from your current mouse, or know someone who does?  \nWhether it's relieving current strain or pain, or prevention before it becomes an issue, your health is important...\nUltimate Travel Mouse \nIf you\u2019re sitting on a sofa with your laptop, in a cafe, on a plane, or in a train or bus - this is where ProPoint\u2122 shines - you can use it right on your laptop palmrest.  \nWhen you need to walk to a meeting or your next class, just close your laptop and attach your Propoint\u2122 to the magnetic parking spot on the lid.\nYou can connect via Bluetooth, or with the USB receiver (which also charges the mouse). \n                                Take Command of your Presentations\nNot only is ProPoint\u2122 the most comfortable mouse in the world, but with our gyro technology it's also a \u201cpresenter\u201d - meaning it\u2019s actually two devices in one.\nStand tall with the ProPoint\u2122 in-hand, and flick the switch to transform it into the ultimate presenter device. \nNavigate your slides and lead your audience through your presentation with the virtual laser pointer, you can even draw on the screen to highlight what matters most.\n...not only a mouse, it's also a presenter device\nFinally! A mouse for your iPad\nPrecision and Gestures for Designers & Power Users \nProPoint\u2122 not only gives you the full functionality of a three-button mouse and scrollwheel but, with our unique gyroscope technology, it opens up a new world of tilt gestures for panning, zooming and rotation.\nUnlike other mice that use the scrollwheel for middle mouse clicks, ProPoint\u2122 has a dedicated 3rd mouse button that\u2019s easy to click.\nYou can assign separate functions to all three buttons when the device is tilted, so there\u2019s actually 6 button actions right at your fingertips. Assign shortcuts to the tilt gestures, like app switching, and the actions you use the most. \nIn office programs like Word and Excel, use tilt gestures to effortlessly flick up / down, or even left / right. \nIn design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, flick to the area you need to work on - without even pressing a button. \nIn 3d modeling programs, use tilt-gestures to effortlessly rotate, zoom and pan.\nPropoint\u2122 is the ultimate tool for designers and power users, in the office or on the go.\n                                   Tech Specs\nWe kept all the things people loved about Swiftpoint GT ...\nWe improved everything, and packed in even more innovative features ...\nOur Story \nWe\u2019ve been developing revolutionary products for almost 15 years and have a unique design ethic that starts with a clean slate, followed by an analysis of every minute detail of how we interact with our devices to complete daily computing tasks. \nWe put our designs and concepts through countless cycles of user testing and refinement - this gives us a deep understanding of ergonomics, efficiency, and intuitiveness, to create truly unique and innovative products.  \nWe're not only an ideas company, our team has decades of experience in manufacturing, production, sales, and logistics, and we've shipped tens of thousands of products to every country in the world.\nEverything we do is about making innovative and robust tools made to the highest build quality that we\u2019re proud to put our name on. Devices that make peoples lives easier and more enjoyable.\nLast year we launched \u2018The Z\u2019 - a gaming mouse that was voted gaming innovation of the year by CES.\nBefore that, we launched our ergonomically designed pen-grip mouse the \u2018Swiftpoint GT\u2019, which went on to become computer peripheral of the year.\nNow we\u2019re launching ProPoint\u2122 which is our next generation Swiftpoint GT device.

You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. Following that time, refunds may be given minus Kickstarter and payment fees.

This means some elements may differ from those shown here following the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nIf you do not complete the pledge manager within the time specified when the pledge manager is sent, you agree that your contribution to the campaign was a donation and your pledge is fulfilled. Of course, we will use our discretion on a case by case basis. Completing the pledge manager is the ONLY way for us to confirm your shipping address and pledge details, as well as making sure we hit the production timelines. \n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that will pay for any shipping and any import or other duties required in your country. You also accept that you are liable for providing us with the correct shipping details upon request and we are not responsible for items lost in transit if sending to an incorrectly provided address. We also cannot ship to PO boxes and you must provide an alternative shipping in this circumstance.\n\nAlthough we are aiming to deliver Hellboy: The Board Game to Kickstarter backers before the game is available at retail, production and shipping delays can lead to delivery at the same time or following the retail release. \n\nIf you do not agree to these terms, then please purchase the game once it's available at your friendly local gaming store in 2019.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "Agent Pledge", "descp": "Includes Hellboy: The Board Game, Conqueror Worm Expansion, BPRD Archives Expansion, Bonus Minions, Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Hellboy, digital edition of Seed of Destruction graphic novel, and all applicable stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6,337 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "This pledge is ONLY for verified retailers, do not choose this option unless you are a retailer.

Last year we launched Panobook, a notebook for your desk. We are back again with a new project that pairs perfectly with it: Mark One, a minimal, durable, retractable pen. \n This is Mark One, in a nutshell:\nMinimal design. No superfluous details, not even a visible logo. Clean, simple, elegant, and it comes in two colors. \nDurable. The entire pen is made out of metal, and coated with a robust ceramic polymer coating, which gives the pen a great feel in the hand. \nRetractable. We wanted a click pen for our favorite refill, and we went to great lengths\u2014including a custom mechanism\u2014to make it happen. Satisfying as heck to click. \nThis whole journey started when we discovered a fantastic refill, beloved in the pen world: the Schmidt P8126 rollerball. It quickly became our favorite, so we thought, \u201cwe should make a great pen for this refill.\u201d So that\u2019s what we did.\nKeep scrolling to learn more! \nPerhaps unsurprising if you know us, but our design goal from the beginning was to design a pen that was both minimal and beautiful. Mark One has a completely seamless (literally) design, with no excess ornamentation or logo. This seamless design was quite an engineering feat, and involved designing a custom mechanism that can screw in from the back. The pen comes in two colors: black or white, which both have a slightly textured, matte finish. The metal plated nocks provide a nice little accent to each. We wanted the pen to be sophisticated without looking overly tactical or masculine. \nIt was also important for us to make something long lasting. Mark One is incredibly durable. It is made entirely out of metal; even the custom click mechanism is metal (more on that below). The pen is coated with Cerakote, which is an extremely durable ceramic-polymer coating. It gives the pen a really nice, matte feel. This pen should last a lifetime. \nWe decided early on that we wanted our pen to be a retractable click pen, but getting there was another story. There are many off-the-shelf click mechanisms we could have used, but none of them were quite right for what we wanted, so naturally, we are making our own mechanism. It is made entirely out of metal and, as far as we know, it is the only all-metal mechanism on the market that has an actual \"click\" action. It's extremely satisfying. We are quite proud of it!  \nMark One ships with our favorite refill, the Schmidt P8126 rollerball. This is a fantastic cartridge; the ink flows smoothly and dries quickly. This refill was popularized by the Retro 51 Tornado, and we wanted to make a pen that... didn't look like that. If you've never used this refill before, you're in for a treat. \nHowever, Mark One will accept any Parker style refill, which, if you are not a pen nerd, just means there are many options for pen cartridges that our pen will accept, like the Fisher Space Pen ball-point or various gels. This list from Well-Appointed Desk is quite comprehensive. \nThe Schmidt P8126 rollerball refill.\nHere are the details of the pen, however things may be tweaked slightly as we move to production. \nDimensions: 128mm long, 11mm diameter. (5in x 0.43in)\nWeight: 25 grams (0.88oz)\nAluminum body and mechanism. Nickel and copper plated aluminum knock.\nCerakote coating, matte finish. See technical specifications for Cerakote here.\nIncluded Refill: Schmidt P8126. Black ink with 0.6mm tip diameter. \nWe've had the design concept for Mark One for a while now, even before we launched the Panobook campaign (you can actually find early prototype Easter eggs in the video if you look for them). Once that campaign was a success, we knew a pen would be the perfect follow up. Although the design of the Mark One looks simple, we spent countless hours tweaking the geometry and design, and we reworked and redesigned the mechanism multiple times. It was a long journey to get to the current design, and we can't wait for you to use it! \nNot even scratching the surface of how many prototypes we made.\nSince everything about this pen is custom machined, there is a sizable upfront cost, as well as a minimum quantity needed to get this off the ground. If you are interested in supporting your new favorite pen, hit the green button to help bring the Mark One into existence.\nThanks for your support! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 400+ successful project with over $200MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are Kickstarter veterans, and have successfully funded and delivered 7 projects in the past.

Our original plan was to make the knocks out of aluminum and plate them with nickel and copper. We soon realized that while nickel plating aluminum is very tough and robust, copper plated metals can corrode over time, turning the shiny copper color brown (like an old penny). At this point we started looking at PVD (physical vapor deposition), a process used to color and strengthen metals (Apple uses a process like this for their gold colored Apple Watch, for example). We were told that titanium is a better metal for the PVD process than aluminum, which is why we switched to titanium knocks in a past update."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Big Update and Address Surveys!", "update_content": "Hey Folks!\nIt\u2019s been a while since our last update, and we have much to report.

Our products received rave reviews from many backers.  We are proud to be back with another extraordinary product.  Introducing: \nNot much bigger than the credit card it is built to carry, the extremely compact WYN can hold up to ten cards plus cash and receipts. It is constructed of exquisite carbon fiber, which is lightweight, strong and durable. The WYN Minimalist Wallet allows for fast card access, is completely secure, and is simply eye-catching.\nIf you want to comfortably carry more cards and cash, access them faster while shredding the bulk then the WYN Minimalist Wallet is perfect for you.\n\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\" - Leonardo da Vinci\nWYN is an advanced twist on the bulk of a wallet that bulges uncomfortably in your back pocket. Phones have evolved; they are smaller, easier to use and carry, so why not wallets? That is why we created WYN, a wallet not much thicker than the actual credit cards it is built to carry. WYN slips easily into any pocket, whether it be on your shirt or on your pants. It is so lightweight that you will not even notice it is there. You will find that WYN is the most comfortable wallet you have ever owned.\nWYN is only as thick as the amount of credit card you carry, whether it is 3 cards or 10 cards.  It is only 0.5 oz., about the weight of two US quarters.\nWhile being extremely compact WYN is still incredibly functional. It has all the functionality of a full size wallet such as holding cash and receipts. WYN also offers the added benefits of easy access to your most used cards, fast payments with card chips and full card view for phone orders. All of this happens quickly and effortless with just one hand. \nAdding cash is easy: press a finger to create gap, insert cash\nWYN's exquisite carbon fiber material and modern design makes it the perfect wallet for every occasion. It is comfortable during work, secure and lightweight for active wear, durable for the outdoors, and compliments any attire from casual to formal. \nDURABLE: Carbon fiber is used in aerospace and performance cars, well known for its superior properties of strength, flexibility and lightness.  We have spent countless hours perfecting WYN's design. There are no rubber bands, straps, screws or latches to wear or break over time. \nSECURE: WYN's innovative, patent pending design straddles both sides and applies just the right amount of pressure to keep your cards and cash securely in place.  They also stop the cards from moving side to side.  \nI had a car accident in 2015 and went to see a chiropractor. I complained about my back pain which seemed to be getting worse. He took some measurements and the results showed that my right side is about half an inch shorter than my left side. He told me it was the result of sitting on my leather wallet year after year. Many of his clients have had the same problem and they never even suspected that their wallet was the cause of the pain.   \nI started taking my wallet out of my back pocket before I would sit down. It was too big to comfortably fit in any of my other pockets. It was such an inconvenience and sometimes I forgot my wallet. I knew I had to find a better solution.  I wanted a wallet that was compact but didn't restrict the amount of cards or cash I could carry.  I wanted something simple yet functional while easy to use. I wanted a wallet that is cool, elegant and sophisticated so that I would be proud to carry it.  What I didn't want was any rubber bands, straps, screws or latches. \nIn early 2016 I had an aha moment and conceived a design for a wallet that meets all of the requirements, and more. We spent a lot of time refining the design using different materials and manufacturing processes. We tested plastic, aluminum, titanium and finally settled with carbon fiber. We ordered material from different factories and tested them. We've been using the WYN wallet for many months and we LOVE it. \nWe guarantee you will love WYN too!\nPrototypes\nOur gratitude to the following individuals (in no particular order) whose feedback, advises and involvements help bring this project to fruition: John Groth - Waterjets Design, Phil Kooken - Oak 2 Design, Josh & Joe Gray - Fractal Focus, Xuyen Huynh, Tyler Fetters, Matt Nguyen, Edgar Molina, Melody Caron, Trent Striplin, Riley McElroy, Allen Napoles. \n                     IMPORTANT NOTICE: \nPlease note that YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CUSTOMS FEE, DUTIES, VAT, IMPORT TAXES, SPECIAL DELIVERY FEES ADMINISTERED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT, AND HANDLING FEES.

It makes all the pieces perfectly organized.\n  THE HISTORY\nOur first development was an ergonomic screwdriver. The product was shown to the most important screwdriver manufacturers, but they were not interested in it. The handle design had a small rubber ring made to protect the tip of the screwdriver and surfaces, like a wooden floor or a car veneer and this it the part of the invention they were amazed by.\nAfter that breaking moment, Michael W. Perez decided to improve this part in many more utilities creating a greater body structure and adding a powerful magnet. This is how the MAGNET DRIVER\u2122 50 was created.\nAfter the successful Kickstarter campaign launched in 2015 he decided to work on a screw holder for the common 1\" insert bits and \"Bitholder Classic\" was created. He added a new utility to this piece by inventing the revolutionary \"Bitholder Drill&Drive\". Finally he created compatible multi-purpose accessories, and the result of these developments is Magnet Driver Total Tools DDN, our new pack to Drill, Drive and Nail.\nCurrently Michael W. Perez works for Micaton company in R&D department constantly inventing and developing new tools for DIY enthusiasts and professionals.  \n    WHEN WILL I RECEIVE THIS INVENTION IF I BACK THIS PROJECT?\nYOU ARE OUR BEST COLLEAGUES\nYou are our best allies!

We heard you, loud and clear!\nToday we are happy to announce two new wide angle lenses to the Pinhole Pro family: the Pinhole Pro S11 (11mm) and Pinhole Pro S37 (37mm).\nPinhole photography predates any form of modern photography as the most fundamental form of photographic art. The forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura \u2014 a permeative photographic device with no lens but a single pinhole aperture.\nContemporary cameras use state-of-the-art lenses, mirrors, mounts, AF/MF techniques, and endlessly higher pixel density to deliver amazing images, but those images are too life-like, lacking the charm of raw, naturally vintage look of pinhole photos boasting the most original saturated colours. \nPinhole is photography in its most original form. However, achieving that unforgettable photographic aesthetics requires high precision engineering and modern state of the art manufacturing technologies. With so many sub-par quality options on the market, as well as the ability for anyone to build their own, we saw an opportunity to not only build a pinhole lens that\u2019s beautiful with exceptional build quality, but also with precision engineering and rich inputs from the photographers and cinematographers themselves \u2014 the result was the world\u2019s first ever multi-aperture professional pinhole lens that supports virtually all modern digital cameras with interchangeable lenses.\nIn the early 20th century, the development of high speed films and mass production of glass lens almost made pinhole photography forgotten. It\u2019s a lost art form, only to be kept alive by the few enthusiasts.\nPhotographers turned to the endless pursuit of sharpness, resolution and speed. That trend still dominates today. However many photographers like yourself have started to realize that high resolution and high specs can not replace the authenticity of analogue photography that\u2019s more personal, original, unfiltered with a timeless 'point of view'. Pinhole photography provides exactly that. After all it is the closest to what a human eye can see.\nCreate photos and videos exactly the same way photos were taken hundreds of years ago, and pair that with modern high speed, high ISO technologies. The result is stunning and timeless.\nExperiment and have fun!\nPinhole photography is great for printing out. Paper gives pinhole photos timeless feeling.\nNever before, is professional pinhole motion pictures so easy and achievable. The vivid yet stunningly unique look of the pinhole cinema is something that\u2019s simply non-reproducible by digital.\nInstead of charging over $1500 for a professional made pinhole lens for cinematography, we offer a much more affordable option for movie makers and video artists with a much more dramatic offering:\n What lies in every Pinhole Pro lens, is the secret of how each tiniest yet perfectly precious pinhole aperture is made. The shape and edge smoothness of the pinhole aperture is one of the most critical factors in image quality and sharpness.\nUnlike most DIY and commercial pinhole cameras and pinhole lenses that use either mechanical pin punching, chemical etching or laser etching, Thingyfy uses a robotic controlled tiny micro-drill that is only 0.05mm in diameter, to preciously drill a perfectly round and smooth pinhole aperture. This process requires state-of-the-art environmental control and vibration reduction, in order to produce the stunning quality of each Pinhole Pro in mass production. Below is a table that compares the attributes of each pinhole production method:\nThe first three methods result in an imperfect pinhole, with pinhole apertures that are either too large, not round in shape, thick walls of the pinhole or with fuzzy edges \u2014 each of which will result in poor image quality.\nOne of the biggest challenges to create a super wide angle pinhole lens is the innovative engineering of the lens structure itself at a microscopic scale.\nIn order to achieve a whopping 120\u00b0 field of view at an aperture less than 0.15mm, the pinhole wall has to be leas than 0.1mm to eliminate the tunnel effect, or dark corners on the picture.\nThis is no easy task, as if the wall is too thin, the aperture plane of the Pinhole lens will be as thin as a tin foil, therefore easy to penetrate and warp. Thingyfy\u2019s engineer has developed an ingenious design x allows the aperture plain to stay as thick as 1mm, ensuring its strength and durability, while by precisely machining two opening funnels at opposite orientation, both allows a 120\u00b0 opening on each side, to let light rays pass through with no obstruction. \nPinhole Pro and Pinhole Pro S offer seven different lens mounts and four focal lengths, ranging from 11mm to 55mm. With the extension tubes that are widely available for each lens mount, it\u2019s possible to covert the Pinhole Pro to a wide range of focal lengths, taking advantages of the unique multi-aperture design.\nIn case you are pledging for Pinhole Pro S as a present for your loved ones and the event will take place soon.

And this time, it\u2019s serious.\nFive years ago, we came to Kickstarter with a simple mission: we wanted to make a better spatula for you. Since then, based on your requests and 100% born and raised right here on Kickstarter, we\u2019ve launched nearly three dozen products across six campaigns. But there are two products that have taken more time and effort than any of the others. Two products that deserved (heck, demanded) as much time and attention as the rest combined. These are the ones that kept us up at night. They also happen to be the ones you wanted more than anything else.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain our approach without a self-referential nod to our name and mission: Get It Right. When we design a product, we strip away everything and start from scratch. We imagine what it would be like to experience the platonic form of whatever it is we\u2019re working on. And then, we build.\nWhen you strip tongs back to the basics, you\u2019re not actually looking at tongs anymore. You\u2019re looking at hands. Tongs should be an extension of your hands - an extension that can get hot, messy, and extra grippy when the going gets tough. And to be a perfect extension of your hands, your tongs need to lock and unlock intuitively, just like your hands grab and release. No weird dongles to pull, tabs to slide, or upside-down gravity tricks. No using one hand to help the other. Just you and your tongs, lefty or righty, working together to get stuff done.\nTo achieve this intuitive one-handed lock experience, we developed a mechanism unlike anything else out there. It\u2019s patent-pending, and took us four years of meticulous engineering and prototyping to perfect. When we finally cracked the code, we knew we\u2019d hit on something special.\nGIR tongs lock and unlock with a simple squeeze. And once you\u2019ve got the muscle memory dialed in, it\u2019s addictive.\n\nSqueeze on the logo to lock. Squeeze on the grip stripes to unlock. Repeat.\nIt\u2019s a magical experience, and we are so excited to share it with you. But we didn\u2019t stop there.\n316 Stainless Steel\nWe\u2019re using 316 surgical grade stainless steel in the construction of every one of the tongs\u2019 parts. It\u2019s an extremely high quality material - in fact, we\u2019re not aware of any other tongs that use grade 316 stainless (and we've looked). You might have heard of 18/10 or 18/8 steel, both of which use a chromium/nickel blend and are commonly found in household appliances. 316 steel adds molybdenum to the mix, resulting in a material that's durable, biocompatible, and highly corrosion resistant. This stuff is the best of the best.\nFeatures\nErgonomic Design\nTo conceptualize the overall tong shape, we went back to a familiar form: the original GIR Ultimate Spatula. By splitting this shape down the center and making some thoughtful adjustments to size and proportion, we were able to create tong blades that conform to bowls and pans at an ideal angle, grip precisely, slide gracefully underneath delicate items, and provide an equally enjoyable experience for both left-handed and right-handed users. \nGently curved edges and softened cuts, along with a tapered overlap, make for an easy grip and completely eliminate the possibility of pinched fingers. And a 35\u00b0 angle when fully open is comfortable for hands large and small.\nWe\u2019ve also added grip stripes and embossed logos as \u201cX marks the spot\u201d indicators for locking and unlocking, so that you can use your tongs without even looking at them.\nSizes\nGIR Tongs come in three sizes. The blade shape, open angle, materials, and locking features are identical on all three of these tongs; we\u2019ve simply adjusted arm length for each of them to accommodate a variety of use cases.\nFor smaller tasks, serving bowls, kids, and tabletop use, the 9\u201d Mini Tongs will be your go-to. They\u2019re quite cute. But don\u2019t underestimate them.\nOur flagship Ultimate tongs clock in at an industry-standard 12\u201d. This size is the \u201cregular\u201d tong size you probably already know and love. It\u2019s great for all-around multitasking in the kitchen, and will keep your hands comfortably away from stovetop and oven heat. If you\u2019re only going to get one pair of tongs, this is the size we\u2019d recommend.\nAnd finally, our 16\u201d Grill tongs will be your backyard best friend. These extra long tongs will keep your hands well away from searing barbecue heat and can easily grip and flip just about anything you want to toss on the grill.\nColors\nWe\u2019ve got a thing with color. We love it. So naturally, working with metal didn\u2019t really stop us from keeping things interesting in the color arena. We\u2019re launching these tongs in three finishes (and who knows\u2026 more may be around the corner). \nHigh polish stainless\nOur team favorite. A bespoke polish treatment combining high gloss blades with a fingerprint-resistant matte stainless grip.\nBrushed stainless\nThe workhorse. These tongs will weather scratches and wear nicks with pride.\nLMTD Edition Black\nA titanized matte black finish, because you deserve tongs that look this dark. \nNonstick Safety\nNonstick-safe blades are in the works. We are planning to offer them down the line (or perhaps as a stretch goal), and will have lots of cool colors to choose from once we hit go.\nWhy didn\u2019t we just do nonstick in the first place?\nWell, there\u2019s lots to like about solid steel. For starters, it allows these tongs to have unibody arms that are sanitary, easy to clean, and extremely wear-resistant. It also makes for an extra precise grip. And honestly, we wanted to bring these tongs to you as fast as we could. The nonstick blade design has taken bit longer to perfect, so we\u2019re presenting the 100% steel versions first and paving the way for future iterations. In the meantime, use these tongs with care on your coated cookware. We\u2019ve got ours in the kitchen with pots and pans of all varieties, but we do work gently around treated surfaces.\nOur whisks might not look all that different from what you already have in the kitchen drawer. But they\u2019re full of surprises. Their features boil down to one basic idea: these whisks make you a better whisker.\nWhisking 101\nSo how do whisks work? When you\u2019re whisking, each wire pulls a stream of air through liquid to create a foam. More wires \u2014> more air \u2014> more foam, faster. So instead of the standard 8 to 10 wires you find on most whisks, we\u2019ve used 12. Right there, you\u2019ve got yourself a faster whisk. But there\u2019s more to it than that.\nWire tension, material, and spacing are also mission-critical for aeration and foam production. You want wires that vibrate vigorously to create turbulence and shear force in your liquid medium. Hardened 304 stainless steel wires, inserted under high tension, create max vibration and efficiency in the GIR whisk. And no wire should touch another, lest the vibration be dampened. We\u2019ve evenly distributed our wires around the handle circumference for better whisking at any angle, and spaced them for peak aeration.\nWe\u2019ve selected a medium-thin wire gauge (width) of 1.3mm that can handle thick batters, cookie dough, and sauces, but is flexible enough to whip eggs, cream, and vinaigrettes with no loss of efficiency. Each wire is inserted through a stainless steel cap and secured deep inside the handle. To create an oil-safe and germ-free seal over the insertion points, we\u2019re using a food-safe hardened epoxy that acts as an airtight seal over the entire assembly.\nStyle Equals Substance\nWe\u2019ve got half a dozen whisk styles in our test kitchen at any given moment (and more in the backup stash, of course). From French whips to fat balloons, we can find a place for each of them. But to design an all-purpose whisk, we set our sights on a \u201cskinny balloon\u201d shape that balances classic styling with the ability to get into tight corners.\nTechnique\nA note on technique: our friends at Cook\u2019s Illustrated have a piece to say about efficient whisking. For most tasks a side-to-side motion, rather than circular strokes, will take advantage of shear forces in the liquid to emulsify oils or whip cream much more quickly than any other motion. For viscous egg whites, a beating motion is preferred because taking the whisk away from the action with each stroke allows wider air channels to propagate in the liquid.\nErgonomics\nThe wires and handle are counterbalanced to reduce wrist fatigue, and avoid that messy moment when a heavy handle flips the whisk out of the bowl.\nTo top it all off, the handle shape fits every grip style and was designed with humanscale ergonomics in mind. And in case you\u2019re wondering, all those geometric facets make for an excellent non-slip grip and are molded from very comfy, platinum-grade silicone.\nColors\nLike most GIR products, these whisks come in a variety of clean and bright colors. Match your kitchen, make a statement, or stick with the neutrals. Most of all, go with what feels right!\nSizes\nThe Ultimate whisk is 11\u201d (280mm) from end to end, with a 4.5\u201d long silicone handle that\u2019ll keep your hands away from skillet heat. You\u2019ll use this whisk for most tasks - it\u2019s a versatile size for everyday use.\nThe Mini Whisk is 8\u201d (203mm) from end to end, with a 4\u201d silicone handle that fits the smallest of hands (hey kids!) and is just the right size for smaller jobs like stirring vinaigrettes or beating a single egg.\nPrototype to finished product\nDeveloping these tools has been an exhaustive process spanning four years and dozens of prototypes. We left no stone unturned in our search for the perfect tong mechanism, and destroyed many a whisk trying to uncover their secrets. From initial sketches and caffeine-fueled brainstorming to CAD modeling, 3D prints, and saying goodbye to great ideas that just weren't good enough... we've done it all. We're delighted to present these tools as the very best of their kind, and we hope you love them as much as we do.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "CUSTOM PLEDGE", "descp": "Use this tier to customize a reward from the add-ons menu!

We'll demo products and answer any question you've got:\nWhat is all this?\nWe're Peak Design, a San Francisco based product design company. We're also the luckiest goobers on the planet; we engineer and make world-class photography gear, and we both shape it and share it with the Kickstarter community.\nWe've got new stuff, and you can pre-order it by backing this Kickstarter project. Your new gear will ship worldwide before the end of this year!\nThis is Peak Design's 7th Kickstarter project! Holy Toledo, we can't even believe it ourselves. This time around, with your help, we are making our best products even better.\nHow to back this campaign:\n1. Click \"Back this project\"\n2. Pick your reward level\n3. Want to add more stuff to your reward? Check out the Add-On Menu and increase your pledge amount accordingly\nFor detailed instructions, scroll down to the bottom of this page or see the FAQ.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ\nWhat are we making?\nAll-New Capture v3\nIt's a metal clip that lets you rigidly carry any camera on your backpack strap, belt, or bag. Take your camera more places, keeping it secure and instantly accessible. Our new design is made of beautiful machined and anodized aluminum, and is smaller, lighter, more durable, and more comfortable than ever before. There's a also new Pro Pad for heavy rigs or all-day carry.\nAll-New Slide + Slide Lite\nThey're the world's most quick-connecting, versatile, stable, and comfortable pro camera straps, one for DSLRs and one for mirrorless. All hardware and materials have been updated for better comfort, smoother operation, increase durability, and gorgeous aesthetics.\nWhy did we make 'em?\nThere are a million straps, harnesses, and holsters out there for carrying cameras, and none of them met our needs. They were bulky, flimsy, frumpy, floppy, and frustrating. We knew we could do better.\nWhy are we updating them now?\nYou (our Kickstarter backers) brought Capture, Slide, and Slide Lite to life several years ago, and those earlier versions are really, really great products. Since then, we've learned tons, and we knew we could make these core products even better. Our backers demand the best, and we feel inclined to give ya'll just that.\nPeak Design has enormous plans for 2018. But before we start our next adventure, we had to give these three products the performance and aesthetic upgrades they deserve. Like momma used to say: dance with the one who brought ya. Now, let's meet these products:\n Capture: why is it so exceptionally dope?\nCapture is, in our humble opinion, the best damn way to carry a camera. It keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button. \n   Jump to:  Add-On Menu  |  Reward Menu  |  FAQ\n    Slide + Slide Lite: What makes 'em so freaking sweet?\nHave you ever used a traditional camera strap? You're probably all too familiar with bouncing cameras, clunky connectors, annoying shoulder pads, tripod incompatibility, and frumpy looks. With Slide and Slide Lite you get none of that, and all of this:\n    Jump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ \n  Now for the nitty gritty.\nWow, you've really made your way down the page. Maybe that's because you're looking for more details. Well, lucky for you we didn't spare a single one.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ  \nAnd now for the big question...\n    Reward Menu \nAdd-On Menu\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ.\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ. For more info on what all these products are, visit peakdesign.com.\nWhy such a short campaign?\nThere's a lot going on at Peak Design right now. We've launched over 20 SKUs in the last few months. It's almost holiday season. And, we'll soon be launching our own flagship retail store in San Francisco. We're keeping this campaign short and sweet so we provide top-notch service to our backers without dropping the other balls we have in the air. We also want to ship all rewards out before the end of the year! \nWhen will it all ship?\nWe expect all rewards to leave our warehouses by mid December. That means that many of you will receive awards before the end of the year and even before the holidays.\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee that rewards will ship by a certain date, and once rewards are in the mail, we have even less control over how long it takes them to reach your doorstep. We'll do everything in our power to get rewards out the door by early December, but we can't make any absolute promises. See the FAQ for details.\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter project since 2011, so we've had ample time to hone our design, manufacturing, shipping, and supply chain management processes. Most importantly, we've gotten pretty darn good at setting our customers' expectations accurately and delivering on our promises.\n\nBut no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: It's the holiday season, the busiest shipping time of the year. Every year, record breaking volumes can cause port congestion, over-stuffed warehouses, and shipping service delays.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have the Wellness Coach Convention and the Artisan Toast Convention scheduled for the same weekend (can you imagine finding a place to brunch, let alone park the Subaru?!). Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Slide Lite", "descp": "The small strap.

It has the practicality and versatility of a full-size knife\u2014but at a fraction of the weight, and the size of a house key.\nThe WESN Titanium Micro Blade EDC Pocket Knife\n        When I started making the WESN knife, I didn\u2019t have any grand ideas of starting a \u201cknife brand.\u201d All I wanted was a knife that I myself would want to own\u2014something reliable, practical, and made of the best materials. Plus, I wanted something worth every penny of the cost, and not a cent too expensive.\nThe story of how the WESN has come to be is long and unique\u2014but the best part is that the story isn\u2019t done yet. This is a knife I\u2019ll be able to hand down to my kids. And so will you.\nLanyard Hole to attach to your keychain\nThis knife is built to go absolutely anywhere you want to take it (well, other than airport security, of course). In fact, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the WESN: West, East, South, North. Every direction, every destination, the WESN can go there.\nWESN assembly\n       When it came to actually making the WESN, you can bet your bottom dollar I did my research. I dug into what\u2019s behind all my favorite parts of different knives I\u2019ve owned. I asked people both in and out of the industry what made their favorite knives so special.\nI found out what kind of materials the best knives are made of. And then, I got to work. I ended up with a knife that\u2019s got the practicality and versatility of a full-size knife\u2014but at a fraction of the weight, and the size of a house key.\nA sleek and compact design\nBy using top grade components, the WESN is made with some of the best materials at an affordable price: grade 5 titanium and AUS8 steel.\nPartnering with the top knife manufacture overseas, we are able to produce the WESN out-of-country. This keeps the cost down for you and helps us get the knife into more hands. But even though we\u2019re taking these steps to lower the cost, we certainly aren\u2019t lowering our standards of quality.\nThe titanium makes the body simultaneously tough and hardy, while also dramatically reducing the weight. And by using AUS8 steel, the blade is durable, sharp, and made to last...and last...and last.\nWESN / Stock & Barrel Custom Sheath\nPlus, as an extra bonus for Kickstarter backers, we\u2019re super excited that we\u2019ve been able to partner with Stock & Barrel to create an all-natural Wickett and Craig\u2019s natural tooling leather Sheath specifically designed for the WESN and made right here in America.\nWESN / Stock & Barrel Custom Sheath\nI\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Stock & Barrel. Their commitment to quality design and materials made them a perfect match for the WESN in my mind. This case is just like the WESN\u2014made with integrity, and built for the long haul.\n     What can't you use this knife for? Well, I wouldn't recommend trimming your nose hairs... but hey: where there's a will, there's a way.\nThe WESN was designed to be versatile\u2014and I made sure it was by testing the crap out of it. With over 6 months of testing and usage, it's been able to do any task someone might ask of a knife. Even though the WESN doesn't have the specialized ability of knives built for specific tasks, you can know that the WESN will be up for the task, whatever you ask it to do. \n Here's a list of practical uses:\n...pry, cut, pick, flip, dip, nip... It\u2019s endless what you can do with the WESN... Only time will tell!\nProcessing firewood\n  Cutting rope\n  Fire starting\n    Opening a box\n                        Blade Length: 1.5\u201d (38mm)\nClosed Lenth: 2.25\u201d (57mm)\nOpen Length:  3.75\" (95mm)\nTotal Weight: 1oz\nHandle Material: Grade 5 Titanium body\nBlade Steel: AUS8 Heat Treated Steel\nHardware: Stainless steel\nFrame-lock \nPocket Clip\nKeychain Hole\nLifetime Warranty\n Every detail was considered when I was designing the WESN, from the steel I chose for the blade, to the shape of the pocket clip.\n It was my goal to create a compact, high-quality knife that won't get in your way. Whether you choose to carry it on your keychain, in your pocket, or with a custom Stock & Barrel sheath, it will carry far and it will carry well. \n    I believe in this knife, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s got a lifetime guarantee. This is a knife we\u2019ll be able to hand down to our kids. Wherever you take it, whatever you use it for, the WESN can handle it.

I've carried everything from a 3\u201d folder to a multi-tool, but nothing ever satisfied me or quite delivered what I was looking for. Everything was either too big, heavy, or ugly, or just not practical enough to carry around with me everywhere I go. So, a little over a year ago, I set out to create what I consider the perfect pocket knife.\nStarting from a simple sketch on a piece of paper all the way to manufacturing a working prototype, the WESN has been a long and exciting journey. I've been committed to quality the whole time\u2014 so there's been a lot of starting over to perfect each and every aspect of the knife. I've considered everything, from which screws to use to how thick the blade should be. Then, I personally tested the knife. I'm happy to say it's passed my own test, as well as the simple\u2014but all important\u2014test of time.\nEarly Development Concept Design\n  Blueprint designs\n  WESN Hand Made Prototype\n  PLAY\n\n  WESN Dimensions\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a background in product design, it has been my commitment from the beginning to create the best product possible.\n\nWith a little over a year of development, the WESN is in the final stages. All the necessary steps\u2014from design to prototyping\u2014have been completed, and the materials are in place to begin manufacturing. Once the project is complete and funded, we'll be able to get the gears rolling and begin production as soon as possible. \n\nI have been working closely with my machinist and manufacturer to ensure the WESN is ready for mass manufacturing and the delivery dates are in place.\n\nIf the WESN Micro blade is successfully funded, I commit to making sure all steps are completed and delivery is met as promised. The funds raised from this Kickstarter will be used for production and manufacturing. \n\nOur goal is to deliver all rewards on schedule, but if demand is higher than expected or unforeseen challenges arise, we could see a delay in delivery. \n\nDevelopment of the WESN has been a long road, and I\u2019m excited to get this knife into your hands. \n\nThank you for making the WESN story a reality,

Read more\nWhether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker\u00ae is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for. \nHere at Owlcat Games, we love and are inspired by classic isometric computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Arcanum. Our dream is to rekindle the thrill of playing those games for the first time. Building your hero, exploring the unknown, getting to know your companions, experiencing the adrenaline rush of your first battle (and your last), delving into mysterious dungeons, and\u2014most importantly\u2014seeing your protagonist and your world change through your actions.\nWe've always been big fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u00ae from Paizo, Inc\u00ae, so we thought: How cool would it be to do this in the beloved Pathfinder setting? Paizo agreed, and with your support, we hope to bring a brand-new fantasy saga to life.\nWhat the press says\n\"If the alpha build was any indication, then there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to shape your own identity and leave your mark on the world.\" - Gamespot\n\"Almost everything I asked about in terms of story seemed to have a layer beyond what I expected--the advantage of having years of tabletop playtesting, perhaps. If these different aspects of Kingmaker can coalesce into a dramatic whole, this could be special.\" - IGN\n\"For fans of the tabletop game, this will be a great opportunity to translate their fantasy adventures to their desktops.\" - Game Informer\n\"First impressions from in and around the bandit lord's fortress; the game looks incredible. The in-progress menus are attractive and orderly, the environments lush and vivid, the character portraits appealing and refined. What voice acting there was, was convincing and professional.\" - mmorpg.com\nThe Game World \nPathfinder: Kingmaker is the first single-player computer RPG based on the acclaimed Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The game invites players to Golarion, a world rich with history, mystery, and conflict, and gives players the chance to claim part of this world as their own.\n\"Follow the white rabbit, Baron\"\nPathfinder has considerable depth, not only in its lore, but also in its game mechanics, and in the freedom it offers you to develop your own unique character. You can customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\nUse night to your advantage \u2013 and see the world change.\nThe Story\nIn the north lies the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\nThe only easy day was yesterday.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love. Either way, you will experience a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. Pathfinder: Kingmaker features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\nMore than 10 companions to watch your back\u2026 or stick a knife in it.\nYour Kingdom \nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler.\nYou never know what's around the next bend.\nMost importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and the ability to lead troops in the field are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins\u2014and while dealing with politics in your own court.\nThere are many ways to manage your Kingdom, and many rewards to be gained.\n As you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\nIf you fail, your kingdom will be destroyed, but if you succeed, you\u2019ll have made a nation where countless others have failed.  \nYour kingdom awaits! Do you have the strength to rule it?\n\nAre you a benevolent ruler or a ruthless tyrant?\n Expanding depth and richness of kingdom gameplay is so important to us that we\u2019ve made it our initial goal for the Kickstarter. Every pledge made toward our initial funding target will result in more features, more content, and more polish for your growing nation. Our goal is to let you build a kingdom that fits your play style. Perhaps you want to control every single activity in your kingdom by yourself, or perhaps you are more of a top-level ruler who wants to spend time exploring the wilderness and fighting dangerous beasts. Either way, we will give you the life you want to live. You are a king, after all!\nWe are excited about the kingdom mechanics and we have carefully planned all the features we would love to implement if you support us. All funds will be distributed according to the following pie chart:\nExpanding the kingdom is our first goal for the Kickstarter, but it\u2019s not going to be our only goal. With your support, we can improve every aspect of game. We\u2019re prepared to announce additional stretch goals to diversify the characters you\u2019ll be able to build, including the introduction of archetypes (at least a couple for each of the classes), additional classes (we have been asked about Magus several times\u2014and some Owlcats really want to play this class!), and additional races. We also want to develop the storyline further, expanding it beyond the Adventure Path, and we would like to include even more companions, each with their own alignment and agenda (including a companion that\u2019s dear to hearts of Pathfinder fans). We also want to bring you even more locations to visit, including an epic dungeon. We want to enhance our game with more voiceover and music. And we want more players to experience our game by adding additional language localizations, and support for OS X and Linux!\nWe don't just want to reward your support through stretch goals alone.

Dining on those meals will provide your party with different small and pleasant bonuses.\nOwlcat Games was formed by developers who have the experience, resources, and - above all - the passion required to make Pathfinder: Kingmaker a truly amazing game.\n We are a new studio, but we are not new to the industry. Many of us worked on these games as part of Nival Interactive and My.com:\nWe can't deny ourselves the pleasure to name just a few games Chris Avellone worked on:\nOwlcat Games team.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker has an existing schedule, an existing scope, and an existing budget, and that budget will allow us to achieve that scope on schedule. We already have a full team of people working on it, and we're committed to doing it regardless of what happens with this Kickstarter. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is YOU\u2014we need YOU to decide how big Pathfinder: Kingmaker is going to be. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to increase the budget and the scope, delivering a bigger and deeper game on the same schedule.  \nAll of us\u2014RPG fans and developers alike\u2014deserve a game that demonstrates the richness of the Pathfinder universe. There are so many interesting things in the world and in the rules that we can\u2019t fit into the current budget, yet our desire to add them to the game is practically unbearable. We dream of more companions with added depths to their stories, new classes, new dungeons, more wilderness to explore, more kingdom events, and even brand-new quests and custom content by famous Pathfinder and CRPG authors. With this Kickstarter, our only limit is your support and your faith in us. Help us make Pathfinder: Kingmaker the product we all want it to be. Help us kick the epicness to the stratosphere!\n\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

It's a dream come true to design and publish RPG games, and we're incredibly excited by this opportunity.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for games to be delayed. Unexpected challenges sometimes occur, but we have a strong expertise in video games and a plan in place to minimize any obstacles to production. We\u2019ve done due diligence during our vertical slice and we know exactly how long it takes to create assets (dialogues, levels, models, animations) for our game. As such, we are pretty confident that the game will be on the digital \"shelves\" in summer 2018.\n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is being developed under license from Paizo Inc., with their full support. Products presented on this Kickstarter page and during the campaign may be subject to change in order to meet the expectations of our licensing agreement with Paizo.\n\nThe largest unknown element will be the number of backers, which affects the amount of labor needed to fulfill the rewards for those backers. You will notice many of our rewards have limited quantities; these are to ensure that we are able to satisfy our delivery dates. When some of these reward categories fill up, we will add identical reward categories with adjusted shipping dates. We do this to maintain quality and ensure you receive your rewards on time.

Oh well, all your dreams can't come true, right?\nWrong. When the issue of porting the game to consoles came up, we realized pretty fast that something had to be done about combat. Micromanaging the party in combat, particularly important at high complexity levels, is extremely difficult when you have a gamepad instead of a mouse and a keyboard. Of course, we could try to improve the artificial intelligence of the player's characters and make it customizable, but this didn't seem a good solution: we'd play AI programming, not Pathfinder."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Beta Test for Pathfinder: Kingmaker Update 2.1 is now Live!", "update_content": "Pathfinders,\nIt is less than a month until the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker Definitive Edition for PC and consoles.

We are back with a new project: Panobook, a notebook for your desk, and eventually, your shelf. \nHere is Panobook, in a nutshell:\nThe unique panoramic format (160 mm x 288 mm) is designed to sit nicely on your desk, either in front of, behind, to next to your keyboard. \nEach page contains a subtle dot grid, with guide markers to help with layout. \nWe really sweated the details. All of the materials have a premium feel and are very nice. \nPanobooks are designed to be kept. Put it in the included slip case, annotate it if you want, and line a bunch up on the shelf.\nKeep scrolling to learn more!  \n  It all started with an insight about how we use notebooks. Even though we spend 8 hours a day doing digital work on a computer, notebooks are an essential analogue tool. We noticed, while sitting at a computer, it would be great to have a notebook directly in front of us. But that would require a different type of notebook, one with more of a panoramic ratio. So that\u2019s what we made.\nPanobook works great on a desk, either in front of, behind, or to the side of your keyboard. We wanted to create a notebook that was always open and always within arm's reach.\nIn using a prototype of the Panobook, we realized its unique format opened up some interesting creative possibilities. In landscape, it is fantastic for things like UI flows, storyboards, weekly calendars, Gantt charts, comic strips, level design, bullet journals, etc. Open up the notebook fully to get an even wider view. Rotate the notebook 90 degrees and you\u2019ve got a mini legal pad, great for list making, note taking, webpage layout, giraffe doodles, and more. We were surprised by how the unusual format seemed to get the creative juices flowing.\n        We designed the pages to help creative folks get their work done. Every page has a very subtle dot grid, with a twist. We\u2019ve included guide markers that make it easy to quickly draw three rectangles on the page, sized ideally for smartphone UI design or storyboarding. We also included edge guides to divide up the page and provide layout cues. The guides virtually disappear if you are not looking for them, but are very useful when you need them.\nEach page is 160 mm x 288 mm (6.3 in by 11.34 in) and the dots on the grid are spaced 5 mm apart.\nGuides for three 16:9 boxes.\n  Vertical and horizontal midpoint guides.\n  5 mm dot grid on a 288 mm x 160 mm sheet.\n  Being two fussy designers, we paid attention to every last detail in this notebook. The paper is super high quality, and performs well with a variety of writing instruments without smudging or bleeding. We consulted with several pen nerds and paper experts to help us find a fantastic paper, and we think we found it. It is Finch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb text, if you're curious. Each notebook contains 50 sheets / 100 pages.\nFinch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb.\nThe front and back covers are rigid, with an amazing soft touch feel. Panobook is bound with a robust wire-o binding, which allows the notebook to sit flat when opened. An insert in the front of the notebook contains a place for record keeping, as well as metric and imperial rulers and a type size reference. \nWe think you will appreciate all the care and attention to detail we put into this thing.\n  The front and back covers are rigid, with a slightly textured, soft touch feel.\n   The front insert.\n  Lastly, Panobook was designed to be kept. It comes with a slip case, which is meant to be the final resting place for your notebook. You can write on the spine to catalogue the notebook, and it looks awesome when you line several up on a shelf. We've noticed a tendency among designers to hang on to their old notebooks, and Panobook helps facilitate that. \nThere is a spot to write on the spine of the slip case for archival purposes.\n   The slipcase.\n  Panobooks lined up on a shelf.\n  We've wanted to make a notebook for a while now. We went in several different directions, but the \"ah-ha\" moment came when we started to consider how a notebook could be uniquely designed for desk use. We spent way too long fussing over materials and details of the notebook. Every last detail was considered, and we think you will be pleased with the end result. \nIf you want to learn more about the design process behind Panobook, be sure to listen to our podcast episode specifically about it! \nLots and lots of paper samples.\n  Printing projects such as this one are required to be paid in full to place an order, and are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold. We are on Kickstarter to gauge interest for Panobook, and see if it can gather enough pre-orders to make it a reality!

He's the award-winning composer of 'The Last Door', and other remarkable indie titles like 'Pharaonic' (by Milkstone), 'Six sides of the world' and 'Rotor'scope'.\nThis time around, he will be directing the work on both the Original Soundtrack and the audio design.\nListen to the first theme of the soundtrack:\nIf you don\u2019t know the works of Carlos Viola, we recommend you start by checking out his amazing work for \u2018The Last Door\u2019, available on Spotify.\n  We\u2019re a tiny development studio that focuses on creating meaningful playable experiences. We proudly specialize in delivering great games, despite operating with scarce resources. Maybe, you've heard about our previous work, a playable homage to classic horror writers (Lovecraft, Poe, & Machen):\n'The Last Door' is an award winning point and click horror adventure. It\u2019s a series of 8 playable episodes, developed using crowdfunding between 2013 and 2016. Initially, they were launched for browsers, but now you can enjoy them in their Collector\u2019s Editions for PC, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nOur previous title, \u2018The Last Door\u2019, was developed together with its community, with frequent discussion, beta builds, and incorporating community feedback in every possible way. For \u2018Blasphemous\u2019 we want to take this concept even further.\nWe offer our backers several levels of involvement with the project\u2019s development:\nThe Penitent (20 $) an up: We love transparency! Any pledge that includes the game will give you access to frequent development updates.\nThe Follower (25 $) and up: This pledge will grant access to a private development forum, where you will be frequently asked for feedback, participate in polls and help us with decision-making, plus access to the game's beta.\nThe Disciple (40 $), The Immortal (200 $) and up: you\u2019ll get access to our private channels on Slack/Discord, where all the design discussions will take place, one-on-one conversation with the development team, enjoy monthly (unfinished) builds and all future prototypes of the game.\n      The work on Blasphemous started in November 2016. The first stages involved the creation of the first bunch of concept art, to explore the artistic themes we wanted the game to feature. We\u2019ve been working non-stop since then, and indeed completed some key milestones along the way.\nWe are now preparing to switch from pre-production to production, and that\u2019s when we need you on board!\nWe\u2019re currently prototyping the second layer of gameplay, involving narrative and exploration mechanics. We're in the process of measuring the production scope and testing every required production pipeline. After that, we will confidently enter the production stage!\nFrom there, we have laid out a roadmap of frequent milestones (please note these dates are subject to change, although we are confident in our production dates):\nJune. 2017 - Aesthetics prototype (If the campaign succeeds, available for all backers, for Win/Mac/Linux!)\nSep. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Narrative prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nNov. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Player\u2019s progression prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ2, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Alpha (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ3, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Beta (The Follower pledge or above required).\nQ1, 2019 - All Platforms Global launch.\n                      So far, this project has been completely fueled by our own money. Bringing the game to Kickstarter now will enable us to get the extra funds we need to fully realize our artistic goals while retaining full creative control. For us, and particularly for Blasphemous, this is critical because of the potentially controversial topics we are featuring in the game.\nAt the same time, it creates a community around the game we can rely on to make the game truly awesome! While creating our previous game \u2018The Last Door\u2019, we experimented with opening the development process to the community. It was not only the most amazing experience, but it also helped the game become really extraordinary, reaching quality standards that we never hoped to achieve on our own, thanks to the collective intelligence.\nLet's make another game together!\nEngage the developers in our DISCORD server\nFollow us on Twitter:\n@BlasphemousGame\nFollow us on Fadebook:\nFacebook.com/BlasphemousGame\nOfficial website\nPresskit()\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you are about to embark on any project there will always be a certain amount of trepidation.

However, we are experienced developers, having successfully steered a three-year development project right before this one, so we feel confident we will know how to manage the unexpected.\n\nSome of the areas of expertise required for this project are beyond our skill set, particularly the ones related to porting the game to consoles, and the ones related to marketing. We will seek strategic partners to go where we cannot go on our own. \n\nFinally it\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the controversial and mature nature of some of the themes and visuals, we may have to prepare ourselves to fight a couple of battles against censorship, political correctness or etiquette here and there, but we\u2019re confident that if we have the support of you backers, we will be able to manage it in a way that it is satisfactory to most parties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Thankful", "descp": "Not sure if you'd want the game, but you still want to give a hand to the developers, be kept in the loop and receive the backer-exclusive campaign updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Penitent - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Be among the first backers to receive a 33% discount on The Penitent reward tier!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["499 backers", "Limited (1 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Penitent", "descp": "Get 'Blasphemous' the game when it's done!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["2,146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Follower", "descp": "Get the soundtrack, access to the Beta and have a significant impact in the game's final form by participating in development discussions and polls.

So far, the findings have been incredible.\nGravity uses the power of proprioceptive input (more commonly known as \u201cdeep touch pressure stimulation\u201d), a well regarded therapeutic method that stimulates pressure points on the body linked to improved sleep, mood, and relaxation.\nThe result is a reduction in cortisol levels and an increase in serotonin production, which decreases heart rate and blood pressure.\nEven hospitals use weighted blankets to calm patients' anxiety and promote deep, restful sleep. In a similar way to swaddling an infant, the weight and pressure on an adult provides near-instant comfort and relief.\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05\nhttp://www.somna.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pilot-study-of-a-sensory-room-in-an-acute-inpatient-psychiatric-unit.pdf\nGravity is designed to hug you back at night, closely mimicking how a parent swaddles their child while they sleep. But Gravity isn\u2019t just for sleep. It can be used while you\u2019re reading in bed, as you relax on your couch, or while you meditate.\nBest of all? Gravity is engineered with breathable materials, so you\u2019ll never be too hot underneath the covers.\nThe world around you is a stressful place. The barrage of news headlines. The incessant push notifications. The demands of your job. It\u2019s never been harder to turn your mind off, relax, and recharge.\nThe average American now spends 30 percent of their leisure time browsing the web, and 61% of us admit to being addicted to our devices.

As a result, we spend nearly two hours a day recovering from distractions.\nSleep loss, prolonged anxiety, and stress take a real toll on our lives\u2014they decrease productivity during the day and can lead to long-term health problems like diabetes, obesity, and even heart disease. \nWe know your anatomy is unique, which is why we\u2019ve engineered Gravity to meet your personal needs. This isn\u2019t a weighted blanket for everyone. It\u2019s a weighted blanket for you.\nWeighted blankets should be around 10% of your body weight, which is why we\u2019re offering 15, 20, and 25 pound options. Choose your preference (suggested based off of weight).\n But Gravity is more than the science that engineers it. From beautiful design to thoughtful materials sourcing, we set out to craft a product that looks and feels as great as it performs.\nTaking design cues from renderings of gravity planes, we used the same grid-like pattern to evenly distribute the crafted poly pellets to specifically target pressure points throughout your body.\nThe cover is made from a luxurious, ultra-soft micro plush fleece, and is easily removable for washing. The inner shell is made of 100% cotton.\nThe Weighted Filling\nGravity Blanket's weighted filling is a High Density Plastic Poly Pellet. The material is odorless, non-toxic, and food grade, making it perfectly suited for use in a blanket. They are dense to add weight, and soft to provide a nice texture to the Gravity Weighted Blanket. High Density Plastic Pellets are manufactured using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is extremely durable, non-toxic, washer / dryer safe, and pet and kid friendly.\nApril-May: Run Kickstarter \nMay-June: Kickstarter complete-Production begins \nJune-July: Production completed \nJuly-August: Product ships to our bi-coastal fulfillment houses \nSept-Oct: All Kickstarter rewards delivered just in time for fall!\nPLAY\n\nGravity is a health technology company dedicated to naturally improving physical and mental wellbeing through research-driven science.\nOver the past 12 months, we pored over medical research and studies about the effects of weighted blankets on serious conditions like autism, PTSD, and insomnia.\nFrom there, we set out to take this science and make a product that could help everyone. After much trial and error, we\u2019ve arrived at a prototype that people love.\nOur manufacturing partners are ready to go. All we need is your support so we can deliver stress relief to your door.\nMy whole life, I've been an entrepreneur. I'm obsessed with brands, customer experience and making the people in my life smile.\nMy career has been focused on bringing products to market; from pillows, to fragrances and handbags, and now, a blanket for sleep and relaxation.\nBefore creating Gravity, I founded a media company called The Good Ones, a product review site and web series where I test and try any and every brand I can get my hands on, and give honest recommendations to consumers.

We designed the Regatta Chronograph models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function but should naturally derive from it.  \n  Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over 5 years; with the Regatta Chronograph being our sixth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners. \nEvery component of the Regatta is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. Our watches are designed to be an heirloom, to be passed down to the next generation. \n    Quality leather is not only durable and hard wearing but it develops a beautiful and unique patina as it ages. We use buttery soft Italian calf leather for both the outside and the lining. After you wear it for a few days, the strap will conform to the shape of your wrist for a custom fit.\n5 models in the Regatta collection feature stainless steel mesh straps (also known as shark-proof straps). All versions are 100% waterproof and corrosion resistant. The adjustable clasps makes for a perfect fit.\nThe watch case is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The caseback is made of the same material. Water resistance is rated at 50m/165ft/5ATM.\nThe Regatta Chronograph collection showcases 3 different dials (black, white and navy), all with a classic, crisp design. The dials feature applied hour markers and a square date window at 3 o\u2019clock.\nChronographs have been used for centuries for maritime navigation. All Regatta models feature a quality quartz chronograph movement with a 4 min per year accuracy.\nIn addition to time and date, the watches feature 3 chronograph functions: elapsed time, accumulated elapsed time and split time, all with a 1 second accuracy.\nThe watches will be numbered and hand-assembled as a limited edition. Only 359 serialized watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international warranty card and a certificate of authenticity.\n    PLAY\n\n  Named after the Hamptons on the eastern tip of Long Island, world-famous summer playground for high society.

It superimposes an image of your subject onto your paper. You see your pencil and your subject at the same time. Trace what you see!\nBack on Kickstarter!\n In 2013, along with fellow Art Professor Golan Levin, I launched the NeoLucida project on Kickstarter. Our goal was to make this amazing\u2014but obsolete\u2014tool available again. We hoped there was a small group of art/tech/history nerds like us who might want to try a camera lucida, but couldn\u2019t afford a vintage one. To our surprise, over 11,000 (!) backers helped us make many more NeoLucidas than we ever planned. Most had never heard of a camera lucida; they just wanted to draw and the NeoLucida gave them an entry point. We scaled up production by bringing Kickstarter veterans Big I Design on board as manufacturing partners. We even won a prestigious Core77 Design Award along the way! There are now over 25,000 NeoLucidas helping people in 90 countries draw from real life. \n\"Um, this is hard!\"\nOne thing became clear from the feedback. People said, \u201cThis is harder than I thought!\u201d We said, \u201cWe know!\u201d After all, the original NeoLucida copied the prism design of vintage 19th century camera lucidas, which made sharp, clear images, but has a tiny viewing area. To us, it supported the idea that great artists of the past were still incredibly skilled; using a tool wasn't \"cheating.\" This was a provocative media archeology project: NeoLucida users could test what it was like to be an artist 200 years ago. \nBut thousands of people were just excited by using a tool that might make drawing a little less frustrating. Many people appreciated the art history story, but they just wanted to draw. Maybe they used to draw and gave up as a teenager. Maybe they never learned to draw but always wanted to. Many parents wanted to support their kids' creative impulses. The NeoLucida offered an accessible and inexpensive motivation to draw. \nI was inspired. Years of lecturing and running NeoLucida drawing workshops in a half-dozen countries gave me direct exposure with hundreds of aspiring artists. With all the feedback in mind, I went back to the drawing board. \nAfter two years of research and testing prototypes, the NeoLucida is back! People asked for a larger viewing area, but why stop there? The all new design has an extra large viewer to make drawing from life just a bit easier. Say hello to the NeoLucida XL.\n  First, A Little Art History.\nIf you wanted to make a realistic image in the days before photography was invented, you had to draw it.\nFor centuries, artists and inventors developed clever optical drawing instruments to assist with the difficult task of drawing from real life. Devices with mirrors, lenses, and prisms helped with the most challenging part of drawing: flattening a three-dimensional world into the two dimensions of your paper.\nPortrait of Mrs. John Mackie, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1816 (Photo by me while doing research at The Victoria & Albert Museum, London). Ingres' drawings are meticulous but tiny, leading some scholars to suggest Ingres used a camera lucida\nDrawing would be so much easier if you could hold up a piece of glass to your subject and trace its likeness directly onto the flat glass. Your page and your subject would be aligned; you wouldn't have to look away from your subject to see your drawing. Simple devices like the Sighting Grid did precisely this. Instead of glass, a grid of wires made a reference plane. \nSighting Grids by Robert Fludd (Left) (1617-21) and John Bate (right) (1634). The simplest of drawing instruments, the Sighting Grid provides a flat reference plane for translating the 3D world to the 2D page\nSighting Grids were accurate, but slow and cumbersome. As optical technology advanced from the early 17th century onwards, artists and inventors found ways to project images onto paper for tracing. The most advanced of these technologies was the camera lucida, invented by scientist Sir William Hyde Wollaston in 1807. A prism acts like a beam-splitter: part of your vision is directed towards your subject, part towards your paper. This overlap makes it possible to trace directly from real life. \nThe NeoLucida XL borrows from this tradition of simple, effective drawing instruments, but leveraging some modern technology to make a simple and inexpensive version of these ancient tools. \nWant a little more history and a look at the vintage tools that inspired the NeoLucida? Check out this chat and demo with Norman Chan of Adam Savage's Tested.com: \nHow does it work?\nThe main suggestion we got for the original NeoLucida was: \"Can't you just make the prism bigger?\" Actually, no. When you look into the prism, you look at the exposed edge of the prism. It doesn't matter how big the prism is, you still look at the edge. And as the prism gets bigger, the more the image shifts when you move your head. This is bad for tracing (trust me, we made and tried larger prisms. No good). To make the viewing area bigger, the NeoLucida would have to be completely redesigned. Ditch the prism and find other materials to create the ghost reflections.\nThe NeoLucida XL setup: Clamp to a table, position the viewer over your page with your subject in front of you.\nThe NeoLucida XL uses mirror and glass to combine a virtual ghost image of your subject and the real view of your hand. Setting it up is easy: \nClamp the NeoLucida XL to a table or sturdy drawing board. \nBend the adjustable gooseneck so that the viewer is facing your subject and positioned over your paper. \nLook straight down into the viewer to see your page and a ghost image of your subject superimposed. \nTrace what you see!\n  Part of your vision goes through the glass to your pencil. Simultaneously, part of your vision bounces off the glass, then the first-surface mirror, then out to your subject. The result is a ghost image on your page. \nLook down into the NeoLucida XL and a ghost image of your subject appears on top of your page.\nHere's an actual view through the NeoLucida XL. You can see your hand and your subject superimposed. This drawing only took 4 minutes, but proportion and perspective are rendered accurately. Tracing really works!\nNo matter your skill level, the NeoLucida XL helps you make more accurate drawings. Proportion\u2014the relationships between elements of your subject\u2014and perspective\u2014accurate rendering of space\u2014are laid out for you in the ghost image. You can even compose your scene before you draw so your subject fits on your paper the way you want it to. All of this means you can focus on the most important part of drawing: putting pencil to paper. Controlling a pencil to make beautiful lines takes practice. With the NeoLucida XL, you spend less time on laying out your drawing and more time drawing. \nSpecial Features\nThe basic elements in the NeoLucida XL are simple enough: A piece of glass and a mirror placed at a certain angle to each other. This arrangement is the same as it was in the early 19th century. After testing dozens of samples and prototypes, we've developed the NeoLucida XL to be the best version of the glass-and-mirror camera lucida ever made. \nGlass and Mirror. The quality of the glass and the mirror are key to make the camera lucida ghost image as sharp and clear as possible. The mirror we use is a First Surface mirror. Typical mirror is made with a reflective surface applied to the rear of a piece of glass. This is how most commercial mirrors are made. Because the light travels through the glass to get to the mirror, there are additional reflections from the glass surface and tiny distortions from scattering light. This isn't usually a problem for your bathroom mirror, since the mirror is thin and you're not standing that close to it. But if you want a precise reflection with your eye up close to it, you need a sharp reflection. Usually used in scientific applications, a first surface mirror has only one surface reflecting light rays. One surface exposed, one crisp reflection. \nTypical mirror (left) has a reflective surface on the rear face of the glass. This causes minor distortions and soft reflections as light bounces and scatters between reflective layers.\nPortability. Making the NeoLucida viewer larger makes drawing easier, but it also makes the device bulkier. To make the NeoLucida XL as portable as the original NeoLucida, the glass-and-mirror viewer neatly folds into a flat package. Slide it into the custom pouch provided, and toss it in your bag with your art supplies. Easy! The folding action also protects the glass and mirror inside a sandwich of hard plastic to keep the delicate optics safe while in transit. \nThe NeoLucida folds up for easy storage.\n  At just 10 ounces and slim in profile, the NeoLucida XL fits in the handy custom pouch provided. Easy to toss in your bag!\n  When folded, the NeoLucida XL is only 1 inch at its thickest. Compact!\nLegacy Support. The NeoLucida XL is an all new optical design, but it uses the same adjustable gooseneck from the original NeoLucida. If you have the original NeoLucida, you can swap viewers between the gooseneck stands. Save space! Carry both NeoLucida viewers but only one clamp!\nLighting Control. The NeoLucida XL comes with a removable shader to help balance the lighting. It's like custom sunglasses for your NeoLucida! Is the page too bright to see the ghost image?

At 8 and 4 years old, the NeoLucida's requirements of precise eye placement with a tiny prism made it frustrating to them. The NeoLucida XL isn't a toy, but it was made with kids in mind. I've tested it with kids and found that, depending on the skill level, children as young as 6 and 7 can draw with the NeoLucida XL! \nThat's my 8-year-old daughter using the NeoLucida XL to draw her favorite teddy bear. Fun!\nAlmost every child draws. But many give up in their teenage years when drawing skills don't seem to improve. Practicing with tools like the NeoLucida XL to advance skills can help keep kids drawing into adulthood. \nBacked by Primary Research\nThe NeoLucida XL isn't just a product, it's the result of years of primary research. As an art professor, the NeoLucida is part of a decade of research into the relationship between technology and art history. I have one of the most complete camera lucida collections in the world, and have used this personal collection to reverse engineer both the original NeoLucida and the NeoLucida XL. \nOne idea, a century apart. The Magic Art Reproducer (left) from 1952 and A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (right) from 1840 both use angled glass and a mirror to create the ghost image.\nThe glass-and-mirror design is inspired by several different historical designs. The desire to draw more accurately from life is an old one; 19th century finely crafted brass devices and mid-20th century toys all responded to demand from aspiring artists. \nVintage glass-and-mirror camera lucidas from my personal collection provided primary research for developing the NeoLucida XL. At left, the 1952 Magic Art Reproducer. Center, A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (1840).\n  Two years of NeoLucida workshops gave me first-hand experience with users. Clockwise from top left: Demo at Open Hardware Summit, MIT; Manifest Drawing Center, Cincinnati; Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Aspen; Children's Camp, Valdai, Russia.\nRewards\n(Prices include WORLDWIDE shipping!)\nLet's get drawing!\nWho's behind this? \nI'm Pablo Garcia, Associate Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and the history of drawing and technology is my life. I've spent a decade researching historical and contemporary drawing techniques and tools. I have over 30 different camera lucidas spanning 200 years, making it one of the largest and most complete private collections of its kind in the world. I also run drawingmachines.org, a growing archive reference site covering 600 years of drawing technology. With Golan Levin, I made the award-winning NeoLucida in 2013, earning over $424,000 from 11,406 backers in our first-ever Kickstarter. I also exhibit art and lecture about art, design, and technology. Find out more here. Or tweet me!\nManufacturing partner Big Idea Design is Chadwick Parker and Joe Huang. Veterans of 21 Kickstarter campaigns, Big Idea Design has earned over $1.4 million from their high-quality titanium pens and clever tool designs. As manufacturing partners for the original NeoLucida, Big Idea Design helped us scale from a few hundred planned units to tens of thousands after our Kickstarter went viral. \nWant to keep up with NeoLucida?

We've got our manufacturing process down, and I have been to China several times to oversee production. So are we confident that the NeoLucida XL will be delivered as promised? Yes. But there are some new challenges we have our eyes on: \n\n\u2022 The new NeoLucida XL has some moving parts the original NeoLucida didn't have. When we get to producing molds there is a chance that parts don't fit or move smoothly. We have a plan to do final prototype modeling before we invest in the injection molds, but if there are problems, there's a chance for a delay if we need to make new molds. \n\n\u2022 The glass and mirror are thin and very precisely cut to be as flat as possible. This gives the truest image for tracing. We have planned for a higher-than-usual spoilage rate before we assemble the NeoLucida XL to account for possible irregularities and damage as we produce and package the NeoLucida XL.\n\nBut our team is battle-tested and have been manufacturing high-quality NeoLucidas together for three years.

The Kickstarter was a major success for us, reaching our stretch goal of $11,000. The EP came out in February of 2013, and was followed by shows and touring in the U.S., as well as appearances in the UK and Germany. It was a blast.\nFor quite some time now (years, actually), many of you have been asking when we would be doing a new album.

There are a few pieces of gear we want to add to our studio rig to make the recording better, and we're currently looking at a few different engineers to mix the album.

( messing up our plans for the year, which were meant to build on these shows) and, as bad news tends to come in threes, we got the news that our building is going on the market to be sold, and will

Another significant development is that Zone Zero (our studio) has moved location; we have moved from a 20\u2019 X 12\u2019 rehearsal space to a full scale, purpose-built recording studio (pictures below). The space is awesome, but has required a fair bit of work and TLC to get it up to spec, so this has been another major time suck of late."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 20, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/303880739/the-bellwether-syndicate-new-album-project", "project_name": "The Bellwether Syndicate \u2022 New Album Project"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We have taken everything we've learned from the award-winning original Roadie Tuner and upgraded it in every way imaginable. \nDid you miss out on this Kickstarter campaign?

Touring musicians spend vital minutes during sets to manually switch their instrument from one complicated tuning to the next. No matter your experience level, tuning can be a chore and take time away from playing.\nRoadie 2 is an automatic string tuner that is quick, easy to use, and three times more accurate than the human ear.\nIt\u2019s fully standalone and uses vibration detection to tune in even the noisiest of environments. Roadie 2 is compatible with any string instrument with a guitar machine head including 6-7-12 string guitars, ukuleles, mandolin, banjo and many more. When using Roadie Bass, its new more powerful motor allows you to tune Bass guitars as well.\nRoadie 2 adds new dimensions to music-making by allowing you to freely experiment with known alternate tunings as well as save custom alternate tunings that you find yourself.\nRoadie got its start on Kickstarter thanks to the tremendous support of our backers.

The company was founded by Hassane Slaibi and Bassam Jalgha. They decided to combine their passions for music and tech by developing the company\u2019s first product, Roadie Tuner, in 2013. Roadie garnered worldwide attention and accolades including the TechCrunch Disrupt 2014 Audience Choice Award.

You're invited to press play on this beautiful, immersive track from the Banner Saga soundtrack, and let it bring you into the world while you browse the page.\n \nWHAT\u2019S THIS THEY SAY?  \n\u201cFrom epic backgrounds to hand-drawn animation, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful game series on the planet.\u201d - Kotaku \n\u201cThe Banner Saga franchise feels like a nerd\u2019s dream. Essentially the marriage between Game of Thrones, XCOM and Oregon Trail.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201c...a stunningly beautiful and uber entertaining RPG/adventure experience. Artistic values are through the roof, likewise the game mechanics that are perfectly crafted to offer interesting choices and great tactical entertainment.\u201d - Eurogamer\n\u201cThe combination of gameplay, character building, strategy, and narrative highlights the power games have in telling stories, and that experience is uniquely Banner Saga.\u201d - Polygon\n    WHAT\u2019S ALL THIS ABOUT MORE BANNERS AND SAGAS?  \nBanner Saga 3 is the highly anticipated final game of an award winning trilogy. It's a role-playing game merged with turn-based strategy, wrapped into an adventure mini-series about Vikings.  \nMany modern games play it safe \u2013 you are the chosen one who always saves the day. Our game is different, you can\u2019t take anything for granted in Banner Saga.\n\nPicture the classic tactical strategy games of your childhood but refined for the modern age. It's not about grinding to get past the next fight. Every encounter, every decision you make has heavy and sometimes far-reaching consequences. It throws you into the end of the world and asks,\"how do you deal with this\"?  \nBanner Saga 3 is aimed at people who appreciate art, story and strategy.\nBattles in Banner Saga are turn-based, harkening back to the classic \"Tactics\" days of gaming. The combat is straight-forward and easy to learn, but after a few battles you'll realize the game's simplicity hides a vast tactical depth. Each turn is an engrossing challenge for even the most seasoned tactician.   \nBuild your party from a roster of over 40 unique characters, each with different abilities that interact in varying ways. Each unit has a combat style all their own, but it\u2019s how they work together that counts and a well-chosen roster will equal more than the sum of its parts.\nBanner Saga combat has a classic turn-based gameplay, with a strong emphasis on tactics over brute force and endless grinding. \nBanner Saga draws heavily from Norse culture and mythology while creating its own identity. There is a low-fantasy approach to Viking themes. Giants - yes. Horned helmets - no.  \nThe choices you make as events unfold have a huge effect on how the story plays out - who survives, who dies, and what's worth saving. Add people to your caravan as you travel, or lose them when tough decisions arise. You're not just fighting to save nameless strangers, you're fighting for your neighbors, your family and your way of life. You\u2019ll care what happens to them.  \nBanner Saga 3 is a mature story for adults, which means forming relationships and making tough decisions; not sex, violence and swearing.\nTravel through stunning landscapes that evoke films from the golden age of animation. Sweeping vistas straight out of a Norse saga will accompany an emerging storyline and pin the imagination squarely in the realm of a Wagnerian Opera. \nThe Darkness plays a major role in Banner Saga 3 and your exploration of it will be unlike anything you have experienced in the previous sagas. Interact with the vast city of Arberrang and travel its streets. The gods may be dead, but their godstones and their world, remain full of wonder.  \nEvery scene in the game is painstakingly hand painted with the intent of transporting you into a bleak yet beautiful world.\nAs the heroes gain experience in battle you can modify their stats, gain extra abilities, equip mystical items, choose Heroic Titles and more!    \nIndividually, heroes can be strong, but as the game evolves you\u2019ll devise new strategies on how they work as a warband. Playing off each other's strengths will turn what seems like a rout into a great victory. In camp, rebalance each hero to fit your evolving team dynamic.\nMost combat animations are done using rotoscoped, frame-by-frame video shot in Arnie\u2019s front yard. Each \u2018hit animation\u2019 may take 20 to 30 shots to get right and each \u2018death animation\u2019... well, pummeling the heck out of each other to make every action in the game look authentic. Our friends at Powerhouse Animation then take all the raw footage and add even more drama to the action. The cinemas are all done in 2D and drawn by hand using good old-fashioned traditional animation techniques. It all comes together to give the effect of playing a film from the golden age of animation. \nWe started this game old-school and, by Dundr\u2019s beard, we\u2019ll end it old-school.\nOKAY, TELL ME SOMETHING I DON\u2019T KNOW \nBanner Saga 1 threw you into a deep, strange world where the gods were dead. The sun had stopped. A colossal serpent leveled mountains, searching for answers hidden in an ancient language as darkness roiled on the horizon. You guided your flock against overwhelming odds, to protect the ones you loved. How did you fare as the world began its end?  \nBanner Saga 2 remembered your deeds, both wise and foolish. Calamity tested your leadership. Friends became enemies and enemies, allies. You walked in deep places, and glimpsed places deeper still. Always one more hill to crest. Did you endure to the great city of Arberrang? Were you welcomed or feared within its black wall while the world outside was breaking?  \nBanner Saga 3 concludes the tale. Steel your nerves, step forth into the approaching abyss. Cross the threshold from daylight without end into untold darkness. Warped lands within threaten your sanity, and a writhing wyrm tests your mettle. But here, in the darkness, is where secrets are brought to light and motives are made clear. Are your friends who they claim to be? They all look to you. What story will your banner tell?\n    BEHOLD, THE LOOT  \nA sincere \u201cThank You\u201d for the support of this project, we really hope you enjoy the rewards! Scroll down to see everything we have to offer and please visit our Kickstarter FAQ below for more details.\n                           WHO ARE YOU, TO PROMISE SUCH THINGS AGAIN?\n    LET'S DO THIS RIGHT     \nMaking games is an intricate business, and we take it very seriously. Stoic formed in 2012 with the launch of the Kickstarter for Banner Saga, and a humble ask of $100,000. We were blown away by the response and support of the community who raised more than $700,000! That first Kickstarter campaign helped us launch the game, develop and launch the sequel, and accrue many awards in the process. Putting all the money we raised back into the development of the game raised the bar higher than we could have managed on our own.  \nNow we\u2019re back, in a similar position as before, hoping you\u2019ll support Banner Saga 3 to make this game just as special. We\u2019re still solidly indie, not accepting any investor funding so Kickstarter is still a great way to rally the community to show support for the game, while letting us call the shots on the games we make. We\u2019re paying for most of the game ourselves, but the funds we\u2019re asking for will enable us to take the time we need and bring the band back together one more time!\nEveryone that has played Banner Saga knows how important the score is to the emotion and mood of the game. This world renowned composer has been with us from the start and will be with us to the end, but he\u2019s fighting battles to make our current budget work. Let's give him the means to make it everything he knows it should be!  \nThis animation crew is truly the power behind the cinematic look of Banner Saga, we could not do this without them. How many new heroes, new boss enemies and new cut-scenes can we add for Banner Saga 3? A lot more with your help. \nDuring the first Kickstarter we recieved a long letter from this award winning sound design studio explaining these crazy wonderful ideas they had for such things as the flapping of a banner during travel scenes. We knew you needed them, now they need you. New sounds mean new experiences for the player, but new sounds need funding.\nWhere do you go to find voices that sound like Vikings? You go to Iceland. They thought we were crazy when we approached them to do a video game, but here we are 5 years later and these vikings have become our trusted allies. Please help us bring them back...or you\u2019ll have John\u2019s southern drawl to contend with.\nWe began the saga with a clear vision of where it would go, and it has become something far better than that. We have the utmost confidence that, with your help, we can bring it all together for a conclusion both profound and rewarding.\nWill you lend us your axe?\nWe\u2019re going to make every effort to produce a game for you that's deep, meaningful and makes us proud. Feel free to check out the latest Saga news by signing up for our Newsletter, keep in touch with us at www.bannersaga.com, follow us on Twitter, and Like us on Facebook.\nAlso, a huge appreciative thanks to our families and friends for putting up with, and even supporting, this insane multi-year endeavor. We love you and will come to dinner soon.\nImportant note about shipping\nShipping will be charged after the campaign ends, at the time of fulfillment and is not included in the pledge amount. Please be prepared to pay shipping costs when we verify your address right before we send out the rewards. This is done so we do not over- or under-charge, as shipping costs fluctuate over time.

Classic Metroidvania elements such as backtracking, secrets and unlocking new abilities that open new regions are at the core of the exploration experience.\nFight.\nConfront hordes of dynamically spawned eldritch monsters. Put your skills and reflexes to the test through furious melee combat and epic boss fights against uniquely designed enemies. All monster spawns are dynamic, constantly keeping you on your toes.\nDie.\nDesigned as a challenging adventure for seasoned gamers, frequent deaths are part of the Sundered experience. But taking our inspiration from our favorite rogue-like games, death in Sundered is only the beginning.\nUpgrade.\nWhen you die, you respawn in the Hub, where you level up and customize your character. Equip and upgrade a host of unique Perks, stats and special Abilities hidden throughout the world.\nAll the skills!\n  We announced the game with our marketing partner, Sony, at the end of September 2016:\nThe trailer received wide-spread praise and showed that there was definite interest for the game!\n  Sundered simply wouldn\u2019t be a Thunder Lotus game if we didn\u2019t have larger-than-life boss fights. There are six massive boss fights in the game, each providing epic confrontations that truly test your mastery of the game.\nWakey, wakey!\n  Sundered\u2019s tag line, \"Resist or Embrace\" is key to the experience. The Metroid-style abilities you find in the Shrines can be corrupted, but at a cost.\nSmash attack > Corrupted smash attack!\nAfter defeating a boss, you receive an Elder Shard. You can choose to bring this special relic to a Skill Shrine on the world to corrupt a specific Ability. A Corrupted Ability is a much more powerful version of the same gameplay mechanic, but it comes at a cost to your humanity.  \nThe tragedy of Eshe's gradual, voluntary corruption is eloquently illustrated in our second trailer, Embrace:\nThere are seven major abilities in the game, each corruptible into a more powerful eldritch version:  \nShield \nDouble Jump \nGun \nDash \nSmash \nHook Shot \nWall Run \nUltimately, corrupting your abilities has important gameplay repercussions and even changes the game's ending, as how corrupted you are defines which boss you'll face.\nSundered tells the story of the mysterious Terror, a cataclysmic event that causes the undoing of society and plunges the world into madness. You play Eshe, a scavenger who becomes trapped in a strange sandstorm which drags her into a mysterious cavern. You have stumbled upon the source of power that led to the world\u2019s destruction centuries ago. \nA derelict shrine hides massive power.\nThe backstory tells the tale of how this strange power attracted the Valkyries, an armed group of scientific revolutionaries, and the Eschaton, mad cultists following the teachings of an obscure god, to this place. As she picks up the pieces, the player uncovers the conflict that sundered the world. \nThe choice is yours...\n  We want the monsters in Sundered to be unpredictable, for you to feel like madness is just around the corner. To achieve this, all the monster spawns are dynamic.\nSlashing through a horde.\nLike in Left 4 Dead, the monsters spawn based on a number of factors (time, difficulty level, current region). This creates hordes of eldritch horrors that lurk within the shadows, waiting for the player to fall into their trap.\nRun, Eshe, Run!\n  When we announced Sundered, many players argued that a Metroidvania could not be procedural. We respectfully disagree. Though the overall structure of the world is set in stone, sub-sections (the green and grey squares on the map below) are procedurally generated every time you die. This allows us to make design choices which are core to a Metroidvania experience, like backtracking and unlocking new abilities that unlock new sub-sections, while keeping the experience fresh.\nThe structure of the world stays the same. Purple, red and blue rooms are always there.\nSub-sections in action:\nThis adds a multiplicative layer of uncertainty, since the layer of randomness of the dungeon gets added over the random monster spawns. The final game will have three unique regions, each with a multitude of monsters, secrets and challenges.\nSundered builds on Jotun's foundation and maximizes our team\u2019s visual talent through our signature hand-drawn art style, creative characters and impressive vistas. \n  A selection of concept sketches\n  As with our previous game, immersion is key to the experience and having an original soundtrack composed by Max LL is essential to the player experience.\nFor sound design, we'll be working with the amazing Pixel Audio team who worked with us on Jotun.\n  Back in 2014, with the generous help of many friends, we put together a Kickstarter campaign with very few resources. And thanks to our amazing backers, we were able to make a great game: Jotun. \nOur award winning hand-drawn Viking game!\nJotun was a critical and commercial success. We are proud to say we released Jotun on time and on budget, while still releasing an award-winning game. We learned so much during the process and are already applying it to Sundered!\n  We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to put the game in your hands and make it the best it can be. We know how important feedback is and Jotun\u2019s alpha and beta backers transformed the game into something special. We need you to tell us what we can do better. It's about polish, feedback and using Kickstarter funds to make Sundered the best it can be.\nHere is a sampling of things we want to improve with your help:\nOverall balancing and pacing\nSpecial nodes for the Skill Tree\nDifferent ideas for Perks\nWhat exactly defines the core gameplay experience and how we can improve it\nThis also explains why anyone backing at the $15 or higher tier will get an automatic invite to Sundered's Beta. Yes, we want your feedback, but we also need the money for development time to implement that feedback. The July release date reflects this extended timeline.\nWe've been hard at work on Sundered for just over a year. All the money we raise during Kickstarter will be invested in the game's production, which will allow us to extend the game's production until June, for a July release.\nSundered's total development budget is $700,000 CAD, coming from Jotun revenues and a loan from the Canadian Media Fund (the same entity who helped fund Jotun). Sony is acting as our marketing partner (which explains why we are only releasing on PC and PS4 for now), but is not funding the game.\nHere is how we're breaking down the months until release:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays are one of the biggest issues in game development. Bringing so many different aspects together in an innovative product necessarily brings its own set of challenges. With Sundered, the complexity and amount of systems we're bringing together can cause our heads to spin, requiring a ton of balancing and polish. The amount of feedback we get from you guys can also impact our timeline, as we want to make sure that our backers are happy with the game before we ship it to the masses.\n\nThis leads into the other major risk: game quality. Most people making a game are trying their best to make a great game. No one enters this industry while thinking \"Let's make some very average games that not too many people will like\". There is always the risk that the game doesn't turn out as good as you hoped it would. However, we are 100% focused on delivering an amazing gameplay experience, building on what worked and didn't work with Jotun. We also believe that with your help in alpha and beta, we'll be able to mitigate most design/fun issues and polish the game until it is great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Sundered Advocate", "descp": "The heartfelt gratitude we feel towards our more frugal well-wishers will shine through every lovingly crafted pixel of their exclusive Sundered digital wallpaper!\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks!\nKickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "Sundered Core", "descp": "A digital copy of Sundered on Steam, PS4, or GOG (Windows, Mac or Linux), plus access to the exclusive beta test version of the game!\nINCLUDES:\nSundered Digital Copy (Steam, PS4 or GOG)\nClosed Beta access\nAll previous rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["2,190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 30 or more", "title": "Corrupted Core", "descp": "Enjoy Sundered's haunting digital soundtrack!

See this update on Kickstarter for details on the stretch goal and a new feature called Safe Replies.\nHi, my name is Manton Reece, and I\u2019m writing a book called Indie Microblogging. I'm also launching a brand new platform for microblogs.\nDo you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?\nIn the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren\u2019t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.\nToday, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can\u2019t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.\nI want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.\nI first set out to build a new service just for microblogs. It has a timeline experience like a social network, with replies and favorites, but it\u2019s based on RSS, with the main posts pulled from independent sites.\nIf you don\u2019t have a microblog yet, there\u2019s a full publishing interface with Markdown support and a native iPhone app. I call it Micro.blog.\nThe second thing I\u2019m doing is writing a book and I\u2019d love your support for it on Kickstarter. This short book will make the case for microblogging and show you how to participate in the growing community of writers who own even their short-form writing.\nSome of the topics:\nHow to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with microblogs.\nThe important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out there.\nTips for integrating your microblog into an existing full weblog.\nThe architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how I built Micro.blog.\nOverview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.\nPlus my own personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve our content on the internet.\nYou\u2019ll get the book itself and early access to Micro.blog so you can reserve your username. Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.\nI love real books, too, so I\u2019m even doing a limited run of print copies of the book in addition to the standard e-book. There are also rewards with Micro.blog stickers and more.\nOver the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles to my blog about independent microblogging and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing \u2014 as well as brand new essays and technical topics \u2014 to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into it.\nThere's a growing community and movement around independent microblogging. With your support, we can take back the future of the web from closed platforms and silos, and leave our own mark on the web. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting a book \u2014 even a short one like Indie Microblogging \u2014 is a lot of work.

More than just a coffee maker, it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. Designed with equal elements of function and form, the Arctic is sleek, elegant, and makes amazing tasting cold brew. It\u2019s simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine - no professional barista experience necessary. Great coffee awaits.\nThe best-kept secret in the coffee world has been brewing for centuries. Cold brew coffee was invented in Japan during the 1600s, recently popularized by upscale coffee shops, and perfected for making at home with the Arctic.\nIf you haven\u2019t tried cold brew yet, you\u2019re missing out. The flavor is delightfully smooth compared to the taste of your usual cup, and it packs more than enough of a caffeinated kick to get you going in the morning. \nSkip your morning trip to the coffee shop and save time and money during your morning routine.\nEverything we\u2019ve learned about cold brew coffee has been put into the Arctic. After discovering something so great, we couldn\u2019t help but share it.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a professional barista to make your own cold brew. The Arctic is specifically designed to make brewing easy at home.\nSo what is cold brew? It\u2019s a way of brewing coffee in cold water rather than the traditional method of using hot water. Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it a few advantages over your typical cup of coffee. For one, it tastes a lot smoother. The familiar bite of hot brewed coffee is caused by fatty acids, which are left behind during the cold brewing process. This means it\u2019s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well.\nAfter brewing coffee grounds in cold water for a set amount of time (more on the ideal schedule later) you\u2019re left with a tasty cold brew.\nYour brew can be used as a base for many different drinks: hot, cold, iced, or in a shake! The versatility of cold brew is a true game-changer in how you consume your daily dose of coffee.\nPlus, with the Arctic, you can brew up an entire batch of cold brew at once to store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. \nThere are a million reasons to love cold brew coffee made by the Arctic. But for starters, here are the main benefits we think you should know about:\n                                                                                The Arctic is incredibly easy to use. Here's our preferred cold brew method to get you started.\nRemember, you\u2019re in control of the brewing process from start to finish! If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee. \n As part of your daily life, we knew the Arctic had to be designed with equal elements of function and form. What we came up with was something sleek, and simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine.\nThe carafe is made of 100% borosilicate glass and has a capacity of 50.7 oz (1.5L) to hold enough cold brew for 1-2 weeks. The Micron Filter is laser cut with tiny holes, 200 microns in diameter, to keep coffee grounds from leeching into your brew. Each feature was chosen to enhance the entire coffee-making process, from the simplicity of brewing to enjoying the smooth taste in every cup. \nYour favorite cup of coffee should be as unique as you are. The choice is yours in how little or how much you want to customize! If you\u2019re someone who is very particular about your coffee, you\u2019re going to love making cold brew with the Arctic. From fine-tuning the brewing process itself to choosing which beverage to make with your finished cold brew, the Arctic makes it easy to experiment and find out what works best for you. The possibilities are nearly endless with the Arctic.\nOne of the great benefits of the Arctic is how customizable each brew can be. For all you coffee connoisseurs out there, you\u2019re able to control not just the bean type or roast level, but also the brew time and water-to-coffee ratio. This affects the taste, aroma, and caffeine level, so you\u2019re in complete control to adjust these levels to your liking and make your ideal brew each time. If you prefer to keep things simple, find out what works for you and stick to it.\n  If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee.\nOnce you\u2019ve made a batch of cold brew with the Arctic, you can use it as a base in a variety of coffee beverages. Not only can you serve it as hot coffee, over ice, or with cream or milk, but there are also plenty of ways to think outside the mug. Try it in a smoothie or milkshake, over ice cream, mixed with your favorite spirit, or even use it to bake with! Any coffee lover will surely have no shortage of creative ways to incorporate cold brew into drinks and desserts. Here\u2019s a few of our favorite recipes:\nThe journey for developing the Arctic was a process that was driven by our love and passion for coffee. And, of course, it was fuelled by coffee, too. Our goal was simple: bring to life an awesome cold brew system we would be proud to use ourselves and share with our friends. We envisioned it would be functional and an attractive conversation piece. Take a closer look at our journey with the Arctic!\nThe Arctic isn\u2019t just a coffee maker\u2014it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. If you\u2019re like us, you need coffee in the morning and it needs to be well-made. Cold brew made with the Arctic simply tastes better than regular coffee: it\u2019s smoother, more flavorful, and has less bite. The Arctic can save you money by avoiding those daily trips to the coffee shop, and save you time by brewing big batches at once that can last up to 2 weeks.  \nYou\u2019re going to love the versatility that the Arctic provides, which lets you adjust both the brewing process and your beverage of choice as well. Say hello to hot coffee, iced coffee, shakes, and anything else your imagination can dream up for cold brew. Best of all, the Arctic itself is a prime example of when beautiful design is masterfully executed. Because when all your guests compliment you on serving them the best coffee they\u2019ve ever had, you\u2019ll be proud to show them the Arctic.                                         \nYour pledge will not only help us bring the Arctic to life, it will help us build our brand and take our business to the next level. We thank you for believing in us.\nJoin the movement now and make a pledge to get your very own Arctic. Great coffee awaits.\nAs of December 5th 2016, we successfully reached our $75,000 stretch goal. A huge thanks to all of our backers for your support.

As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter.\nShipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.\nEstimated Delivery: Once production is complete on all of the orders, we will provide updates for shipping dates. As you know with international shipping there can be unpredictable delays that are out of our control, however, we will do our absolute best to ship based on the predicted time frame.\nOur team is made up of friends and colleagues, all of which have one major thing in common: we\u2019re 90% powered by caffeine. Which is why we thought it was so fitting to collectively put our energy into making an amazing home coffee system.\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot from day one on our long journey of developing the Arctic. We\u2019re proud to share our creation with the world and appreciate all the interest that we\u2019ve been shown by our supporters.\nBecause no matter how we spend our days, we all start them the same.

I'll collect this info in the survey (sorry USA address only for this option)\nWhat can The Weatherneck System do for you:\n  Mullet Hat + Face Mask = The Weatherneck System\nDesigned strictly for purpose:\nRemoves with one-hand in one-second \u2013 powerful neodymium magnets make the system secure but quickly removable\nSize adjustable \u2013 Three metal tabs stitched into the back of the hat allow for small, medium and large sizing options\nBreath in and out at any pace \u2013 a mesh center section gives protection where you want and ventilation when you need it  \nExcellent coverage, where it matters most - your ears, face and neck\nRUNNER?\nPLAY\n\nQuick running review now that its cold out!\nMullet?\nClearly the mulleted among us are on to something!\nMy problem; solved.\nFor me, the idea of stopping and wrestling a piece of fabric over my head/helmet was not attractive. So unattractive in fact, that I didn\u2019t bother starting with a neck/face mask even though I really wanted to be wearing one. Sometimes you just don't have the chance to stop and adjust clothing. Now you can have the best of both worlds by backing this campaign right now. \nConstructed from highly technical, USA made, fabrics with a unique mesh design that reduces fogging and keeps you warm, without bulk, by wicking moisture from your skin. The Weatherneck System is professionally sewn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by seasoned experts.\nHigh performance without bulk\n      Loose around the neck is how I wear it about 90% of the time\nA version of this launched last season, what\u2019s different? \nThe original design was just the bandana, but after getting feedback from our backers it was clear more was needed to solve the problems. I am now absolutely convinced the two part system represents the right solution for all types of users.\nRetro compatible? Yes.\nThe original Weatherneck works perfectly with the Mullet Hat. If you have a previous face mask you just need the hat and you're good to go! \nTop 5 Improvements The Weatherneck System provides: \n1. A magnetic connection keeps the face mask high and secure \n2. Steel tabs in the hat simplify the re-sizing process\n3. The Mullet Hat completely covers the neck and ears\n4. Higher airflow mesh material massively reduces fogging \n5. The face mask is 2 inches longer allowing it to rest more comfortably and tuck in easier\nAdding 2 inches in length made a HUGE difference!\nNot always obvious. \nSurprise! We incorporated a secret hidden pocket in the Mullet Hat (thanks DJ)! It\u2019s a great place to store a hand warmer, ID, credit card or anything else you want to be your little secret. \nA secret Mullet Pocket for hand-warmers or whatever else. What will you put in there?\n100% black - I dyed the fabric black all the way through front and back. Dyed fabric performs better at wicking moisture than sublimated fabrics. Also some organizations require head gear to be uniform in color. We have complied by popular request.\nBehold all the color options!\nIt\u2019s one-size but with multiple options - The system makes resizing super simple. Using 3 settings, it fits roughly from 46cm to 61cm comfortably.\n3 steel tabs across the back of the hat allow 3 size options\nIt's safe - Do you or your team work around machinery? The Weatherneck System allows the face mask to pop right off in case it gets caught in something. You won\u2019t get choked, so there\u2019s that\u2026which is nice. \nNo Velcro - There are a few reasons I avoided it: it's loud, it screws up other gear in the wash and it fails to function when iced or dirty.\nIt's made from yoga pants material - Yes! It blocks just enough wind and provides just enough insulation to get the job done without adding bulk and it is insanely comfortable.\nCan I wash and dry it? Use the washer but I recommend air drying both pieces.\nFinally, it is a tactical advantage: \nIt\u2019s quiet (NO VELCRO) - Using magnets makes this the only tactical breakaway balaclava. Getting hot out there but you\u2019re in a noise sensitive environment? No problem. Put it on and take it off in silence. \nWho should buy The Weatherneck?\nsnow, moto, cycle and tactical (no bank robbers!)\nPlease donate a SHARE to my project even if you can't back it right now.\nREVIEWS SO FAR (added as they come in):\nthemtblab.com\nBikeRumor.com\nCyclingtips.com (about crowdfunded cycling projects in general)\nPodcast: on Cyclingtips.com\nPodcast: on Midwest Cycling Podcast\nITS Tactical (video review)\nPaceline Podcast (we're Fatty's pick this week 40 minutes in)\nPeloton Magazine\nBikeRadar\nEngearment\n  I am planning on placing the first order prior to the end of the campaign so we can start shipping BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

The fabrics are already ordered. The magnets are in hand, the steel tabs for the hat are easily obtainable from numerous suppliers. My sewing supplier is more than up for the challenge and all our design changes are behind us.\n\nI do have 1 alternative sewing resource if the current supplier has issues. My supplier makes product in Milwaukee for some very large brands. My project doesn't appear to be too challenging for them.\n\nI'll take no chances on quality. I'll be performing spot inspections as production starts and my cut/sew vendor is committing to a regular QA process themselves. I believe the product is in great shape. I'm further along than any of my previous campaigns and all those delivered on time. But products can always be improved. What would you do differently? Pledge to back the project then let me know your thoughts (comments are welcome).\n\nI am planning on making my first order prior to the end of the campaign so we can start shipping BEFORE CHRISTMAS.\n\nRegarding INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - The fee I collect is only for shipping, it does NOT cover ANY taxes or fees charged by your country. Please re-read that if you're confused.\n\nA word on magnets...\n\nNeodymium magnets are STRONG. These are sewn in place, but they can escape. If that happens throw dispose of them immediately.\n\nLearn more about magnets here: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5548a3.htm\n\nThe magnetic fields of these Neodymium magnets can effect pace-makers or other bodily implants, don't use if you have metal plates in your head or a pacemaker. They don't effect cell phones and are unlikely to effect credit cards.\n\nChildren should not be allowed to handle magnets as they can be VERY dangerous if they escape the seams.\n\nCan magnets wreck your credit card? Uh, not likely... http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/video-magnets-make-credit-card-mag-stripe-not-work-1457.php\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that once again I have committed to providing you with only the finest chi enhancing magnets on earth.

Those are 5 of the regular spoon sizes pictured against 8 of ours :)\nWith Polygons, you are able to find the size you need in seconds, without searching through all of your drawers. Plus, the spoon lays completely flat until you need to use it.\nWhen designing Polygons, we wanted to focus on making our product not only durable but also better for the environment than traditional measuring spoons.  \nThe hinges of Polygons are made of TPR, which have the property of being able to flex a 100,000 cycles without failure.\n(Edit: Many of you have messaged us asking for a 10 year warranty card... The life of such a composite plastic product depends on a variety of factors such as usage patterns, abrasion, temperature, humidity, product abuse, etc, other than just the number of times it\u2019s hinges can flex\nThe product may not live till 10 years, or it might even probably far surpass it\nIt would be like determining the lifespan of a person based on how well his/her joints function)\nAdditionally, with the 4-in-1 design, Polygons eliminates the need for excess plastic and metals that traditional measuring spoons use.\nThe materials we use to create Polygons ensure all ingredients fall off the spoon with little effort. They ensure that the ingredients you use do not stain or stink up your Polygons measuring spoons.\n\n(The images showing the folded spoon resting in place without being held by a hand, are staged photographs... But we see that people want some facility to be able to hold the shape in place without having to hold it, and we're working on it! - covered in the November 17th update)\n A sneak peek of our early prototyping processes \nNumerous configurations & geometries were tested using paper during the ideation stage, then manually tested with a variety of materials\n3D volumetric determination & construction \nWe tested several manufacturing methods to see which one would be optimal for a product of this nature\nShown in this video is one of these early methods, with very basic tooling without any fineness\nPictured in the campaign video is a prototype with similar functioning to the production version -\n (thickness & features exaggerated for explanation)\nThe production version has a similar appearance from the top, and the hinges slightly wider at the bottom, for the softer, flexible TPR to have surface area for a robust bonding\nThis is what gives the product an almost flat, easy-to clean surface both at the top and bottom\n\nWe haven\u2019t pictured the nitty-gritties and manufacturing technique of the production version in more excruciating detail to protect our IP, exactly due to instances like these, which we\u2019ve been citing as a concern early on:\nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/new-design-cheap-Polygons-The-Flat_60551273844.html\n\nApparently, what you\u2019ve pledge $10+ for, is available for 1/100th the price \nOr is it? The particular seller has listed other popular products on Kickstarter as well, stealing the same images \nYou place a bulk advance order, and then never receive anything (we tried it out with this guy)\n\nPolygons was created in 2014 by Rahul Agarwal. An India native, Agarwal is an inventor, designer and teacher.\nHe's worked on products ranging from the simplest of stationery to complex, head-up display systems.\nA few years ago, as a design student at a renowned Indian university, he was given this advice by a senior \u2013 \u201cDo not tackle designs that have reached the final stage of their evolution. For example, a spoon.\u201d From that point on, Agarwal dedicated his efforts to reinventing the wheel when it came to this object, and the idea for Polygons was born. After extensively testing with various shapes and materials, he arrived at an optimal geometry.\nOver the past couple years, Polygons has won various design awards and thousands have expressed interest in the invention. For the inventor in Agarwal, there could be no greater satisfaction than to see people using what he had created, so he got to task.\nPlease help us spread the word :)\nThe larger the Polygons community, the better it'll help us make the best kitchen gadget ever!\n A big BIG shoutout to Tali, for the delicious photographs\nhttp://www.talidovrat.com\n\nAnd the friends, family, loved ones and kind strangers who've helped us make this happen :)\n\nAnd also...\n...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you like the product, the only risk you're bearing is that of missing out on a true piece of delight by not backing it!\nNo but seriously, as with any new project, there are always some risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.

Anything. Simply.\nHave you ever dreamed of controlling everything in your home with a single remote? Well now you can! Smart Remote is a revolutionary product that lets you instantly control any device\u2014TVs, media players, speakers, lights, thermostats and more. Just point at what you want to control and Smart Remote\u2019s screen automatically adapts\u2014like magic.\n   When you point at any device, Smart Remote\u2019s high-definition touchscreen will instantly display an intuitive interface to control that specific device.\nWelcome to a world you can easily control. This goes way beyond your TV and media players.\nIf you want to control a device that is located near other ones\u2014like a media player below your TV or maybe a light next to your speaker\u2014Smart Remote lets you easily select which one you want to control. Just use the device selection carousel that automatically appears at the top of the remote.\nYou can also control devices located in other areas of your house. For example, you could point at your living room fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway or point in the direction of your garage door to make sure you remembered to close it. \n    They Love Us\n  The Only Remote You'll Ever Need\nSmart Remote gives you the ability to control any device via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. It\u2019s compatible with more than 25,000 devices, and we\u2019re adding new devices & services every day.

For the first time in history, we\u2019ve integrated a precise indoor positioning system in a consumer electronic device. This breakthrough technology gives Smart Remote the ability to control tens of thousands of devices in a simple and intuitive way. Our patent-pending technology combines this indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion sensors to track Smart Remote\u2019s exact position and orientation. This enables Smart Remote to know what it\u2019s pointing at in 3D space. \n     Control Your Entire Home\n  Smart Remote users will have several options for controlling all the devices in their home.\n1) Control Wi-Fi Devices In Other Rooms \nSmart Remote gives you the ability to control any Wi-Fi connected device on the same wireless network as Smart Remote, even if those devices are located in areas of your home other than where you installed your room sensors (aka your Smart Zone). All you need to do is set locations in your living room to point and control devices in other rooms. For example, you could set up Smart Remote to point at your fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway, or you could point in the direction of your entry way or dining room to control the lighting in those rooms from your couch.\n2) Install Smart Remote in Multiple Rooms \nIf you\u2019d like to have a Smart Remote in more than one room, you can purchase and install as many Smart Remote kits as you like\u2014living room, bedroom, office, kitchen, man cave, wherever. Each Smart Remote you purchase will only work in one Smart Zone, but fear not, your Smart Remote experience will continue to grow and get better with time. Read on.\n3) Install New Smart Zones \nBy the end of 2017, we will provide an option to purchase additional room sensor kits to create new Smart Zones and expand use of the Smart Remotes you already own. We will also release a free software update that lets you use any Smart Remote you own in any Smart Zone in your house, not just the Smart Zone in which it was originally installed.\n4) Use Smart Remote in Extended (Non-Smart) Zones \nWe launched Smart Remote on Kickstarter because we need your feedback and support to make this an exceptional product that you\u2019ll enjoy using everyday. After receiving hundreds of comments and suggestions and lots of great input, we\u2019re excited to announce our first community-driven feature\u2014Extended Mode. When you take Smart Remote outside of its Smart Zone and carry it to other areas of your home, Smart Remote will automatically display all your devices and services in a selection carousel. You will be able to select and control any Wi-Fi device on the same network as Smart Remote, any Bluetooth device within range that Smart Remote is connected with, and any infrared device you point at after selecting it in the carousel. Every home environment is unique, so your Smart Zone(s) may actually extend beyond the room or rooms where you installed sensors.\nInstantly Access Your Favorite Services\nFor the first time ever, you can turn on your TV, dim the lights, control your Thermostat, check Weather and order an Uber in less time than it took you to read this sentence. This is what makes Smart Remote so unique. Just choose a location for every service you want to add\u2014like your front door for Uber or your window for weather\u2014and simply point toward each location to get instant access.\n  Never Lose It\nLike you, we hate when we lose things. That\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting back against couch cushions, evil gnomes, mischievous children and general absent-mindedness. If there ever comes a time when you can\u2019t find your Smart Remote, just press the lost and found button on the charging base to make it ring.\n  Make It Yours\nSmart Remote has lots of cool features to make your connected home experience more convenient and enjoyable.\nGroup your lights together\nDo you want to control all your living room lights at the same time? Or maybe specific groupings of lights? No problem! Just open up the Smart Remote app and create custom light groups. It lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights\u2014all at once. When you point at any light in a group, you can use the selection carousel to either control the entire group or just control the individual light you are pointing at.\nCreate custom scenes\nSmart Remote gives you the power to set the mood and control multiple devices at once. Want a little romance in the air? Then bring the lights down low and turn on some music with a single tap. Is it movie night? Then choose your movie scene to fire up your TV and media player and adjust all your lights to the color and brightness you prefer.\n  What's In The Box\nEach Smart Remote kit comes with a Smart Remote, charging base and 3 room sensors.\n  Simple Setup\nIt only takes a couple minutes to get Smart Remote up and running:\nDownload the free Sevenhugs Smart Remote app (iOS or Android) \nInstall sensors in the room where you\u2019d like to use Smart Remote, in line of sight with each other. For best performance, place them at least 7ft (2m) high on different walls and as far apart as possible. \nAdd devices and services using the app and designate a location in your room for each device or service using Smart Remote \nEnjoy :)\nThe 3 room sensors can cover a room up to 1,000 sqft (100m2) in size and are also paintable.\n Smart Remote is available for iOS and Android.\n  To Infinity And Beyond \nWith our open API and SDK, the possibilities for developers are endless.\nLevel 1 \u2014 Add New Devices (Available June 2017) \nReuse existing UI and implement functions to control new connected devices. Our open API/SDK is made in Lua and based in C/C++ and lets you easily add new devices. Developers have access to communication interfaces (Wi-Fi, BT, BLE, IR). A first version has been released here: https://github.com/sevenhugs/smart-remote-sdk\nLevel 2 \u2014 Unleash Smart Remote\u2019s Full Power (Available End of 2017) \nCreate new use cases, gestures, screens and menus. Gain access to a detailed specification interface (position and orientation, or specific events identified with the 9-axis accelerometer), and trigger specific actions and services.\n  Design and Specs\n   Rewards  \n  Stretch Goals \n     \nHow It All Started \nWe began this journey in 2014 with a mission to connect people and their homes. There are several challenges with today\u2019s smart home products: 1) They are too complicated for people to use 2) Every device comes with it\u2019s own app or remote control 3) Nothing works seamlessly together. We wanted to build a product to solve these challenges and create something so simple that anyone could enjoy a connected home.\nDesigned in collaboration with of the most iconic and decorated French Design studios, eliumstudio, Smart Remote will be the heart of every connected home. Since 2014, we\u2019ve made dozens of drawings, 3D printed prototypes and manufactured prototypes. Smart Remote made its first appearance at Techcrunch Disrupt in 2015, where we gave a live demo on stage using our first prototype in front of hundreds of journalists. A few weeks later, we showed the prototype version 2 at CES in Las Vegas in 2016.\n      Why Kickstarter\nWhen you\u2019re trying to build great product, you need the support of a passionate community. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re here. Your ideas and feedback are vital to our product development efforts. As we prepare to enter production, we know we can build a world-class physical touchscreen remote. Where we really need your help is understanding all of the ways you want to use it. And when you receive your very own Smart Remote, we\u2019ll be very eager to learn how we can make it better. Let\u2019s build the world\u2019s most amazing home remote together.\nOn Track To Deliver\n  Sevenhugs Family \nWe are Sevenhugs.

With stunning visuals, innovative camera mechanics and solid RPG crafting and story elements, Redlock Studios has struck a chord with this game.\"\nPhil Elliott, director of indie development, Square Enix.\n           Hi there. It looks like you're here to learn more about Shattered: Tale of the Forgotten King, and it seems like I am the perfect conduit for this. In case you are wondering, this is the astounding creature called the Whisperer, fellow citizen of Hypnos's kingdom, now talking to you.\nLet's get started. My creator, Maxime Ren\u00e9, has been working on stories around my universe for about ten years. He created lots of artwork, wrote many tales and even developed role-playing games based on that mythology. A year ago, he decided to take the ultimate step and gathered a team together - called Redlock Studio - to finally bring it all to life. And now is the time for you to help!\nI'm looking forward to meeting you all in the game, dear Wanderers...\n      Maybe he dreamt himself up, birthed from the first spark, within his own creative consciousness. Maybe something greater breathed him to life. The truth is without a doubt beyond our humble reach and stretches past all philosophical considerations. And it might be better this way. From a thought he conjured up the Void. From a glance, he made the world. And from a whisper, he created us.\nFor his kingdom, the first word came in a whisper. Before knowing what the sky, a mountain or a river was, this word echoed within our souls. From our birth to our last breath, we would serve and protect Hypnos.\nAmong countless wonders of his creation, we thought we would live and dream forever.\nThen the King left. Nobody, even among his closest subjects, happened to know where and why he was gone, nor if he was still alive. Hypnos lost its soul without a warning or an explanation. From this moment, the kingdom gradually fell into a misty limbo.\nFrom darkness and oblivion, unnatural entities entered this too-far-gone world and crushed everything that remained, shattering the realm in three separate pieces. Soon, it was nothing more than a dead land shaped in silence, ashes and shadows.\n\nThousands of years passed, or maybe just a moment. And no one remembers these lost times.\n  Without any memories of your past, now begins your quest for truth. As you march on those strange places, you'll face incredibly powerful and mythic creatures; learning about them, and your own destiny.\nWait a minute. Here are a few things you may like to know before you dive into Hypnos's fractured lands by yourself...\nEvery living thing in the world of Hypnos was born silent with a mask that defines their personality. Few came to life with a name, which could only be given by the King and defined the purpose of their existence.\nThe only ones who can talk are called Whisperers. They're nothing like other people: Whisperers wear no masks, but handle words for the silent ones.\nThe Pretorians were once part of the Royal Army. Unlike normal citizens, they abandoned their mask and name to wear the Pretorian armor and served the King until their last breath...Or, at least, until he wasn't there anymore. Now, they serve other masters...\nThe Demiurges, as they were named, are the ferocious entities that rose when Hypnos was falling. They are the last lords of the truth and mysteries of the world.\nThe story of Hypnos yet has to be discovered and the future is in your hands. Will you help the Wanderer on his journey?\n  2D PLATFORMER\nThe challenge for the player is to explore the whole, wide-ranging level, and then to solve it as a large-scale puzzle.\n Each zone is made of :\nOne major puzzle that the player has to solve to progress through the adventure.\nThree minor puzzles that will give you access to secret zones or different scenaristic nodes.\n    In this part, you must survive lethal traps, solve many enigmas and find your way through labyrinthic levels.\n3D DYNAMIC BOSS FIGHT\nThrough the game, the player will face 12 bosses, the Demiurges, and legions of the Fallen: dead creatures and citizens of the realm are now their servant and minions. There are different behaviour patterns for each one of them.\nThe fighting system is as pure as possible, relying on:\nPlayer's dexterity, reflexes and sense of timing. Light and heavy attacks, dodging, feinting and dashing are at the very heart of the gameplay and lead to special attack chains.\nSkills acquired and used during the platforming phases.\n      STORYTELLING\nThe story is narrated throughout in the following ways:\nThe Whisperer's narrative\nScrolls from the Geodesian Book, common objects in each level\nEibon fragments, hidden in some dark places.\n  Each one carries its own vision of the story. Indeed, Shattered encourages players to collect different lore elements that will tell portray differing perspectives (if not the precise opposites) about Hypnos. You'll then have to reconstruct the truth according to your interpretation of the varying stories you've uncovered.\nRPG COMPONENTS\nSKILL SYSTEM: Unlock different passive or active skills depending on how you want to play the game. Some hidden skill trees will give different skill sets, depending on the battles you fight and levels you complete.\n  CRAFTING SYSTEM: Every killed monster will drop Limbo Essences, which are the in-game currency. You can use them to heal yourself or throw them in the alchemical crucible. The crucible allows you to create several consumables, plus items to merge with your equipment in order to change your stats according to your preference. You can also improve your alchemy skills by collecting cardinal slivers.\nLANGUAGE : Every single Eibon's fragment is a letter of the alphabet. The more you have, the more you'll be able to translate the Demiurges' strange language. The player will need to understand and handle properly those elements to discover the most complete ending.\n    We had so many ideas for the rewards that it was hard to chose between all of them. Aside from the \u201cgoodies for fun and style\u201d as we like to call them, we truly wish to offer you rewards that are directly connected to the game to extend your experience: original role-playing notes, universe books, added lore fragments etc... The fact that you will to share this adventure makes us so proud and grateful that we really want to offer the best. Thanks again dear Wanderers, if it wasn't for you, this project wouldn't exist.\n        The Redlock is a mystic place, a path between the universes. It is born of a will to create an intricate and captivating world. Shattered is one of the first stones. We're a French studio based in Lyon (FR) that has attracted many artists and engineers, due to our game\u2019s special atmosphere, its graphic style and lore. Today, eight souls have joined Redlock Studio, supported by the work of a dozen other wanderers.\nOur goal with Shattered is to deliver an intense storytelling experience, with emotive scenery and epic boss fights. We work on creating an intimate world, through a complex tale. We want to tell a story in which the different endings are complementary, to bring a global vision and a message open to players' interpretation.\nAs the Redlock team grew up very fast and the feedback around the project were so encouraging, we decided to go to Kickstarter to make the exact game we were dreaming of for so long. As a matter of fact, our artistic director and scenarist have been working on the Hypnos' universe for the last seven years. It is a large, complex and fully thought-out world, which now needs your help to take foot in our reality... Our first goal of EUR 80 000 is enough to fund the game, but not to remain fully independent. That would be the necessary amount to rise external funds or find some publisher \u2013 which is already done if we finally need to. So, aside from allowing us to add ingame content, reaching higher funding levels would let us remain independent...

The easiest, most effective wine preserver there is.  Aroma and taste.   Perfectly preserved.  Enjoy every glass.\nOur Promise.  Repour works.  Every single time.  We'll never let your wine go bad - so you never have to worry about it.\nPeople Talking about Repour.\nIt's Easy. Remove a foil seal and insert our smart stopper into your wine bottle. That's it. Really. Repour is activated to absorb oxygen when you remove the foil. When you walk away, we get to work.    \n  Come back anytime and get another glass...days, weeks or even months later. Your wine will be waiting patiently for you.  As fresh as when you first opened the bottle.  Simply remove our smart stopper from your bottle, pour a glass, and re-insert the smart stopper to save the rest for another day. \nIt's Effective.  We absorb oxygen from the air above your wine.  In turn, oxygen is degassed from the wine to levels lower, way lower, than any preserving system.  Ever.  So low in fact, that your wine may need to \"open up\" again the next time you pour a glass.\nNo Oxygen.  No Wine Degradation.  No Wine Down the Drain. \n                The Idea.  Almost two years ago, trying to sleep on the couch to let my wife, Michelle, get some much needed rest while our newborn son \"slept\", I started thinking about the half bottle of wine that was just poured down the drain. Trying many of the gimmicks on the market thru the years with little success, I thought there must be a better way of getting rid of nuisance oxygen in leftover wine.  As a chemist, I thought there must be a better way.  \nI started the research and development process on this problem as I have countless times thru my career.  But this time as a fun side project to do at home. The end result of these efforts (with many failures along the way) is the Repour Smart Stopper, the easiest and most effective wine preservation tool on the market.\nYour Help. We need help.  We have a finalized design, we've proven Repour works...really well.  We know the investments required to bring this product to commercialization.\nWe just need your support to make it a reality. With meeting our fundraising goals, we can hit \"go\" and have product ready to ship no later than February 2017. \n         How do we know Oxygen is less than 0.05%....\n Long term \"shelf life\" study, started 9/16/16, picture taken 10/26/16.  (It's hard to tell, but the bottles stopped with Repour Smart Stopper have the indicator inside the bottle)\nOxygen <0.05% the indicator is PINK  \nOxygen >0.05% the indicator is PURPLE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done a lot of design, development, and costing work to be confident we can deliver what we say we can...timing, product performance, product MSRP!\n\nThe Repour team and our advisers have helped bring thousands of products to market thru the years.

We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 3 weeks. We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, god forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

The glass bead finish helps avoid condensation from causing your glass to stick to the coaster. \nWe also used a special non-slip neoprene base on the bottom to prevent your coaster from sliding around. As with all of our products, our Titanium Coasters are proudly made in the USA!\nThey're tough, durable and made for everyday use.  Whether at home, in the office or in your own workshop our Titanium Coasters are built to keep your surfaces safe while looking like they always belonged there. Being made from Titanium means they won't shatter, rust, dull or change their beautiful appearance for as long as you own them! \nDurable and Sturdy for Everyday Use\nThese Pure Titanium coasters are perfect for your workspace whether it's a desk at work, a workshop table or your garage bench.  The sleek design fits with any desk setup and keeps your surface protected from unwanted condensation.\nPerfect Coaster for Your Workspace - Protect Your Wood Desk\nWe chose 6AL-4V Grade 5 Titanium because of it's superior characteristics:\nTough:  So durable it's 4 times stronger than steel.\nLight:    This coaster set can be easily moved around your home.\nHot/Cold Resistant:  Titanium can absorb energy whether from hot or cool surfaces contacting it, meaning it won't transfer the heat from your coffee or tea into your nice table.\nCorrosion Resistant:  Titanium naturally resists corrosion and does not rust like steel.  It's ideal to withstand the wear and tear of daily use.  That's why they built aircraft engines from it.\nElegant Surface Finish:  Glass bead blasted so the surface looks flawless and will remain durable over time.\nJust Cool:  Titanium is a unique and very cool metal, we think it's neat to have everyday items made from this awesome material.\nSmooth Glass Bead Blasted Finish\nDesign\nWe chose to keep the coaster pure, and minimalist.  Everything needed, no unnecessary frills. The coaster is 3.50\" in diameter and is made from 0.100\" thick solid Grade 5 Titanium. It serves its purpose and is thick enough to be sturdy and stable, but still sleek and easy to store and does not take up valuable desk real estate. \nWe gave the bottom a non-slip neoprene rubber, which has a pattern that increases the surface contact area, allowing the coaster to grip any surface it rests on.\nTextured Neoprene Non-Slip Grip\nYou can be sure your drink won't slide around, or be pulled up from condensation.  We carefully selected this design over cork for these reasons.\nPLAY\n\nWe designed the storage rack to compliment the dark metallic hue of titanium and look great in any setting. Like the coasters, we also tried to conserve the space, for small tables.\n~~ Optional~~ Black Walnut Coaster Holder $15\nThe non-slip pads ensure the coasters stay put in the rack and the holder on the table.\n~~Optional~~ Black Walnut Coaster Holder $15\nThe hardwood storage rack can be purchased as an add on for the 4-set for $15.\nEveryday Use - Home, Garage, Work\nIn our own houses we have stemless wine glasses, stainless travel mugs, ceramic coffee mugs, tea steeping pots, beer bottles, soda cans, water glasses, nalgenes, the list goes on...\nPerfect for Any Type of Drink\nAll of these need a place to rest and having a durable coaster means protecting your furniture, countertops, and other surfaces while contributing to your decor and aesthetic.\nIn the office, we always have several drinks on the desk: coffee, water bottle, soda, drink from lunch, having a sleek coaster to compliment your workspace saves your desktop from damage and will be the envy of your office.  \nEasily Protect your Workbench\nTimeline & Delivery Date\nDeliver by Late October\nAbout Taftware\nWe are a small design and manufacturing company based in Detroit, Michigan.  We enjoy working with unique materials and bringing our ideas to life by creating useful products that everyone will enjoy.  We believe in creating and making things you care about and are committed to doing that in our home base of Detroit.\nEverything we design is made in the USA from materials sourced in the USA.\nWe've done it before, crafting whiskey tumblers from titanium, brass, copper, stainless steel and even soapstone.  We then set out to create a perfect, minimalist wine stopper that would provide a superior seal on any size wine bottle.  We have a passion for well made products designed for everyday use.  These coasters are no different.  Strong, beautiful and made in the USA from Grade 5 6AL-4V Titanium.\nGrade 5 Titanium Coasters\nThank you for viewing our project!

Easy! Because I love it! Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarters, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nT-Shirts from the 2015 Kickstarter\n  Lotus MALAYSIA t-shirt design ideas\n  Lotus MALAYSIA totebag design idea\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation.\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO which was published in English & German in 2014.\nThe following winter we spent 10 weeks exploring Sri Lanka. The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA was published in 2015, following a sucessful third Kickstarter project with over 737 backers from more than 30 countries worldwide.\nI traveled around Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo for 5 weeks in early 2016 learning to cook traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes from the locals. I've spent the last six months creating all the recipes, artwork, photography & stories for the new cookbook.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations & shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nCooking Show at Veganz Hamburg\n  THE TIMELINE\nSEPT 2012: My first Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nDEC 2012: 1st English edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures published.\nMARCH 2013: My second Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nMAY 2013: 1st German edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden published. 2nd English edition printed.\nOCT 2013: The Lotus and the Artichoke nominated by VEBU (German Vegetarian Association) for Best Cookbook of the Year; wins a spot in the TOP 10 COOKBOOKS of 2013!\nMARCH 2014: Return from 3 months in Mexico.\nSEPT 2014: Germany Tour with The Vegan Zombie \u2013 Cooking demos, dinner parties, cookbook signings & other events in 9 cities in 11 days. 3rd printing of The Lotus and the Artichoke in German!\nNOV 2014: The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO! printed in German & English.\nMARCH 2015: Return from 10 weeks in Sri Lanka.\nSEPT 2015: My third Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nNOV 2015: The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA published in German & English\nFEB 2016: Return from 5 weeks in Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo\nMAR-SEPT 2016: Art, Cooking, Writing, Photography & Production of The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA.\nOCT 2016: Expected publication of The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA in German & English.\nCupcakes with Nicole Just, best selling author of La Veganista\n  Thomas D & Me!

In order for a Watch to be allowed to be branded Swiss Made, the movement and final control process must take place in Switzerland and this must be verified.\nThis magnificent watch shares its characteristic with a very few watches of renowned brands. But there is one significant difference: the Tonneau Chronographs currently offered on the market are rare and generally cost in excess of $3000 and beyond.\nA watch to be worn on any occasion and to be admired by everyone.\n     WM of Switzerland in the market and the media. They loved it .\nWM of Switzerland was established in 1980 in a small Swiss village in the Canton of Bern, close to Solothurn.\n  Originally, WM of Switzerland was just another Swiss watch-making company producing hand-made watches. In 1992, Mr. Hans Meissner, who today has over 36-years\u2019 experience in the watch-making industry, directed the aims of the company towards more ambitious horizons: recreating legendary time pieces. Hans Meissner is a firm believer in two things:  \n\u2022 That there is much in the history of watch making that is worth resurrecting and making available to everyone wishing to own a piece of watch making history, but priced to wear every day.\n\u2022 That a watch is worn on the wrist and money is kept in the pocket! A watch, even of high quality, does not need to cost 3,000.00\u20ac or more.\nWith these principles, WM of Switzerland proceeded to design and develop high quality wrist watches at a fraction of the costs of its competitors through the continuous search of components and manufacturing processes in close cooperation with world-wide suppliers.\n      WM of Switzerland offers its timepieces directly to you, without the intervention of any local distributors, and thus is able to save expenses on advertising and overheads, which we pass straight on to you. WM of Switzerland today trades internationally with a specific emphasis on the use of the web, at very low costs. We invest our money in research and in the design of new creations.\nAccording to the Smithsonian \"In 1927, Canadian-born Warren Marrison, a telecommunications engineer, was searching for reliable frequency standards at Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n Building on earlier work in piezoelectricity, he developed a very large, highly accurate clock based on the regular vibrations of a quartz crystal in an electrical circuit\" - the first quartz clock. Later, in 1967, the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland) designed the first quartz movement wrist-watch, famously known as Beta 21, and 2 years later, in 1969, Seiko launched its Seiko Astron, the very first commercially sold quartz movement wrist-watch.\n  Marrison\u2019s discovery proved to be of a revolution in the measure of time. Since early 1940\u2019s, laboratories in all the world, responsible for the measurement of time and public centres reporting the exact time, started to switch from mechanical measurement instruments to quartz measurement instruments.    \nThe quartz watch revolutionized the watch industry and from the early 1980\u2019s all Swiss manufacturers designed and launched their different quartz movement wrist-watches. Originally all of them were classical round dial watches, until the advent of the Tonneau case. The Tonneau case is so called because it\u2019s design and form reminiscent of a wine barrel or cask (tonneau in French).  \nThis Tonneau case is used by the world's most prestigious watch manufacturers including Rolex, Patek Philippe, Breitling, Oris, and other. However, due to the technical difficulties it entails \u2013 it is not common to find a Chronograph watch with a a Tonneau Case The WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is simply an example of this exploit in technology and design.\n    Water-resistant 5 ATM (50 metres). \n1 ATM is the standard pressure of the atmostphere at sea level, equivelant to a depth of 10 meters. The Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is water resistant to an incredible depth of 5 ATM\u2019s or 50 meters (165 Feet).\n2-year international guarantee.\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is guaranteed internationally by WM of Switzerland for a period of 2 years from date of purchase.\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph is available in three different versions:\na) Stainless-steel case\nb) Yellow Gold-plated\nc) Exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold-plated  \nAll three versions presented with a genuine brown leather strap.\nThe watch will be delivered in a beautiful leather style case and accompanied with its corresponding 2 year international warranty certificate.\n   The full retail price for the WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph with Stainless Steel case will be 499EUR/565USD and in the Gold-plated version (yellow Gold or exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold) 599EUR/675USD. These watches cannot be found at any retail store worldwide. \n                    Stretch Goals Stretch Goals  if we are successful in raising our funding goal we will announce the first of our stretch goals at the top of our campaign page.   \nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph watch will be shipped anywhere in the world. However, international customers are responsible for any duties that may be charged in their respective countries.  \nEstimated Delivery\nWe expect to be fulfilling orders in October 2016. While we do not expect this deadline to move, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. If at anytime you would like an update, please check the \"Updates\" section of our Kickstarter campaign.  \nWarranty\nAll WM of Switzerland watches include a 2 years international warranty.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nForecasting Risk\n\nTaking the WM of Switzerland Tonneau from prototype to production will almost certainly have unforeseen issues, but we've done our best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan.

Click HERE!\nPrey for the Gods is coming to PS4, Xbox One, Mac and Steam, with successful campaign completion! No stretch goal required.\n  Read about this recent announcement of PS4 & Xbox One.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802508750/prey-for-the-gods/posts/1635921\n  In Prey for the Gods, you play a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.\nCore Features:\nColossal battles with giants where you can climb your foes \nA vast and mysterious frozen world with dynamic snow terrain that you must traverse\nIntense survival game play\nExplore mysterious temples that contain secrets and treasure.\nDynamic weather and day/night cycle\nNon-linear game play where you choose who to battle and how\nLoot the fallen heroes and equip yourself with weapons and supplies\nUnique musical score\n  Prey for the Gods ambitiously combines the game play of Shadow of the Colossus, Deus Ex, DayZ, and BloodBorne. It has tight controls, action-packed boss fights and a frozen mysterious world to explore.\nPrey for the Gods can be played with a keyboard or a game pad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge/climb. Simple to learn and critical to master. You control the hero from a third person perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Dodging is crucial as the creatures that inhabit this island are not forgiving in battle and will not give mercy.\nThe combat in Prey for the Gods is fast-paced, brutal, and up to you. Each of the giants you encounter will be unique. To be victorious, you need to discover and exploit their weaknesses then climb on and defeat them. Do you take the giants head-on and dodge their massive attacks, striking when the time is right? Or hide from their gaze and sneak up on them? Pick up a sword, find a bow and arrow, fly through the air with a grapple hook, or use your bare hands.\nYou decide how to fight, and you decide how to survive. In battle, weapons can break, and arrows are finite, so do your best to make every shot count. Luckily, you can pull out the arrows you shoot. Discover the giants weaknesses, climb and defeat them.\n    Composer Ian Dorsch has been writing and recording music for games and related media for the better part of 15 years. His game audio work runs the gamut from AAA (Gears of War 3, Xbox Fitness) to indie (Airborn \u2013 Pino\u2019s Journey), and as a contributor to Polygon, The Escapist and Gamers With Jobs, Ian has written theme music for some of the longest-running podcasts and video series in gaming (Zero Punctuation). In addition to his work as a freelance composer, Ian is also a singer and choir director, and he currently directs the Grays Harbor Chamber Singers and the Vestr Singers, a professional vocal ensemble from the Seattle area.\nSkewsound has the experience and talent to bring the cold atmosphere of Prey for the Gods to life. Having done sound and music for a number of AAA and notable indie games including Chariot, Lost Within, Knee Deep, Magic Circle, RockBand 4, Gigantic, and Grim Dawn\nExploration is rewarding but risky. Luckily, your footsteps in deep snow will help guide you back if you get lost. However, the deeper the snow the more tired and hungry you will be. Hunt for food, then pick up what you can and find a safe cave to rest. Build yourself up from nothing, salvage items and weapons from fallen heroes including swords, bows, outfits, and more.\nSpend too long out in the cold and risk exposure that will chill you to the bone. Our dynamic weather system is treacherous and ever changing. From a sunny day, to a blizzard at a moment\u2019s notice you never know what to expect. The weather is just as dangerous as the giants you are after. A trek out to find your next foe could have you changing course and looking for shelter to warm yourself.\n   \nNo Matter Studios is developing Prey for the Gods. Comprised of three veteran game developers with approximately 30+ years of combined experience.\nBrian Parnell - @brianjparnell\n\"Director\"\nArt and Design and email LOTS of email;)\nIn 2004, I got my first job play testing at Nintendo and then my first development job as an artist at Iron Lore working on Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, Dawn of War: Soulstorm. After that I worked at Harmonix which included Rock Band 2, & RockBand: Beatles. I mainly did 3D character art and some concept/UI work too before getting more interested in proper management and focusing on game development as a whole. All of this while staying up late helping with friends indie projects including Natural Selection 2, and Grim Dawn. \nTim Wiese - @timjwiese\n\"Alchemist\" Art and Programming\n\"I've been working in the games industry since 2009, started off as an Environment Artist and over I time transitioned into Technical Artist/Tools Engineer, then to Engineer. As a gamer with love for a good story, I'm driven by the desire to develop a game that is Fun first and foremost (yes fun with a capital \"F\", it's important), with the depth to leave a lasting mark.\"\nHung-Chien Liao - @akyangliao\n\"Architect\", Programming\n\u201cI make the magic happen.\u201d That\u2019s all Chien wanted to say, mainly because the guy is too busy atm.\n  We started development of Prey for the Gods game in 2014 part time. We've been full time, living on our savings, since January 2016. For 3 people, we've come pretty far and are about 25% of the way in development. While we've come a long way, there's still a lot of work left to do. In order for us to continue development and keep creative control we need to ask for your help.\n    UPDATE: Prey for the Gods will launch with 5 bosses. At the initial budget of $300k, we'll release the game on Windows/Steam with boss types ranging from bipedal, quadruped and flying body types. Following Steam release we will begin porting the game to PS4, and Xbox One. This combined with intense survival based action combat, dynamic weather, and non-linear game play will give players a great experience at a fair value.  \nFurther stretch goals allow us to expand scope. We can add more art, animations, orchestral score, and more bosses. Most importantly we can hire an animator and hire a world builder. \nBoss stretch goals will be released after the initial 5 boss launch on Windows/Steam and not-simultaneous console release. Stretch goal bosses will be free to all backers that back at the $15 amount or more. \nStretch Goals!\n    $15 Backer = PC Digital Copy of the game, to be delivered via Steam upon release.\n  $25 Backer Plus = A Digital copy of Prey for the Gods (choose which platform if stretch goals are met), Elite Grappling Hook In-Game Item, & Digital Wall Papers\n  $35 Backer Deluxe = Digital copy of the Original Soundtrack for Prey for the Gods, and a digital copy of the Art Book.

To do this we have put in a great deal of our own funds into the development of this so far. It was important to us to have real skin in this before asking for outside funding. We have also been incredibly ruthless with our scope and brutal with our budgeting. Because of this effort we\u2019re able to have a road map that we feel comfortable with as Prey for the Gods come to fruition with your help.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: There is inherent risk in completing any project let alone a video game project. Estimates are much harder to lock down early in development. Prey for the Gods is far enough along in development to shed some of that risk, but it needs your help to get across the finish line. We have been working on this game part time since 2014 and full time since January 2016. During that time we\u2019ve developed, and documented our core mechanics, game play loops, combat, climbing tech, and weather systems. Doing this has allowed us the ability to scope and estimate more accurately. However, we\u2019ve been shipped a number of games and we know that even with the best planning development can change, and slip. Given our past game development experience we know how to manage this when it does crop up and our backers will be first to know and we will do our best to meet those challenges head on.\n\nCONSOLES: We've listened to our fans and placed consoles platforms in a position where we can make it work for our development. To make this possible we had to remove the Mac version. This was no easy decision but one that we feel is possible if the stretch goals are met. It is very likely that the console development will be staggered to allow us the time and resources to release each version in the best state possible. To speed this up it could mean working with partners to deliver specific platform versions for an even smoother deadline, by entering into these partnerships it can also push out other platform releases for a number of reasons.\n\nHYPE vs REALITY: Our plan is to stay as true to our vision and make necessary adjustments for the goals of making the game as fun, and exciting as possible. However, sometimes the last 10% of development can take 90% of the time. Luckily, we\u2019ve made enough solid games to understand that early feedback and iteration are key. Our plan is to do play-testing during development to help us guide that polish so that we focus on what matters most.

Sometimes we take time to make adjustments in order to deliver a better game. Other times we take time because there are external factors that push our hand. This is one of those times where external factors have come into play.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous update, one of us has been dealing with an unexpected family emergency.

In the meantime, we will continue to polish and finalize the game, but this means that we will not make our April release target as hoped. We're sorry that you'll have to wait a little longer, but we need to do what's right by our team and the people closest to them.\n\nWe're a small studio and we want to keep it that way. The downside is that when one of us needs to take some unexpected time away, it means that 33% of our company is suddenly not there.

It was a revolutionary step forward for the medium in a time when developers first began experimenting with interactive story telling.\nPlayers were trapped aboard Citadel Station as they fought to survive against the cyborgs and mutated crew members corrupted by a maniacal A.I. known as SHODAN, one of the most treacherous antagonists ever conceived. System Shock offered an unparalleled experience that would solidify it as one of the greatest games of all time.\nSystem Shock - Big Box Collectors Edition\n    We want to demonstrate our commitment and passion for System Shock by providing a fun and exciting experience to potential backers. This demo represents the look and feel that we want to achieve with the final version we'll deliver to you, our backers. Please be aware, this is a proof of concept; the PERFORMANCE, FEATURES, and VISUALS are subject to change. We hope you enjoy your time aboard Citadel Station! SHODAN eagerly awaits your arrival...\n                                            PLAY\n\n                                                                                                         Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to discover the surgeons are missing, the station is in disrepair, and the once-prime corporate facility now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots, and mutated beings, all programmed to serve a ruthless A.I.: SHODAN. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...\nCortex Reaver Concept Art - by Robb Waters\nTo help shape and direct the existing narrative of System Shock, we've enlisted the help of Chris Avellone, who is best known for his work on a number of role-playing games, including; Fallout: New Vegas, Wasteland 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 2. Chris will be working closely with Stephen Kick (our Creative Director) and Jason Fader (our Project Director and Senior Producer from Fallout: New Vegas) as well as several other key developers from Fallout: New Vegas to bring modern AAA quality into the world of System Shock.\nChris has been a long-time fan of the System Shock series, and we\u2019re very eager to work with his design expertise to improve Citadel Station.\n  General Features\n\u2192 A modern take on System Shock, a faithful reboot; it\u2019s not Citadel Station as it was, but as you remember it. Many improvements, overhauls and changes are being implemented to capture the spirit of what the original game was trying to convey, and bring it to contemporary gamers.\n\u2192 Re-imagined enemies, weapons, and locations by original concept artist Robb Waters.\n\u2192 Terri Brosius reprises her role as SHODAN, and new VO will be recorded.\n\u2192 Brand new musical score composed by Jonathan Peros.\n\u2192 The user interface, game mechanics, enemies, and puzzles will be updated to reflect modern aesthetics and sensibilities, while maintaining the feel of the original.\nScope Features\n\u2192 $900k Goal: Modern Inventory Management, Modern Controls, New Puzzles, Updated Faithful Levels, Game Difficulty Modes.\n\u2192 $1.7m Goal : Enemy limb dismemberment, More puzzles, Ammo types/weapon settings, Vending machines, Weapon upgrading, Hardcore mode (No respawning), Ironman mode (Only 1 savegame. If you die, the save is deleted)\n    We wanted the art of System Shock to be fresh and new while still remaining true to the aesthetics of the 1994 classic. We've maintained much of the original look, while accentuating it beautifully by an array of modern rendering features such as Physically Based Rendering (PBR), screen-space reflections, real-time global illumination, ambient occlusion (HBAO), volumetric particles, and dynamic lighting. It's the world you remember:\n Leading our conceptual efforts is Robb Waters, the original concept artist from System Shock, the BioShock series, Thief, and Freedom Force. He's been tasked with revisiting his work from 1994 and re-imagining it. It's been very exciting seeing his designs evolve through the process.\n          We want this game to be as chilling to players today as the original System Shock was when it was released in 1994. What is most important to us is taking the essence of the original game, and emphasizing that as we present it to gamers today. With the knowledge and technological improvements over the last 22 years since the original, we can communicate the story of Citadel Station more effectively than ever.\nSystem Shock will have a dramatic and modern take on a musical score. Combining its root sci-fi elements with dynamic acoustic elements \u00e0 la BioShock, we are striving to set System Shock apart from other more action-based shooters as an atmospheric and dark experience.\nPrague's FILMharmonic Orchestra; Civilization V, Hostel, Halo Wars, et al. (see stretch goals)\nThough computer music software has improved exponentially in the last decade, there is no equivalent to the breathtaking and visceral sounds that real instruments can produce. We have been working with Videri String Quartet, and we are in talks with Prague's FILMharmonic Orchestra about recording the score for System Shock. They're a very professional orchestra, having recorded scores for Civilization V, Thief, Hostel, Dream Theater, and many more projects. If we can reach the stretch goal required to afford everything that it takes to record a full orchestra, the game's musical experience will be much more expressive and terrifying than would ever be possible without.\nThough for a modern game like System Shock, a more restrained and dramatic approach is called for, we are also really excited to bring the old System Shock tunes back to life in an updated way! With a roster of world-class musicians, we have set a stretch goal to release a remixed version of the original soundtrack intact! Please help us to make this a reality so that we cannot only provide a strong modern gameplay experience, but also give the old tunes the love that they deserve!\nNightdive Studios - Composer and Sound Designer, Jonathan Peros (Working in the Studio)\n    Nightdive Studios is comprised of industry veterans passionate about developing a faithful reboot of one of our favorite games.\n We understand the risks and challenges there are when creating a compelling experience and with the help and guidance from the original Looking Glass/Irrational Team (as well as AAA RPG developers directly on the team) we are poised to deliver a worthy entry to the System Shock universe. Here are just a few of the games we've worked on:\n    The full release of System Shock will be initially available for Windows and Xbox One. The Windows version will be available on Steam, Humble, and GOG (DRM-free). OSX and Linux versions will be unlocked when our first stretch goal is reached. We\u2019re open to other platforms in the future.\n    Nightdive Studios is a small team of passionate and talented developers and while we're able to operate on the revenue we earn from the sales of our classic games catalog, it's only enough to continue funding our core business. With our transition into full-time development, we'll need help from you, the fans and members of the crowdfunding community to get us off to a great start. We want to make this game with the fans, and it\u2019s important to us to remain independent for that reason. Ultimately, this game is for you. We want to ensure your voice is heard and we deliver on what you want. We've done the math, and with $900,000 we're confident we can complete the project and deliver a game (and rewards!) that every Shock fan will love - but with additional funds, we're prepared to increase the scope of the game and include some great stretch goals that will enhance everyone's experience.\n                    We are hoping to exceed our goal in order to bring you a more exciting experience. When our stretch goals are reached, prepare yourself for what is to come including cross-platform integration, new locations, challenges, and multilingual support. \n                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe understand that game development is difficult, and a numbers of risks are involved. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re dealing with that:\n\nFINANCIAL RISK: Games are very expensive to make. We\u2019ve worked on several big-budget games and have senior developers onboard to help budget the project properly. We have frontloaded a great deal of development using our own funds, taking on the risk ourselves. It wasn\u2019t easy, but we\u2019re driven to see our vision of System Shock complete and in your hands. Now, with a pre-alpha demo, we need your help to get us to the finish line!\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: One of the biggest risks with any project is the completion timeline. Early on in a project, estimates are far less accurate than later. Fortunately, we\u2019re starting this campaign at the 25% mark in development, so our estimates are more accurate than usual. Still, game development can be unpredictable at certain stages, and we understand that. Our goal is to do our very best to complete the game as outlined by our funding and stretch goals. Should the schedule need to change, our backers will be the first to know and we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible. We\u2019re in this together.\n\nFUN RISK: Making a fun game is the ultimate goal, but it\u2019s more of an art than a science. Often times a feature may not be as fun as we\u2019d like, and requires more iteration. Luckily, we\u2019re working with some amazing developers that have shipped critically acclaimed AAA titles to help ensure we\u2019ll make the game fun and engaging. During several phases in the project, we\u2019ll be conducting limited focus tests for every level and every feature.

Featuring our most sophisticated designs to date and high spec automatic movements. Its understated style will impress with its presence.\n  We designed the Metropolitan models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function, but should naturally derive from it. True style complements function. It should be subtle, never loud or trendy. It should be timeless, never rendered obsolete by new technology.\n  Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over three years, with the Metropolitan Automatic being our fourth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners.\nEvery single component of the Metropolitan is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. It was designed to be an heirloom to be passed down to the next generation.\n  Our direct-to-consumer business model means we skip the distributors and retailers and pass the savings down to you.\n  Exhibition caseback allows full view of the automatic movement\nThe Metropolitan Automatic models all feature an exhibition caseback with a large window showcasing the beautiful automatic movement. You will be able to observe the rotor spinning and admire the engineering that goes into the design of the beating heart of an automatic watch.\nDouble domed bubble crystal\nOne of the signature elements of the Metropolitan Automatic collection is the double domed bubble crystal covering the dial. Reminiscent of the bold mid-century modern designs of the 60s, it gives the watch an undeniable presence. The domed shape creates a slight distortion at the edge of the crystal, a signature look of 60s watches and part of the unique character of the Metropolitan watch.\nMiyota 9015 movement (courtesy Miyota Citizen Japan)\nThe Calibre 90S5/9015 used in the Metropolitan Automatic watches is an exceptional high-spec, Japan-made automatic movement featuring a 42-hour power reserve.\nIt is a 3-hand movement that has been favorably compared to the ETA2824 movement used in luxury watches such as Baume & Mercier, Bell & Ross and Tudor.\nIts high 28,800 bph (8 beats per second) impart it with a super smooth sweep of the seconds hand.\nIt was developed and is manufactured by Miyota, an iconic Japanese manufacturer with a reputation for quality, reliability and precision. The 90S5/9015 is ideally suited for an heirloom watch like the Rossling & Co. Metropolitan.\nFaux-croc genuine leather straps\nAll Metropolitan Automatic watches feature a faux-croc genuine leather strap with genuine leather backing for ultimate comfort and durability. The polished buckle is engraved with the Rossling & Co. logo.\nSolid stainless steel 316L case and crown\nThe case of the watch is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The low profile crown allows for easy adjustment of the time or date.\nMetropolitan Automatic dial details\nThe Metropolitan Automatic collection showcases 3 different dial colors (gloss black, gloss white and sunburst blue) each available in 2 dial layout options (Classic and Open-Heart). All dials feature hand-applied polished indices and diamond cut hands.\nThe Open-Heart layout features a round window at 6 o\u2019clock showcasing the 90S5 movement.\nThe Classic layout features a square date window at 6 o\u2019clock.\nCertificate of authenticity and warranty card\nThe Metropolitan Automatic watches available for pre-order will be hand-assembled as a limited-edition. Only 399 watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international 2-year warranty card and a certificate of authenticity. Each watch will feature a unique serial number on the caseback (ex.: 001/399).\n  The Metropolitan Black is for the man of the world. It conveys an air of mystery and effortless charm.\n    PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n    The Metropolitan White is for the classical man. Subtle, recognized by those in the know, it exudes confidence and charisma.\n    PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n    The Metropolitan Blue is our boldest design; for the man that does not fear being noticed.

[\u2026] a nice formula that mixed value and style.\u201d - Worn & Wound\n\u201cthe watches are seriously awesome\u201d - Cool Material\n\u201cThe Rosslings are attractive watches that could easily find their way into almost any collection.\u201d - The Time Bum\n\u201cAt just over a year old, the Montreal based watch company has left a huge mark on the timepiece world, all-be-it with the aid of crowd-funding behemoth Kickstarter.\u201d - Vouchmag\n\u201cThere is something very appealing about these watches that is hard to put your finger on. It\u2019s in their simplicity and lack of pretension. They aren\u2019t trying to be something they are not, they are just pleasant and easy to wear.\u201d - Worn & Wound\n\u201cWhile, Kickstarter campaigns often dilute true horology in search of profits, Rossling has committed itself to making high-quality watches for less.\u201d - Ivy Time\n\u201cRossling & Co. definitely have made the case as one of the best up-and-coming watchmakers around.\u201d \u2013 Vouchmag\nHere's a small selection of the customer reviews we received for our previous collections:\n\"I had to stop and remember to breath after I opened the box. The gold and blue with the domed sapphire was absolutely stunning.\" - Ken L., Modern 36mm - Westhill\n\"Simple and elegant watch. It's timeless and goes with anything. I get compliments all the time from both women and men. It looks classic but bold, love it.\" - Thibault C., Classic 40mm - Glencoe\n\"less is more (sometimes). It is definitely the case here! So thin so light, nothing left to say than; Buy this watch. Simplicity at its best\" - Tobias P., Classic 40mm - Stirling\n\"I am an avid watch collector and I can say that hands down this is my favorite watch. The simplistic design, paired with the unique band garners tons of compliments from family and friends. For the price, there is simply nothing that even comes close to comparing with this watch.\" - Alec A., Classic 40mm - Stirling\n\"One of my favourite watches to date. As a passionate collector I love coming across a fresh design. These guys have kept it simple and pulled off a really beautiful piece. The strap colour is so dynamic I end up wearing this more than the rest of my pieces combined. keep up the great work guys, looking forward to seeing what else you come up with.\" - Luke O., Classic Automatic \u2013 Westhill\nHello! We are Nadim, Terry and Karim, entrepreneurs and watch lovers. We started out as two brothers designing our first watch collection in 2013 after we couldn\u2019t find what we wanted on the market. As the company grew, Karim, our third brother, joined us and Rossling & Co. became three-brothers strong. Our first model was a success beyond our expectations on Kickstarter with close to 1,300 backers. We then launched our Classic Automatic collection in the fall of 2014 and our Modern 36mm collection last summer. Both were huge successes, raising multiple times their initial funding goal. We are beyond excited to launch the Metropolitan Automatic and we can\u2019t wait to get it on your wrists.\n  We are excited to see you join us on this adventure. By pledging for this project, you'll help it become reality. You'll also get yourself one of the few limited edition Metropolitan Automatic watches. You'll choose the specific model that you want. You can also help by sharing the project with friends and family. Word travels fast. By sharing on social media, you will help spread the word and give the project more exposure, allowing it to stretch its wings. More exposure means more backers and more funding. More funding means more stretch goal goodies for everyone!

Or as vegan cookbooks with illustrations of sad rock stars drowning their sorrows in food. Either way, you'll laugh, cry, and learn to make some really tasty recipes.\nAbout the Books:\n  Defensive Eating with Morrissey: Vegan Recipes From the One You Left Behind is a book of beautiful portraits of Smiths star Moz hoarding food; each portrait is accompanied by a poetic vegan recipe, so that you can eat what Morrissey is eating.\nThe praise is already rolling in! \"To dine on these sides is such a heavenly way to dine,\" declaims Wes Allison, co-author of The Taco Cleanse.\nComfort Eating with Nick Cave: Vegan Recipes to Get Deep Inside of You contains portraits of Mr. Cave crying and eating those salty, noodly, cheezy staples that we all crave when we're sad\u2014with recipes for every one.\nWhat's the story behind these unusual books? We asked artist Automne Zingg to write an introduction.\nAutomne's Story:\nIn 2013 I was broke, living in Los Angeles, and going through a terrible breakup. It was probably one of the darkest times in my life and I felt inconsolable. I wasn't working. I wasn't eating. I wasn't drinking. I wasn't doing much of anything except writing depressing songs and listening to even more depressing ones from my youth. I found it curious that the bands that got me through the general malaise of being a sad teenage goth served as a type of sonic comfort food for me as an even sadder adult. Was I having a midlife crisis? The only thing that brought me comfort during this nightmare was drawing. I started to doodle images of Nick Cave crying over pints of ice cream, Siouxsie Sioux devouring tacos, and The Sisters Of Mercy stuffing their faces with Cinnabons. The more time passed, the more surreal these drawings became.\nNick Cave was a particular go to for me during this time and he became the musical equivalent to my grandmother's lasagna. I devoured his music and binge listened for months. It was familiar and comforting; I thought whatever feeling emotional eaters gained from consuming a pint of ice cream, I got from blasting \"Your Funeral...My Trial.\" As heartbroken as I was, I reminded myself that Nick Cave had been through much worse. I wondered what he did during those trying times and found myself unconsciously doodling pictures of him weeping while eating. Each day the drawings got a little weirder and my mood got a little better.\nEventually I started sharing them with others and everyone wanted to see Morrissey putting things in his mouth. Who wouldn't? I obliged and started doing a series of drawings of Morrissey hoarding food.\nNom nom nom. Boo hoo hoo.\nxoxo Automne Zingg\nWe fell in love with Automne's drawings, and asked Joshua Ploeg to write a recipe to go with each one. The spectacular results are here for you to see!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThese books are sturdy hardcovers without dustjackets (the industry term is \"paper over board\"). They'll hold up to a lot of sad tears, exuberant tears, and kitchen spills. We're Kickstarting them for two reasons: \n1) The world needs to know.\n2) We're committed to printing in the US. Most color books are printed more cheaply in China and then priced artificially low for consumers\u2014so we are raising funds in order to pay for the printing without risking our building and staff, and to keep the price manageable for you, the reader.\nBy backing this project, you help us make an awesome book (and keep making more in the future!), you support manufacturing in the US midwest, and you get to never stop laughing. Win!\nFrom the Moz cookbook\n  From the Cave cookbook\n  About the artist\nThe artist at work\nArtist Automne Zingg originated the internet trend of drawings of goths eating things. Drawing these pictures started as a breakup remedy.... then things escalated. When not drawing, she makes video art and performs music as Lacey Spacecake. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.\nAbout the chef\nYour chef in action\nJoshua Ploeg travels the world cooking vegan food for a wide diversity of parties and causes. He's the author of many vegan cookbooks, most recently This Ain't No Picnic: Your Punk Rock Vegan Cookbook. When not cooking, he sings in punk bands: currently Select Sex, and previously in pioneering queercore bands like Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet.\nAbout the publisher\nOur store at work!\n  Microcosm Publishing produces brightly-colored books that empower readers to improve their lives and change the world. Inspired by the ethics and aesthetics of punk rock, we've been scrappy and independent since 1996. With our staff of ten and almost 400 titles and 2 million books in print, we still come to work at our Portland, Oregon office and have the most fun every day. \nWe run Kickstarter projects for some of our books for two reasons: So more people can find our books and be delighted and inspired by them, and to pay the bills.

So why Kickstarter? Printing is one of the biggest costs in publishing, and to put out two books at once is a real financial challenge. That's why we're running this campaign!\n\nThere's always the possibility that one of the fine gentlemen lovingly parodied in these books will sue us into oblivion. We ran a fine-toothed legal comb through the books and even asked both Morrissey and Cave point blank if they'd object ... or if they wanted to be involved in the books (Cave's agents graciously declined to be involved; no response from Moz's people). This is America and anyone can sue anyone for anything. But parody is protected under fair use and we think we're well protected.\n\nThe biggest challenge we expect to face is: Will we make our goal? These two books are drawn, written, formatted, edited, layed-out, paperworked, publicized, and basically completely ready to go to print. We've invested a lot in these already. But will we be able to afford to press the send button on that email to the printer? And will this work of art make it into your eager hands?

Spooly makes on-the-go charging a breeze.\"\nWelcome to Spooly, the most portable full-length charging cable ever. Spooly has a clever design which takes up virtually no space and is durable enough to withstand the rigours of everyday life on the move. Spooly might look tiny, but definitely lives long.\nSpooly\u2019s incredibly portable design simply would not be possible using regular cable \u2013 the Mag-System uses bespoke magnetic cable which quickly and effortlessly aligns the cable to form a perfect and secure coil. Then simply pull to un-wind \u2013 it\u2019s that easy.\n  Whether you\u2019re doing some urban exploring or an off-road adventure, Spooly\u2019s form fitting case offers complete protection. The robust, yet elegant design fits comfortably in your pocket making Spooly the ultimate adventure cable.\nAlways there when you need it most.

This USB Type-A design is a user-friendly reversible connector that allows you to connect your cable to your device or wall outlet in any direction. Compatible with all standard USB slots.\nTechnical Details\nSpooly & Keymaster Connectivity Options  \nSupported by Apple, Android, Windows and Google operating systems. Whichever your device preference- Spooly's got you covered. *Options will be available via survey after campaign ends.\n 2.4 amp cable\n Fast charging and data transfer \nSpooly Dimensions\nAvailable in 1 meter or 1.3 meter length.\nSpooly 1.3 meter dimensions: 43 x 60 x 7.

We chose hardwearing and highly flexible thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) blended with powdered barium ferrite particles in sections for our bespoke cables.\nBarium ferrite is an extremely good insulator and doesn\u2019t allow any electrical current to flow through it, which makes it perfectly safe. These sections are then magnetized by rolling the cable through an electromagnetic field with a field strength of at least 20,000 oersteds, resulting in cables that are highly flexible, rollable, and resistant to wear and tear.\n  Spooly Team\nScott McCormack\nScott has over 18 years expertise in product design, electrical and mechanical engineering. Extremely passionate about innovation and engineering, he invented his first product at 17 \u2013 an electronic and biometric security lock powered by kinetic energy. He believes that simplicity and quality make the best products. Before creating Spooly, Scott worked on design projects in India, China and the UK.\nJinger Chen\nJinger was born in China. She moved to the UK when she was 21 and met Scott while studying at Oxford University. Both share a passion for design. Fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and English, Jinger has many connections in China and uses these to source and work with manufacturers of the highest standards without language or technical barriers \u2013 a key role that helps manufacture Spooly\u2019s unique components.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are a small innovative company with huge ambition, dedication and determination.

The exquisite dial is engraved in \u201cGuilloche\u201d style, a technique producing an intricate three dimensional pattern creating a silver effect.\nSapphire Glass Crystal\nCompleting the watch is a scratch resistant absolutely transparent and anti-glare Sapphire Crystal Glass.\nThe Stainless-steel rear case is engraved with the manufacturer's brand \"WM of Switzerland\".\nSwiss made watches are renowned world wide as the pinnacle of watch making design and quality and as such is protected. In order for a Watch to be allowed to be branded Swiss Made, the movement and final control process must take place in Switzerland and this must be verified.\nThis magnificent watch shares its characteristic with a very few watches of renowned brands. But there is one significant difference: the Tonneau Chronographs currently offered on the market are rare and generally cost in excess of $3000 and beyond.\n A watch to be worn on any occasion and to be admired by everyone.\nWM of Switzerland was established in 1980 in a small Swiss village in the Canton of Bern, close to Solothurn. \nOriginally, WM of Switzerland was just another Swiss watch-making company producing hand-made watches. In 1992, Mr. Hans Meissner, who today has over 36-years\u2019 experience in the watch-making industry, directed the aims of the company towards more ambitious horizons: recreating legendary time pieces. Hans Meissner is a firm believer in two things:\n\u2022 That there is much in the history of watch making that is worth resurrecting and making available to everyone wishing to own a piece of watch making history, but priced to wear every day.\n\u2022 That a watch is worn on the wrist and money is kept in the pocket! A watch, even of high quality, does not need to cost 3,000.00\u20ac or more.  \nWith these principles, WM of Switzerland proceeded to design and develop high quality wrist watches at a fraction of the costs of its competitors through the continuous search of components and manufacturing processes in close cooperation with world-wide suppliers. \nWM of Switzerland offers its timepieces directly to you, without the intervention of any local distributors, and thus is able to save expenses on advertising and overheads, which we pass straight on to you. WM of Switzerland today trades internationally with a specific emphasis on the use of the web, at very low costs. We invest our money in research and in the design of new creations.\nAccording to the Smithsonian \"In 1927, Canadian-born Warren Marrison, a telecommunications engineer, was searching for reliable frequency standards at Bell Telephone Laboratories. \nBuilding on earlier work in piezoelectricity, he developed a very large, highly accurate clock based on the regular vibrations of a quartz crystal in an electrical circuit\" - the first quartz clock. Later, in 1967, the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland) designed the first quartz movement wrist-watch, famously known as Beta 21, and 2 years later, in 1969, Seiko launched its Seiko Astron, the very first commercially sold quartz movement wrist-watch. \nMarrison\u2019s discovery proved to be of a revolution in the measure of time. Since early 1940\u2019s, laboratories in all the world, responsible for the measurement of time and public centres reporting the exact time, started to switch from mechanical measurement instruments to quartz measurement instruments. \nThe quartz watch revolutionized the watch industry and from the early 1980\u2019s all Swiss manufacturers designed and launched their different quartz movement wrist-watches. Originally all of them were classical round dial watches, until the advent of the Tonneau case. The Tonneau case is so called because it\u2019s design and form reminiscent of a wine barrel or cask (tonneau in French). \nThis Tonneau case is used by the world's most prestigious watch manufacturers including Rolex, Patek Philippe, Breitling, Oris, and other. However, due to the technical difficulties it entails \u2013 it is not common to find a Chronograph watch with a a Tonneau Case The WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is simply an example of this exploit in technology and design. \nWater-resistant 5 ATM (50 metres)\n1 ATM is the standard pressure of the atmostphere at sea level, equivelant to a depth of 10 meters. The Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is water resistant to an incredible depth of 5 ATM\u2019s or 50 meters (165 Feet). \n2-year international guarantee. \nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is guaranteed internationally by WM of Switzerland for a period of 2 years from date of purchase. \nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph is available in three different versions:  \na) Stainless-steel case\nb) Yellow Gold-plated\nc) Exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold-plated \nAll three versions presented with a genuine brown leather strap.\nThe watch will be delivered in a beautiful leather style case and accompanied with its corresponding 2 year international warranty certificate.\nThe full retail price for the WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph with Stainless Steel case will be 499EUR/565USD and in the Gold-plated version (yellow Gold or exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold) 599EUR/675USD.\nThese watches cannot be found at any retail store worldwide.\nEarn 10% cash back for sharing the WMS Tonneau Chronograph with your friends.\n Stretch Goals\nIf we are successful in raising our funding goal we will announce the first of our stretch goals at the top of our campaign page.\nFREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING \nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph watch will be shipped anywhere in the world.

Check the updates for the link!\nChildren of Zodiarcs is a story-driven, single-player Tactical JRPG that combines traditional strategic gameplay with the thrill of collectible cards and craftable dice! \nDo you wish there were more indie games inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics, Shining Force, Tactics Ogre, and the best of Tactical JRPGs? Us too!\nChildren of Zodiarcs comes from our deep love of these games, as well as board games and collectable card games like Magic: The Gathering. We decided to bring these two passions together to make a game that would resonate with fellow fans of Tactical JRPGs, and also add to the genre in fun and exciting ways.\nZodiarcs is a game that engages you at every moment with a sophisticated story, memorable characters, and gameplay that provides countless opportunities for strategizing the ultimate victory.\nThe core team at Cardboard Utopia is made up of AAA game industry veterans. Collectively we have worked on games like Eternal Darkness, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, The Warriors, and Far Cry 3. We have been in the trenches and know the rigours of top-quality game development well.\nZodiarcs is being developed for PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac and will launch with English and French language support to start. On that front, we already have a \"Coming Soon\" Steam store page up! You can check it out here! Feel free to add it to your Wishlist and Follow it. Doing so shows to Valve that people are interested in the game and helps with our visibility on the Steam front page.\n\"At the heart of an evil empire, a group of young outcasts rebel against the corrupt system that holds them down...\"\nInfiltrating the chambers of a decadent noble, they intend to steal a priceless relic, but what awaits them is more than anyone bargained for. Relentlessly pursued by the authorities, they make a desperate escape, seeking refuge in the city's seamy slums and sunless underground catacombs. On their trail are heavily armed city guards, rival bandit gangs, and a clan of subterranean cannibals. Can a motley crew of outsiders survive this vicious world without sacrificing their own humanity?\nChildren of Zodiarcs is a very personal story for us at Cardboard Utopia. As lifelong fans of JRPGs, we grew up with stories of amazing fantasy worlds, relatable and memorable characters, with surprising (often shocking) plot twists. Recapturing those emotions and that sense of wonder is one of our company's primary motivations. We have been developing the world of Zodiarcs for over a year now, making sure to create a rich universe, full of mysteries and unexpected revelations.\nAs a story-driven game, unique and memorable characters is something very important to Children of Zodiarcs. Here are but a few of the the characters you will meet in the game.\nNahmi and her companions are forced to run and fight for their lives against the elite city guards ordered to capture them. Worse, even the Toran nobility is equipped with the latest in Zodiarc weaponry, and will show no regard for the lives of the thieves they are after. To emerge victorious you will need to use everything at your disposal, and not be afraid to fight dirty, flank, and corner your opponents.\nCombat is about much more then planning, however. Your ability to adapt to the unexpected will be tested at every turn. In Children of Zodiarcs, every action (attacks, curses, or even special abilities like stealth) take the form of cards that heroes draw at random from custom decks they carry into combat. Do you save that powerful attack for later, or come up with a new strategy on the fly? As cards are drawn, so is your strategy.\nThis is not to say you have no control over luck - Zodiarcs is a game of planning. Outside of combat you will build a deck of cards for each of your heroes. While you will always know WHAT is in your deck, you won\u2019t know WHEN you will get it, making each card draw an opportunity for new strategies to emerge. Make yourself more lucky by crafting better odds for your heroes.\nEach hero has their own strengths and weaknesses; Nahmi is quick and deft whereas Brice is reckless and deadly, even to herself. These traits are expressed with symbols etched on Zodiarcs' dice. Your heroes will carry their own set of dice into combat that you roll for each card played. These symbols can vastly affect the outcome of the card. Learn what each hero is capable of to unleash devastating effects upon your enemies.\nAs with cards, your chances to get the dice outcome you want is also influenced through customization. Outside of combat, you will craft and equip the dice your heroes bring into combat, effectively stacking the odds in your favor. Want a die with more swords for stronger attacks? Equip it. Don't have one? Craft it using collected loot dice as ingredients in a recipe.\nThe ability to build your deck of cards and customize your dice makes combat in Children of Zodiarcs about how well you can adapt to changing situations. It took us months of prototyping to find the perfect balance between tactics and influenced luck, but we put the prototype into the hands of Tactical JRPG fans and they have been excited about what we have to offer.\nPlan your actions and fight by pushing and flanking your enemies.\nPlay your cards and roll your dice to increase your damage or get that extra turn to finish the job.\nInfluence luck by building your deck of cards and crafting your dice to maximize the chances of the outcome you're looking for.\nPositioning Matters\nGetting attacked triggers a Counter-Attack, allowing you to still be on the offensive even during the enemy's turn. But watch your back! Exposing your backside opens you up Back-Stabs that cannot be Counter-Attacked and cause greater damage.\nUse ranged attacks and high-ground to your advantage to attack enemies without them being able to reach you!\nPlay Your Cards Right\nChildren of Zodiarcs was heavily inspired by the tactical gameplay of tabletop card games like Magic: The Gathering.\nEach of your heroes has their own deck of cards for battle that you add to throughout the game. In combat you play these cards to perform attacks, use abilities, or cast spells. You can combine the effects of cards to create chain effects. Each card drawn from your deck opens up new tactics, making it a moment of great anticipation; that next card you draw may turn the tide of battle!  \nCards work together with dice. Some cards have special effects that are triggered with certain dice symbols.\nDepending on the dice results you get, special effects will be triggered\nYou will be able to customize your dice to support the deck you have built for each hero.\nBuild Your Deck of Cards\nNew cards are unlocked in Children of Zodiarcs for each hero as they level up, opening new deck strategies with each new card. Children of Zodiarcs has no microtransactions and there are no booster packs purchased with any form of paid currency in or out of the game.\nUnlock new cards are your heroes level up\nBetween each battle, you will need to revisit your deck in the Deck Builder to add or remove cards and craft that deck to match exactly how you want each hero to play. Each hero's collection of cards supports multiple play-styles. Play! Experiment! Share your builds with the world!\nDice-based Outcome\nLuck has always been a factor in tactical games in the form of success / fail percentages (ie: XCOM) or dice rolls hidden behind the scenes (every Dungeons & Dragons video game ever). Other than performing actions to try to adjust those percentages by a couple of numbers, you have little to no control over the outcome, let alone an answer as to why your 95% chance-to-hit missed!\n\"How did I miss on a 95% Success?!\"\nOur solution to this is to make those results obvious, intuitive\u2014and best of all\u2014to put the control in your hands!\nFirst, our dice do not determine ultimate success or failure, but instead reflect varying degrees of success and alternate outcomes. We use symbol-based dice, with each symbol having a different effect. This means that each dice roll gives you different outcomes that can benefit you in different ways.\nThe dice symbols of Children of Zodiarcs\nSecond, you will actually shake and throw the physically simulated dice in-game, creating a greater investment with the results you get. Be honest. How many of you have a special ritual when rolling dice? Do you blow on them? Shake them a certain number of times? We don't judge! :)\nShake and throw physics-simulated dice!\nWith these systems in place, the results feel intuitive and fair. Enemies also use the same system for rolling their dice, so there's no secret developer cheating going on here. BUT, our system of dice rolling has an ace up its sleeve! With each roll, you'll get a second chance to select which dice to re-roll. Maybe this time, you'll get that extra sword you were looking for...\nGet a second chance by selecting and re-rolling dice\nThis system of re-rolling came out of our lengthy prototyping period, but it was what really brought the idea of \"dice\" together, helping us find that balance between tactics and influenced luck. (Thanks, Sam and Denis!)\nCustomize and Craft Each Hero's Dice\nCustomization and influencing luck is a big part of the Children of Zodiarcs experience. Each hero is equipped with their own set of dice for combat, with dozens of different dice types available to choose from.\nA few of the dice types in the game\nAs you progress through the game, you will find randomly dropped Loot Dice. Equip these dice on your heroes to match the play-style of their deck of cards.\n\"Tank\" build or \"Combo\" build? You decide\nThe emphasis on dice is taken even further by letting you craft dice, customizing the symbols on each side. You will use collected Loot Dice as ingredients in the different crafting recipes. Through collecting and crafting, you can build the perfect set of dice unique to you! \nCraft dice and make them unique to your play-style!\nLong ago the Heralds came from a dying world, bringing with them the Zodiarcs: arcane machines that allowed the user's will to manifest as reality. The people of Lumus were in awe of the Heralds and made them kings and masters of the world. Thus began the Age of Apex, a time of incomparable beauty and advancement. The Heralds built great nations and the people prospered under their wisdom and guidance.\nBut the descendants of the Heralds did not share their ancestors' wisdom. They used the power of the Zodiarcs against one another in a terrible war that nearly destroyed everything, ending the Age of Apex.\nThe Coming of the Heralds\nOver time, the people of Lumus forgot about the Heralds and their Zodiarcs, the ruins of ancient cities buried under mountains of sand and rock. But eventually they were uncovered, and their secrets revealed once more. The ruined temples of the Heralds were rebuilt, and their stories told again. Zodiarc Relics from the Age of Apex were reverse-engineered and their power harnessed. Lumus stands again at the doorway to a new golden age, a time when anything is possible...\nTorus, Heart of the Empire\nThe corrupt Toran Empire has harnessed the power of the Zodiarcs to swallow up much of the world, draining resources and profiting from the misery of the conquered. At the heart of the empire lays the city of Torus, a place where rich and poor are polarized to their limits. \nToran Conquerers\nHere are a couple of the Torus districts you will visit in Children of Zodiarcs.\nThe Nobles' District - In the gilded towers of Torus' Nobles' District, opulence is everywhere. The treasures of a dozen conquered nations clutter their residences while decadence and entertainment dominate their lives. The pleasure chambers, hanging gardens, and menageries tell of the nobles' disinterest in the banality of common life, to the point that they carelessly dump their uneaten table-scraps down to the Shambles below.\nNobles' District\nThe Shambles - The majority of the city's population occupy the ground level beneath the shadow of the Nobles' District. Virtually abandoned by nobility, the people who built Torus are supported by neither the taxes of the Empire nor the protection of the Army. Left to survive by their own means, the Shambles are overrun with crime and violence, but there is still joy in these blood-soaked streets, evidenced in the vibrant music and colourful murals of people struggling to find meaning in an uncaring world. \nThe Shambles\nThe Underworld - Below the streets of the Shambles is a world lost in shadow. Once the guts of an ancient city from the Age of Apex, it now crumbles away like a forgotten mausoleum. Here, huddled beneath giant turbines and stone aqueducts, are the untouchables of Torus\u2019 social order. Traitors, liars, cheats and murderers, too vile even for the low standards of the Shambles, with nowhere else to escape to. Rumours of their foul lifestyle abound, but not many can truthfully claim to have seen them and lived to tell the tale...\nThe Underworld (click for more art)\nMusic is one of the big reasons we're such lovers of the JRPG genre. Some of the most amazing and memorable soundtracks in all of video games have accompanied JRPGs.\nFor Children of Zodiarcs, we wanted a soundtrack just as memorable, so we're working with award winning Vibe Avenue for music composition. Vibe Avenue shares our deep love of JRPGs, and they jumped on the chance to help us create Zodiarcs. Here are a couple of samples of music already composed for the game.\nMight of the Toran Empire\nLegend of the Zodiarc Mirror\nChildren of Zodiarcs is being developed by a core team of industry veterans coming to you from the production trenches. We are lead designers, lead programmers, and writers from the AAA space. We've worked on such games as Eternal Darkness, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, The Warriors, and Far Cry 3. Combined, Cardboard Utopia represents 60 years of game development experience across 35 shipped games.\nPrevious games the core team have worked on\nBeing able to involve the community in the development of a game is a big reason why we moved from AAA to indie. As recent history has shown, Kickstarter is an incredible way to do just that. This is mainly why we are coming to this platform.\nThe second reason we are coming to Kickstarter is to make the game greater. In the spirit of openness, we already have the initial funding necessary to make the core of Children of Zodiarcs. We are fully committed to bring this game to life, and with your support we can extend the length of the game, add new playable characters, and expand the numbers and types of abilities giving each hero more cards to bring into battle. Onward!\nKickstarter funds breakdown\nSquare Enix Collective is an indie outreach platform where independent game projects can get direct feedback from Square Enix Fans.\nBack in September, 2014, we ran a campaign on Square Enix Collective where we received a 93% approval rating, the highest rating at the time and still one of the highest to date. Because of the awesome response Children of Zodiarcs got from the Square Enix community, the Collective is helping to spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign. Just to be clear, we do NOT get any money for being a part of the Square Enix Collective. The funding we already have comes from the Canadian government, our own personal funds, and an investment from Execution Labs, an accelerator for indie game studios.\nSquare Enix games like Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Tactics, Dragon Quest, and Tactics Ogre stand out as some of our favourite games of all time. They gave us some of our greatest video game memories. Being involved with Square Enix Collective is a huge honour and a fantastic way for us to connect with fellow fans of the genre.\nDigital Copy of the Game - A digital copy of the game available to be downloaded upon release through the PlayStation 4 store, Steam or a DRM-free alternative.\nYour Name in the Credits - See your name in lights. Or, well, on a screen... It doesn't have to be your actual name, but cannot be the property of someone else or anything offensive.\nDigital Soundtrack - A digital copy of the Children of Zodiarcs original soundtrack by Vibe Avenue for you to listen to when you aren't playing the game.\nBeta access - Help us make Children of Zodiarcs the best it can be! You will get early, pre-release access to the game to help us tune, balance, and bug test the game. While the Beta will be near completion, it will still be an in-progress build with bugs and balancing issues. Available for PC first, followed closely by a Mac version.\nPostcard Signed by the Team - We mail you a rad 'thank you' postcard with original art from the game, signed by the core team.\nAlpha Access - Be among the VERY FIRST to play Children of Zodiarcs. You will get access to very early builds of the game and be able to give us feedback. This early version of the game will be gameplay only, no narrative, so it is intended specifically for fans looking to help us during the (barely) functional stages of game development. Available for PC only.\nDigital Art Book & World Guide - A digital (PDF) Art Book & World Guide for Children of Zodiarcs. The book will contain concept art, character bios, lore, and more!\nDigital Painting of You - Send us a photo and our artists will digitally paint you in the art style of the game.\nWall Poster - A sweet 11x17\" poster of original Children of Zodiarcs art for your wall. You can even choose to have it signed by the core team (optional).\nT-Shirt - Get a stylish, limited edition t-shirt designed by our Art Director, Erica.\nFinal T-Shirt Design (in both men's and women's cut)\nPhysical Copy of the Game - We send you a physical copy of the game in a cool case with original art designed by Art Director Erica. This is for all you old school gamers who like physical stuff. A PlayStation 4 physical copy is available!!\nName an Enemy - You get to name your very own enemy! Scattered among the rank and file enemies will be special, named units which will be stronger than the generic ones. Name them after you, after your dog, or make something up; it just can't be the property of someone else or something nasty.\nCome to the Launch Party - Like any good developer, we plan to party when the game is done. Come to Montreal, Canada and join the fun! Must be at least 18 years old. Travel and lodging costs not included.\nYour Name in the \"Designer\" Credits - We put your name in the game's credits under \"Additional Design\". It doesn't have to be your actual name, but cannot be the property of someone else or anything offensive.\nPhysical Art Book & World Guide - A physical (soft cover) version of the Art Book & World Guide. Will contain the same content as the digital version, but it will have that \"nice book\" smell.\nMini-Boss in Your Likeness - We put your face into the game. You will be one of the mini-bosses that players will encounter during battles.\nDesign an Enemy - We want you, yes, YOU! To work with us to design an enemy class for Children of Zodiarcs. There will be several different classes of enemies in the game and, with our help and guidance, you will design one of those enemies. Please note that this enemy will need to fit the game's art style and gameplay.\nDesign a Boss - Looking to help contribute to the game's design in a different way? Well, how about designing a boss enemy to stop those pesky thieves? We will work with you to design an awesome boss for all players to see and fight. Whatever your creation ends up being, it will need to fit the game's art style and gameplay.\nDesign a Playable Hero - This, this is the big one. With this backer reward, we will work with you to design a playable hero for all to see and play in a side campaign. We will help you nail down their look, story, and gameplay. Again, whatever the design, it will need to fit the game's art style and gameplay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPerhaps the single biggest risk for an independent studio is not having enough money to finish and release the game. We already have the funding to finish the core game, so whether this Kickstarter is successful or not, Children of Zodiarcs IS going to be finished and released.\n\nGame development, however, is a challenge. Combined, we have shipped a whole lot of games (around 35 titles) of all shapes and sizes, so we are well aware of this fact. Because of this, we have approached the development of Children of Zodiarcs with theses risks and challenges in mind.\n\nOf course, despite our experience, there will still be unforeseen issues that come up. This is where the other aspect of our depth of experience comes in: our ability to adapt. In the past, we have had to adapt to changing deadlines, budget cuts, crazy publisher 'requests', and shifts in game direction. Adaptation is a critical tool, and one that we have used a lot.\n\nWe have already poured over a year of blood, sweat, and tears (oh so many tears!) into this game. We will not let this game die before it's finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #66", "update_userinfo": "Get Your 2020 Vision!", "update_content": "Welcome to 2020!\nJanuary felt like it lasted the whole dang year!\nLuckily it\u2019s over and we\u2019ve got some news for all of you!\nIf you were part of a backer tier that was expecting a PS4 copy of the game, well, you\u2019ve either received it, or it\u2019s very close to being in your mailbox!

(And Mac and Linux!) \nHere's an EARLY in-engine visual exploration that our art team's been working on. It\u2019s still work-in-progress, not final\u2026 but we just had to show you guys!\n> WHERE\nThe BattleTech Universe is one of near-constant warfare and feudal political intrigue, where great noble houses vie for dominance of a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. It's a universe of flawed heroes, fallen empires and grey moral realities. Great families vie for supremacy, with alliances and betrayals constantly shifting the balance of power.\nThe Inner Sphere, circa 3025.\n> WHEN\nOur BATTLETECH game is set in the popular 3025 Succession Wars Era of the BattleTech Universe - often referred to as \"Classic BattleTech\".\nClick to view a timeline of the Inner Sphere. (2271 - 3025)\n> WHO\nThe project is led by:\nJordan Weisman, creator of BattleTech and MechWarrior, Shadowrun, Crimson Skies, and more.\nMike McCain, Creative Director of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed series of Shadowrun games.\nMitch Gitelman, Producer of the classic MechCommander series of tactical 'Mech combat games.\nOur studio, Harebrained Schemes, has delivered three successful Kickstarter campaigns - Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall, Golem Arcana, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong - to rave reviews and very positive responses from our Kickstarter backers. Kickstarter allows our studio to remain independent and to focus on making games directly for our fans.\n> WHY\nBecause we love BattleTech, and there hasn't been a turn-based, classic BattleTech game on PC in over 20 years! Above all else, our goal with this project is to deliver an authentic BattleTech experience. Accomplishing that goal isn't just about designing great 'Mech combat - it's about fully realizing the BattleTech Universe, its characters, its factions, and its stories.\n> HOW\nWith your help! CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING STAGE 4 - PVP Multiplayer!\nYou did it!\nBATTLETECH is in development for PC, Mac, and Linux in English and will be delivered in standard and DRM-free versions on Steam, GoG, and Humble stores. The game will also be made available in German, French, and Russian (with localized text, and audio subtitles) in a post-launch update. Other platforms and languages may be announced later. BATTLETECH is expected to launch in early 2017.\nBATTLETECH is set in a universe at perpetual war, fought by militarized factions utilizing huge, mechanized combat vehicles called BattleMechs.\nFollowing centuries of space colonization and the rise of six Great Noble Houses, treachery undermined the Star League and toppled its First Lord. The rulers of the five remaining Houses each proclaimed themselves the new First Lord, and so the Succession Wars began - hundreds of years of mechanized armies, scavenged technology, and political machinations.\nNow, in 3025, each faction is near its breaking point. An uneasy stalemate sets in as the Houses scrape to rebuild their holdings, reinforce their worlds, and restock their 'Mech armies. But the conflict continues as the nobility drives their agendas forward covertly through the use of mercenaries\u2026   \nWhether maintained by a House army, or passed down within a MechWarrior family from generation to generation, BattleMechs reign supreme on the thirty-first century battlefield. These massive weapon platforms - ranging from seven to sixteen meters in height, and twenty to one hundred tons in weight - form the backbone of the Great Houses' interstellar armies.\n'Mechs are rare, and often passed down from generation to generation within a noble family.\nOver the 200 years of the Succession Wars, attrition has eaten away at the resources of the Great Houses, and the number of working BattleMechs on the field has dwindled. By 3025, field-ready 'Mechs are a precious commodity, and keeping them running is a tactical necessity.\nWe're excited that Piranha Games, creators of MechWarrior Online, are sharing their incredible roster of Inner Sphere BattleMech models with us for BATTLETECH. Not only are their 'Mechs wonderfully detailed, using the same models adds to the continuity of the BattleTech Universe.\nWe\u2019re also very happy to be working closely with Catalyst Game Labs, publisher of the BattleTech tabletop board games and novels. Even though Jordan created the BattleTech Universe over 30 years ago, the talented folks at Catalyst have been the keepers of the flame for years, and we appreciate their help in ensuring that we deliver an authentic BattleTech experience.\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big dreams for an amazing game.\nWe know that to do 'Mech combat right will be a substantial investment - in fact, Harebrained Schemes has budgeted over a million dollars to self-fund the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME (see below), and we've already started pre-production. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve scoped the project appropriately, and that we can deliver this version of the game without any Kickstarter support.\nBut, we also know that BattleTech isn't just about big stompy robots battling it out. There\u2019s so much more we\u2019d like to include in this game! A full single-player campaign. Full control of your career as a mercenary. PVP Multiplayer. That\u2019s where you come in!\nThe scope of this project expands in the four major FUNDING STAGES below - so that no matter which funding level we attain, we\u2019re sure to deliver a great game worthy of the BattleTech name. Help us co-fund BATTLETECH and let\u2019s see how big this game can get!\nNaturally, 'Mech combat is the cornerstone of any great BattleTech game, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting development. HBS is self-funding a complete 'Mech battlefield experience in the form of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME.\nOur goal is to craft a combat system for BATTLETECH that\u2019s the perfect blend of tactical depth, speed of play, and meaningful unit customization. As we did with our Shadowrun games, we intend to capture the *spirit* of the original tabletop rules, while designing the best PC game we can. That said, Shadowrun and BattleTech are very different games! For one thing, Shadowrunners like to hide behind cover, while \u2018Mechs\u2026 squash cover. Expect turn-based combat in BattleTech to feel very different than a more cover-based combat system like Shadowrun\u2019s\nOn the battlefield, you'll command a Lance of four 'Mechs in turn-based combat. We\u2019d like a typical skirmish to be complete-able within about 30 minutes, without sacrificing the tactical depth that any BattleTech game demands. All of our systems will be designed with a \u201clayered\u201d approach in mind - surfacing the information you need for quick decision-making, while also allowing you to drill-down into detailed stats and unit management options.\nThink of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME like a personal 'Mech command simulation - you\u2019ll be able to set the parameters and difficulty level of each skirmish game, challenging yourself to defeat larger and larger AI-controlled enemy forces over more and more difficult terrain. Or, choose from a variety of pre-built combat encounters created by our design team.\nBetween skirmishes, customize your BattleMechs in the 'Mech Bay. Choose from over twenty-five 3025-era Inner Sphere 'Mech chassis, and configure the weapon loadout, armor, heat sinks, and paint scheme for each. If you want to dive even deeper, tweak their engine, gyros, actuators, and shock absorbers - all of which will impact the 'Mech\u2019s battlefield performance in different ways.\n\nIn the Ready Room, select the best pilots for the 'Mechs you\u2019ve configured. Each MechWarrior will have their own 'Mech and weapon specializations, as well as certain special abilities that can be used on the battlefield. \n\nOh, and one more thing: we want to put the PUNCH back into BattleTech. This game will include MELEE COMBAT and DEATH FROM ABOVE!\n\n>>> STAGE 1+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$250,000 - Combined Arms: We'll add a healthy roster of non-'Mech AI opponents to the Base Skirmish Game including tanks, hovercraft, support vehicles and more. But be careful - even the lightest of combat vehicles can still wreck your 'Mechs under the right conditions. \n$400,000 - Expanded Mission Objectives: We'll add a variety of mission types to the Base Skirmish Game including Escort, Capture, Defend, and more. \n$500,000 - Expanded Environments: We'll add a wider variety of battlefield environments to the game, including time-of-day and atmospheric conditions that affect both movement and combat. Confront enemy forces in the low-visibility conditions of a blizzard on a frigid ice world, or carefully manage your heat in a battle across volcanic fields.\nThe BattleTech Universe is all about stories - of nobles and MechWarriors, fighting to protect their people and their homes. Of mercenaries, surviving from battle to battle in a war-torn universe. It\u2019s a dynamic science fiction setting filled with intrigue and cutthroat politics that spans centuries. It\u2019s a shared universe that has evolved over 30 years, in tabletop miniatures games and sourcebooks, novels, comics, and dozens of computer games. We want to honor that history and make this perennial game setting come to life with a killer single-player story campaign.\nOur STAGE 2 STORY CAMPAIGN will put you in command of your own mercenary outfit, as you find yourself inexorably drawn into a bloody dynastic conflict set in the Periphery of the Inner Sphere. Over the course of the campaign, you\u2019ll manage the finances and logistics of your mercenary outfit - from the modifications and loadout of your 'Mechs, to the salaries and skill growth of your MechWarriors.\n\nA mercenary Lance of MechWarriors prepares for battle.\nAt the end of the day, the life of a mercenary is all about money: the money needed to repair the damage your 'Mechs took in combat, to pay your MechWarriors to keep fighting, and - if you\u2019re lucky - the money to put towards buying new 'Mech chassis and weapon systems. Fortunately, 'Mech components salvaged from the battlefield can be both cheaper and better-performing than the oft-refurbished parts available for purchase.\n\n>>> STAGE 2+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$1,100,000 - Cinematic Transitions: We'll add short cutscenes for various events in game - such as deploying your forces to the battlefield - and for key moments in the single-player story.\n$1,200,000 - Player-Character Origin Stories: In BATTLETECH, you\u2019ll create your own mercenary character to star in the story. If we hit this funding level, you'll be able to choose one of six origin stories for your mercenary commander's career. Are you the only heir of a once noble family that has since fallen from favor? The bastard child of a famous MechWarrior? You decide.\n$1,350,000 - Voice Acting: We'll record a cast of talented voice actors to act as your advisers, provide mission briefings, and record battlefield emotes. We\u2019ll also add voice acting to the animatics for important moments in the story.\n$1,550,000 - 3D MechWarrior Portrait Customization: We'll build a complete 3D portrait customization system for you to customize the look of both your MechWarriors and your own Mercenary commander.\nThe STAGE 3 EXPANDED MERCENARY CAMPAIGN puts you in full control of your life as a Mercenary. The campaign becomes open-ended, allowing you to charter JumpShip transport for your mercenary outfit when needed - travel to various hot-zones across the Periphery and Inner Sphere. You\u2019ll be able to choose your contracts and alliances, with both the Great Houses and other subfactions within the Inner Sphere.\nThe emblems of the five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere.\nOver time, the missions you choose to accept and the objectives competed in those missions will determine your reputation as a mercenary. Your reputation will affect the contracts and contract terms you may be offered in the future. But be wary: each Great House - and in some cases, each House representative - can have their own agendas, sometimes leading you into bad deals or deadly betrayals.\nTheir negotiations complete, a Davion liaison officer briefs a merc outfit on their mission.\nTo support this open-ended Mercenary career, STAGE 3 adds a wide variety of \u201cside-contracts\u201d in addition to the story campaign, as well as a procedural contract-generation system to ensure that you always have fresh contracts available, wherever your Mercenary career may take you.\n>>> STAGE 3+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$2,000,000 - Customizable Home Base: As part of the ongoing campaign, you'll acquire a home base (likely in the form of a derelict DropShip) for your mercenary outfit to call home. At this funding level we'll also allow you to adjust its appearance, repair and upgrade its functionality, and grow and evolve your base as your outfit grows and evolves.\n$2,150,000 - Legendary 'Mech & MechWarriors: In addition to the game's standard 'Mechs and customizable, procedurally-generated MechWarriors, we'll include rare legendary 'Mechs to find, and rare hero MechWarriors to hire - including some famous characters from BattleTech history. Such legends may not stick around for long, but will be well worth hiring if you can afford them.\nThe neutral planet of Solaris VII is home to the Inner Sphere\u2019s most famous gladiatorial 'Mech combat arenas. Here players can challenge each other to casual PvP battles or enter our matchmaking system to be matched against an appropriately experienced opponent. \nEach Great House maintains an embassy and a namesake arena on Solaris VII and each has very different gameplay features - from the Roman-inspired Steiner Coliseum to the frozen glaciers of Davion\u2019s Boreal Reach (or one of Davion\u2019s many other holographic environs).\nTournaments and Leagues will reward the victor with various prizes and Leaderboard fame.\nJon Everist, composer for the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is creating the music for BATTLETECH. We\u2019re very excited to continue our collaboration with Jon and you can hear his first BattleTech tune in our Kickstarter video!\nInstead of throwing a bunch of random tchotchkes into this campaign, we've focused our physical reward efforts on two really awesome reward levels that we know we can deliver (in addition to all the great digital rewards we've created.)

The Fun's Not Over!\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar is an RPG inspired by the classic console greats, featuring deep dungeon diving, turn-based combat presented in a classic JRPG format, and tons of secrets, story and randomly-generated replay goodness.\n\nNightwar is currently planned for release on PC and Mac, both on Steam and DRM-free on GoG, as well as Xbox One and PS4. (Look for other platforms to possibly show up in our stretch goals!)\nThe game is being created by ex-Vigil Games veterans, including two of Vigil's co-founders, Joe Madureira and Ryan Stefanelli.\n\nLike the greats that came before, the soundtrack will be something special.\nDigital Artist Edition Battle Chasers #10\nWe are about to drop some additional items to the add-on store, one of which will be an awesome new pencils-only \"artist edition\" of Battle Chasers #10, featuring a full book of Joe's beautiful and uncolored pencil work. This new add on is now automatically included in the COMPLETE DIGITAL EDITION and above! So if you've pledge for the Complete Digital tier or beyond, you're already covered. The digital book is yours when released!\nNew Tier - Signed Battle Chasers #10\nThose keeping an eye on the page may have noticed a new tier with a signed copy of Battle Chasers #10. This book is also included in the Landmark Edition and above! Unfortunately we can't edit the tier descriptions to reflect this, but if you were one of these supporters, you will now also get this signed book!\nJoe Mad Originals!\nDarksiders Crossover Exclusive!\nIn partnership with our friends at Nordic Games, and for our Kickstarter backers only - a unique weapon skin for Garrison featuring the one and only CHAOSEATER from Darksiders! Every backer will get one, and ONLY our backers.\nSpecial shout out to Nordic Games for doing this for our fans!\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar is a love letter to one of our favorite genres of gaming: the JRPG. We grew up playing legends like Final Fantasy, Suikoden, Chrono Trigger, and Phantasy Star. While many greats continue to come from Japan, very few western developers are creating them. \nWith your help, we're going to change that.\nPlan for survival. The desolate town of Harm's Way is your only place to prepare. Choose three of the many heroes you've unlocked, fill your travel backpack with items from your stash, make sure you've chosen the best equipment and abilities for each hero... and then strike out.\nExplore an overworld presented in classic form, peppered with hidden dungeons, rare bosses and randomly appearing friends and foes.\n  Old-school combat inspired by the console RPG greats, with a unique two-tiered mana system and turn-based initiative, featuring random buffs and debuffs on initiative slots\nAction oriented, randomly-generated dungeons loaded with traps, puzzles and secrets. Use each hero's unique dungeon skills to survive!\nNon-linear story driven by the discovery of lore on items, landmarks and secret elements in the world. Discovering these will both provide deeper insight into the mysterious Lost Vale, and also reward lore points, which are used to upgrade the heroes' different abilities\nTruly key story moments will be depicted in gorgeous, traditional 2D animation from Powerhouse Animation Studios. For these, sit back and enjoy.\nThe Lost Continent\nThe Grey Line. An impenetrable wall of mist hovering over the West Waters, stretching endless from north to south, and towering from ocean crest to dark sky above. \nNothing has ever come from, or survived entering, the historic monolith. The great hero Aramus felt a calling from the Grey Line and crossed, despite the dangers. And like countless warriors, vagabonds, fugitives and fortune seekers before him, never returned. Now, his daughter Gully and her unlikely band of adventurers venture into the mist to uncover her father\u2019s mission. \nAlong the way they'll meet friend and foe alike while piecing together the silent history of the Grey Line, and the dark secrets within.\n\nLearn a bit about the heroes of Battle Chasers!\nThe turn-based combat in Battle Chasers is inspired by the great JRPGs of years past, with three major features: the Dual Mana system; an  Active Initiative Bar with random buffs and debuffs; and momentum-shifting super attacks called Battle Surges.\nAbilities\nAbilities are unlocked when a hero levels up. Each can eventually unlock more abilities than there are slots to equip them, so choosing can be difficult. \nBlue and Red Mana\nThere are no basic attacks in Nightwar. All abilities either consume mana, or generate red mana.\nBlue mana is the core resource pool, with red mana acting as a backup or bonus pool.\nIf a hero runs out of blue mana, they can generate red mana as a way to perform their most powerful attacks. But red mana can take time to generate, and is lost at the end of a battle. Using it carefully can preserve the core blue mana pool or allow a spent hero to continue fighting.\nEach hero reacts to red mana use in a unique way. Garrison's abilities are more effective when using red mana, so building it is encouraged (though his base mana pool is much smaller). Knolan is better off using blue mana and suffers penalties for using red. Calibretto is healed slightly when using red mana. \nThis is the primary strategy of resource management in Battle Chasers: Nightwar. \nInitiative\nKey to survival is managing position on the initiative bar. Initiative determines order, but the slots can also appear with randomized effects which activate when a hero performs an action in that slot. These can be beneficial or harmful, and even be based on the environment you're in. Deep swamp? Beware the poisoned gas debuff that may appear on slots.\nAbilities have different speeds which affect initiative position, making it possible to strategically position yourself (or your enemy) into a slot that's helpful. This is most important in the highest dungeon difficulties.\nDungeons are a random arrangement of hand-crafted rooms, overflowing with traps, treasure, puzzles and lore. Monsters are visible on the map and exhibit unique behaviors when aggressive.\nTouching a monster initiates the turn-based combat system, featuring big and bold characters on gorgeous 2D backgrounds.\nRandomness and Rarities\nThe enigma of the Lost Vale means no two dungeons are alike.\nRooms move, yes. But so do monsters, traps, treasure, secrets, rare vendors, shrines, NPCs, puzzle elements and resources.\nReturn to a dungeon after successfully surviving once, and the option to change the difficulty is unlocked. This increases the difficulty as well as the reward... and the chance for rare artifacts and NPCs to appear.\nBeating each dungeon on the highest difficulty setting is the only way to truly see everything Nightwar has to offer.\nSurviving\nPrepare carefully before entering a dungeon. Death means losing everything not equipped on your characters. And when every dark corner leads to another menacing creature or lethal trap, death may not be so infrequent.\nNot all is so bleak. Every dungeon has a single rest point, where you are given the chance to replenish all your resources and stash a few items for safekeeping, so they aren't lost upon death.\nYou can do this once per dungeon. Good luck.\nDungeon Skills\nFortunately each hero is equipped with a unique assortment of dungeon skills to aid in the adventure. These skills include the basic but necessary - lock picking, treasure finding, and dashing - to the less ordinary: invisibility, teleportation, blinding and more.\nLore\nEverything from landmarks to torn scraps of paper have a story to tell in Nightwar. Finding these will reveal more and more layers of the narrative, but they also provide lore points of varying value, which are used to upgrade abilities on the heroes. \nKey Cutscenes & Traditional Animation \nKey moments will be depicted with killer 2D animation from Powerhouse Animation Studios. It's the Battle Chasers heroes like you've never seen them before!\n\nAbilities \nAbilities unlock as heroes level up. Players can choose which abilities a hero leaves town with, however the slots are limited so choices will be difficult and based on overall party makeup. \nPerks\nPerks award passive bonuses and are arranged in a tree. As players move into a new tier of the perk tree, ability slots are unlocked.\nPerk points can be earned a number of ways: leveling up, finding rare lore relics, and as rewards for killing rare bosses to name a few.\nArmor and Weapons\nThe world is littered with rare and powerful items. Weapons, armor, trinkets, and more are dropped in combat, found in chests, or found tucked away in dark and powerful corners of the world.. Vendors, some rare and hidden, can offer up some of the most powerful wares.\nThe Legendary Comic Series continues!  \nYou thought it would never happen. So did we. Alongside the release of Battle Chasers: Nightwar, new issues of the classic comic series will continue where the story left off. \nWritten and drawn by original series creator Joe Madureira, these new books mark his long-anticipated return to the most cherished and iconic work of his career.\nVisionary comic artist Joe Mad and design veteran Ryan Stefanelli were two of Vigil's founding members, creating and shipping Darksiders and Darksiders II. \nSteve was one of Vigil's first hires, where he instantly proved himself invaluable as an animator. He worked on almost all of the bosses in Darksiders, so if you were cursing and throwing your controller, you can partially blame him. \nBrooks has a long history in programming, having written entire game engines from scratch and performing as a lead programmer on Vigil's MMO, Dark Millennium online. His first company, Professor Fog's Workshop, gave Ryan his break into the industry - hiring him as an intern over 15 years ago.\nJesse was an environment artist at Vigil before heading to Digital Extremes to further cut his teeth on Warframe. He rejoins his old comrades at Airship to help make our \"moving concept art\" philosophy a reality.\nOur history working together allows us to develop games instinctively, making quality stuff quickly. \nWe love this stuff.\nWhy We're On Kickstarter\nEvery member of the Airship team has shipped big, AAA titles, many from soup to nuts. We understand the trials and tribulations of game development at every stage.\nWhat you are funding here is the core experience for Battle Chasers: Nightwar; the foundation for a great RPG. We hope that by reaching our true fans and hitting through some stretch goals, we can take the game even further.\nWe've gotten this far using a combination of our own sweat equity, personal investment dollars, and some savvy angel investment. So you aren't paying for the entire thing: we've already put a lot in.\nWe've had faith from day one that our team, plus support from our fans, can take us across the finish line. We believe the goal of true independence can become a reality through the power of Kickstarter.\nDelivering a great game to our backers will always be the number one goal, however. And should there be unexpected challenges, we have a number of options at our disposal, including taking on more investment or a even a publisher.

It's more than a camera bag, it's your day-to-day essential carry workhorse, and it does things other camera bags can't.\nIt comes in Charcoal...\n...and in Heritage Tan...\n ...and it will make your everyday carry experience wonderful, no matter what you're doing.\n                                                                                             When something is \"totally dialed,\" that means that every last bit of it does its job perfectly and fits together flawlessly. This bag is totally, indubitably, unequivocally dialed. See why:\nTo reiterate:\nIt adapts to your gear and lifestyle.\nWhat do all camera bags have in common? Foam cubes. Big ones. Bulky ones. Square ones. What do all cameras and lenses have in common? They're not square.\nFlexFold\u2122 dividers: instantly customize them to organize your gear and maximize your space for everything else. Fold 'em over and stack gear on top. Note that the final divider color is the same as the rest of the inner bag.\nLike we said before, The Everyday Messenger is not just a camera bag, it's an everyday bag. And since no two days are quite the same, we designed a shell that expands greatly to accommodate the perpetual \u201cone last thing,\u201d and also lets the bag maintain its shapely figure when your load is light. \nFlexFold\u2122 dividers allow the bag to expand and contract depending on load. Typical camera bag dividers are about 3x the thickness and designed to have a fixed width. Note: final divider color will be the same as the rest of the bag interior.\nThe semi-rigid shell expands from a capacity of 13.5L to 20.5L without the need for slack material. \"I like a floppy messenger bag,\" said no one, ever.\nLastly, it adapts to your activity too. No more switching bags when you travel or hop on your bike\u2014one bag, with straps that let you wear it in a multitude of ways.\nThe main strap is made of internally-padded seatbelt webbing, and it adjusts for messenger or shoulder carry style. Removable stabilizer strap can also be worn as a waist strap to take weight off your shoulder.\nCarrying a tripod? We've got you covered. Slip your tripod leg through the sleeve in the main flap, fold the flap over, and place the silicone band (included) around your tripod legs. Carry a tripod will full access to the rest of your bag.\nThe versatile straps can be configured for easy, secure luggage carry. Use the shoulder strap to sling your bag around large rollers, or use the stabilizer strap as a standard luggage band.\nIt gives you instant access to everything you need.\nYour hands are always full. Full of cameras, toddlers, beer...sometimes all three. Hence we invented a new way to open and close a bag:\nThe patent-pending MagLatch\u2122 is a digital-safe magnetic latch that opens/closes securely, blindly and one-handedly. It can latch onto 4 different catchpoints, depending on your carry load. There's no other piece of hardware quite like it.\nStill, you don't always have time to open a flap. Unlike traditional messenger bags, The Everyday Bag has quick-zip access to the main compartment, as well as an outer pocket layout designed around the workflow of photographers, commuters and travelers.\nFront access panel has 8 stretchy mesh pockets for bits-n-bobs. Water resistant top zip gives instant access to main compartment. See images at the top of the page for final interior pocket colors.\nWhat's faster than getting your camera from inside your bag? Getting it from outside of your bag. Peak Design started as a company that made Capture\u00ae, a clip that lets you carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Naturally, we had to incorporate the perfect Capture attachment point:\nYou'll find 2 diagonal straps on the side walls, designed for attaching the Capture Camera Clip. Keep your camera secure/accessible and free up carry space. Capture is included in our $375 Reward, and also available in our Add-On Menu below.\nA dedicated, protected 13-15 inch laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve and document pocket makes this truly an everyday bag, even if you're not carrying any photo gear.\nThere's a clever place for every bit and bob imaginable, like the pen sleeve in the laptop compartment and the Anchor link key/ID tether in the side pocket.\nIt protects your stuff like a boss.\nOur favorite messengers are roomy and built to repel water, mud and unwanted flotsam. Our favorite camera bags are padded and protective cradles for our digi-babies. The Everyday Bag had to be both.\nThe shell, made of lightweight Kodra\u00ae synthetic canvas, is waxed and DWR-coated to repel water. It also contains high-density tessellating foam pads to protect from bumps and bruises.\nThe super soft poly-spun twill interior is soft on your photo gear, but will hold up to years of stuffing and re-stuffing your bag with you-name-it.\nBar-tacked stress points, reinforced with ultra-tough Hypalon. Beautifully anodized aluminum hardware.\nWe built The Everyday Bag to last a lifetime. In fact, we guarantee it will.\nIt looks totally dialed, with zero slop.\nDangling strap ends, cheap internal fabrics, cookie-cutter plastic hardware...these are what we call \"slop.\" Many bags out there have slop because it's cheap and it's easy. We designed this bag with a strict no-slop policy, and the result is a product that looks, feels and functions like a premium product should. \nNo corners were cut in the building of this bag.\nThe form of The Everyday Messenger took a cue from the past, incorporating timeless elements and shapes from classic messengers and camera bags. Then we fused that with modern materials, custom hardware and Peak Design\u2019s less-is-more aesthetic.\nYou use the inside of a bag just as much as you do the outside. So, we designed an inside that you'll want to look at again and again.\nClassic lines and textures, but with refined hardware and technical materials.\nWe\u2019ve created 2 color schemes - Charcoal with red accents and Heritage Tan with blue accents (shown above). Pledge now, choose your color when the campaign ends.\n                                                      Behind every good bag is a wing-bag. The Field Pouch\u2122 is a manager of cords, hard drives, toiletries, socks, Pogs slammers and all those other pesky doo-dads that can\u2019t seem to get along with the big boys.\nHello. Is it keys you're looking for?\nKeys, hard drives, laptop chargers, pens, and even small lenses can fit inside the stretchy mesh pockets that line its interior.\nThe Field Pouch fits in both the main compartment and the front panel of The Everyday Messenger. It\u2019s made from the same materials, contains 5 stretchy mesh pockets, and holds a lot or a little without losing its shape. It also comes in Charcoal or Heritage Tan.\nStowe The Field Pouch in the main and front compartments of The Everyday Messenger.\nLike its big bro, The Field Pouch expands and contracts depending on what's in it. It saves you space and saves itself from looking embarrassingly floppy and misshapen. Note that this animation depicts an older prototype.\nYou can even attach Peak Design straps to the Pouch (via Hypalon loops on either side) and attach Capture on the front Hypalon strap. It becomes the perfect excursion bag for you and a mirrorless camera.\nAttach any Peak Design camera strap to The Field Pouch and have yourself the perfect excursion bag, which is a type of bag that is not at all like a man-purse.\nThe Field Pouch and The Everyday Messenger. 2-gether 4-ever.\nTo pre-order The Everyday Messenger, click the button below and pick a reward that contains The Everyday Bag. Simple as that. If you want more stuff that isn't in your reward, then follow the instructions in our Add-On Menu (scroll 2 sections down). Once you have pledged, sit back and relax.

Throughout our campaign we'll be updating backers with footage of our latest production units and having live Q&A hangouts with Trey Ratcliff and the PD team.\nNot sure how the Add-On Menu works? Scroll down below.\nWant to add additional items to your reward like another Everyday Messenger or Field Pouch? Perhaps you want to add on a Capture clip, so you can carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Either way, adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level.\nEverybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward\u2014you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. For example, you cannot order the PD Dream Pack and switch out CapturePRO for an extra Slide. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.\n2. If you want to add something, check out the Add-On Menu.\nIf (and only if) you want something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a Peak Design product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry. We will give you a chance after the campaign is over to add additional products to your shipment for a special discount. See the FAQ for further explanation.\n3. Relax, you're done for now.\nAll details like shipping information, color preference and add-on specifics, will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended in late September.\nCaptureLENS and Lens Kit are 2 new products that let you change and carry lenses easier than ever before. Watch this video to see it in action:\nWe launched CaptureLENS halfway through this Kickstarter campaign, and right now it is only available to Kickstarter backers through our Add-On Menu. Instructions on using the Add-On Menu are above, and below, and in the FAQ. How's that for a helping hand?\nIn our opinion, CaptureLENS + The Everyday Messenger is the most convenient, rapid-fire lens changing solution in the world.\nRight: Lens Kit has loops for attaching Peak Design Anchors, letting you sling a spare lens across your body. Left: CaptureLENS works on any belt or strap.\nOther specs you should know about CaptureLENS:\nIt works with Canon (EF mount), Nikon (F mount) and Sony (E and FE mount) lenses. You'll specify which mount you need in our post-Kickstarter survey.\nCaptureLENS ($80 add-on, $90 MSRP) includes a standard Capture clip (nylon backplate) plus a Lens Kit adapter plate. It does not include a plate for camera bodies.\nLens Kit ($40 add-on, $50 MSRP) includes just the adapter plate. It's for people who already own (or plan to own) a Capture clip. Lens Kit is compatible with all versions of Capture.\nHow to pre-order CaptureLENS and Lens Kit:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that. Join at any reward level (or, don't select a reward level). Already a backer? Click here instead.\n2. Add $80 to your pledge (for CaptureLENS) or $40 (for Lens Kit). You can add those funds when initially backing this project, or you add them after the fact by clicking \"Manage My Pledge\" at the top of the page.\n3. You're done for now. After this project is complete (late September) we'll send you a survey where you can specify which model you'd like.\nSlideLITE is a new camera strap designed specifically for mirrorless and small DSLR cameras.\nFor those familiar with our other camera straps (all of which were launched here on Kickstarter) SlideLITE sits smack-dab in the middle of our lineup. Not too bulky, not too skinny, it's perfect for your ultralight mirrorless companion.\nSlideLITE contains the same adjustment hardware that Slide does. But SlideLITE is a skinnier 3.7cm (1.25\") and does not have internal padding.\nWear SlideLITE as a sling, neck strap or shoulder strap. It connects to your camera with our patent-pending Anchor link quick-connect system. And, it looks damn good.\nHow to pre-order SlideLITE:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that. Join at any reward level (or, don't select a reward level). Already a backer? Click here instead.\n2a. Add $50 to your pledge. You can add those funds when initially backing this project, or you add them after the fact by clicking \"Manage My Pledge\" at the top of the page.\n--OR--\n2b. Choose the $375 reward or higher. You now have the option to choose SlideLITE instead of Slide in these rewards.\n3. You're done for now. After this project is complete (late September) we'll send you a survey where you'll specify that you want a SlideLITE.\nSlideLITE will ship with the rest of our Kickstarter rewards, by December. Want SlideLITE sooner? Pre-order it from one of our retail partners. There's a list of them in this update.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Peak Design's 5th Kickstarter project. We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues, and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders for our new products. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science. While this ain't our first Kickstarter rodeo, our forecasting capabilities aren't the same as what you might expect from a big company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk \nAs Peak Design continues to mature we're getting better and better at managing our supply chain. For example, two years ago we set up two fully-operating parallel supply chains to shore up our ability to make quality products, at high volumes, on time. We're totally stoked on how far we've come. But it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new parts doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

Earlier this year, I returned home to Berlin, Germany after 10 weeks in Sri Lanka \u2013 exploring the cities, mountains, coasts and countryside, eating and cooking with the locals everywhere, and riding lots of buses, trains, rickshaws, scooters and boats all over the country.\nSince then, I've been recreating the insanely delicious eats, writing up new recipes inspired from the trip, spending hours at my art desk and computer with the illustrations and design, and photographing all the dishes for my next cookbook: The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA!

I've met many in my travels, particularly in Germany and France, but also in North America, and Asia. After so many great conversations and meals, I knew I had to see their homeland!\nThe Food: Sri Lankan food is unique in its flavors, freshness, and creativity. It has tastes and touches of other Asian styles \u2013 South Indian & Thai in particular \u2013 but usually uses different, often simpler cooking methods and an exciting array of other spices and flavor combinations. I've had some absolutely amazing meals at Sri Lankan and South Indian restaurants all over the world. Taking a culinary adventure through Sri Lanka plus eating and cooking with the locals was something I'd wanted to do for years! After one week in Sri Lanka I was already certain it would be the focus of my next cookbook.\nThe Culture: Sri Lanka's history and mix of cultures are intense. It's a land of amazing, elaborate temples \u2013 mostly Buddhist and Hindu. It's a place of contradictions where modernity meets antiquity and tradition. Elephants and Hybrid automobiles share the streets. It reminds me of India in so many ways, but it's like a slowed down version.\nThe Landscape: The mountains are gorgeous, the hillside with their rolling tea plantations are amazing, the cities have their charm, the towns are quaint. The beaches and islands are beautiful, and especially peaceful and wonderful \u2013 if you seek out the hidden treasures.\nLearning new kitchen skills during a homestay in Galle Fort, Sri Lanka\nKolja helping out in the kitchen at Shiva's in Upuvelli, Sri Lanka\n4 curry & salad Sri Lankan Dinner Party for visiting friends\nJust some of the delicious RECIPES...\nJackfruit Curry\nMasala Mushroom Dosa\nCauliflower Cashew Korma Curry\nRed Beet Curry\nMango Pineapple Curry\nPumpkin Dal Curry\nCabbage Curry \u2013 Mellum\nRocket Coconut Curry \u2013 Gowa Atu\nSpicy Seitan Kottu & Vegetable Kottu\nWild Greens & Ginger Mango Dressing\nLotus Root Salad \u2013 Nalum Ala Salada\nCoconut Carrot Radish Salad\nIdly & Vada \u2013 Rice Lentil Dumplings & Fritters\nSri Lankan Crepes \u2013 Vegetable Roti & more\nStreetfood Vegetable Rolls\nDeviled Chickpeas \u2013 Kadala Thel Dala\nHoppers & String Hopper \u2013 Appa & Idiyappa\nCoconut Chili Chutney (Pol Sambol)\nCoriander Chutney\nMango Chutney\nLadoo Sweets\nDelicious Date Cake\nCoconut Pockets\nTapioca Pudding \u2013 Payasam\nCoconut Rice Syrup Squares \u2013 Kalu Dodol\nBanana Pancakes\nSpiced Coconut Pudding \u2013 Watalappam\n...and many more!\nDeviled Chickpeas (Kadala Thel Dala)\nWild Greens & Ginger Mango dressing\nDal!

Easy! Because I love it! Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarters, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nIn my studio\nOriginal Ebook & T-shirt from my 2012 Kickstarter (This T-Shirt design will be one of 4 available as rewards from this project)\nT-Shirts from my 2013 Kickstarter project (This will be one of 4 designs available as rewards from this project!)\nTote bags from my 2013 Kickstarter project\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation!\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO! which was published in English & German in 2014.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations and shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nCooking Show at Veganz in Hamburg on the Vegan Zombie Germany Tour\nHanging out with local farmers in Lagos before my cooking show at the World Veg Fest\nTHE TIMELINE\nSEPT 2012: My first Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nDEC 2012: 1st English edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures published.\nMARCH 2013: My second Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nMAY 2013: 1st German edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden published. 2nd English edition printed.\nOCT 2013: The Lotus and the Artichoke nominated by VEBU (German Vegetarian Association) for Best Cookbook of the Year; wins a spot in the TOP 10 COOKBOOKS of 2013!\nMARCH 2014: Return from 3 months in Mexico.\nSEPT 2014: Germany Tour with The Vegan Zombie \u2013 Cooking demos, dinner parties, cookbook signings & other events in 9 cities in 11 days. 3rd printing of The Lotus and the Artichoke in German!\nNOV 2014: The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO! printed in German & English.\nMARCH 2015: Return from 10 weeks in Sri Lanka.\nMAY-AUG 2015: Art, Cooking, Writing, Photography & Production of The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA!\nSEPT 2015: Expected publication of The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA in German & English\nTasting Cupcakes with Nicole Just, bestselling author of La Veganista\nDr Mudar Mannah (Happy Cheeze), Yancey (CEO Kickstarter) and Me!

I have an emergency extra delivery of English SRI LANKA books arriving on Tuesday so I can post the last Trinity Rewards and Trinity Master Set rewards."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 86, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/justinpmoore/the-lotus-and-the-artichoke-sri-lanka-vegan-cookbo", "project_name": "The Lotus and the Artichoke -- SRI LANKA Vegan Cookbook"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Kickstarter campaign might be over, but you can still support this game on our website.\nAn isometric open world action-RPG in a corrupted world falling apart. You are a former officer of army of the Human Republic, forced to flee the death penalty because of the magic powers you have unwillingly developed. Being tracked down by humans and hunted by the monsters of the Wild, you are recruited by a mysterious group of Templars. And thus an epic adventure begins in which you will wander the world to fight inhuman, mutated monsters and discover the terrible secret of the extinguishing mankind.\nThe game features a unique mechanic called Apocalyptic Form that allows players to shape shift into a highly customized character! You\u2019re free to mold your character thanks to a deep and rich customization system. And thanks to our complex crafting mini-game and our housing module you will be able to make your adventure feel as YOUR adventure!\nUmbra aims to deliver many features that will differ from the classic games of the genre:\nOpen World : Discover the world and enjoy it at your own convenience\nExploration and experimentation is rewarded with new powers, attributed according to your play style!\nFree character development - No class limitation. You have three resources: Rage, Stamina and Mana, and they all interact with each other in order to balance gameplay.\nApocalyptic Form: According to your play style, you will develop special powers for your character, changing their abilities and look. Fierce melee warriors may gain a third arm to equip with a new weapon; a fire caster will have their skin turn into lava, healing from fire. Even wings and horns might appear depending on your actions!\nTons of Loot: Weapons, Armor, Potions and randomly generated magic effects for more gameplay diversity!\nSemi procedural Weaponry: Blades, pommel and guard details can be randomized for more unique gear in the game!\nAdvanced Crafting mini-game: Build your own weapons and armors thanks to a complex and challenging module in Umbra\nTons of Destructible environments: From small walls to complete parts of an area. We hope you enjoy it!\nHousing: Create your own house and proudly showcase your special gear!\nMature story full of secrets to discover exploring the world\nKythera AI system: The automatic real time navigation adaptation of Kythera adapts to any change in the physics of the world, allowing us to create exciting scenes including large portion of levels collapsing or moving and fighting on the back of giant creature, creating never seen before gameplay situations!\nDungeon challenge (Stretch goal): Transform a special part of your house into a dungeon and challenge other players to survive the onslaught!\nMultiplayer mode (stretch goal): Multiplayer is an ambitious goal we would love to achieve, but it must be done correctly. We plan to have different interesting stretch goals for you that will allow us to build the foundation of the multiplayer. In the best case scenario, we would like to have the following modes: Dungeon Challenge, Co-Op, and Competitive Plaver vs Player vs AI.\nA Different Hack & Slash\nThe scenario is an important part in Umbra, because understanding it will allow you to unlock secret areas with massive rewards. For example, helping an NPC who got lost in a hostile area may grant you with precious information about the game\u2019s story, and this may lead you to a hidden place full of treasure. If you just want to kill monsters you don\u2019t have to worry because you can focus on that. But Umbra will become even more interesting if you embrace the game\u2019s story!\nQuality of action, loot and personalization are keys for a good Hack & Slash game. By mixing these three elements, we designed the Apocalyptic Form feature, that will allow you to hand pick \u201cmutations\u201d for your character, such as wings or horns, and create a powerful war form for your character, affecting both your look and play style.\nWe are mixing the freedom of Skyrim, the action style of Diablo 3, the ambience of Diablo 1, the graphical power of Crysis, and adding our very own features on top of all that to come up with a unique and powerful gameplay!\nThe corrupted Human Republic is falling apart: Starvation and disease are ravaging mankind, leading to violent riots everywhere.\nIn order to maintain their grasp on the population, the Republic is using vicious tactics, poisoning the population to weaken it and removing all children from their parents to better mold their minds. Newborn babies are rare, and few are born healthy.\nAn unknown curse has made men lose their memory, provoking a limbo that has eaten their own history and technological knowledge.\nRumors say that the leaders of the Republic signed pacts with occult entities, and monstrously mutated humans are appearing in the wild, leading raids against cities and villages.\nFood became rare, leading to an extreme measure. In the name of survival, the Republic declared that anyone over the age of 50 should be killed. The same rule applies to anyone presenting mutation.\nThe Hero\nYou are a former officer of the Republic who developed magical powers. You tried to hide it, but your hierarchy found out. Instead of directly killing you, they tried to capture you and lead experiment on your body.\nYou managed to escape and take refuge in the wild. There, you were attacked by a large pack of the monstrous creatures. Outnumbered, you were about to fail when the mysterious order of the Templars saved you.\nWe want our quests to be memorable. We want you to fight on the back of giant walking creatures. We want you to defeat bosses that will collapse the ground under your feet.\nSecondary quest and random bounties will also be available and rewarding. They will usually be quick to execute, to make sure you can have fun if you don\u2019t have a lot of time to play.\nIf the funding follows, we would love to allow you to build your own dungeon using a system similar to our housing module, and challenge other players to defeat it. We already have the tech to do it... we only lack the budget to create more visual content.\nThe game will include a large open world featuring various environments, from swamp to mountains, to ancient ruined cities, forests and villages. If you want to spend a lot of time exploring the world and performing side quests, it is up to you.\nHumans populate most of the universe of Umbra. Other races exist, but are hiding because of the savagery of mankind. Most of the human population has actually forgotten about the existence of said races. Tales about dragons exist, but none have ever seen them in the flesh. The fact is that the Human Republic has conquered most of the known world and eradicated all of the potential concurrent living entities...\nThe CRYENGINE allows us to build a huge and beautiful world, full of dynamic vegetation. The game will feature a time of day mechanic that will influence gameplay as well. For example, some enemies will only appear during the day, others will try ambush you at night, and some secrets may only be revealed at a specific time!\nOpen World\nThere is a huge world to explore, and some areas of this outdoor environment will be randomized, so you will not see the exact same layout every time you start a new game.\nThe basic map size is of around 4 square km, and the world can be extended and grown if we reach specific stretch goals. The world will be alive and full of interesting locations to discover. And don\u2019t worry, this is a hostile world and enemies will be everywhere!\nIn addition to the huge map, players will be able to find several entrances to caves or ruined cities. These entrances will usually lead to a randomly generated dungeon, thus bringing more variety to the world each time you begin a new adventure.\nRandomly Generated Dungeons\nAs mentioned before, cave entrances in the open world or bounty quests will lead you into randomly generated dungeons. These levels not only look different during every game, but the game mechanisms inside these level may also vary during each run.\nRandomly generated dungeons are designed based on hand-made presets, with randomized elements thrown into the mix. We chose to do it that way in order to always control the render and the lighting of our scene because we want to exploit the rendering capabilities of the CRYENGINE as best as we can. For those who are interested in a more technical look at our Dungeon Generation technique, you can check some of our documentation about it at our DevBlog!\nFreedom of Development\nYou can build your character as you want, picking any skills, weapons or armors and making the combination of your choice. There is no class restriction. However, there is a price:\nResource Opposition System\nThe gameplay is balanced by three ressources:\nRage: Used for powerful melee attacks. You gain Rage by attacking enemies.\nStamina: Used for escape and assassin type skills. Stamina Regeneration is effective when your character doesn\u2019t take any damage.\nMana: Used for magic skills.\nAs stated above, Rage is gained by attacking enemies, but when you gain Rage, your Stamina and Mana will be reduced, and their regeneration rate will decrease. When you use Mana, your Rage bar will deplete faster.\nYou are responsible for your play style. If you keep attacking enemies with melee attacks, your Stamina will deplete, and you won\u2019t be able to cast an escape skill to avoid the deadly strikes from your enemies. It is up to you to balance your Build.\nOf course, there will be many ways to \u201chack\u201d the Resource Opposition System thanks to Active and Passive Skills or by carrying the right piece of equipment, so you\u2019ll definitely find a way to get things just right for your style.\nFire, Frost, Water and Lightning\nYou are free to use skills and spells as you want, but just like the Resource Opposition System, element-based spells will react to the environment and to other active elements in the area. For example, Lightning will spread in water and stun targets; Fire will spread unless water or frost gets in the way, ect...\nApocalyptic Form\nApocalyptic Form is a unique feature in Umbra making all players unique in their look and powers.\nWhile you are playing at a low level, all important actions of your character are recorded. Based on said data, we will generate specific powers for your character, called Apocalyptic Upgrades. At higher levels, every player\u2019s Apocalyptic Form should differ according to their story and play style!\nApocalyptic Form Concept\nHere are some example of Apocalyptic Upgrades:\nDemon wings: You can perform huge leaps and crush the enemies around you. You will also be able to access areas unreachable to other characters\nThird Arm: You have a third arm, and you can equip a new weapon for it.\nHorns: Run everywhere and rush into enemies to knock them down, crushing their faces while they are on the ground!\nBody of Fire: You won\u2019t take damage from fire anymore. Actually, fire will heal you. But beware of frost! You\u2019ll also leave a trail of fire on your path.\nBody of Shadows: You get a huge boost to your attack and movement speed and to your critical strike chance bonus while you are in a dark area. You also have a great dodge bonus.\nAura of Death: Undead raise everywhere you walk.\nHorrifying visage: Enemies have a chance to run away in fear when they see you.\nIncreased size: You are bigger. Your strength and Constitution get a huge percentage bonus.\nTornado: Reaching high speed will turn your body into a tornado, attracting every enemy around.\nOf course, there will be more powers to discover by yourself!\nAn Apocalyptic form is created with three of the available powers, but some items or passive skills may allow you to choose additional ones. Entering your apocalyptic form will grant several bonuses for a certain amount of time, but by combining Skills and Items, maybe some of you will find a way to make them last longer!\nActive Skills\nActive Skills are regular magic spells, assassin skills or special melee moves your character will use. They are usually paid with Rage, Stamina or Mana, but some can also be paid with Health Points or might simply have a long refresh countdown.\nActive Skills are found in the game by looting books. When you read a book, it is destroyed, and you gain a new skill. This skill will level up if you use it effectively against enemies.\nSkill Modifiers\nActive Skills can have their effects modified by special items in the game, usually with what we call Soul Gems. Soul Gems are socketable items with unique powers.\nThe effects of Skill Modifiers are different according to the targeted skill, but their effects are always powerful. A fireball will burn everything on its path, projectiles will bounce on enemies, and electricity-based skills may strike lightning everywhere in a large radius.\nThese Soul Gems will be numerous but will have a corresponding rarity, and they will be dropped by enemies according to your play style, so you will not find useless Modifiers for your build.\nPassive Skills\nPassive skills are a very important side of your character\u2019s development because each point you invest will drastically change you character\u2019s abilities. You will gain one passive Skill Point from each level up.\nPowers you may gain from the Passive Skill Trees can be very helpful and powerful. Some examples of the powers granted by Passive Skills are: \nAbility to have one Two-Handed weapon in each of your hands (because, why not?)\nAdditional Skill Slots on the Skill Bar\nIncrease the number of mercenaries following you\nStats increase\nArmor bonus from Health points (ideal for tanks)\nBonus damage against enemies in Fear\nCharacter Stats\nEach level, you will gain 5 points to invest in four different stats:\nStrength will increase your damage with melee weapons, how often your strike can stun enemies without using any special skills, and is also an important requirement to use the heaviest weapon and armors.\nDexterity will increase your chance to passively dodge enemy attacks or projectiles, how often you can perform critical hits, and increases your attack rate and movement speed.\nConstitution defines your resilience, increases your Health Points and Health Regeneration, passive Stamina recovery and resistance to various types of attacks.\nPower defines your ability to harness magic energy and it will increase the power of your magic spells and your Mana Points and Regeneration.\nCombining the effects of Stats, Passive Skills and Mutations will be a key element for your character\u2019s evolution. Combinations can be created to transform your character into a brutal force of destruction or to make him a vicious and elusive assassin!\nAllies\nMercenaries can follow you in your quest. By default, only one can follow you, but Passive Skills may increase that amount. You will be able to customize the armor and weaponry of mercenaries to complement your own powers!\nYou can also have an animal companion that will automatically sell your items in town, attack enemies and even immobilize some of them. If you feed them, they may start to dig for items, and they could even bring you great loot!\nUmbra WarDog - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Wizard or Higher!\nZombie WarDog - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Monk or Higher!\n   \"War Dog\" and \"Wolf\", exclusive animal companion skins for Kickstarter backers!\nFire Wolf Pet Skin - Kickstarter exclusive for those at BEAST TAMER TIER or higher!\nFrost Wolf - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Duke or Higher!\nCreating Your Gear\nCrafting in Umbra is a unique mini-game designed to put you in the role of a smith. In order to forge a weapon or an armor, you will first need to gather all the requested ingredient. Once this is done, you will use them in the Forge Crafting module.\nThis mini-game is designed as a rhythm game simulating the hammer of a smith hitting the metal. Crafting can be frustrating because failing a recipe will destroy the ingredient, but it can also be very rewarding thanks to the customization and the possibility to hand-pick magical effects if your skill is good enough!\nA Stretch Goal we would love to achieve would be the ability to play the crafting module on your smartphone or tablet, and be able to bring your creations into the game!\nWeaponry System\nUmbra allows you to really personalize every detail of your weapons. Weapons are built from several elements. For example, a sword is usually built with a pommel, a blade and two guard elements. Each component of a sword has its own attribute, allowing a huge amount of different possibilities and optimizations.\nWeapon Stats\nWeapons in Umbra have a lot of different parameters. If you are a casual gamer, you may just care for damage and attack speed of your weapon, but the most hardcore one will love to check every stat our weapon system provides.\nEach of these stats will vary according to the weapon type and the crafted quality!\nAsymetric Armor System\nWe love asymmetric armor, and we want you to be able to customize your gear down to the finest details! You will be able to equip different shoulders and arm protection on the left and right side of your character, bringing a great number of personalization options!\nThese armors will be exclusive for Kickstarter backers! Check the Priest, Month and Duke tiers!\nSocketable Items\nSocketable items are precious stones or gems you can socket into your gear, upgrading each piece with new magical effects. There are three types of socketable items in Umbra:\nPrecious Stones: These items have predefined magical bonus.\nRare Jewels: These items have randomly generated bonus effects.\nSoul Gems: These are the most powerful gems, carrying unique and powerful powers, described in the \u201cUnique Items\u201d section below.\nUnique Items\nPotions are not items you can throw in Umbra. They are an important part of your build, just like a piece of armor or a weapon. Each potion can have various effects in addition to the classic Health / Resource recovery, such as a temporary attack or movement speed boost, invulnerability to elements, a search bonus, and so on. Potions can also be upgraded with Ingredients and special Recipes, granting them even more powers!\nVisual Design\nThe key idea behind the look design of our enemies is to make most of them look appear as tortured, mutated and dreadful humanoids. Terrible things have happened in the world of Umbra, turning normal people into inhuman and monstrous creature.\nEnemy sketches\nGameplay\nWe try to give every enemy its own set of powers. Each of one is supposed to challenge a side of your play style. Each one has advantages and weaknesses, and groups of enemies always feature a combination of various powers to make sure you face a a decent difficulty level.\nBosses are impressive, powerful, hard to kill entities, and they will always use the environment to challenge you.\nYou will be able to create your own house, build its walls and floor, add various kind of furniture, and showcase your best weapons and armor all over the place!\nSome achievements in the game will also allow you to unlock new furniture for your house to present your success to the world! Trophies and statues of your past victims can also be built if you have enough resources for it!\nMultiplayer is a very important aspect of Hack and Slash games, but also a complicated feature to setup because of the testing and balancing required.\nWe would love to develop a Multiplayer mode for Umbra, but we want to do it right, and that means additional development costs. For that reason, Multiplayer implementation is divided into different Stretch Goals:\nCreating a global leaderboard: All players will have to register on a server to be displayed in the leaderboard. It will allow us to develop ladders and cheat protection.\nHousing visit: Players will be able to visit each other\u2019s house. The most popular houses will be featured on our website!\nDungeon challenge: Things become serious here. You will be able to build a dungeon and challenge other players to defeat your setup. Tease them with precious items as reward for winners. And in order to participate, players need to pay in gold\u2026 and if they\u2019re defeated they will end up losing even more gold!\nCo-op: The classic Multiplayer mode!\nPlayers vs Players vs AI: A competitive multiplayer mode in which a group of players will have to complete a mission before an opposing team. And each team will have the ability to create traps or to use the roaming enemies to slow down the opposite team!\nWe want to self-publish the game, and we are asking for your help. In return, we want to build the game with the community.\nIn the following months after the Kickstarter campaign, we will release the prototype or Umbra (basic moves, spells, and gameplay will be implemented). It will be a glimpse into the future game. Most features are not implemented in this version, but you will be able to destroy enemies with powerful weapons and amazing magic effects. This will be available for those at the Wizard tier or higher. The prototype of the game will be limited to PC. \nThe Early Access will start with the Alpha release for backers at the Sorcerer Tier and at higher tiers. It will start with new content that will be the basis for the final game, including the beginning of the open world. This will be released to backers around November 2015!\nOnce that most features are implemented, and we consider we have a stable build, the Beta version will be launched for backers at the Apprentice Tier and at higher tiers.\nWe are using CryEngine EAAS\nAll key members of the team have years of experience working professionally with this engine.\nCRYENGINE offers us a great system for rendering, lighting, animation, particles effects and more. It allows us to forget about creation the technology for the game so that we focus on MAKING the game. \nThe amazing real-time environment we can create will allow us to present a beautiful world full of life and wonderful magic effects.\nIn real time, Kythera AI System adapts to every change in the world without any additional setup, allowing level designers to quickly test and reshape their work.\nThe amazing part of Kythera is that this system also works in the final game! So when a bridge explodes, AI will still find a way to come and beat you! It also means that scenes including moving platforms or walking on the back of giant creature without QTE is possible!\nWe are using the most cutting edge scan data available to create rich and high fidelity environments, with the help of early access to the Quixel Megascans library. It helps us as a small indie team to create really high quality graphics in a short amount of time, on par with AAA projects\nExocortex Species is a great tools for our character creation pipepline, allowing us to quiclky model and integrate new enemies in Umbra!\nSolarFall Games is a new indie studio born from the passion for creating the type of games we ourselves would love to play. All key members of the team have several years of experience working professionally with the CryEngine. That\u2019s how we met, and soon after we started to design Umbra during our free time. About a year ago, we left our jobs to focus our entire time on Umbra. \nWe are full indie. There are no publishers or private investors behind us. We had several possibilities to fund the game that way, but it would have meant losing control over our project and we decided we would prefer to remain 100% independent. So far, the game has been funded from our savings. \nReady to meet the team? \nPart-time staff members also works on the game: Alexandre Le Corre and Romain Pommier as Concept Artists, Jonathan Colin and Aurore Fiorini as Animators and Nathanael Fis as 3D Modeler\nUmbra\u2019s development started more than 4 years ago and hasn\u2019t stopped. It was originally supposed to be an open source RPG development platform for Crysis Modders, but was quickly oriented towards the Hack and Slash variety.\nFor Umbra on KS we joined forces with PR Hound, indie gaming gurus who have worked on several projects like MyDream, InSomia, Planets\u00b3, Animal Gods and Dungeons of Aledorn, to name a few. They know how to make the most out of what a Kickstarter campaign can offer and they definitely helped us us to get a ton of media coverage!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHack and Slash releases require a large amount of content and a high replayability value. We\u2019ve spent years on the game focusing on creating the right pipeline tools we could use to maximize our working time. All the team has great and valuable experience with the technology we are using, and we think it will minimize the risk involved in the development of our game.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is not being able to deliver the game on time. For that reason, we try to not make any crazy promises. Our Kickstarter is designed to build a solid game, and all stretch goals will contribute to making it better. We carefully picked the amount of money we need for a minimal team, and planned the potential extension of the team with the funds from stretch goals.\n\nWe do not have other financial backing, but this is a choice made in order to remain in full control of the game. We are confident in our game and are working hard to expand it and to make it even better. \n\nAs for Umbra itself, performance will be a very important focus for us. We have a good relationship with Crytek, and they love the fact that we are small indie team achieving great result with their engine. We know we can count on them for help for the optimization of our game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #122", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter pets and armors have been sent", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nAll the extra-keys have been sent to Adepts+ and Archbishop+ backers based on the email you provided in your surveys.

We'll also develop additional status effects for crashing, withdrawal and addiction.\n$280,000.00 New Game Mode: Sandbox Mode, in Customizable Worlds\nWe will create a new game mode: an indefinite mode, set in a world that you can customize as you wish (larger, smaller, more dangerous, less food, more Wellies, etc).   \n$315,000.00 Extra Uncle Jack Shows\nMore Uncle Jack! We'll go out and take an additional set of Uncle Jack shows, to be seen in-game.

In them, each member of the team explains what they've been working on during the week (what new props are being added, new concept art, how the A.I is progressing etc...). You can check all of the previous entries here!\nWe Happy Few is the tale of a plucky bunch of slightly terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful delusion. Set in a drug-fuelled, retro-futuristic city in an alternative history 1964 England, you\u2019ll have to blend in with its other citizens, who don\u2019t take kindly to people who don\u2019t abide by their not-so-normal rules.\nIt\u2019s a first-person game, set in a procedurally generated, fully 3D city that you must escape before society collapses around you. But, like any good roguelike, you\u2019re probably going to die a few times before you figure out how it all works. \nYou will need to learn how to conform and avoid suspicion. You will need to hunt for supplies, and craft the devices and weapons that enable you to make it out of town alive. What do the Wellies approve of you doing? What makes them suspicious? What turns them into a homicidal mob? And is there anyone here who can help you?\nWelcome, my friends. It\u2019s another fabulous day in Wellington Wells.\nIn We Happy Few, your main minute-to-minute need is to avoid suspicion. The Wellies really hate Downers, and are very touchy if they think you might be one. But, if you don\u2019t draw too much suspicion, they\u2019ll just wish you a \u201cLovely day for it!\u201d, and go about their day. Do as the Wellies do, and you should be fine. However, if you act like a naughty Downer and, say, break into a house in front of them, they\u2019ll desperately want to make sure you take your Joy, with extreme violence if necessary, and all their friends will help them. Ha ha ha, what fun!\nThis isn\u2019t stealth - this is hiding in plain sight. We Happy Few is a game about blending in, while you look for a way to escape.\nEverything is perfectly fine - Concept\nOnce they start coming after you, you\u2019re going to have to fight, run, or hide. Combat isn\u2019t easy - you\u2019re not a superhero who can reload a saved game, you\u2019re just a normal person trying to survive in a crazy world. Alternatively, you could craft an escape mechanism or take Joy to blend in\u2026 but every option comes with some sort of disadvantage. And usually, because you have one life, you\u2019ll want to be very, very careful about what you\u2019re doing.\nIf you die, or win, you\u2019ll start a new game, in a brand new Wellington Wells. The world will change, so only through understanding the systems inside the game and how they work will you be able to win. Winning the game requires getting good at stealth, conformity or combat (hopefully all three), while learning what you can and can\u2019t get away with.\nIt\u2019s another harsh, but fabulous day in Wellington Wells.\nIn We Happy Few, you play as a Downer - someone off their happy pills. We have three Downers for you to unlock and play:\nWhat a handsome bunch of Downers - Concept\nOur playable characters are not typical video game heroes - they are flawed and not particularly heroic, warped by the trauma their world has been through. They are haunted by terrible things they\u2019ve done in the past, and they each have something they urgently need to accomplish.\nEach one has a story to play through. Their stories all interweave, so by playing one character, you can unlock new ones. And, each character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, which change how you play the game.\nOur stories are definitely Not Appropriate For Children, unless your children are already reading Neil Gaiman novels, in which case, good on you. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all frowns and sadness! It\u2019s also laced with dark humour, hope, and even a spot of redemption.\nYour average Wellies - Concept\nOf course, you\u2019re not alone in Wellington Wells - you\u2019re surrounded by its people, the Wellies - regular lads and lasses just wandering about their day. They are enthusiastically happy and friendly, at least until they suspect you haven\u2019t taken your Joy. Then they tend to get a little bit violent. They\u2019re like that friend of yours that just won\u2019t shut up about that thing they\u2019re into, except that the Wellies get quite a bit more violent if you dare challenge their world view.\nYour not-so-average Wellies - Concept\nWe also have a bunch of special NPC types, who\u2019ll make your life a tad more difficult:\nThink you\u2019re tough? Try fighting a Bobby. \nThink you\u2019re sneaky? There\u2019s a kindly, Nosey Old Lady who is always sticking her nose where it doesn\u2019t belong. \n Think you\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re on Joy? The Doctor can practically sniff you out.\nDepending on how you like to play, some of these will be more dangerous than others.\nThe early bird gets Jack - Concept\nFinally, we can\u2019t complete this section without Uncle Jack, the proud, smiling face of Wellington Wells. Everywhere you go, he\u2019s there to say good morning and he\u2019s there to say good night. He is there to make you laugh, to make you smile, and to remind you that things really aren\u2019t all that bad, and sawdust really is a very filling substitute for bread. Always so happy. So, so happy.\nIt\u2019s just another fabulous day in Wellington Wells.\nLocated in the southwest of England in 1964, Wellington Wells is a city haunted by the ghosts of its recent past. In 1933, this world deviated from our own, and the Germans successfully invaded and occupied England during World War 2. Most of England is rubble, as is a fair part of Wellington Wells.\nThe Garden District, Home of the Wastrel - In-game\n However, during the Occupation, the Wellies all had to do A Very Bad Thing. To calm their anguish and guilt - and forget what they\u2019d done - the Wellies invented Joy, the miracle happiness drug, that obviously has no side effects whatsoever.\nThe Village of Hamlyn - In-game\n They set about rebuilding their town, and along the way, got a bit carried away with technological research and development. So, the Wellington Wells you will see is a combination of areas ravaged by war, and areas rebuilt with futuristic \u201cmodern\u201d technology.\nThis might not be a good trip... - Concept\nOr is it? - In-game\nIn We Happy Few's psychedelic, retro soundscape, we're embracing the musical revolution of the 60s. For example, in the Village, our ambient theme takes inspiration from early 60s space-enthused electronic music, while the Wellies listen to the ultra perky 60s pop, mod, and lounge that is pouring out of the Village speakers and televisions. Our composer and sound guys have been doing a lot of experimentation with vintage 60s instruments (such as mellotrons and other things we secretly suspect aren't real instruments) and recording techniques, and we're very excited with how this will shape the atmosphere and tone of our happy yet unsettling world.\nIt\u2019s a really groovy, fabulous day in Wellington Wells.\nWe began building prototypes for We Happy Few in January 2014, and built the team throughout 2014/early 2015 to get us to where we are today. We\u2019ve embraced open development, by showing the game really early on, posting consistent updates, and getting feedback from friends and family. We spent a few whirlwind days at PAX East in March, where we got insightful and challenging input from hundreds of gamers on a very early build. Afterwards, we invited a small gang of contest-winners to continue playing We Happy Few throughout development, and we\u2019re just starting to get their feedback now.\nAs a whole, this community feedback has been awesome and has hugely helped us shape the development of We Happy Few. Which is why we\u2019d like to work with you and hear your feedback all the way to our release. Plus, right after the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll be offering backers who pledge CA$60 or more immediate access to the game, letting you provide hands-on feedback with every update.\nCommunity-focused development will take more time and money than just keeping our heads down and getting a game out. But it will help us to make sure that we\u2019re not missing any serious flaws \u2014 or great opportunities \u2014 and that we deliver on our ambitions.\nWe are Compulsion Games, a small studio of around a dozen game developers based in Montreal, Canada.\nWhat a happy bunch!\nTwo years ago, when we were just 7 people, we launched our studio\u2019s first game, Contrast (http://store.steampowered.com/app/224460/), which was a launch title for the Playstation 4. It also came out on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. We like to make games set in surreal worlds, with stories about emotionally interesting characters, great voice acting, hallucinatory art, and innovative gameplay.\nWe\u2019re also thrilled to be working with our partners and friends at Signal Space (Jose, Nic), who created the music and sound effects for Contrast. They have worked on a whole range of other games, including Deus Ex and Civilization 5, and they are just as passionate and cantankerous as we are. We\u2019re also working with a bunch of great London-based voice actors, and of course, Montrealer Julian Casey as Uncle Jack.\nFacebook - Twitter\nAs we\u2019re not in the business of making physical things, we decided to ask for the help of Luis and Shawn at Level Up Studios. These guys have previously worked on the rewards for the Awesomenauts Kickstarter (among others), and also look after other physical merchandise for the teams behind OctoDad and Guacamelee, and Vlambeer.

So, to get in the habit, we\u2019ve been practicing. In February, we started sending our monthly builds to our friends, family and more recently to PAX players, and are currently at Update #5. We also post a weekly review of what our team is doing, so that you can always check in on where we are with the project. We do our best to respond to everything on our forums and social media, and won\u2019t change that.\n\nOtherwise, games are orange alert territory - something might go down somewhere in some way at some point in time.

We are incredibly excited to begin this journey with you.\nYou can order the Roost Laptop Stand on our website.\nORDER THE ROOST LAPTOP STAND\n------------------------------\nOdds are, you\u2019re well acquainted with the neck and other pains that come with hours of leaning over a laptop. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way!\nThe new Roost Laptop Stand is the world's most portable, eye-level laptop stand that elevates your screen to prevent 'laptop hunch.' Used with a portable keyboard and mouse, or next to your desktop monitor, the Roost Laptop Stand transforms your laptop into a posture-perfect desktop workstation, literally anywhere.\nThe Roost Laptop Stand - On the Road\nThe Roost Stand - Packed Up and Ready to Go\nThe Roost Laptop Stand - In the Office - Standing Desk\n2,500 backers pledged to get rid their \u201claptop hunch\u201d for the Original Roost\u2019s Kickstarter back in June 2013. James and the team delivered the Roosts largely on-time. And customers were thrilled with just how awesome and helpful the Roost truly was.  \nWord spread quickly, and since then, 10,000 Roosts have been put to work relieving sore necks and supporting good posture.\nHistory - The original Roost Laptop Stand was created out of pure necessity. James, the Roost\u2019s creator, incurred so much damage leaning over a laptop, he lost the ability to type and was taking time off work to recover \u2013 all by age 26.\nThe solution prescribed by his physical therapist was to elevate his laptop screen to eye-level and use proper posture. James scoured Amazon for a suitable, portable device to accomplish this, but found nothing compelling. His inner engineer piped up \u2013 \"Build it!\"\nMeet the Need - The original Roost was made with a laser cutter, off-the-shelf parts, and a ridiculous amount of rivets. However, the evolution of its design was ultimately limited by this \"hobbyist\" manufacturing method that built it.  \nThe Evolution - The new Roost sheds all those limitations. It's been completely redesigned from the ground up, taking full advantage of high-performance injection molding.\nUPDATE 1: Add-Ons: Add $49 to your pledge for each additional Roost, Add $29 for each additional RKM Case.  \nUPDATE 2: Get your Roost custom engraved! Add $15 to your pledge now. We will collect your custom 35-character message via survey after the campaign ends. Corporate Branding: $10 per Roost, 4 Roost minimum.\nEasy to Use - It's simple: One easy motion opens and closes the Roost. You can stop the painful laptop hunch in seconds, and packing up is just as easy and quick.\nExtremely Portable - Get work done anywhere - The Roost Laptop Stand collapses into an impossibly small 1\" x 1\" x 13\" package and is a featherweight 5.8 ounces \u2013 it also comes with a Rip-Stop Nylon Carrying Sleeve.\nHeight Adjustable - Adjusting your workstation to match your body and environment is critical for maximum comfort and productivity. The Roost provides rapid height adjustment to fine tune your screen height to match your eye-level.\nUniversal Compatibility - Patent-Pending \"Pivoting Grips\" automatically adjust to fit your laptop's size and shape. \nExtreme Stability - Your laptop needs to be safe and stable when lofted up off the desk. The Roost's patent-pending Pivoting Grip mechanism securely latches on to your laptop, keeping it safe from unexpected bumps.\nYour Laptop Spill-Proofed - It's much cheaper to replace a keyboard than a laptop. Here's a good save from the original Roost Laptop Stand:\nKeep it Together with Optional RKM Case (Roost Keyboard Mouse) - Think: Your entire office in a super compact carrying case. The heavy-duty nylon RKM Case has a spot for your Roost, Bluetooth keyboard, and mouse. And the external pouch stashes your charging cables. You are ready to go.\n(RKM Case fits Original Roost as well)\nThe Roost Laptop Stand will be manufactured in partner with Alfred Manufacturing in Denver, CO, USA.\nAlfred Manufacturing is a 3rd-generation family-owned and -operated manufacturer with over 120 employees and 75,000 sqft of manufacturing floor. The Roost team is honored to have the opportunity to partner with a manufacturer so well known for exceptional production quality across every industry: aerospace, automotive, military, commercial, medical, sporting, motorcycle, energy (green, nuclear, fossil), turf and landscaping, and housing hardware markets.\nPlease stay tuned for future updates where we'll interview and get to know the people behind the machines and process that bring a product like the Roost to life.\nTimeline\nStay tuned for Project Updates that will dive into the engineering, design, and testing that went into making the Roost.\nRoost Press Kit:\nroo.st/press\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe new Roost has been extensively prototyped and tested, which means the final hurdle is translating its design into production tooling.

This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge.

The studio is in its 12th year of existence now, and has a proven track record for Kickstarter-produced games, having released Wasteland 2 to fan and critical acclaim and with a second project in production in Torment: Tides of Numenera.\n\nThe main challenge is indicating a fully accurate delivery date, which is not possible to do before we know how much funding we have. As funding increases, it allows us to increase the scope and depth of the product, but this will inevitably impact the release date. Our initial estimate is based on a $2.5 million budget game and we will openly communicate on changes to the release date as our project progresses.\n\ninXile has established revenue streams from its back catalog, including Wasteland 2, The Bard\u2019s Tale, as well as the upcoming Wasteland 2 Game of the Year Edition. This revenue is invested directly back into the games we\u2019re working on \u2013 we will be investing at least a matching $1.25 million should Bard's Tale IV fund.

Although the magi-crystals were fused with her body at a young age, for 10 years she lay sleeping while the curse matured to its full form. It was during this period that the demons arrived, meaning that she missed their appearance and awoke with a mild form of amnesia, not quite fully understanding what happened to her.\nShe is a woman of few words but strong of purpose. Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends.\nGebel\nOriginal host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet. Gebel (JEE-bill) was the only one to survive its effects at such a high level. He destroyed the guild that created him, but in doing so realized he was no longer human and had no place on Earth. This in turn, lead him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet.\nIt is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition.\nJohannes\nA member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel\u2019s best friend. Johannes (yo-HAH-nis) was the only Alchemist who dissented with the plan to call demons to the earth to cement Alchemy as the prevalent philosophy. His rejection of the other Alchemists\u2019 scheme is what kept him from sharing their fate. He has a vague understanding that Miriam\u2019s awakening and the demon castle\u2019s appearance are no mere coincidence.\nExploration: Bloodstained's story unfolds as you explore Gebel's hellish castle; a sprawling structure that features a variety of locations. As you explore the massive castle you'll find warp gates that will allow you to travel quickly without having to backtrack too much.\nRPG Elements: It's not an Igavania without leveling, and Bloodstained will be no exception. In addition to the classic elements everyone\u2019s come to expect, enemies in Bloodstained will drop a wide variety of items, materials, and magi-crystals necessary to create the items that will get you safely through Gebel\u2019s castle. \nCrafting: As you explore, fight enemies, and complete quests you will gain experience and become more powerful, acquiring a variety of weapons along the way. Enemies will also drop materials you can use to craft new weapons and abilities using Miriam's training in alchemy.\n\n \n \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDarkness lurks around every corner, seeking to corrupt all that it touches. The world is torn between those in power and those the powerful would destroy, and both sides are held in thrall by the demons lust and avarice. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be dishonest of us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nBut Inti Creates has shipped more than 30 games on eight different platforms, and Koji Igarashi personally oversaw the production and design of one of Japan's most legendary franchises. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the kind of game they love to make, and they've got a lot of experience making them.\n\nBetween us, the people behind this Kickstarter have helped to launch and fulfill several of the biggest, most complicated gaming Kickstarters ever launched. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it.) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIGA has worked for more than a year to prepare and gather support for this game because fans have asked him for it. Now that he's come to you for help, his goal is to make the game you've been waiting for. By backing this campaign, you'll become a part of the process. During and after the campaign he hopes to keep you involved, whether it's voting on swords and whips, telling us how you play his games\u2014as fast as possible, or exploring every hidden passage\u2014or helping us find the perfect style for the graphics.\n\nFinally, the possibility exists that a man scarred by unfeeling, power-mad alchemists could summon a hell-castle filled with demons across the street from Inti Creates headquarters in Tokyo. IGA has as much experience handling that risk as any game designer on earth, but we estimate that it might set production back slightly (depending on whether or not he's allowed to backdash).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #106", "update_userinfo": "Classic Mode and Kingdom Crossover Are Here", "update_content": "Hello, Army of the Night!\nClassic Mode and a new area and boss based on the hit game Kingdom: Two Crowns launched on January 14th.

We strive to design and produce custom mechanical time pieces of the utmost quality for an affordable price. We have teamed up with some of the best names in the industry and sourced parts from all over the world to make that happen.\nPrinceton, NJ and its surrounding area was once at the epicenter of the American Revolution. Washington's crossing of the Delaware in 1776 led to the battles of Trenton and Princeton and signaled the turning point of the war. \nBeing history buffs, we decided to name both the company and our first offering after Brigadier General Hugh Mercer - a key player in the battles of Trenton and Princeton. He was a doctor, a soldier and an accomplished leader.  While they didn't wear wristwatches in the late 1700s, the mechanical technology powering the watches we design has not changed much since the pocket watches of that time. \nThe Brigadier is a stylish automatic timepiece that embodies the mission of the Mercer Watch Co. No gimmicks, no gadgetry - just classic American design at a great price. \n The Brigadier has been featured on the following websites: \nWhile many small watch companies use generic or stock watch cases, we decided to go another way.  We designed and manufactured a custom case made from 316L stainless steel. This low-carbon \u2018surgical steel\u2019 is resistant to both pitting and corrosion, and is the same alloy used by the worlds best watch manufacturers. The case is rated at 10 ATM water resistance, meaning you can wear it while doing the dishes or for a quick dip, but you should avoid diving or other water intensive activities, especially considering the leather band. \nThe dimensions of the watch are enough to give it wrist presence, but not so large that it won't fit under your cuff. The leather strap is 22mm wide and 3mm thick. Take note of the polished and brushed surfaces of the Brigadier, an elegant detail adding to its classy appearance.\nDetails like a debossed crown and a case back precision engraved with our \"Revolutionary Soldier\" design will definitely grab your attention. \nCRYSTAL/DIAL\nWhile a mineral glass or plexi glass crystal would do the job, the Brigadier is constructed with a more expensive sapphire crystal for better scratch resistance. Moreover, the inside of the domed front crystal has an anti-reflective treatment, making the gently guilloched dial easy to read, even in difficult lighting. The dial is made of brass and is enameled for a matte finish. Applied stainless steel hour markers and numerals add depth. The dauphine hands, indices and rehaut are lumed with superluminova C3.   \nSTRAPS\nThe straps we have specified for the Brigadier are velvety soft 22mm wide suede.  We've decided to use curved spring bars to give the straps a nice integrated look as they meet the case.  \nMOVEMENT\nThe Brigadier is powered by one of the most reliable movements available today \u2013 the Miyota 9015. The 9015 includes a date window and beats at 28,800 vph, resulting in a very smooth sweep of the second hand. It is also shock resistant and hacking, making it one of the best values on the market. Best of all - no battery needed. \nWatch boxes are useless.  Your everyday, run of the mill watch box is huge, and serves no purpose after you get it home. We think we can do better. Therefore, every Brigadier will come shipped in a custom, zipper-closure leather travel case. Its reusable, stylish and guaranteed to take great care of your watch. \nAs of the start of this campaign we have produced designs, renderings and prototypes of both watches and packaging. Molds have also been created to produce Brigadier cases in bulk. The funds from this Kickstarter campaign will allow us to place orders with our manufacturing partners and begin mass production of the Brigadier and its associated packaging, as well as pay for shipping, warranty cards, etc. \nWith your help we believe we can reach our goal and realize our dream of providing watch lovers with a fantastic automatic watch at a fantastic price.\nFor our first stretch goal we will offering to upgrade case backs to exhibition case backs for all backers at no charge.  You will be able to purchase the original engraved case back if you choose at the end of the campaign.\nOur second stretch goal will be to decorate the rotors of the Miyota 9015.  This is a little more labor intensive as the movements need to be disassembled, decorated, reassembled and regulated, but this will go hand in hand with our display case back so it makes a great addition. \nFor our third and final stretch goal we listened to our backers.  The majority wanted more strap options, so if this campaign raises $100,000 we will be including both brown and black straps with each watch.

But nothing can prepare you for the depravity of deep space in STRAFE\u00ae.**\nThe story moves at the speed of STRAFE\u00ae.\nIt\u2019s your yearly scrapping mission, but this year is different. Your humble scout ship has been recruited to join the massive spacecraft ICARUS. They plan to head to far edge of the galaxy, to a remote sector where other scrappers have not yet dared to venture.\nThe rewards could be unimaginable. But so are the risks. It may be unexplored space, but it\u2019s a gamble you know you must take.\nYou lost.\nYou return from a run empty handed, but worse, ICARUS is no where to be found. You check your coordinates. You try the coms. No answer from your comrades on ICARUS. Yet their teleporter appears in-range and responsive.\nSo you grab a gun \u201cjust in case\u201d and teleport onto ICARUS. What could go wrong?  \nEverything goes wrong. This is STRAFE\u00ae. Prepare for hours of uninterrupted chaos that won\u2019t stop for storylines or anything short of a melted CPU.***  \nThe gameplay can never truly be mastered, because STRAFE\u00ae is never the same.\nYou start by picking one of three tools of death.\nSHOTGUN. Schklikt, klikt VOOMP\nMACHINE GUN. Brrrat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat\nRAILGUN. Vmmmm-PHT\nEach weapon includes a secondary firing method and is affected by two types of powerups as you progress through STRAFE\u00ae!\nCommon power-ups affect your weapon attributes such as magazine size, damage, reload time and firing speed.\nRare power-ups alter your secondary fire, like turning your machine gun into a mine launcher to set traps or splitting your shotgun flak at mid-range into a wider net of punishment.\nBut obviously STRAFE\u00ae must include more than three weapons. And it does. More are hidden throughout the world, including a secret SUPER WEAPON.\nAs a scrapper, you also collect scrap around levels and off enemy corpses to craft armor and ammo. Use it for protection, or sell it to merchants for credit towards perks and other power-ups that make you an evasive, agile killing machine.  \nDeath is on discount at the STRAFE\u00ae market. Buy now.\nTo survive in STRAFE\u00ae you adapt your killing methods as you go. You can avoid power-ups and perks if you choose, but be warned: when you die in STRAFE\u00ae, you die for real****. You restart at beginning and face a new level where\u2026\nEVERYTHING.\nHAS.\nCHANGED.\nFor the worst.\nLevels get painted red with the glorious permanent gibs of your enemies. Because when you draw blood in STRAFE\u00ae, the blood stays put as your twisted work of art.\nEvery shell casing. Every blown-off limb. Every drop of monster juice. It all persists in the environment and never fades away, disappears, or disappoints. Just as you\u2019d expect from a real-world massacre.  \nLearn more from a detailed post on the STRAFE\u00ae devblog.\nMakes you want to stick out your tongue and catch a taste.\nSince the levels constantly change, this blood and gore is your compass in STRAFE\u00ae. It informs you where you\u2019ve previously traveled and directs you toward new paths of destruction in each level set.\nThe levels of STRAFE\u00ae are radically different environments that will alter your killing methods. Additional details on three of these areas are closely-guarded secrets of STRAFE\u00ae only available upon playing the final game.  \n\nICARUS - Massive spacecraft with short to mid-range based combat.\nYou should have stayed on your scout ship.\nAREA 2 - Open levels where death is quick to surround you and trap you with pits, ledges and enemies with the high ground.\nYou should have stayed on Icarus.\nAREA 3 - Open areas and close quarters combine with environmental hazards for frantically varied gameplay.\nAREA 4 - Close quarters finale filled with all previous enemies and hazards for maximum difficulty. Are you up for the challenge?*****\nIt\u2019s the enemies that will have you strafing helplessly in your dreams.\nMovement is your best defense, as there is no cover. Health does not recharge. Your only hope is to learn the unique behaviors and weakness of each enemy, shoot and STRAFE. Some will rush at you and beat in your skull. Others impale you with a shower of projectiles from afar.\nThe ICARUS levels will feature 7 enemy types, with more to come in later levels.\nMake them pay for living.\nSecrets are special in STRAFE\u00ae. You won\u2019t find them by simply STRAFING around a corner. Because ammo hiding under stairs is not a rewarding find.\n\nFrom unique levels with original art, to modes that affect graphics or gameplay, to minigames, secrets offer rewards or punishments based on your performance. There is no greater accomplishment than discovering every secret of STRAFE\u00ae.******    \nBelow is just one of the early secrets in STRAFE\u00ae. If you don't want to spoil the surprise, skip ahead past this video to the next section. If you're still reading this, STRAFE\u00ae loathes your impatience but respects your bravery. For you're about to experience LUFTENSTEIN, a hidden minigame with original art, enemies, music and gameplay. Win and be rewarded. But lose and... well, STRAFE\u00ae.\n\nLAST CHANCE TO NOT SPOIL THE SURPRISE.\nThe STRAFE\u00ae team is a small group united by an unrelenting love of games. Specifically, of STRAFE\u00ae. Which is the first project from the STRAFE\u00ae team, led by director Thom Glunt, who has the gall to think he can jump in and speak on behalf of STRAFE\u00ae.\nHi everyone,\n\nThom Glunt here, creative director of STRAFE\u00ae at Pixel Titans. This has been fun, but I want to be serious for a second. STRAFE\u00ae is the best game of all time.\n\nKidding, obviously. Because it\u2019s not done yet! Which brings us to Kickstarter.\n\nSTRAFE\u00ae has been a side hobby of mine next to my other career: music video/commercial directing, which doesn't pay great, and playing video games, which hasn\u2019t paid anything and in fact has suffered disastrous losses over the last 26 years. Same story with our lead programmer, Steve Raney. But after attracting fantastic contributors to the project and receiving great reactions at VRLA (Virtual Reality Los Angeles), we\u2019re ready to take the game into full-time development.\n\nBut that requires time. And because time equals money, that means we need your money. Without funding we've seen a number of team members come and go. Pixel Titans at its core is two people, and the STRAFE\u00ae team in full is currently five. A successful Kickstarter will allow us to concentrate on the game and hire an additional animator, artists and a part-time programmer to stay on schedule for an early 2016 release.\n\nWe already have 9 months of part-time development in the can. Most systems have been implemented and major technical hurdles solved. This includes the procedural level generation and a persistent gibs system that doesn\u2019t destroy performance. So we\u2019re confident in our promise to make STRAFE\u00ae as awesome as possible, finish it with all planned content and also never ever threaten Gabe Newell\u2019s life. We love you, Gabe.\n\nThanks for the support!\n\nThom \nKickstarter is the perfect model to release a forward-thinking game like STRAFE\u00ae.\nSurprises, secrets and first impressions are important. Releasing an incomplete version in early access is the only force that could compromise the enjoyment of STRAFE\u00ae. A successful Kickstarter allows us to release the game only when it is final and deserving of the title GAME OF THE YEAR, 1996.\nAs STRAFE\u00ae is all about STRAFE\u00ae, physical rewards are limited so as not to cannibalize the development funds. But there are occasional exceptions (especially at higher tiers), like our STRAFE\u00ae poster:\nBlow away the rest of your art collection.\nWe also have many high-tech digital rewards, including the ultimate digital reward, the STRAFE\u00ae game. Rewards are only for backers, so don't miss out. \nFUND STRAFE\u00ae\nPLAY STRAFE\u00ae\nSTRAFE\u00ae!\n\n*The threat level STRAFE\u00ae poses to humanity is not currently quantifiable.\n**Hardcore players only. Not recommended for children or elderly.\n\n***If STRAFE\u00ae does melt your CPU, please send us a picture of the damage, so we can post it on Twitter. @STRAFEGAME  \n****STRAFE\u00ae will not literally kill you. Most likely. If by coincidence death does occur during a STRAFE\u00ae session, number one, what better way to go out, and two, we do not accept liability or responsibility.

Players and critics were blown away by this innovative take on a fantasy RPG. It was the first game to have a texture mapped first-person 3D world. Beyond its cutting-edge visuals, it heralded an era of sandbox, open-world play.\nPLAY\n\nThe Underworld series continues to this day to inform modern game design. Here are a few games that credit it as an inspiration:\nHere\u2019s what some leading game developers say:\nRichard Garriott (Ultima, Shroud of the Avatar) \u2013 \u201cFor those of us lifelong gamers that go back to the early days the Underworld franchise, created by Paul Neurath, represents a watershed event on what an immersive 3D true role-playing game can be. Personally I am as excited about Underworld returning as any game I can imagine.\u201d\nKen Levine (BioShock) \u2013 \u201cUnderworld had a transformative effect on my understanding of what games were. It was the first time I ever felt \u2018inside\u2019 of an imaginary world. It was the game that primed all my creative ambitions.\u201d\nChris Roberts (Star Citizen, Wing Commander) \u2013 \u201cUnderworld was the first truly 3D textured first person game\u2026 it influenced pretty much all first person 3D games that came afterwards.\u201d\nCLICK HERE to read more about what legendary game developers are saying.\nFar more than a dungeon crawl, Underworld Ascendant is a next-generation sequel to the legendary fantasy RPG\u2019s Ultima Underworld & Ultima Underworld 2. It not only modernizes the series\u2019 visuals and user interface to take full advantage of the today\u2019s powerful PC\u2019s, it innovates in bold new ways.\nNext Generation 3D Immersion\nHere's how we\u2019re going to raise the bar with the visuals of the game::\nPLAY\n\nTHE UNDERWORLD AS A CHARACTER\nNo other game has such a vivid imagining of an underground fantasy realm as Underworld Ascendant. The Stygian Abyss is a vast world unto itself\u2026\nPlunder ancient temples, navigate subterranean rivers, gaze in wonder at the masterwork of jade dwarven halls, scale plunging ice caverns, trek through enchanted forests of giant mushrooms, dare shadowy tombs of the undead, and much more.\nAlive with bustling underground societies: enclaves of human renegades scavenging for survival, villages of the mysterious shambler \u201cmushroom people\u201d performing arcane rituals, dwarven factories producing the finest arms and armor.\nFace monstrous creatures like the ripper, a vicious, ambulatory plant whose bark is prized by The Stygian Abyss\u2019 intelligent races; stay clear of mass migrations of ravenous rotworms; dodge the giant spider\u2019s sticky webs it casts through the air.\nAlter the environment to your advantage. Flood an arid plain to help the damp-loving shamblers expand their territory, gaining their favor. Changes you make can ripple across the game's reactive, ever-changing ecology, producing startlingly unpredictable results.\nThe Stygian Abyss makes the typical fantasy game\u2019s above-ground assortment of medieval towns and wilderness seem stale by comparison.\nA DYNAMIC, PLAYER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE\n\nGet drawn into an epic story with ties to the original Ultima Underworld games. Play as The Avatar, a human newly arrived from our earth through a mystical Runegate. As a \u201cstranger in a strange land\u201d you will:\n\nMeet shrewd characters, with their own motivations and agendas. Some may be swayed to your cause, while others may manipulate you.\nEncounter rugged dwarf frontiersmen, fierce dark elf renegades, and strangely alien shamblers. Each faction holds a valid claim to The Stygian Abyss. Which side will you join? Will you unite, or destroy?\nEntangle yourself in a tale of intrigue and conflict as three fierce, rival factions struggle for control. Your choices will determine the ultimate fate of The Stygian Abyss.\nThe 3 main factions who vie for dominance of The Stygian Abyss\n  Runegates connect to other worlds as well, including the lands of the Shroud of the Avatar. Over the eons travelers have spanned these worlds, including a band of rogue dark elves who set themselves up in The Stygian Abyss. Discover how these worlds have intertwined over the ages.\nTHE IMPROVISATION ENGINE\nPLAY\n\nDo you enjoy the freedom of choice in sandbox games like Deus Ex or Elder Scrolls? The team at OtherSide in large part invented this style of experience with the original Ultima Underworld -- now they intend to take it to the next level.\nAt the heart of Underworld Ascendant's distinctive gameplay is the Improvisation Engine, which gives you an array of tools to think up your own ingenious solutions to challenges.\nFor instance, how to cross a subterranean river guarded by deadly lurker?\nUnwise player tries to swim past, meets their watery doom.\nClever player tosses rotworm downstream to distract lurker.\nClever player charms giant cave spider to carry them up and over.\nWhat\u2019s your clever solution?\nUnderworld Ascendant's Improvisation Engine encourages you to experiment and unlock your creative potential. Devise clever techniques that even the game's designers haven't imagined yet!\nINTENSE COMBAT & INVENTIVE MAGIC\n\nEnjoy swordplay and spell casting that are distinctly dynamic and inventive\u2026.\n\nExperience engaging first-person combat. Launch yourself into fluid, running battles where maneuvering and timing are everything. Utilize your environment to stack the odds in your favor.\nCollect magical runes bristling with power. Learn to combine them to surprising effect. Discover potent spells like Charm Creature, Hailstones, and Clairvoyant Eye. Experiment to customize and improve their effects.\nObtain rare and powerful weapons and armor. Align with the dwarves to acquire masterfully-crafted plate mail. Trade with dark elves to gain access to an arsenal of enchanted weaponry.\n  CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER CLASS\nThink outside the box of formalized character classes and concoct your own one-of-a-kind adventurer.\nJump right into the game choosing from a Fighter, Mage or Thief. But from there you are free to customize your Avatar to your individual play style.\nMix and match your favorite skills and perks. Create a mage skilled at stealth, a fighter who can summon spectral allies, or the ultimate thief.\nJoin a faction and gain special perks that improve your abilities to alter the environment, traverse obstacles, or craft traps.\n  STRETCH TRADITIONAL RPG BOUNDARIES\nStretch Goals will allow us innovate even further, adding companion creatures, co-op, user-crafted content, and more\u2026\nCrave fellowship and a companion creature?

With your help, we can embark on the next chapter with Underworld Ascendant.\nWe got the ball rolling with some funding of our own to get development underway, building a playable prototype over the past 4 months. But to take the project through full production and deliver the core PC game, we will need the Kickstarter funding from our fans.\nIt goes beyond the funding. We\u2019d like you to join us on this creative journey, experiencing first-hand the surprises and fun of genuine innovation. This means having you VOTE on decision around features, items, and creatures. Participating in our forums, livestreams and developer blogs. Depending on your pledge level you will have early access from beta builds to as early as pre-alpha prototype builds. \nDon\u2019t be shy. Discuss on the forums, vote on the website! Get involved! We want to hear your thoughts and ideas!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoftware development is never certain, even more so when you\u2019re trying to innovate. Projects can run late, run into technical hurdles. And it takes more than just getting the program to work, you\u2019ve also got to make it fun! Never easy.\n\nOur team does come to this project having delivered over 25 award-winning games, including the original Underworlds, and other more recent games in the genre. There\u2019s a fair chance that we created or influenced some of the most-loved games in your collection. While this track record is no guarantee of success with Underworld Ascendant, it does give us a distinct edge. \n\nAlso we\u2019re using tools, like the Unity Engine, that help offset some of the risks, and allow us to more rapidly prototype, test and iterate. We have been in development for four months now, and already have a number of our key systems in the prototype working. Next, we\u2019ll stage our system trials to narrow down unknowns. At each step, your participation will help in refining the game further, which helps up the odds we\u2019ll deliver on the fun.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 11351, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/othersidegames/underworld-ascendant", "project_name": "Underworld Ascendant"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Click here to become a Second Chance Backer!\nMiss our Kickstarter campaign but still want to get in on the action? Click the banner above to see a limited group of reward levels you can still get in on until March 13th!\nWe're back!\nThe team that brought you the award-winning Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director\u2019s Cut is back with an all new, full length standalone cyberpunk tactical cRPG set in Shadowrun's magically Awakened Hong Kong of 2056.\nHONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

Unpredictable environments!\nRoguelike influences and RPG features, including randomly generated encounters and discoveries, meaningful permadeath, three different supplies to manage, crew veteran rankings and incredible replay value.\nDozers, the gargantuan rolling fortresses covered in armor and weapons to protect passengers and crew during the journey through Bedlam.\nFour class-based crew member types: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Melee all with their own strengths, weaknesses, movement and attack ranges.\nFour unique enemy factions: Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs and the A.I. - all with their own appearances and behaviors.\nEvolving Crew -- battle survivors will evolve into Elite and Veteran units!\n\u201cDouble-Down\u201d (a New game+): Travel back through Bedlam for the opportunity to defeat merciless overlord King Viscera and his minions for untold riches... or the sacrifice of everything!\nYour goal is to travel from the futuristic metropolis of Bysantine through the chaotic realm of Bedlam to reach the rumored utopia of Aztec City with as many of your passengers and crew intact as possible.\nYou will constantly consume supplies as you travel across Bedlam. Meat, Metal and Crude are what you will need to keep your passengers fed, your Dozer repaired and your engines running. These critical resources can be collected through random events, salvaged from defeated enemies, or received after completing quests or prevailing in battles.\nBut keep in mind that all territories, Points of Interest, NPCs and events are randomly generated at the start of each new game, encouraging multiple playthroughs for a fresh experience each time! We want to focus on the fun of finding something different in every game. The unpredictability of Bedlam is both its biggest challenge and its greatest appeal!\nIf you successfully navigate through Bedlam, you will be given an option to \"Double-Down\". This is the BEDLAM version of a New Game+ (unlockable video game mode), offering a chance to transport your crew and Dozer (with all upgrades and weapons) back across Bedlam for subsequent journeys - but remember, it's double-or-nothing!\nUpdate #10 goes into detail about the gameflow of BEDLAM!\nCheck out these jaw-dropping, ear-melting BEDLAM tunes composed by none other than Kevin Riepl (GEARS OF WAR)!\n* Hit play and continue reading to get the whole BEDLAM experience!\n\"Drifters\" by Kevin Riepl\n \"Marauders!\" by Kevin Riepl\nOur battle system is called blitz because the battles are swift, aggressive and intense \u2013 it\u2019s an all-out attack from the very beginning! Opposition beware!\nThe battles in BEDLAM will offer plenty of depth and variety! A battlefield is similar to a chessboard, with an isometric view and each opposing side taking turns. Battlefields can be a variety of sizes and many special battles will take place on larger or irregular-sized boards. Certain battlefields will also feature protective cover, making every battle different!\nDuring a turn, each side has two action points to expend. Because there is no forced character turn-order or action order, these action points can be used in many ways. During each turn, you will decide which crew member(s) to move and/or attack, or which Dozer Upgrade or Weapon to use. Each turn gets you closer to ultimately destroying the enemy and overcoming that territory!\nYou also have the option of retreat! It just depends on how much of your crew and resources you are willing to risk versus the possible rewards you could acquire!\nA significant strategic element during combat is the inclusion of battlefield Equalizers! These items and objects are randomly inserted onto battlefields and can take many forms: atomic waste barrels, dead creatures, scrap containers, vendetta contraptions, or even packages of coveted resources! Some Equalizers can be used as temporary cover, but you\u2019ll need to be cautious as they can also be destroyed by incoming weapon fire, resulting in the loss of any valuables they might hold!\nIn order to gather the riches that may result from various Equalizers, you will need to maneuver a crew member to that position -- which means weighing the risk of those rewards against coming under attack from foes. The caveat is that you must collect these bonus items BEFORE each battle ends!\nYOUR BATTLE CREW\nYour Battle Crew is the first and last line of defense against the hostile enemies that roam the wasteland trying to claim territories throughout Bedlam, threatening the progress of your Dozer and the safety of your passengers. Your crew can be deployed in teams of up to six members, including one Elite or Veteran.\nCrew member death is permanent! Those who survive will gain higher levels of experience and status, allowing them to equip deadlier weapons against the ferocious enemies in Bedlam!\nCREW MEMBER CLASSES\nFrontliner (Melee)\nThe Melee class is both the sturdiest and most agile combatant, ready to dash directly into hand-to-hand combat and inflict punishment as well as absorb it. Another strategic use of a Melee combatant is to treat them as a human shield for more vulnerable Rifle crew members.\nTrencher (Shotgun)\nAs the close-combat weapon specialists on the Dozer crew, the Shotgun class is fairly resilient and packs whopping firepower when the enemy is near, but is much less effective at a distance.\nGunslinger (Pistol)\nThe Pistol class is a great balanced soldier with moderate endurance, movement and weapon range. These hand-cannon hotshots are also the only class with run-and-gun ability.\nDeadeye (Rifle)\nThe long-distance engagement expert in your crew, the Rifle class has the lowest health and movement range but also deals the greatest damage at the furthest distance. These sharpshooters are integral to any good battle plan and should be protected!\nELITES\nA variety of Elite characters from various Factions can be discovered and recruited during your travels through Bedlam... or they can be promoted from existing crew members through in-game events.\nOver time, as crew members survive brutal battles and toxic environments, their bodies may show signs of heavy physical damage or radiation effects. These are tracked by meters on each crew member, and when the corresponding levels reach a certain plateau, you will have a chance to convert that crew member to an Elite class as a Cyborg or Mutant!\nCyborgs are considered a \u201cHeavy Weapons\u201d class, which has greater health and inflicts more damage. Mutants are the \u201cMega Melee\u201d class that can deliver a tremendous amount of melee brutality, but also has access to powerful grenades and healing abilities.\nIf you decide not to convert your crew member into a Cyborg or Mutant, they will remain human and have the opportunity to reach the coveted Veteran Status... if they can survive long enough!\nVETERANS\nThese tried-and-true crew members have survived more battles and seen more horrors than they\u2019d care to remember. They have shunned ALL cyborg enhancements or biological improvements and have embraced their own humanity as the strongest weapon in their arsenal. These rare and legendary characters live by their own rules, and can help turn the tide of battle in an instant!\nYou can usually only have ONE Veteran or Elite crew member on the battlefield at any time, so choose your team wisely!\nDOZER UPGRADES\nDozer upgrades are technologies that can be purchased through NPCs, discovered by exploring locations, or acquired after successfully negotiating a hostile situation. You never know what you'll find on any given playthrough!\nDozer Upgrades (like the Dreadhound Kennel above) can be used during battle with major effects, giving your crew members various buffs and powers, calling in reinforcements, or even raising the dead! Possible upgrades and technologies include an Alchemist laboratory, robotic research department, nuclear engines, science facility, cloning vats, agricultural center, meat processing plant and sick bay.\nUpdate #3 has more information about Dozer Upgrades!\nDOZER WEAPONS\nLast but not least are the devastating Dozer weapons that can be discovered during your journey through Bedlam. Only a single weapon can be installed on your Dozer at a time, and each has a specific impact and recharge timer. Spin up the Gatling cannons to deal vicious area-of-effect damage, or trigger a laser strike to blaze a lethal line of light across the battle board! \nDuring your navigation through Bedlam, these primary Dozer weapons can also unlock inaccessible areas if you have the proper tool for the job -- with lasers equipped, you could cut through a crashed spaceship's hull to search for extraterrestrial technologies, while missiles could demolish that landslide blocking your path, revealing a new route through Bedlam.\nWhile forming a battle strategy, you must factor crew member positions, relative health of all friend and foe combatants, control of key battle board areas, crew-impacting Dozer upgrades and, of course, the primary Dozer weapon.\nIf you plan your battles effectively, triumph is assured! On the other hand, a few wrong choices could result in grisly death... and once a crew member falls in combat, they are lost for the remainder of the game (\"permadeath\"). The wasteland is a cruel and unforgiving place!\nSuccessful outcomes in battle earn resources that can be used for barter, upgrades, or Dozer improvements. However, enemy victory can result in game failure \u2014 a Dozer is defeated once its armor is obliterated or when all passengers and crew are eliminated, sending you back to the beginning for a fresh start.\nThe realm of Bedlam is the result of the catastrophic clashes of black science that caused the Barren Age... and the impact of those terrible wars still linger after centuries.\nCivilization survived and ultimately flourished in the spectacular walled metropolis of Bysantine... but as this technological marvel begins to fall victim to overcrowding, class distinction, corporate conflict and organized crime, there is a new hope in the distant utopia of Aztec City!\nYour travels through Bedlam may take you into tachyon mists that can distort time before your very eyes, hallucinogenic squalls that can present literally unreal threats, alternate-dimensional bleeds that can drop legendary parallel-reality champions into battle with (or against) you, or ancient necrotech that can reanimate the skeletal remains of long-fallen warriors... with a vengeance!\nThe unpredictable environment can even affect battles. Because of Bedlam's constantly fluctuating climate, your combatants may have to fight during blinding blizzards of crimson ash, near patches of homicidal vegetation, or in confounding fields of X-ray wavelengths. Or a corrosive enzyme cyclone could suddenly swirl through the middle of an encounter, which may prompt the enemy (or your own crew) to flee or risk molecular degeneration!\nTemporal anomalies, freak storms, bone soldiers and deadly apparitions? It's no exaggeration to say that anything can happen in these bizarre lands -- Bedlam truly earned its namesake!\nRandom Events\nYour path through Bedlam will take you through a series of Faction-controlled territories, and your Dozer traverses each of these areas by navigating and visiting separate Points of Interest.\nArriving at a Point of Interest may lead to a Boomtown -- settlements like Gluttonhold and Trudgefoot dotting the charred domain -- or you could be sent immediately into battle with the dominant Faction of the territory. But it could also initiate a Random Event, delivered to you via NPCs through the Dozer's Communications Window.\nKing Viscera\nThe massive and merciless tormenter who proclaims himself the overlord of Bedlam, King Viscera is known mostly for his fearsome blood-streaked armor and complete lack of compunction.\nThough he rarely handles matters personally, he dispatches his infamous (and particularly vicious) patrols to eliminate his competition, harass the denizens of independent Boomtowns, and generally disrupt any semblance of peace. All the while, he scours the blackened sands of Bedlam for valuable artifacts to help him gain the dominating power he seeks. During your journey through Bedlam, you will become keenly aware of King Viscera's notoriety. And there's a very good chance you will encounter his scouting parties, because despite the expanse of Bedlam, it would be all but impossible to hide your rolling fortress from his attention... and it's just the kind of thing he would desire.\nBut will you also have the opportunity (or misfortune) to actually face him? Even the mighty Dozer may not provide protection if you cross his path or draw his wrath!\nSimply put, we want to be completely in control of both the design and execution of the game! We at Skyshine have all spent years working at large companies, which in turn have large publishers behind them - and it is always the same story. The publisher will flex its muscles and insist the game design bends to 'current trends', while demanding the game ships on their schedule (even when it's not ready) just to meet quarterly numbers. Been there, done that! Now it is our turn!\nBut... we need your help! So we are asking you for your support in raising enough money (or more) to escape the metaphorical shackles and bring to market our vision of BEDLAM!\nKickstarter also empowers us to go directly to you, the gamers who love to play role-playing games, to get your support, input and feedback that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together.\nSo come aboard this journey and become a backer and future BEDLAM player!\nDigital downloads of the game (ALL TIERS) are your choice of Steam keys for the PC or Mac version.\nWe are aiming to release BEDLAM in Late Summer 2015 (with a few months possibly added for polish based on beta results).\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in creating fun and captivating role-playing games. Skyshine was founded in 2014 by three industry veterans from various high-profile studios.\nJohn Mueller, Artist\nJohn is an award-winning author, illustrator, and game artist whose career has spanned 20 years.

John has been a contributor to numerous AAA games and has recently spent five years as the Studio Art Director at Vigil Games, the studio that created Darksiders.\nJeff Johnson, Gameplay / A.I Programmer\nJeff worked for Bally right out of college and helped create hit pinball games like 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', 'Judge Dredd', 'The Flintstones' and 'Theatre of Magic'. After years of pinball, he started working on video arcade hits such as NBA Showtime (and its sequels), NFL Blitz (and its sequels) and Redcard soccer.\nSam Gage, Animations / VFX\nSam has a background that goes from the GameBoy Color Indie scene all the way to Lead Visual Effects Artist on the recent Darksiders games. He\u2019s done pixel-art, 3D modeling, animation, world building, game design, scripting, visual effects, you name it.\nAdditional Contributors\nWe at Skyshine Games also want to give a HUGE shout out to three vital individuals who have helped us get to this point; because without their help, BEDLAM would not be what you see today!

Check out this update.\nSome big names in games love our pitch!\nJerry Holkins of Penny-Arcade has some interesting stuff to say about Human Resources here.\n Want to destroy the world? Get in line.\nHuman Resources is a PC real-time strategy game that puts you in command of apocalyptic factions vying to conquer the drifting remains of a shattered Earth. Using humans as your resource, assemble giant armies to annihilate your foes, then feed the newly-cleansed Earthshards to your almighty leader. \nKey Features of Human Resources include: \nAsymmetrical factions! Play as ancient squid monsters from another dimension or as giant killer robots.\nInsanely huge battles! Command hundreds of units and conquer sprawling, fully destructible cities.\nBreathtaking visuals! A comic-inspired art style means the apocalypse has never looked so gorgeous.\nBlast from the past! The tone, character, and pacing of a Command & Conquer game mixed with the mammoth battles of an Annihilation game.\nThe Singularity is nigh. Newly-sentient automated factories churn out waves of giant robots, hell-bent on dismantling and recycling all of human civilization. The insect-like Machines can deploy into stationary modes, enhancing their shielding and firepower. They decimate their enemies with ranged energy weapons. \nThe humans invoke the tentacled Ancient Ones in a last-ditch effort to stem the Machine onslaught. This proves unwise. Now the Ancient Ones vie with the Machines to consume the last scraps of Earth. The Ancient Ones advance in fast-moving hordes, overwhelming their foes with fearsome melee attacks. An assortment of arcane spells and foul poisons rounds out their arsenal. \nWho knows what other factions may lurk in the void, waiting for the moment to strike? \nBattles unfold on floating fragments of Earth as they are ripped from the planet and pulled toward the waiting mouths of god-sized faction leaders. The cities that lie in your path are fully destructible, as is the terrain beneath them. Uproot buildings to use as clubs! Create mighty warriors that can cut the Earthshard in two! Bore giant holes through the ground! Summon your overlords to eat the whole thing!\nUp to eight players can duke it out on endlessly-varied procedural battlefields. Skirmish against up to seven AI adversaries on your own or fight multiple AI opponents alongside your friends. \nRandomly-generated terrain and cityscapes create new opportunities from battle to battle. A single game may encompass one or many Earthshards, crisscrossed by any number of human settlements. Unexpected bonus items lurk in randomly-generated structures throughout the battlefield, encouraging improvisation and risk-taking. \nHuman Resources\u2019 visual style is inspired by the clean color and precise linework of classic comic illustrators like Moebius, Herg\u00e9, and Geof Darrow. Clear silhouettes and easily-differentiated colors make it easy to navigate chaotic battlefields. We\u2019ve created a homebrew rendering system to make the apocalypse prettier than it\u2019s ever been before.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small-team environment. In 2010, Uber released its first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. Since then, we have released Super Monday Night Combat, Toy Rush, and Planetary Annihilation. \nPlanetary Annihilation was developed with the support of a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign (the Planetary Annihilation team will continue to support that project while a new team builds Human Resources). Having experienced the unprecedented creative control, autonomy, and IP ownership enabled by crowdfunding, we can\u2019t imagine going back to the old way of making games. With Kickstarter, we get to make the game we want, the way we want to make it -- and we get to work with you guys from day one. \nWith Planetary Annihilation, we think the results speak for themselves. The game is a beloved and critically lauded entry in the RTS canon, and we\u2019re extremely proud of it. Now we\u2019re ready to try something even more ambitious. \nHuman Resources evolves the powerful Planetary Annihilation engine to enable new innovations in gameplay, graphics, and world-building. We need your help -- not just as financial backers, but as partners who will shape key aspects of the game\u2019s design.  \nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on titles like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander, and Demigod. We are very passionate about RTS gaming and we can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\nJohn Comes - Lead Designer, Project Director\nJohn Comes has spent the better part of his 13 year professional career working on some of the biggest strategy titles out there. Titles like: Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, and more. He wants to take this opportunity to combine all the best parts of all these games and incorporate them into one awesome experience. After all, he knows awesome! \nNate Simpson - Art Director\nNate Simpson\u2019s highlight reel includes Demigod, Supreme Commander 2, GoPets, and Starfleet Command 2. He also writes and draws Nonplayer, an Eisner Award-winning series published by Image Comics. His favorite games are Katamari Damacy and Shadow of the Colossus. He\u2019s excited to have found a way to put both robots and monsters into the same game, and he\u2019s hoping this isn\u2019t all just a wonderful dream.\nAdd Ons: (Just add this amount to your pledge to get these extras)\nAll tiers: Extra game keys: - Add $20 for each key, 3 extra keys for $50 \nFor $40 tier and above: Extra beta game keys - Add $40 for each key, 3 extra keys for $100 \nFor $125 tier and above: Extra t-shirts - Add $30 for each t-shirt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is hard, but we like a challenge.

Game development is an evolutionary process, and features are often reprioritized, expanded, or redesigned. We will prototype key features rapidly to ensure compelling and exciting gameplay.\n\nThe estimated launch date of February 2016 grows directly from this plan and resulting production timeline.\n\nThe Kickstarter video is a gameplay visualization, not actual in-game footage.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Planetary Annihilation Inc\n2 created \u00b7 2 backed\nPlanetary Annihilation Inc is the new home for Planetary Annihilation and this Kickstarter project originally created by Uber...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "The End is Nigh", "update_content": "Fellow meat sticks,\nI come here today to give a wholehearted THANK YOU to everyone who backed us, tweeted, Facebooked, and stood on an overpass with a sign.

Wells and Jules Verne, Ironcast is set in an exciting alternative history; a time when refined men and women in top hats and bonnets commanded gigantic walking war machines, laying waste to the enemies of the British Empire!\nPlayers take control of a 7 metre tall walking vehicle called an Ironcast. They must face off against an invading force of enemy Ironcast in order to defend 1880's Victorian England. \nBattles are fought by generating resource nodes which in turn drive the Ironcast's various weapons and systems. Players must choose how to spend these nodes wisely, either offensively in order to cripple and destroy their opponents, or defensively, if they suspect a barrage of incoming weapons fire is due.\nThe Light Cannon shreds unshielded armour with ease.\nFeatures:\nTurn based strategy combat set against a rich and interesting alternate 1880's history. \nRoguelike campaign mode where death is permanent but with persistent rewards from one game session to the next. Drive back the invading forces and press forth for victory!\nCompletely hand painted art style.\nInspired by the steampunk genre and Victorian science fiction.\nLoot new technology and upgrade abilities from the wrecks of fallen enemies. \nCustomise your Ironcast with a range of unique weapons and defensive systems. Over 50 different unlockable items will ensure an almost limitless number of combinations.\nPassive boosters allow players to augment and tweak their Ironcast's weapons and abilities. \nFor PC, Mac and Linux. \nThe year is 1886. France and England have been at war for over a decade, both sides commanding gigantic walking war-machines known as the Ironcast. Each towering construct bristles with advanced Victorian era weapon systems and electrical shields. \nFrench forces cross the channel, supported by huge Naval fleets and airship bombers, landing to do battle in the burning, ruined streets of 19th century London.\nAlthough designed for military purposes, the British army does not own the patents or designs for the Ironcast. The war-machines are instead built and operated by a private group of supremely wealthy businessmen and women, collectively known as the Consortium of Merit. Sick of the duration and bitterness of the ongoing Anglo-French war, the Consortium developed and manufactured advanced models of Ironcast in order to break the stalemate and declare a victor, once and for all.\nThe Consortium resisted the pleas and threats of the beleaguered British Government to hand over their designs, but instead agreed to join the war as a powerful supplementary force, on one condition; each Ironcast would remain separate from the British Military, and would be commanded by a lady or gentleman of the highest calibre. Their pilots, gunners and support crew would be chosen by the Consortium of Merit and none other. \nWar on the streets of London.\nSmartly dressed and devoid of the usual rough qualities found in fighting troops, an Ironcast commander is a whole new breed of tactical genius, eloquently directing their crew in battle from the comfort of their elaborately decorated and baroque Ironcast cockpits.\nThey are an elite fighting element in service to Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria alone. The newly formed Ironcast Dragoon League has become the bulwark of England\u2019s defence and the spearhead of their eventual offensives into France.\nThe campaign sees the player take the role of one of the few surviving Ironcast Commanders, the majority of which were killed by a devastating attack on the English command centre, The Spire. They must organise the surviving British forces into a coherent fighting force, repel the French invasion of England and finally launch a counter offensive directly into the heart of the French capital; Paris. \nIt is a desperate time for the Ironcast dragoons and the Consortium of Merit; a time in which the player's efforts will be greatly appreciated!\nPlayers must match coloured nodes from a grid in order to gather energy, ammunition, repair tools and engine coolant. They must then use these resources to unleash a torrent of cannon, laser and missile fire upon the enemy in order to cripple their systems and ultimately be the last walker standing. \nA typical battle scene in Ironcast.\nPowered by a mysterious energy source called Voltite, the Ironcast are supremely advanced by Victorian standards. However, such powerful war machines are not without their flaws. \nEvery action the player takes during battle - whether that's firing their cannons or powering up their energy shields - generates a vast amount of heat. Players must ensure that they keep enough coolant supplied to their systems else they risk overheating and taking additional damage! \nThe game is turn based. Players can only make three complete matches from the power grid per turn, but can activate any mech abilities or fire any weapon system that has the required resources without ending their turn. A match must be at least 3 nodes of the same colour, but there's no upper limit on how many nodes are linked in a match, as long as each node is touching another.\nEach ability or weapon system can be activated several times per turn, although most abilities have a \u201ccool-down\u201d period before they can be fired again (measured in turns).\nThe opponent's systems can be targeted specifically; enemy heavily protected by strong shields? Target and disable their shield systems first. Enemy crippling your evasion systems? Take out their strongest weapon first. It's up to the player what they target first and how they plan to win the battle! \nFinally, damaged systems can be repaired by matching repair nodes. Players can spend these nodes to restore health to their disabled systems, but resources are limited and they should be careful in deciding which system to give a valuable boost.\nThe weapons in Ironcast's version of the Victorian era are a curious mix of explosive projectile cannons, missile launchers and energy weapons. \nThe light cannon fires a rapid-fire stream of explosive shells, able to tear through heavy armour with ease. However, it is fairly ineffective against energy shields due to the relatively low damage of each shot.\nThe heavy cannon fires a twin payload of 6\" shells. Each shell causes a medium amount of damage, ensuring it's always able to be partially effective, even when enemies have shield protection.\nThe energy lance fires a high power beam, able to cut through armour and shields with ease. However, as it only fires a single blast each time it is activated, it is susceptible to missing if the target currently has a high evasion chance. \nThe missiles fired from the missile launcher strike a single location for a fairly high amount of damage, but cause a smaller amount of \"splash-damage\" to all other systems too. \nThe shock coils energy weapon can be fairly unpredictable. It has lower single target damage output than the Energy Lance, but has a 25% chance to strike the enemy a 2nd time. This can occur several times in a row if you're lucky!\nPlayers can equip a multitude of different components and systems that will help protect their mech from damage. The primary defensive system is a sophisticated energy barrier, capable of deflecting projectiles and absorbing laser blasts alike. We call these barriers shields. \nMatching orange energy nodes in order to power shields.\nShields completely block a fixed amount of damage from each shot that strikes the Ironcast. If a shot's damage number is higher than the shield's protection number, a portion of that damage will punch through and strike the intended target. \nIn addition to shields, Ironcast mechs can also increase their movement speed in an attempt to avoid incoming damage altogether.\nThis Ironcast is walking, which means that it'll avoid 20% of incoming attacks.\nThe standard evasion chance is only 5% (to represent the natural inaccuracy of Victorian targeting systems), but this can be increased significantly by diverting energy  nodes to the evasion system, causing the mech to walk and potentially avoid 25% or even 40% of all incoming shots!\nIroncast's campaign mode is a roguelike experience, featuring character levelling, numerous mech systems and weapon upgrades and randomised loot and mission content. Most missions will be procedurally generated from a set of pre-made components to give maximum variety from one play session to the next. The only exceptions will be boss missions and specific story missions designed to push the narrative of the game along. \nThe goal of the campaign is to repel the invasion of French forces before they reach the capital, London. Players have 14 days (which is the equivalent of 14 missions) to prepare themselves before the boss encounter, gathering experience points, cash resources and War Assets. \nWar Assets (WA) represent hundreds or even thousands of ground troops, air support and friendly armour that will engage and weaken the bosses before the player has to fight them. The more WA the player has before a boss encounter, the more likely it will be that they defeat the boss. We say more likely, but it'll never be easy. This is a Roguelike, after-all...\nPlayers can choose the difficulty of the mission they wish to undertake. The more difficult the mission, the more scrap, XP and War Assets they'll obtain. However, failure brings them nothing!\nFor example, if the player has 500 WA before the first boss, they could expect all enemy health and effectiveness to be reduced by about 25%, bringing it down to a potentially beatable level. However, if they only managed to secure 100 WA, this reduction will only be about 5%. A small difference and likely a disastrous battle for the player. \nPlayers also earn scrap materials and experience points from matching yellow nodes and defeating enemies throughout the game. They then spend these scrap resources on Ironcast upgrades, weapons and defensive systems. It's important that players try to keep ahead of the curve where possible to ensure that they'll be strong enough to survive the boss encounters.  \nNew systems are built and fitted to the Ironcast in the Hangar Bay. Players can also equip new Passive Boosters and Abilities, earned by levelling up their Commander.\nDue to the difficulty and long term progression you see in Roguelikes, the player will be highly unlikely to get far into the game on initial play attempts. However, there is a certain amount of persistence from one gameplay session to the next, with players unlocking the chance that more powerful items and components will drop from destroyed enemies on subsequent playthroughs. \nThe whole campaign is expected to last around 60 minutes for an experienced player. Perfect for a lunch break. \nAt the beginning of every new campaign, players choose from a selection of different Ironcast frames. \nIroncast mechs have varied statistics such as health, ammo and energy capacity and starting weapon load outs. In addition, they also come with a unique Active Ability, which is exclusive to that Ironcast. \nThe Dunraven is a sturdy Ironcast, that benefits from larger than average ammunition stores. This means that they can effectively fire their weapon systems more often than other Ironcast, as long as the player is matching purple nodes efficiently enough, that is. \nThe Arundel is a lighter Ironcast. It's still built to withstand serious punishment, of course, but what it lacks in overall protection, it makes up with larger energy stores. The Arundel can store more energy nodes, and therefore can power larger shields and evasion systems, for longer. \nThe Warwick is a titan of an Ironcast. It's built to take some serious punishment, and not overheat whilst it does so. The Warwick has larger coolant reserves than the other Ironcast in addition to it's higher overall health, making it a tough beast to put down. \nOnce a player has chosen an Ironcast, they must then pick a Commander to lead it into battle. \nEach Commander comes with a powerful Signature Passive Booster, which augments the player's experience in interesting ways during battle.\nWe aim to have three playable Commander characters. Here are the first two:\nAeres Powell and William Beechwood, Ironcast Commanders.\nAeres Powell \nOwner and chief technician at Powell Energy Co. After losing both of her sisters to a French bomb at her home town in Wales, Aeres turned her attentions to the development of energy weaponry. She is a brilliant scientist, with arguably the greatest knowledge of Voltite technology in Britain. \nSignature Passive Booster: \"Electrical Gift\" - Matching 5 or more energy nodes reduces the cost of activating the next energy based system by 1 (to a minimum of 1). The heat cost remains unchanged. In addition, the ammo cost of firing all energy based weapons is reduced by 1.\nWilliam Beechwood\nThe owner of Beechwood Munitions. Having already acquired a wealth beyond imagination from his company, Beechwood now seeks something else to occupy his time. He looks to the glory of victory on the battlefield to build his legacy. \nCritics call him vainglorious and dangerously selfish in his war manoeuvres, but one thing\u2019s certain; he always gets the job done, whatever his true motivation.\nSignature Passive Booster: \"Master of Munitions\" - Matching 5 or more ammo nodes awards the player with a bonus of 2 purple nodes. Matching 8 or more purple nodes boosts the damage of the next projectile attack by 10%. In addition, all projectile weapon damage is increased by 5%.\nLinking nodes together generates resources and awards the player with Experience Points (XP). The longer the chains, the more resources the player has to spend and the quicker they'll gain levels for their Commander. The best players will always be looking ahead before they make their matches, to see what new, longer patterns could be formed.\nBut why include match 3 mechanics at all?\nWe believe that matching shapes, colours and patterns is an integral part of the human brain. It's incredibly satisfying and addictive; a good reason for why many casual puzzle games are so appealing to so many players; they're really good fun!\nA huge part of what make Ironcast so exciting to play is strategically taking your opponent apart piece by piece until they're ultimately destroyed! Disabling their strengths and exposing the weaknesses of their Ironcast set up is fantastically rewarding, but it takes a tactically minded player to pull off perfectly. \nWe also wanted a resource generation mechanic that would compliment that planning but without being too heavy; there really is such a thing as too much thinking! A mechanic that would be instantly gratifying but would also allow players to get better at with time; a bit of skill to go along with the strategy. Match 3 was the perfect... match!\nMatch 3 games don't have to mean \"casual\". There are excellent examples of deep and compelling match 3 games such as Puzzle Quest and Dungeon Raid. We just think that there aren't enough of them!\nIroncast is a deep and exciting strategy game, complimented by an accessible and addictive resource gathering mechanic.\nIroncast was designed from the start to be a project that could be finished inside of a year. We've been careful to select only the features which we believe are essential for an exciting and compelling game. Anything else had to be put to one side in the \"wouldn't it be great if...\" pile. \nThis dedication to clean, uncluttered game design comes from a great deal of experience working within the games industry, where some projects languish for several years before they finally see release (or are never released at all!). This is not how we believe game development should be done. \nHowever, it's not always easy to work this way. It means that tonnes of genuinely awesome ideas and content simply won't be made without additional funds or time. This is where Kickstarter, and you, come in. \nThere are only 3 full-time developers on the game, with a number of part time contributors supplying animation, audio and video. This is why we've set a deliberately low goal of \u00a310,000 ($16,600) which is the required amount to ship Ironcast with the following feature set within the year of 2014:\n3 core Ironcast mech designs, with attached signature abilities\n3 Commander characters, with attached signature passive boosters\n4 background environments (one of which you can see in the trailer and images above).\n30+ missions, with dozens of randomly selected modifiers to keep them fresh and challenging.\nA mid-game and endgame boss to test your commanding skills.\n8 core weapon systems with multiple upgrades, tweaks and passive boosters, making for hundreds of possible combinations.\n30 or so passive boosters and active abilities.\nHowever, there's so much more that we wish to put into the game! With your help, it can be done. With enough backing from you, the public, and a little bit of luck, we'll be announcing realistic stretch goals early on. Expect more Commanders, more Ironcast designs, more locations and missions, perhaps more platforms, and of course, competitive multi-player, to be on the list. \nWe won't be pushing back the launch date for these stretch goals, however, as we've already got a clear cut plan for how to get to launch. Instead, we'll be patching the stretch goal content in at a later date, so you can all enjoy Ironcast while we continue to work on new content for the game. \nIroncast is being produced by a brilliant and creative team of developers, each coming together to pour their love and talent into the project. \nDaniel Leaver - Designer, Dreadbit. @rovient\nDaniel is the designer on Ironcast. He's responsible for thinking up the crazy weaponry and creating the missions and content that make up the game.\nDaniel's been a professional game developer for more than 8 years. He was a senior designer at Media Molecule, and was a core part of the team that developed the BAFTA winning LittleBIGPlanet games. He designed and built levels and gameplay features for all of Media Molecule's titles, more recently Tearaway for PlayStation VITA. \nHe's also run a business before, as one of the co-founders of Ambient Studios, producers of Monster Meltdown on iOS.\nChris Butler - Programmer, Polygon Hearts. @avalix\nChris is an experienced programmer with 5 years of industry experience. He is responsible for taking Daniel's ideas and Amber's art and bringing them to life!\nHaving starting his career working on AAA titles, Chris gained his experience working on tools and engine code for console and handheld games, and was a core part of the team that brought Need for Speed: Most Wanted to the PS VITA.\nHe then moved onto providing coding services to the indie scene, working on a range of titles such as Monster Meltdown, Hohokum and Super Exploding Zoo.\nHe is also active on Twitter and up for a chat!\nAmber Blade Jones - Artist. @eyecager\nAmber has been a part of the video game industry for 3 years. She worked in-house for 2 years as an artist for Escalation Studios and on the side worked on Skullgirls. \nNothing excites Amber more then seeing robots full of character!\nPhysical rewards:\nFull game pre-loaded on custom USB drive:\nThe drive will come with a DRM free copy of the game pre-loaded onto it (although you'll still receive any digital download codes on launch day so you can get right into the game straight away!). \nI'm assured that the drives are made from recycled materials, so are as eco-friendly as any physical technology can get. They're a great alternative to a plastic box with a DVD inside!\nThese USB drives will not be available after the Kickstarter ends, so they'll be a collector's piece of sorts.\nThe Steampunk Jetpack:\nWe're extremely proud to present the Escape and Evasion Rocket Pack (E.E.R.P), a life-sized, one of a kind steampunk prop, created by the wonderfully talented metalworker, Kruki99. It is completely unique in the world and can only be yours if you opt for our highest pledge level; Grand Iron Admiral.\nThe jet-pack is a non-functioning replica of the type of escape method utilised by many Ironcast Commanders once their steed has been crippled beyond repair. It has been meticulously hand-crafted by Kruki99 using reclaimed materials such as brass, leather and glass. There are no resin or \"metal effect\" components; it is a solid, quality piece of art. \nImagine wearing this to your favourite steampunk or gaming event! The E.E.R.P is the ultimate accessory in steampunk cosplay and fantasy dress-up.\nFor more photos of this incredible pledge reward, please visit Kruki99's Flickr page, here. You can even see some photos of the man himself sporting the piece. \nFinally, a few words about how your money will be spent. \nKickstarter fees: First off, Kickstarter will take an estimated 10% of the funds through Fees, and VAT on those fees.\nDevelopment: We'll require funds in order to pay for audio and animation outsourcing work. Any additional funding over the goal amount will help to pay the core development team and improve our quality of life. \nTaxes: Putting aside up to 15% for UK taxes on funds. \nQuality assurance and testing: A big chunk of the funding will be required to bring in an external QA team for a few weeks to help us squash bugs and fix issues. Obviously this is a fixed amount, so will become a lower percentage if we're lucky enough to receive more pledges than our goal amount. \nMarketing: This doesn't just mean advertising, but also just getting the game onto digital distribution platforms like Steam.\nLegal: as with all businesses and products meant for sale, there will be contracts, solicitors and legal fees to pay. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our trailer video and GIF images, we're already pretty far along with Ironcast's development. We're confident that we can produce the rest of the game in the next 2-3 months with your help. \n\nHowever, experience has shown us that it's often the finishing process that proves to be the most difficult part of the project. Going through quality assurance (QA) and testing phase is one of the toughest times for any development team, especially one as small as ours. \n\nTo combat this, we plan on using some of the Kickstarter funds to hire competent and proven testing outsource team to ensure that Ironcast is as bug free and polished product as you guys deserve. Although costly, dedicated QA testers are vital for ensuring an excellent player experience.\n\nWe're also building the game using Unity, the excellent 3rd party development software package, which should also help to reduce the number of bugs relating to the wide variety of gaming PC hardware.

At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews. Listen to \"Blue\":\nAnd \"Solar Flare\":\nThe lovely voice you hear is actually important to the story and setting of the game, but we don't dare spoil anything...\nIf there's one thing that creators fight, it's obscurity.  \nMoon Hunters was one of the very first games on the Square Enix Collective. Both we and Square Enix were happy that it went on to earn over 1,000 Yes votes, with an 83% approval rating.\nFurther, following a thorough Team Assessment conducted by Square Enix, they concluded: \"Kitfox Games is a small and vibrant team with passion and drive, matched by a high level of ambition. They seem to be hard-working, diligent and professional and Moon Hunters looks engaging, unique and accessible. Square Enix Collective is very happy to support the team\u2019s crowdfunding campaign, and we believe that Kitfox have the skills and capabilities to make the game they\u2019re describing in this pitch.\u201d You can download and read the full Team Assessment at your leisure.\nWe're not getting money from Square Enix. Square Enix is just helping us find our players -- you! We're just four devs trying to scrape by and make a game. Without a big marketing budget, we need all the help we can get! \nYou can read a deeper discussion of why we think partnering with the S.E. Collective is worthwhile at CinemaBlend. Essentially, we want to make a game, and we want to make sure that the people who would love it get a chance to hear that it exists.\nIf you are into RPGs and/or mythology and/or old-fashioned co-op fun, Moon Hunters is the game for you. \nWe are four upstarts that, despite our modest successes in the game industry, don't have savings to fall back on in times of need. To put it bluntly, we're poor, and Moon Hunters is our dream game to make. We can't do it alone. \nPhoto credit: Belziir Photography\n We need your help to make Moon Hunters the best game it can be. We'll use your money to develop the game's programming, art, music, and design for longer and with more help than we could normally dream of affording. Besides, if nobody likes it and we don't get funded, we might be heartbroken, but at least it saves us from spending a year eating cans of beans making a game that people don't want! Win/win! \nThis is also a great opportunity to get feedback and input from players that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together. \nWe try not to let the Canadian winter keep us down...\nSo, if Moon Hunters seems like the kind of game you might want to play, please consider chipping in and spreading the word! \nWe're still in the prototyping phase of production, so there's a lot of game left to make. But we're covering most of it! We decided to take the sales money from Shattered Planet and our company savings to help cover licenses, software, traveling to conferences, and most of the core team salaries, if this Kickstarter succeeds. \nThe money will be spent as follows:  \nFirst, 5% goes to Kickstarter, 3% goes to Visa/Mastercard/Amazon, and 19% goes to Quebec/Canadian taxes.\nThen, 5% goes to Square Enix. \nWe estimate it will take between $5000 and $7000 to handle production and shipping of all of the backer rewards (depending on which tiers are more popular), or about 12%\nThat leaves us the remaining $22,000 or so to spend on audio, more art, a content designer, and additional programmer time.\nThe core team members of Kitfox are the same core team from developing Shattered Planet, which was developed from idea to release on four platforms in 13 months (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It received praise from The New Yorker, CNET, and others, and remains highly praised on Steam. It was also chosen to be at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014!\n And who are we? We're Kitfox Games!\nThe limited edition T-shirt design is on charcoal grey cotton and features a Spellblade design.\nClick to view a higher-res version!\n We're offering 4 different 12x18\" poster designs, signed by the core team for a limited run, unique to this Kickstarter.\nClick to view a high-res version!\nIf you purchase a fabric print, you can choose from one of five different 10x13\" designs (one for each character class and a cloth map representing one possible world configuration), printed directly onto Belgian linen. They are safe to wash, though we don't recommend using them as a BBQ bib, okay?\nThe Digital Art Book will include the concept art of Moon Hunters. You will get a hand-picked collection of beautiful watercolour artworks in a neatly designed PDF file. It includes some exclusive early concepts that we haven't shown to anyone!\nHere's a visual guide to all the tiers and rewards in their pixel glory:\nIf you can't find the perfect tier, why not build your own?\nDuring checkout, add the following amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Keep your original pledge tier the same.

After the funding is completed we will be emailing all of our backers to do a final check before the order is completed.\nWhat can it repel?\nWhat can the fabric resist?\nOur shorts are resistant to all water based substances including coffee, soda and fruit juice. This also means it's resistant to any forms of staining you would receive from said liquids. \nIs it a topical coating?\nDefinitely not. The fabric we use has a hydrophobic nanostructure inside the actual fabric itself, making it breathable and completely safe for use. We are currently the only swimwear company on the market using this hydrophobic nanotechnology fabric. This fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry-times by up to 95% in contrast to regular 100% polyester swim shorts.\nIs it safe to use Hydrophobic Nanotechnology on clothing?\nYes, we use a fabric that is PFOA, DEHP and DINP free, making it soft to the touch and completely safe for use.\nHow long does the Hydrophobic Technology last?\nThe Hydrophobic technology will last the entire life of the shorts. We have tested the garment in chlorine and salt water and they have no effect on the Hydrophobic Nanotechnology Fabric the shorts are made out of. Washing your shorts will also not deteriorate the longevity of the hydrophobic nanostructure. These shorts were designed for being submerged underwater for long periods of time and have shown no loss of hydrophobic capabilities.\nWhat happens to the inside of the garment?\nBoth sides of the garment are Hydrophobic and will perform equally on both sides. \nHow long are the shorts?\nThe shorts are 17 inches in length and are designed to sit just above the knee on the average male.\nWhere is it made?\nThe shorts are manufactured in Italy with Swiss Fabric.\nAre they washable?\nYes, they should be washed with like colours and there is no need to iron or dry clean them. The Hydrophobic Nanotechnology is not affected by any form of washing and will not deteriorate. \nWhere did you get the idea?\nWe were tired of having to change shorts every time you leave the beach, having car seats soaked and not being able to go from the beach to a restaurant. We decided to look at different topical applications for use but shortly found out they changed the texture of the fabric and had no way of being used on garments. We decided to scrap the idea and look for the perfect alternative. We found the leading textile manufacturer who specializes in high performance nanotechnology fabrics operating out of Switzerland, and focused extensively on creating the most visually appealing and scientifically advanced pair of swim shorts in the world. \nDo you have a website?\nwww.frankanthonyshorts.com\nCurrent Progress\nWe have built a close relationship with our swiss textile mill and have sample shorts already made in their ready to ship form.

Our current design is the third generation of shorts after scrapping previous designs because they did not meet our standards of comfort, practicality, durability and aesthetic appeal which our current design possess.

It provides replayability with random elements that make each playthrough fresh, including beating the game with each of the three factions.\nUpdate #2: Bridging the tactical and overland map\nUpdate #3: Assembling a Tactical Map\nThe Divide is a region at the edge of the galaxy. Mining in the Divide is difficult and costly. Renowned for the huge amount of space between it and the nearest inhabited system, it's the place miners went to get away. \nThe Divide has another reason people did not like it \u2013 some rocks have inactive mines where automated robots offload the minerals to their masters. When miners approach, these automated droids defend the asteroids fiercely. It is unknown who left behind these robots.\nThen Deadrock was found.\nDeadrock is incredibly valuable. Used all over the galaxy, its value is astronomical. Finding Deadrock brought in money, power, and conflict.\nThe Divide is not considered part of any other region of the galaxy. This meant there was no law and no one stopping a massacre. Multiple fleets entered the region and fought in terrible and costly battles. Very little actual mining happened as these war fleets fought.A truce was called by necessity.\nThe fragile peace of the rest of the galaxy has been broken. All warships were called back to battle in an epic war for the throne. This has left Deadrock Divide alone again but with more influence entering.\nCorporations are still greedy. People still demand Deadrock. The flood of prospectors has opened.\nPeople are entering the Divide for riches, to flee the war, or to get away from whatever demons chase them. It has created an unstable and vicious stretch of space.\nEnter Deadrock Divide. Build a crew. Pick a faction and conquer.\nWhenever you board a ship, fight a space station, or even just mine for minerals, it all takes place in turn-by-turn tactical combat with your crew. Move your soldiers to take cover, fire weapons, toss grenades, build turrets and more.\nPre-Alpha tactical gameplay of Deadrock Divide\nThe objects in the battlefield are fully destructible. If you know an alien is behind a wall, blow up the wall to give your other soldiers line of fire. Throw down a turret to provide cover as the walls around you are taken down. Use Space Magic to take enemies out of cover and ensure your sniper\u2019s best shot.\nDestructible walls (pre-alpha footage)\nYour characters abilities in combat are driven by choices you make as they level up and their gear. You build characters how you want. If you have a character with Space Magic, give him points in athletics making him super tanky. There are no classes so you define how your crew fights.\nThe ships in Deadrock are as varied as their tasks. Cargo haulers, drillers, hot rods, and more are flying through space. You\u2019ll be able to buy a number of different ships, upgrade them, and fly across space in your missions.\nEach ship is made up of a number of rooms. You can upgrade, change, and rearrange the rooms in your ship whenever you visit a hangar. Do you want to do some mining? You will need a drilling room. Do you want to carry more cargo so you can trade more at a time? Buy more cargo rooms. There will be over a dozen different types of rooms for you play around with. What\u2019s really cool, as well, if you get boarded, you will fight on your ship in the layout of rooms you have created. Want help fighting off boarders? Buy a sentry room with turrets in it.\nMeet with the varied peoples of Deadrock Divide. The asteroid will be a place to fly around and uncover the world. We'll tell the story of those lost aliens as well as the battles that brought the Divide to the place it is now.\nThe world of Deadrock Divide has a history that we are excited to leave for the player to find. Discovery in sandbox environments are always some of the most satisfying moments for us.\nPirates and other hazards await\nThree major factions have entered the Divide in attempt to control the Deadrock. Players can help the factions in their plans and eventually the player can join one of the factions and take control of the region.\nD.I.G. was in the region before Deadrock was found. It's a group of miners trying yo get by. Originally when corporations flooded in the miners in the area just let it be. Eventually as the conflicts escalated the miners felt they needed to push back. Slowly many of the miners in the area have formed together to control the major rocks and force the corporations out.\nServius Industries is one of the larger technology companies throughout the Galaxy. With the uncovered Deadrock there was some desire to move in for the elusive ore. Servius had long desired to uncover the technology of the robot miners, but Deadrock allowed the company to offset costs of research with the profits they would recover from mining Deadrock.\nThe Lost hate being in the Divide. They are a splinter group of an alien race. Sent here to mine Deadrock in massive quantities, The Lost are mining as much of the mineral as possible to get out of the region as fast as possible. They use the most destructive though speedy methods of getting Deadrock out of the rocks.\n\nDru loves puppies, rainbows, and whiskey. He also loves tactical games, strategy games, and RPGs. Dru comes from a AAA background where he made strategy games, and a game where you killed a bunch of bad guys that ran down lanes. When Dru isn\u2019t coding the far reaches of our galaxy, he plays every board game he can get his hands on.\nMat has a beard. In his previous life, he animated men, women, and monsters in an MMO on the high seas. With Deadrock, he\u2019s thrilled to create a world inspired from awesome 80\u2019s cartoons and sci-fi, mashing them together and creating a unique world. Mat has long loved deep RPG game systems. You can find him tweaking a mech for hours or thinking about new builds for all sorts of games.\nSteve is a master of pen and ink. He\u2019s worked on almost every aspect of creating art for a number of game projects over the years. From concept all the way through final animation, Steve painstakingly crafts all the intricate elements of Deadrock Divide. The world has more scan lines, neon, and glow thanks to Steve.\nBootsnake previously made Containment: The Zombie Puzzler, a puzzle game that was selected as one of the PAX10 in 2012 and Google Play Best of 2013. Containment is a unique puzzle game combining elements of match three games with the classic game Go.\nCheck out the reward tiers. There are some awesome rewards that we really think are amazing.

(All content must be deemed appropriate and fit in the world of Deadrock Divide.)\nName a Corporation - There are a few corporations who manufacture most of the items in Deadrock. These are major companies who will have a logo, name on many items, and be found througout the Divide. You'll get to work with us to name a company, help come up with the logo, and the history of the company to be found in game. (The corporation must be appropriate for the world of Deadrock Divide.)\nDesign a Quest - We'll work with you to design a quest from top to bottom with your involvement. From where you find the quest, to the dialogue, to the mission, to the rewards in game, you'll directly be involved in creating a quest in the world of Deadrock Divide. You'll work with us to make sure it fits the world and is apporpriate. It will bear your fingerprints all over.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk of making this sort of project is to run late in development.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What\u2019s missing? Looking back to all the TV and Movies that inspired us, like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly, we realised games are missing something integral: a crew. A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we\u2019ve taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\nWe wanted to make a game where you\u2019re not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you\u2019ll feel the loss that comes with that.\nThat\u2019s where the drama is, that\u2019s where the story happens, and it\u2019s the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience.\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory \u2013 and we want you to join us.\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\nAs the captain of a ship, you\u2019ll lead your men through battles, boarding operations, and space exploration through a hierarchy of officers, selected and honed by you.\nYou\u2019ll explore your vessel isometrically, discovering the inner workings and day to day life of the officers and crew who serve under you. Invite dignitaries to your chamber, or defend your vessel from attack on foot (in the style of Jagged Alliance, X Com.)\nAs you lead your men to victory, yourself and officers who survive will have access to upgrades and talents, affecting gameplay and offering new tactical opportunities. Make the wrong decision, and expect to lose your officer for good with our rogue-like chain of command.\nConcept for ingame Bridge view\nBattles from space are orchestrated from the classical perspective (Star Trek Online, Klingon Academy, Freelancer, etc.) Whilst in this view, your crew will take their battle stations within the ship, affected by hazards \u2013 even being sucked out of a hull breach. Whatever happens outside of the vessel, affects those within it.\nBoarding operations allow you to isometrically zoom in on your units, or zoom out into Space Battle View at your disclosure. Fight the war on two fronts. Battle in the style of games like Men of War at the same time as fighting battles reminiscent of Klingon Academy.\nTrust your crew? Allow them to fight autonomously, and deal with the ships hands on.\nConcept for ingame boarding\nOur modular design will allow you to build your ships (link to Ship designer) and space station to fit your play style. With thousands of combinations, and the potential for thousands more over the period of the campaign and launch, it\u2019s possible to create something completely unique.\nChange the design for tactical, defensive, and strategic capabilities \u2013 skin, colour, and mix-and-match to your heart\u2019s desire. \nThe Mandate is a sandbox RPG (similarities with Pirates! And Mount and Blade), allowing you to travel the galaxy through a series of jump-gates, opening doors to new systems.\nIf you or your friends are in trouble, instantly jump to their location from outside of the game using Steam.\nEach system of the universe offers a series of procedurally generated content which varies every time, as well as hand-crafted story-driven content for you to take advantage of. What you do in The Mandate is entirely up to you, but as you gain power and unlock more systems, you\u2019ll drive the story forward.\nWith new factions to be found in each sector, and Starbases to be scavenged, looted, and built, watch your empire grow as you conquer and explore the depths of space, where new quests and unexplored territories will reward the most experienced of captains.\nAt its core, that\u2019s The Mandate \u2013 a fantastical space RPG about betrayal, scavenging, exploration, combat, and honor. These elements are eloquently wrapped in an all-original history and lore, waiting to be discovered.\nWith both iterative and entirely unique mechanics and concepts, we\u2019ve been inspired by franchises such as X Com for our upgrading system, Fallout for scavenging and survival, Battlestar Galactica for the sense of home and community, crewmanship, Star Trek Online and Klingon Academy for space battles, and Jagged Alliance or Men of War for RTS style boarding operations. We\u2019re taking the best of what was, and reinstating the old-school \u2013 and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re doing it right.\nWe've written 1500 years of history. It's up to you to write the future. The explorable reaches of space mix hand-crafted and procedurally generated content and is packed with historically relevant easter-eggs offering insight into the Mandate's rich lore.\nEach level of the game, from the political tier of warring empires, through the strategic level of individual star systems and naval battles, down to personal interactions with other characters impacts on how your story develops.\nThe decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.\nAffect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.\nIn the far future, mankind has abandoned the exhausted, dying world of Earth and gone on to colonize hundreds more worlds. These colonies were united under the rules of the Imperial Mandate, and linked by faster-than-light travel gates. As civilization continued to expand, corruption within the Mandate and dissent in the outer systems fomented a rebellion against Imperial rule.\nThe untimely death of the last Emperor gave the rebels their opportunity. The military was recalled to his state funeral and the investiture of his successor - a young and inexperienced Empress who took the throne with limited political support. Seizing the moment, the outer systems declared their intention to break away from the Mandate.\nThe Empress dispatched the Grand Fleet to restore order, but saboteurs redirected the travel gates, and the fleet ended up scattered across the galaxy. The Empress was left vulnerable without the protection of her navy.\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. The Empress founded the Corsairs, a new fleet captained by disgraced ex-Mandate officers jailed for breaching the Articles of War. Reinstated under the promise of redemption, these veterans are the last hope of the Mandate. You are a member of the Corsairs. With a small ship, you must move swiftly and make your way to the far reaches of Mandate space. Your mission - to discover the fate of the Grand Fleet and restore order to the outer systems.\nThere was a time when gaming wasn\u2019t about running through a corridor, firing off rounds into hordes of enemies. There are hundreds of mechanically magnificent titles out there on PC, and hundreds of teams equipped to make them. The only reason they\u2019ve declined is that they don\u2019t sell as well as something you\u2019d find on the consoles. We want to change that, and we have the knowledge to do so.\nThe Mandate is an ambitious title, but we are tackling each of the core elements with equal attention. By making each gear in the mechanism function correctly and optimally, our end result will be something mechanically interesting, with a lot of depth.\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from some of the finest strategy and RPG titles from past and present; working iteratively with their ideas and concepts. These are ideas that have worked in the past, but unfortunately declined with the changing PC gaming demographic. We know you\u2019re out there, and we\u2019re bringing them back. With tried and tested game mechanics, and some completely original ones, all it takes is the knowledge to bring them together \u2013 hard-earned knowledge that our team members have gained through years of games industry experience.\n\u2022 The ships of The Mandate are modular designs, allowing us - and you - to manually mix and match various parts, or to randomly generate any number of designs for the game world.\n\u2022 One of the themes of The Mandate is that ships are home to many of the world\u2019s inhabitants. Space stations and ships will be our cities. They are naturally much smaller than lunar structures \u2013 however, there will be many of them.\n\u2022 Whilst much of space in The Mandate is hand crafted, there are also procedurally generated areas to keep things fresh and offer replayability and interesting battle options in multiplayer. This allows us to offload some of the work to a complex world building algorithm.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we have experience building massive worlds. Many of our team hail from some of the most successful MMO projects ever created.\n\u2022 We\u2019re careful \u2013 using several middlewares to streamline development and reduce risk, increase efficiency, and most importantly, avoid wasting time. Unity3D is a great tool for this.\nCreating a new RPG world isn\u2019t easy, what have you done differently?\nThe biggest mistake a storyteller can make in gaming is to believe they are writing the future. The future is up to you: the gamers. Because of this, we\u2019ve taken the time to do a lot of research into building a believable past. We believe the story to be so important to The Mandate, that we\u2019ve written 1500 years of history based on Tsarist Russian lore and history. What if the Tsars ruled space?\nThe Mandate is part alternative-history, part fantasy. You\u2019ll be writing the future in The Mandate, it\u2019s simply our job to provide you with the context. Throughout our kickstarter period, you\u2019ll be introduced to our characters, how they\u2019re designed, their names, and their pasts. Even you, the player, will be able to choose your path from families dating back to the Tsarist period. The world of The Mandate did not happen spontaneously \u2013 there are reasons for the way that it is, and throughout this campaign and the games launch day, you\u2019ll enjoy exposition and story updates offering insight into our rich new world.\nWe are an international team: Canada, USA, Sweden, Norway, UK, France, Slovakia.\nWe are a team of veteran developers who decided to go Indie together and come from different game developers each with their own strengths [ex-EA, ex-2K Games, ex-Ubisoft, ex-Funcom]. Previously we have worked on and shipped both singleplayer, multiplayer and MMO AAA productions with team size ranging from 30 to 200\nSome of the titles we have worked on and shipped include: Assassin's Creed 1&2, Mafia 2, Alan Wake, FarCry 2&3, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures,Call of Duty 3, Splinter Cell, Planet of the Apes, Saga of Ryzom, FIFA ONLINE, FarCry Evolution, Rainbow 6 Vegas, The Secret World and more.\nPlease refer to the FAQ for full team statement. Portfolio links:\nGarret (Art Director)\nVegard (Tech Director)\nWe are big fans of sci-fi, be it video games or series like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Firefly. We are CRPG players and some of our favourites are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, The Witcher, Gothic, but we also remember classics like Ultima 7 or Microprose's Darklands. We are strategy players and have fond memories of the original X-Com, Carrier Command, Jagged Alliance and more! We love pen & paper tabletop: D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Traveller, Shadow Run and more! And also we are board game geeks: Warhammer, Warmachines.\nWe plan on taking all our inspirations, hobbies and diverse development experiences to ensure we deliver a game you will want to play for many hours both alone in dark space and together with your captain friends.\nTier reward information can be found here.\nCLICK HERE for digital add-ons. If you wish to pick a digital add-on simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount. E.g. if you wish to name a marine ($25) and get the base game with soundtrack ($20) then you would pledge $45 in total and pick the $20 reward tier. After Kickstarter is over, we will transfer your unused credits over to BackerKit where you can spend them on digital add-ons. \nKickstarter is the preferred backing avenue but if you for some reason cannot use Kickstarter, then you can visit our PayPal store.\nReward tiers that grant extra copies [so $150 and above] also include the Cossack Captain tier (alpha, beta, season pass etc) for each extra copy.\nWe have put a lot of thought into thinking about fairness \u2013 especially when it comes to games and their PR and marketing teams. For this reason, to say thank you for your vote of confidence reflected in your pledge amount, we are putting our entire marketing team in the darkest airlock on-ship.\nThey have each been issued a \u201cFairness Directive\u201d, a set of rules they have to follow to make sure there is a coherent and direct flow of information between you and the developers. They have been ordered to be firm, frank, and fair.\nRewards are certainly mentioned in the Fairness Directive, and we will not be selling alpha or beta access at inflated prices. We believe access to the game should be included in the relevant pledge tiers, and we should not profit from your willingness to provide feedback. You are part of the team, and we respect you.\nTherefore, as the pledge tiers scale, you\u2019ll see access to exclusive content that we consider real value for money. Many of these will not be sold separately, and you will not see some of them sold on Steam. They are a thank-you for your continued feedback and support, and there is some exciting stuff such as the Season Pass (access to the first expansion pack and content updates), and access to all early builds of the game (pre-alpha).\nAs you continue to browse the tier pledge rewards, you will even get a chance to completely change the game, and leave a permanent mark on the world of The Mandate. \nRemember, any breach of the Fairness Directive will result in a swift ejection through the airlock, replacing the guilty party with a robotic AI (they are cheaper to feed, anyway).\nAs the Empress placed her trust in the Corsairs securing her a grand victory, your trust is well placed in us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUPDATE\nSome backers have asked to see a clearer cost breakdown. We will not be providing a \u201ccake diagram\u201d as we believe that gives a false sense of security. Instead we have put together a development timeline to illustrate the allocation of manpower for the different stages of development. Keep in mind we are on Indie salaries. The Kickstarter campaign will cover the positions outlined and some devs are prepared to work for free as an additional buffer.\n\nhttp://ships.mandategame.com/images/20131015_KS_dev_budget.png\n\n\u201cWe are taking the pre-production process very seriously indeed. The combat prototype has been in development for almost a year, and only a subset of it is shown in the ship designer. We will get back to this in more detail later in the campaign. \n\n\nPre-production features a skeleton size unit of full-time staff. Other staff are kept informed of creative decisions and when their roles will be needed once production starts. This saves time, money and allows the skeleton team to focus their efforts. Once the production tools are ready, we will ramp up and assign additional full-time staff to their positions. Additionally, we have no big corporate HQ and minimal expenses. Our producer does not have a driving license and as such expenses for company cars will be minimal... (but we might buy him a bike!)\n\nWe are economically efficient, utilizing resources (such as your pledge money) in the best ways possible. We do contingency planning and set aside buffer time to have a reserve. We have funded the prototype so far with side-income and by working late nights.\n\nOur staff understands our budget limitations and the implications for roadmaps and scheduling. We will only hire for position X when it is necessary -not before, and since we have access to a large network of game industry professionals this simplifies the recruitment process. Because we have a clear focus we do not need to give people a task to do merely because they are sitting around. This would be inefficient and wasteful. We will not have Day1 DLCs for the Mandate, and our focus is on delivering the best possible experience at launch to everybody who buys the game. Proper content updates and expansion packs will be planned before launch but developed after based on input from the community, particularly the Kickstarter donors who are our bosses.\n\n\nOn the technological side, Unity3D (the game\u2019s engine) comes with a working world editor, a build system for creating versions of the game, and the ability to deploy to multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has its own eco-system with 3rd party plugins which we purchase for a reasonable price and can use in our project. This saves us time and allows us to do things like push the visual fidelity with one example being TC Particles which allow GPU accelerated DX11 particles. Check out the ship designer and study the impact effect on the shields. It just looks awesome. TC Particles is just one example and we have other bigger plugins or middelware available to us as well like a stable, tried and tested network engine which we have already gained valuable experience with. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed beyond integration, bugfixing and maintenance. \n\nOur team has half a century of game development experience between us, including major MMOs. This is a much smaller project than an MMO, which traditionally demands very capable content production tools. We are taking our combined knowledge and experience to setup and structure efficient workflows and production pipelines. This includes decoupling dependencies between art, code and design to minimize the amount of wait-time and avoid blockers. \n\nMiddleware is the key and we would prefer to license something which has been tried and tested rather than reinventing the wheel. This frees us up to focus on the game and avoid unnecessary distractions. At the moment, we are evaluating several character creation middleware tools which will make the process of setting up characters a breeze for the artists. At the same time players will have access to extensive character customization options. A common theme for both art and game design is to apply a modular and reusable approach. On the art side the procedural textures are an excellent example and if you have tested our ship designer, you will appreciate the versatility it provides even at this early stage. On the design side we are heavily data-driven: our tools must support major changes to content without requiring the involvement of programmers, which would create unwanted dependencies and blockers. \n\nOne final point to make, if you inspect our reward tiers you will see that we do not have any physical rewards. This means we do not divert Kickstarter funds to produce physical goods and instead we can use the funds to fully realize the actual game. To compensate for this we are providing what we believe are fair reward tiers where backers even at lower tiers get to put their mark on the game. Higher tier rewards are bundled with additional copies of the game so backers can split the cost among friends.\n\n\nStill, we understand that some backers would prefer physical copies and merchandise and here is a promise:\n\n\nOnce our funding goals are reached, we will add physical reward tiers and outsource the production and shipping to our backers who will pay for only production and shipping. If people want t-shirts made we will supply the graphics to make your own t-shirts or other merchandise. We will not make a dime off of you ordering that set of China with the Empress Anastasia on it that you always wanted. We are game developers -not Manchester United! \n\n\nTo summarize: we have the necessary know-how, experience and technology, and our overhead is minimal. The Mandate is the love child of some very experienced game developers who all want to see this project succeed. We are doing smart things with smart technology and will pick the right tools for the job to optimize the work-load and streamline our production pipelines and workflows.

Thank you!\n  FITT SPECS:\nMaterials: Knit Elastic from Prym, Ripstop Nylon from Seattle Fabrics, Hook and Loop Fastener from Velcro, Number 5 Thread.\nDimensions (with 1 card): 3.44\" tall x 2.38\" wide. Effective thickness is 0.10\", except in the Velcro area which is about .23\" thick.\nCapacity: 8 cards with 10 bills, 6 cards with 13 bills, 2-4 cards with 15 bills. It will hold more, but that will put unwanted stress on the seams.\nColors: Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Grey.\nThe long story short is that we tried a bunch of slim wallets and thought their small size was amazing, but using them with cash or multiple cards was a pain. We spent a few hundred hours trying to design a better slim wallet because that's what we do, and we think our efforts finally paid off when we had the idea for FITT. For the all-inclusive story read on :)  \nI first learned about 'Slim Wallets' on Kickstarter earlier this year and was immediately on a mission to find the best one for myself. So I spent maybe 4-5 hours researching the countless number of wallet designs out there and narrowed them down a handful I wanted to try. Buying each one would have run almost a couple hundred bucks, and I love to make stuff anyways, so I ended up re-creating each design with my 3D printer and sewing machine. \n3D Printer + Sewing Machine = Ability to make almost any wallet!\nAfter a couple weeks of testing the various wallets had gone by, two things were clear:\nThe tiny size of slim wallets was like a breath of fresh air in my pockets and I knew I'd never go back to my huge old leather wallet.\nSlim wallets were a pain to use, especially for cash transactions since bills had to be folded into 1/4's (unless the wallet itself was significantly larger than a credit card, which I didn't want either). Card transactions were just fine until I wanted to use a 2nd or 3rd card, which I often do. Some wallets were a little better than others no doubt, but they all lacked ease of use IMHO, at least for my personal needs.\nNow I work as a product design engineer for a living and this seemed like an opportunity to try my hand at designing a better slim wallet. I told my designer friend Atiim about it and he decided to help out, which was great because two heads are better than one and he's more knowledgeable than I am with what's called 'Interaction Design'. \nWe made and tested all kinds of existing and original wallet designs\nIt was a really fun design process because from an engineering standpoint a wallet is a very simple system, which means we could isolate variables (wallet features) and iterate designs easily compared to the more complex products we usually work on (see bio for past work references). We got pretty obsessed with trying out every possible option for typical wallet features such as materials, pocket orientations, cash pocket size, card/cash access features, closure methods etc. Because of this we ended up making and testing a ton of different prototypes for both existing designs as well as our own unique concepts. \nCAD models for some of the 3D printed prototypes we created\nAfter a couple months of work Atiim and I were a little bummed... we had a lot of unique designs and a couple were pretty good, but they weren't all that superior to what was already available. Around this time a good idea finally came to me late one night while playing around with one of the initial prototypes; just make a folding design with elastic card pockets on the outside and keep the inner cash pocket as thin as possible. I was too excited to sleep that night and by 6 o'clock the next morning I'd sewn a couple different versions of wallets based on the new idea. Testing quickly confirmed those first FITT wallets had clear ease-of-use advantages when it came to handling both cash and multiple cards. In our line of work, coming up with a novel design that provides such advantages is absolutely the best feeling there is, so we were really happy at that point.\nThree early FITT prototypes. We tried various card orientations, closure methods, and materials to perfect the details after the basic idea was in place.\nAfter a couple more weeks of detailed design/testing we had FITT dialed in to its best embodiment and met with local manufacturers in San Diego who could make it in production volumes. The manufacturer we chose is a full-service sewing contractor that specializes in making things like backpacks, outdoor gear, accessories, and pretty much anything else that can be sewn. We've met with them five times now and they've made five different sample wallets in order to ensure our tolerances and quality standards can be met in production volumes. They're ready to start production as soon as we give the go-ahead and we plan to take out a loan to begin making wallets as soon as the goal is met, not after the Kickstarter campaign has ended.\nManufacturing drawing for the first revision of the FITT wallet. Drawings like this one are used to control the manufacturing process and ensure the finished goods meet the quality standards specified.\nA huge thank you to Travis Morgan for his fantastic song 'Cafe Connection' (instrumental version), which was featured in the video.

Despite all this, there are often delays during production... it just happens and it's very common from our experience. \n\nIf problems do arise we will certainly put all our effort into fixing them, you can be sure of that. We have a few other designs in the pipeline and want to be here for the long haul, not disappear after the campaign ends.\n\nScaling production will be challenging if the volumes go far above the goal, which is why we've limited the number of awards for earlier delivery dates based on manufacturer lead times.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Status and international email confirmations", "update_content": "Important! - If you're an international backer and have not received an email confirmation for your mailing address from 'info@penandclay.com', please check your spam box for Tuesday the 21'st through Thursday the 23rd (last week) and respond to that email.\n\nAs of today 88% of all rewards have been shipped.

This means that bills taller than 75mm will stick out the top of the pocket a bit, so please check to make sure the bills you'll be using are short enough to fit inside.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking.

I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now.

Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes.

He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear.

That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered.

The lens was invented by Joseph Petzval in Vienna in 1840 and had a huge impact on the development of photography. Photos shot with a Petzval lens are immediately recognizable for their sharpness and crispness, strong color saturation, wonderful swirly bokeh effect, artful vignettes and narrow depth of field. The totally distinctive look of Petzval photos is all about the fantastic lens design that gives you the satisfaction of the instant optic experience that goes far beyond using photo editing software and filters.\nFor this Kickstarter project, we are reinventing the Petzval Lens for 21st century photographers and videographers. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you shoot analog or digital; the brand new Lomography Petzval Portrait Lens is designed to work with Canon EF and Nikon F mount cameras. So, for the first time, you can easily get the fantastic Petzval photographic look with 35mm analog cameras and DSLR cameras too. This will bring with it a whole new world of possibilities; from shooting Petzval photos with your 35mm SLR or DSLR, to creating amazing DSLR movies with the lens!\nShot using an old Petzval Lens from the 19th Century on a Canon 5D\nThe Petzval Portrait Lens is a high-quality glass optic; it's a must-have lens for anyone looking to enhance their creative potential and turn every photo into a timeless artwork.\nExpected delivery date of the lenses is on February 2014. However, we are confident to have the first 1000 lenses shipped out by December 2013.\nThe retail launch price of the lens is currently planned as $499/\u20ac499 and the Special Edition at $599/\u20ac599, so you can make some great savings by backing us on Kickstarter! When the lenses are ready, you'll be able to pick whether you want a Canon or Nikon compatible Petzval lens. Each lens looks absolutely fantastic attached to DSLR cameras and analog cameras! \nShot with an old Petzval lens from the 19th century on a Canon 5D\nPlease note: The Petzval shots shown here are either from an old Petzval lens or the first working prototype, which is of extremely high quality. However, we are still working on a few minor details, especially perfecting the Bokeh effect that makes this lens so special. \nThe lens as well as its accompanying lens hood will also undergo small design changes. Rest assured that you can expect an extraordinary lens upon completion of the project!\nThe Re-revolution of Portrait Photography\nThe Lomography Petzval Lens attached to analogue Canon and Nikon SLRs\nThe Lomography Petzval Lens attached to Digital Canon and Nikon SLRs\nWhy are we bringing back the Petzval two centuries after it was created? Well, we\u2019re not just looking to re-build the lenses; we have re-designed and re-engineered the optics to work with a whole new generation of cameras!\nThe original Petzval lens was a truly revolutionary invention. The speed and performance of Petzval's design was especially well suited for portrait shooting and helped give birth to commercial photography as we know it. And just as Joseph Petzval turned the world of photography on its head in 1840 when he first invented the lens, the brand new Lomography Petzval Portrait lens promises to do the same in the 21st Century by giving you truly incredible effects on a whole range of modern SLR cameras.\nThe new Lomography Petzval lens has great color saturation and high contrast. The resolution of the focused area of each photo is extremely high. Thanks to the new and improved Petzval optical design, the Lomography Lens has a large f/2.2 maximum aperture; it's very hard to find older Petzval lenses which have an aperture larger than f/3.5. Because of the large aperture of the new lens, you'll get photos with a very narrow depth of field, and when shooting with the aperture wide open, you'll get a beautiful vignetting effect in your shots.It's the ideal portrait lens!\nAn old Petzval lens (shown on the left) and the new Lomography Petzval Lens (shown on the right)\nA Mind-blowing Lens Effect\nMost modern lenses are designed to minimize field curvature, so you\u2019ll have the whole image in focus. But the Petzval lens design gives its photos a totally different optical effect. You\u2019ll get an area which is very sharp at the focus of the photograph over a narrow field. There is then progressive vignetting towards the non-focused areas; this helps draw the viewer\u2019s attention to the crisp and focused area of the photograph.\nA Diagram Showing The Petzval Design. When The Object Center Is In Focus, The Object Edge Appears Out Of Focus\nA Diagram Showing A Regular Lens Design. Both The Object Center & Object Edge Appear In Focus\nIt's because of the early large aperture optic design of Petzval that photos taken with the lens will have this beautiful, swirly bokeh effect in the background. The best way to get a sense of this effect is to check out some photos taken with the first working prototype of our New Petzval Lens and an old Petzval lens from the 19th century! These quirky, creative and unique effects from the lens have endeared it to a whole new generation of photographers. Using the Petzval lens is totally different to just adding a filter to your shots in post-production; it\u2019s about achieving a real optical effect caused by the lens attached to your camera.\nAn Engineering Breakthrough\nThe new Petzval Lenses is designed and constructed by a team of optics specialists at the Zenit factory in Russia, together with Lomography. Zenit are master lens manufacturers and have the skill to build the Petzval lens for use with today\u2019s SLR cameras. There are very few companies worldwide who still have enough knowledge of optics to complete a project such as this.\nA Technical Drawing of the Lomography Petzval Lens\nReinventing the Petzval is no easy task and we have had to start from scratch to bring this project to life. The teams at Zenit and Lomography have worked together to re-draw, re-calculate and re-measure the original 1840 Petzval lens to make it work with a whole host of modern cameras, whilst retaining the characteristic effects that made the original Petzval famous. We have sourced new production materials, created a faster lens than the original Petzval and one which has smoother focusing too. The new Lomography Petzval lens will be built from brass (just like the original Petzval lens) and features premium Russian-made glass optics.\nShot with the first working prototype of our New Petzval Lens on a Canon EOS 500 \u2013 See Hi-Res\nThe Story of The Original Petzval Lens\nWhen the original Daguerre & Giroux Camera was introduced in 1839, it used a lens designed by Charles Chevalier. This camera marked the very beginning of modern analog photography and was of fundamental importance. But Chevalier\u2019s lens had several problems. It had a slow, small aperture of f/15; this meant that even in bright sunlight, exposures could take 10 minutes or more.\nJoseph Petzval was a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Vienna and worked on a rival lens design which was introduced in 1840 (by the way, as well as being the place where Petzval lived, Vienna is the home of Lomography!). At f/3.6, Petzval\u2019s large aperture design was about 20 times faster than the Chevalier lens and produced photographs which were extremely sharp at the focused area.\nObviously, the original Petzval lens was designed in order to work with the cameras manufactured in the 19th century. Most of these cameras were large-format analog cameras. It\u2019s extremely hard to find a Petzval lens today which works easily with smaller format cameras. The new Lomography Petzval Portrait lens changes all this and allows you to enjoy the magic of the Petzval lens optic using your analog or digital SLR camera.\nIn photo: Sinar P2 4x5 with a Voigtlander & Sohn Petzval Lens\nShooting with an old Petzval lens setup\nThe Petzval Lens with Josef Petzval's grave in Vienna\nA Portrait of Joseph Petzval\nPetzval In Motion\nOne of the most exciting features of the new Petzval Portrait Lens is that, for the first time ever, it\u2019s possible to easily shoot DSLR movies with the Petzval optic effect. Achieving the beautiful and distinctive results the lens gives is very, very hard to achieve in post-production; with the new Petzval lens, it becomes as easy as attaching a new lens to your DSLR!\nThe Waterhouse Aperture System\nThe new Lomography Petzval Lens works using a traditional Waterhouse aperture system. With this design, your lens comes with a set of stops (also known as diaphragms). Each diaphragm is drilled with a hole of a different size; these sizes correspond to the f-stop or aperture. So if you\u2019d like to shoot with f/4 aperture, you select the f/4 diaphragm and insert it into the aperture slot of your lens; if you\u2019d like to shoot with a f/11 aperture, you select the f/11 diaphragm and so on. Here are the aperture options for the Lomography Petzval lens:\nf/2.2\nf/4\nf/5.6\nf/8\nf/11\nf/16\nThe Waterhouse Aperture System\n\nLens Technical Specifications\nFocal Length: 85mm\nMaximum Aperture: f/2.2 \nApertures: Waterhouse aperture set, up to f/16\nImage Circle: 44mm\nField of View: 30 degrees\nLens Mounting Profile: Canon EF and Nikon F\nElectronic contacts: No\nClosest Focusing Distance: 1m\nFocusing Mechanism: Gear Rack Focusing\nLens Construction: 4 Elements in 3 Groups\nFilter Thread: 67mm\nMax.

Interested in stocking the Petzval lens or our other products in your shop? Please contact us at orders@lomography.com\nDelivery Information\nThe Petzval lens will be available for most countries throughout the world. Unfortunately however, backers from Brazil or Russia will have to pay an extra 100 USD for shipping the lens. Lomography will not be held liable for any additional shipping and customs duties that may occur in these countries. This is because we will not use our local logistics hubs in these countries, and these items will be shipped from the the USA.\nFor our backers in the USA, most people don't need to pay any additional shipping costs. However, backers who live in the States of New York or Illinois do need to pay Sales Tax. For backers from New York, please add an additional 8.875% onto your pledge amount to cover local sales tax. For customers in Illinois, please add an additional 9.5% onto your pledge amount to cover local sales tax. So for example, if you live in the State of New York and pledged for the $400 reward, please add an additional $35.50 onto your pledge amount ($35.50 is 8.875% of $400) to cover New York Sales Tax. If you haven\u2019t added this additional sales tax yet, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s easy to do. You can edit the amount you pledge right up until the project ends on the project page.  \nFor backers outside the USA, please note that we charge an additional $40 for most pledges to cover shipping and other costs. For our backers in Europe, please note that your Petzval lens will be shipped from a local hub. We also have logistics hubs in the following locations: Turkey, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. If your country is not listed here, we are afraid there may be some extra importation duties to pay on delivery.\nIf you have a specific question about shipping, please just write us a message!\nDownloads\nView some of the sample photos in full resolution below.

Our manufacturing partners at Zenit are incredibly skilled optics technicians, but this is a project which is different from anything we or they have done before. We have already made good progress in planning the new lens and have a first working prototype, however several issues could arise further along the product development path and we are ready to deal with these.\n\nWe are committed to making an object of quality with the new Petzval Portrait lens, and for this reason don\u2019t want to rush the manufacturing process.

With these influences in mind we\u2019re creating an epic, replayable turn-based tactics game where you train generations of heroes to repel a demonic invasion.\nAnd with Kickstarter, we can do it. We have a great concept and team ready to go, and we want to work closely with our community to control the future of MASSIVE CHALICE free from outside interference.\nMASSIVE CHALICE is a single player turn-based tactics game within a multi-generational strategy campaign built for replayability.\nAs an immortal King or Queen, you must unite your kingdom under a powerful dynasty, eliminate the demonic threat, and reforge the MASSIVE CHALICE!\nThe game is structured into two main layers: strategy and tactics. In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die. You'll have to choose between keeping your favorite heroes on the battlefield or retiring them from combat to foster a new generation of warriors.\nA Hero (early concept)\nDrawing from roguelikes we love, content is modular and randomized. Each playthrough begins with a random assortment of male and female heroes from various bloodlines, guaranteeing that each game is unique. Your knowledge and skill will increase over multiple playthroughs, but the details of every game will change based on your decisions and the whims of fate.\nStrategic map (early concept)\nCore Game Features\nYour story emerges as you defend against attacks, complete quests, and respond to randomized events in your attempt to preserve the kingdom.\nLine of sight and fog of war mechanics come into play as your squad explores beautiful dynamic 3D battlefields where danger may lurk behind any corner.\nDistinct, customizable heroes learn new melee, ranged, and arcane abilities as they age and gain combat experience.\nArrange marriage alliances to ensure your heroic bloodlines can handle any future combat situation.\nBattle alongside your ancestors by equipping your heroes with uniquely powerful Bloodline Relics.\nInvest your resources in forging new weapons and armor\u2014and gamble on polluting a bloodline by researching dangerous demonic artifacts.\n\nAnother Double Fine Kickstarter?\nLast year, you Kickstarted Double Fine Adventure, shattering records and bringing video games to the Kickstarter spotlight! Now known as Broken Age, that game is in full production and is already a beautiful and unique experience\u2014but the Broken Age team only represents a third of our multi-game studio.\nDouble Fine\u2019s goal is for all our teams to remain independent and responsible directly to their players. Kickstarting MASSIVE CHALICE allows us to maintain a pure creative vision, put out updates on our own schedule, respond to feedback without roadblocks, and release it all DRM-free.\nWhere are your stretch goals?\nThis Kickstarter is clean and simple. We\u2019re asking for the minimum amount to make an awesome game, and the game\u2019s scope will grow based on the amount of total backing we receive. There will be ongoing conversations with the community as new features are considered, so stay tuned and let us know what you'd like to see in the game!\nFor MASSIVE CHALICE we\u2019re getting back to basics and focusing on the project itself.

Brad is a turn-based strategy and roguelike fanatic, and is the friendliest guy you'll ever meet! :D!\nDouble Fine Productions is an award-winning, independent game development studio founded in 2000 by games industry veteran Tim Schafer. Located in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market district, Double Fine is committed to making high-quality games with an emphasis on originality, story, characters, and fun.\nThe MASSIVE CHALICE team comprises artists, designers, and engineers who recently worked on Double Fine projects like The Cave, Br\u00fctal Legend PC, Dropchord, Middle Manager of Justice, and various prototypes. The crew is ready to work on something big. Something MASSIVE.\nThe Buddha Engine\nMASSIVE CHALICE is being developed with Buddha, our versatile in-house 3D engine first created for Br\u00fctal Legend.

We believe we can find a substantial audience for this unique combination of strategy, squad tactics, and multi-generational gameplay.\n\nMASSIVE CHALICE is still in its earliest stages, so its backers will join us for every phase of development. We're tackling a new genre for Double Fine, but building on our years of experience making games of all types with our own technology.\n\nGames are complicated and expensive projects, but MASSIVE CHALICE has been scoped appropriately for our fundraising goal. By targeting open PC platforms and relying on a modular game design, we can create a core experience and build on it over time.

Plus a hard copy of Carbon Grey (volume 3) issue #1 & #2 and the PDF file of both issues. Also include the official soundtrack to Carbon Grey! Digital download only.\"\nWhat's the story about?\nSet against the backdrop of a great war Carbon Grey follows twin sisters Mathilde and Giselle Grey, members of a noble family dedicated to protecting the Kaiser of Mitteleuropa, as they struggle to reconcile duty with their own beliefs and ambitions. When the Kaiser is killed a vast conspiracy is uncovered, centered around a prophecy made long ago by Gottfaust, father to the Greys and hero of Mitteleuropa, that the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey \u2013 will one day spark a revolution.\n  Summary\nThe sisters of the Greys; descendants of Gottfaust \u2013 Godlike hero of the nation\u2019s Golden Era. For over three hundred years their family have protected and counseled the Kaiser, ruler of the Prussian Empire. The sisters are beautiful, wise and deadly; bred for purity and groomed to achieve perfection.\n\nThrough generations there have always been three \u2013 one for Strength, one for Grace and one for Wisdom.\n\n\nBut this is a different time.\n1913. At the beginning of the industrial age a great war is raging. As the myth of glory in battle is cut to ribbons on the frontline of Mitteleuropa twin sisters are born; Mathilde and Giselle. One of these two sisters is the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey, prophesied by Gottfaust to bring about a renaissance, and restore the nation to glory.\n\n  Both are flawed; imperfect in different ways. Giselle is disobedient, stubborn; but her faults are hidden. Mathilde does not share the physical perfection of her sisters, something she cannot hide. And an exposed flaw can be exploited.\n\n\nThis war is a diversion, orchestrated by the ruthless Queen, Raisa Vasilyeva. She conspires to manipulate Mathilde, twisting Gottfaust\u2019s prophecy to turn sister against sister, all to gain possession of the Stone, the source of Gottfaust\u2019s Godlike power.\n\n  When the Kaiser is murdered Giselle must run, traveling west across the scorched battlefields of Mitteleuropa on a mission to deliver a mysterious letter into the heart of enemy territory. Pursued by the sisters and hunted by the enemy Giselle must discover the prophecy\u2019s true meaning before the Cossack queen harnessed the power of the stone to rewrite history itself.\n\n  Carbon Grey has been a labor of love for my friends and I. We have been working on and off with this project for over a decade. It is a dedication born of passion, perseverance and hard work, and the belief that one day we'll complete this journey. Now that day is finally here.\nLast year we successfully launched and executed our first Kickstarter project to fund the second volume of Carbon Grey. We couldn't have done it without the support of the community.\nWe're now reaching out to the Kickstarter community again to help fund the final chapter.

Taking equal inspiration from hack \u2018n slash dungeon crawlers (procedurally generated dungeons, loot drops, etc) and Metroidvania-style platformers, the game aims to immerse you in its 2D fantasy world full of exciting treasure, deadly enemies, and abundant secrets. \nWe are attempting to create an authentic retro experience similar to the games you remember. Chasm was heavily influenced by games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Diablo. If these games are your style, then this is the game you have been waiting for!\nIn Chasm, players take up the role of a soldier passing through a remote mining town on their journey home from a long war. The town\u2019s miners have recently disappeared after breaching a long-forgotten temple far below the town, and reawakened an ancient slumbering evil. Now trapped in the town by supernatural forces, you\u2019re left with no option but to explore the mines below, battle enemies and bosses, and increase your abilities in hopes of finally escaping and returning home.\nThe mine entrance in Karthas.\n  Current and Planned Features \nExplore Metroid-like dungeons procedurally assembled from hand-crafted rooms in six diverse areas.\nEnjoy challenging retro gameplay and gorgeous authentic pixel art (320\u00d7180 native resolution) \nDiscover new special abilities and powers to reach previously inaccessible areas\nPlay how you want by equipping weapons, spellbooks, shields, and more to both hands\nUncover random loot drops and rare items\nBattle massive bosses & mini-bosses\nAvoid devious traps and platforming hazards\nIncludes Normal and Hardcore (Scored with Permadeath) Modes\nLeaderboards for Hardcore playthroughs featuring quickest time, least damage taken, and more\nWindows, Mac, & Linux versions with Gamepad support\nExploring the mines.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nSince James quit his job last year to focus on Discord Games, he has been relying on income from sales of Take Arms to keep the company running. He knew Chasm was a much bigger game than he could afford to make, but thought that if he could do it right, people would see the potential of the idea.\nWe met our initial goal of a playable demonstration, but funds for development are now depleted. Simply put, this game can not be made without your support.  We've been waiting forever for a game like this, but game publishers today just aren't interested in projects like this one. With your support, we will be able to finish the game ourselves and give you a truly amazing experience. Your generous pledges will go towards: \nLiving Costs: James and Tim still need to eat, pay bills, and afford life-giving coffee while they develop the game.\nPaying Artists and Sound Designer: We will need money to pay our wonderful team for their hard work.\nPolish and Improvement: Making sure Chasm is a quality, bug-free game with enough time dedicated to it.\nBusiness & Legal Costs: To officially sell the game, we need to keep up with administrative costs and other expenses related to the business.\nPromotion & Marketing: We will need to commission awesome final box art, promotional graphics, video trailers, etc.\nGetting the drop on some unsuspecting kobolds.\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $15 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless, we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux. See below for estimated system requirements. We're aiming to be content complete early 2014 and then release the game by May 2014. This is subject to change, and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging $30 or more ($25 for early birds!) will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain, but we will attempt to start it a couple months before the game is officially released to the public.The game will be highly playable at this phase (at least 90% content complete), but we will still be adding, removing and testing features. As a tester, you will have a direct effect on the game by playing and voicing your opinions and feedback on the private Developer forum. This also includes identifying any performance issues and bugs.\nChecking the map for directions.\nSystem Requirements \nThe requirements are subject to change. Chasm is being developed with older hardware in mind, and shouldn't be too demanding. However, due to how XNA's graphics system works, you will need at least a Pixel Shader 2.0+ capable graphics card. If you have any question of compatibility, please download the demo and try it out for yourself!\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7), MacOS X, or Linux\nProcessor: 2ghz+\nMemory: 512 MB\nGraphics: Pixel Shader Model 2.0+ \nFinding a hidden fountain.\n\nThe Team\n James Petruzzi - Producer - @DiscordGames\nJames is the founder of Discord Games, and serves as Producer, Game Designer and Programmer on Chasm.

It's not a retro-clone, but an entirely new game with a very familiar feel. \nThe Bestiary is the last of three core rule books for Adventures Dark and Deep\u2122 (the Players Manual and Game Masters Toolkit have already been successfully published). \nIt will be approximately 450 pages and will be lavishly adorned with interior b&w art and a full-color cover. It contains around 900 creatures to use in the game (including almost all those from the original three monster books, finally collected in a single volume, plus scores of new creatures), and can also be used with almost every other 1E-compatible game. \nAdventures Dark and Deep\u2122 is designed to be played as a stand-alone game, but can also be used as a source of inspiration and new ideas for your existing game. \nThe rules for Adventures Dark and Deep\u2122 are completely written and have undergone an extensive 18 month open playtest. Feedback from that playtest has been incorporated into the rules, ensuring that they are complete, workable, and above all, fun. \nThe proceeds from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to pay for the artwork and professional editing. This is how that's going to work:\nIf we make our initial modest goal, we'll be able to pay for a nice cover and editing for the book. We can then publish it as a (mostly) art-free book, which would still include all 900 monsters, but there would be almost no interior art.\nBut...\nFor every $25 we go over the initial goal, we will be able to illustrate an additional creature. If we make it all the way to $24,000 total, that means we'll have a brand-new piece of art for each and every one of the 900 monsters in the book!\nThe game is done. We just need to make it beautiful. \nWe are front-loading as much of the work as possible. The text is completely written and ready to be edited, the art is designed and ready to be assigned to the artists, and the layout is ready to accept the art. We're ready to roll as soon as the money comes in to start paying the artists and editor.\nSponsoring Art\nYou may notice that several of the support options allow you to sponsor specific pieces of art. If you wish, you can always add a sponsorship to any reward level by simply manually adding $25 to your pledge. If you want to sponsor more than one piece of art, that is more than welcome. You'll be able to pick specific pieces of art; details will be sent out to sponsors after the Kickstarter campaign. \nNotes on Shipping\nShipping within the United States is included with your pledge.\nWe cannot ship to Post Office Boxes. Please provide a street address when completing your backer survey. \nWe will ship to APO addresses, but there will be a slight delay with such shipments, since they have to be re-mailed. \nDue to the extraordinarily high price of shipping to Brazil, we ask backers in that country to please add an additional US$20 to your pledge to partially offset the cost. This is in addition to the surcharge all overseas backers are asked to pay.\nIf you order a reward that includes a hard copy book other than the Bestiary, all the books will be shipped together, when the Bestiary becomes available. PDF copies will be sent as they become available.\n_____ \n* Note that everything relating to this game was done purely based on public statements and publicly available works; nothing comes from access to any of Gary Gygax's private notes or any other special access, and this project is not associated with either his estate nor any of his living relatives.

The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale.

He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

The tool is absolutely amazing. Looking forward to having Torque 2D utilizing Spine!\" -Michael Perry, GarageGames\n\"Spine is great! Finally a huge void in our 2D content creation process is filled; something no other animation tool on the market could do for us.\" -Moritz Voss, HandyGames\n\"Spine is the 2D skeletal animation tool that game devs have been hoping for. It's well designed and well engineered.\" -Matt Rix, Unity Futile\nSpine is a 2D skeletal animation tool for game development and other animation projects. It features an intuitive workflow to rig and animate skeletons, a multiple-timeline dopesheet for retiming and tweaking animations, and powerful exporting capabilities.\nSpine currently has all the features necessary to use it in production, except for loading and using the data in your games. For each game toolkit, we need to write a runtime library that loads the animation data and draws the animations. Currently this is only done for libgdx, and this is where we need your help.\n\nWe set out to build games, but instead we\u2019ve been working full time on Spine for many months. We would love to add Spine runtimes for Unity, cocos2d, Corona, and others, but we also need to move on and build our own games. Funding this KickStarter will allow us to postpone our games a little longer to add support for additional toolkits and enable Spine to be used in all kinds of games. With your help, we can build the runtimes to match the same level of quality as the rest of Spine, and official runtimes will be kept up to date as Spine evolves.\nOur Kickstarter has been funded! This means we will implement Spine runtimes for these game toolkits:\nUnity: Futile and 2D Toolkit\ncocos2d-iphone\nCorona\nYou can download Spine and give it a try right now for Windows, Mac, and Linux. All of the most important features have already been implemented and hopefully this gives you confidence that we can deliver the runtimes we promise.\nWe hit our goal for the four runtimes in just 3.5 days! The gaming community's response to Spine has been really fantastic! We've already added support for Corona and are working on the other three toolkits promised in the original goal: Unity Futile, Unity 2DToolkit, and cocos2d-iphone. In the meantime, we have been thinking a lot about what to do for stretch goals.\n\nWe've received hundreds of requests to build Spine runtimes for all kinds of gaming toolkits. We would love to build official runtimes for everyone's favorite toolkit, but this would take an astronomical amount of effort. We have thought long and hard about what our stretch goals should be for Spine and finally decided we could do better than listing a bunch of game toolkits, each of which only a fraction of the gaming community cares about. We think we have come up with a way to make everyone happy.\n\nWe have stretch goals to implement generic Spine runtimes for specific programming languages. A generic runtime does everything except the game toolkit specific drawing. It loads the skeleton and animation data into an object model that makes it easily accessible, for example to pose the skeleton, do procedural manipulation, changes skins, etc. To support a game toolkit, all that needs to be done is add the game toolkit's rendering to the generic runtime. This allows the gaming community to easily make high quality runtimes for almost any game toolkit. The key part of this plan is that the core of the runtimes are officially supported and maintained as Spine evolves.\n\nWe have also added stretch goals for some really awesome features. When building Spine there were many things that couldn't make it into version 1.0. We choose from all those as well as features suggested by the Spine community. We are very weary about feature bloat, so we have been careful to choose the features that provide the most value when taking into account Spine's workflow. We also took into account how feasible the features are and we only chose those that we know we can implement in a timely manner. It is very important to us that we don't let you down!\n\nWe are extremely excited about Spine's future and really hope we can meet many of these stretch goals. Please help us bring Spine to the next level and make it the most amazing tool for game development!\nTouchpad support Spine was designed for use with a mouse. When using a touchpad, for example on a laptop, Spine can be difficult to use. This item adds a touchpad friendly input mode. We may not be able to support multi touch touchpads, but will be sure that the app is perfectly usable with a touchpad.\nAdditive blending for slots Enables the images attached to a slot to be drawn using additive blending, for toolkits that support it.\nAdjustable playback speed and framerate Enables slowing or speeding up playback so animations can be tweaked easier. Also allows the framerate used in the timeline to be changed.\nResizable dopesheet and tree Enables the dopesheet and tree to be resized by dragging. This allows a lot more to be seen on larger screens and is especially great for tweaking keys in the dopesheet.\nImport for exported skeletons and animations Allows data in the same format Spine exports to be imported back into Spine. This allows data to be brought into Spine from other programs. Also, data can be exported from one project and imported into another.\nA Spine runtime in the Lua programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for Gideros, L\u00d6VE, Moai, and others.\nA Spine runtime in the JavaScript programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for Construct 2, cocos2d-html5, Platino, ImpactJS, three.js, and others.\nA Spine runtime in the C++ programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for cocos2d-x, Kobold2D, KoboldTouch, SFML, and others.\nA Spine runtime in the ActionScript 3 programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for Flixel, Starling, and others.\nA Spine runtime in the C# programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for MonoGame, XNA, and others.\nOnion skinning draws a shadow of the frames before and after the current frame to give some idea of the previous and next motion of an object. This is very useful when refining animation movement by adding keys between major poses.\nKeyable draw order Allows draw order to be changed and keyed in animate mode. This allows a slot to move in front or behind other slots during an animation.\nDuplicate bone Makes a copy of a bone, any child bones, and any slots and images. This is useful when creating skeletons that have multiple similar bones or body parts.\nBone snapping When moving a bone, this snaps to the start and end of other bones. This makes it easy to build skeletons where the bones match up exactly.\nDisable rotation/scale inheritance This allows rotation or scale to not affect a child bone. For scale, this means additional keys are not needed to avoid a child being scaled. For rotation, this allows a child bone to not rotate with the parent, for example a rope hanging from the end of a crane.\nThese are boxes attached to bones, similar to how images are attached. The boxes represent where the skeleton can be hit. In your game you can easily test for hit detection.\nIntegrated texture packer Enables Spine to pack individual images on to larger images for more efficient use by your game toolkit.\nGraph presets Allows graph curves to be stored so they can easily be applied to other keys without needing to define the curve again.\nMultiple slot color modification Allows multiple slots to be selected and have their color changed all at once.\nMultiple drag and drop for slot draw order Allows multiple slots to be selected under Draw Order and dragged to a new position all at once.\nThis adds an \"Events\" node to the tree where named events can be defined. These events can then be keyed in animations. This allows events to be triggered in your games, for example to play a sound or spawn a projectile or particle effect at a specific time in an animation.\nSlot image chooser A popup for a bone that shows thumbnails for all images for each slot. Choosing a thumbnail sets a key to change the slot's image. Note changing a slot's image in an animation is already possible, this is just a faster way of doing it.\nAnimated textures This allows image with a common prefix to be treated as a single images. They are given a framerate and are displayed as an animation. This is much easier than keying each image change.\nBackgrounds This adds a \"Background\" node to the tree where images can be dragged. These show up behind the skeletons in the editor. This can give a better feel for how the skeletons will look in-game. It can also be used to animate skeletons for use on top of a specific image, for example to animate a skeleton climbing on top of objects in the background image.\nRipple animation Repeats a dopesheet channel for the rest of the animation. Without this, repeating an animation manually for a whole animation is very tedious.\nDopesheet overview This is a dopesheet item that represents all keys in the animation. This makes it easy to select, scale, etc all keys.\nDisable dopesheet channels This disables a dopesheet channel so it won't affect the animation. This is useful for disabling portions of an animation during tweaking.\nFree-form deformation allows an image to be manipulated by moving the four corners or points along the edges. The image will distort appropriately. This reduces image changes, meaning a lot less art is required. It allows for much more powerful animation beyond just animating bones.\nThere are many tools for working in 3D that can be used for 2D, though they tend to be very expensive. Custom plugins need to be written to have a sane workflow for 2D skeletal animation and to extract the data for use in your games. You must write your own runtime for your games to make use of this data. These tools tend to have an enormous feature set and you must be careful to avoid accidentally using features that aren't supported in your runtime. All this is a lot of work up front to get the custom plugins and runtime working, and the end result is a clunky workflow riddled with gotchas.\nThere are not many tools dedicated to 2D. We will mention a few here.\nAdobe's Flash is ubiquitous on the Internet and can be used similar to Spine. It is not dedicated to skeletal animation though, making the workflow somewhat tedious. Data is exported as XML, but there are no standard runtimes for game toolkits, you have to write your own.\nBrashMonkey's Spriter began development 15 months ago. We were initially thrilled when Spriter was funded on Kickstarter 9 months ago. We posted our feedback on the Spriter forums when we found it lacked official runtimes, a multiple-timeline dopesheet, tweening curves, and separate keying of scale, rotation, and translation. After a couple months we decided that Spriter may never have the features and workflow we envisioned, and that is when we decided to build Spine.\nSpine focuses on having an efficient workflow from start to finish. The best way to compare Spine with other software is to build a simple animation with each and put them in your game while noting how easily the tools allow you to tweak and refine your animations.\nSpine animation has many advantages over traditional raster animation:\nReduced art assets Characters can be animated in many ways without requiring additional art.\nSmall data size Spine animations are tiny, enabling hundreds of animations to be used throughout a game to bring it to life.\nFaster development Creating and making use of animations is easy, even programmers can do it.\nAnimation reuse All of the same animations can be reused for characters that look completely different if they use the same skeleton.\nProcedural manipulation Modify the skeleton or animations at runtime to react to game situations.\nSmooth interpolation Interpolated keyframes mean animation is as smooth as the framerate.\nAnimation blending Transition smoothly to a new animation by blending it with the old animation.\nSpine makes it fast and easy to bring your entire game to life!\nWe've been working on Spine full time for a long time. We are excited to have completed all the major features it needs to be used in production and we are looking forward to seeing what the gaming community can build with it. There are many features we wanted to implement but were unable to include in the first version of Spine. We have been careful to avoid feature bloat and keep the workflow in mind, but these features would be very useful. If this Kickstarter does extremely well, we would love to implement these!\nEvent timeline Allows timing arbitrary events during animations, eg to trigger sounds or particles.\nBounding boxes Rectangles attached to bones for easier hit detection.\nOnion skinning Shows the previous and next animation frames so it is easier to see motion over time when designing animations.\nProcedural animation helpers Utilities to make procedural animation easier, eg a bone that is always rotated toward a point with rotation constraints.\nBox2D integration Control physics entities from animations or animations from physics entities.\nImage attachment animation Animate an image's scale, rotation, and translation separately from the parent bone.\nFreeform deformation Animate an image using a lattice for deformation.\nInverse kinematics at runtime Allows for fewer keyframes and more flexible procedural animation.\nAnimation layers Have an animation extend another animation and add keys.\nAnimation mixer Similar to the dopesheet, but for blending and timing animations for cutscenes and larger animations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor each game toolkit, building a Spine runtime consists of implementing the loading of the data, the math for properly transforming the bones and images, posing the skeleton based on the animation data, loading and drawing the art assets, and providing a nice, easy to use API. Each of these tasks is done differently in the various game toolkits and programming languages, so we must carefully research how to best integrate the Spine runtime.\n\nBecause Spine makes it easy to animate everything in your game, it is expected that many animations will be used at once. This means it is important that the Spine runtimes perform well. Animations and bone transformations need to be efficient. Texture atlases need to be supported. Drawing the images should be fast, batching used if possible, etc. Performance testing needs to be done for each game toolkit to optimize the runtime. For toolkits that run on multiple platforms, this must be done on each platform.\n\nWe have a combined total of 23+ years of industry experience building software, gaming libraries and tools (eg, libgdx), and designing concise, clean APIs (eg, Kryo, KryoNet). We've spent an enormous amount of effort building Spine with great attention to detail and high standards for quality. We want to build the runtimes to match so that the entire Spine experience is seamless and pleasant from start to finish.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "New Spine Features", "update_content": "Hey everyone!

This can be useful when you have multiple items to equip which have a different bounding boxes. Also, a bounding box is translated, scaled, and rotated by the bone it is attached to.\nWe've been focusing on editor features, so currently some of the runtimes are missing bounding boxes, keyable draw order, and events.

Video Update #11 Kevin \"The Punisher\" Pun and concept art creation\nWant to learn more? Check out our other Updates!\nCheck out our LIVE streaming channel! \nNeed more information? Check out our FAQ\nPolymorph concepts!\nWildman delivers an action-role-playing experience that only a developer like Gas Powered Games can deliver. Think of it as a spiritual successor to our classic PC game Dungeon Siege, with a twist.\nThis is what Wildman is all about:\nExplore the World: Go on RPG Adventures in amazing and epic environments; discover secret dungeons; fight battles against rampaging hordes of monsters; find and equip new weapons and armor. \nEvolve or Die: Steal technology from your defeated opponents and use it against them in future battles. \nSmash and Destroy: Advanced physics and destructible environments deliver highly visceral (and bloody) combat.\nGo to War: Build your army and fight against opposing champions armies for great rewards in hand-crafted War Zones.\nImagine a game where you control a single hero\u2014the \u201cWildman\u201d\u2014dropped into the middle of a War Zone. The battle starts. Your own army begins to engage the approaching enemy. \nYou support your troops with your own combat abilities and skills. You shape-shift into new forms that grant you new abilities. You upgrade your armies with new technology. You construct defenses. Your opponent switches tactics; you reconfigure your army to counter.\nYou push the enemy back to their citadel, their home base. You face your opponent\u2019s champion. You each rally your troops for support. You execute your special abilities with precision. Your opponent is devastated. \nYou survey the battlefield: the bodies strewn on the ground, the trees burned down and smoldering, the buildings turned to rubble. You collect your rewards. You evolve. \nVictory is yours. For now.\nNow imagine that between these War Zone battles you can go on role-playing adventures. You can explore fantastical environments. You can discover ancient dungeons full of mystery and treasure. You can earn new skills. You can discover and equip new weapons and armor. You can collect materials. You can craft new items. You can fight relentless onslaughts of men and monsters. \nWildman has fast-paced combat and deep role-playing that rewards strategic thinking. The more you play, the greater your power. \nWildman will feature a score from the legendary Jeremy Soule, composer for Total Annihilation, Dungeon Siege, Supreme Commander, Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Dawn of War, and pretty much every other game with an epic score. \nWildman represents the union of our experience working on pure RPG and RTS games, and we\u2019re pulling some of the best features from our past games into the Wildman experience.\nFrom Dungeon Siege: The core action-RPG experience. Equip weapons and gear, cast spells. Fight monsters. Level-up. Find loot. \nFrom Supreme Commander: The core RTS experience. Create armies. Explore a tech tree that lets you customize your hero and armies. Adjust your strategy on-the-fly.\nFrom Demigod: You don\u2019t fight alone in Wildman. Waves of allies fight alongside you in the War Zones as you push the battle ahead, seize key control points, and destroy the enemy citadels.\nWildman is exciting because it\u2019s something new, but it\u2019s also reminiscent of these games we\u2019ve made and loved. We want to make this game, and we have the right people to do it.\n\nChris Taylor founded Gas Powered Games in 1998. We\u2019ve been an independent developer for our entire history.\n\u201cWait a second, you\u2019re no indie,\u201d you might say. \u201cAll of your games have been from publishers.\u201d\nThis is true. We\u2019ve chosen to partner with publishers in the past to get our games into your hands, but it\u2019s equally true that we\u2019ve maintained our independence working within the system. We\u2019ve made a number of original games, we\u2019ve worked on sequels, and we\u2019ve worked on other people\u2019s games. Members of the GPG family weren\u2019t just contributors to classic games like Total Annihilation, Dungeon Siege, and Supreme Commander: We were the lead designers, the lead engineers, and the lead artists.\nFor Wildman, we\u2019ve assembled a team that includes:\nProject Lead/Lead Designer: Chris Taylor got his start in the industry working for Distinctive Software as a programmer and designer on Hardball II. In 1991, he began to refine his interest in designs based on complex simulations and technology with the first 3D polygonal boxing game, 4D Boxing. After spending multiple years developing the first Triple Play baseball for Electronic Arts, he decided to join legendary industry figure Ron Gilbert at the fledgling startup Cavedog Entertainment to design and engineer the hugely influential and innovative real-time strategy game Total Annihilation (1997). Its combination of complex simulation, UI control, and deep strategy remains unmatched to this day.\nHe left Cavedog to found Gas Powered Games, where he immediately started work on the action-role-playing game Dungeon Siege (2002). It featured an enormous streaming world with no loadscreens\u2014an innovation that\u2019s now become standard for open-world games\u2014and supported multiple character parties. Next up was 2007\u2019s Supreme Commander, which was considered by many the spiritual sequel to Total Annihilation and introduced a replacement for the standard RTS mini-map in the form of \u201cstrategic zoom.\u201d Its 2010 sequel added a new technology tree that let players re-configure their armies during the heat of battle.\nDesign: In addition to Chris, some of the other designers working on Wildman include Brian Fricks, who got his start modding Dungeon Siege before joining us to work on all of our games since Dungeon Siege II. Eric Williamson has worked on systems design and tuning and balancing for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, Demigod, Supreme Commander 2, and Age of Empires Online. Steve Bauman was the editor-in-chief of Computer Games Magazine for over a decade before joining GPG in 2007 to contribute to the design of our most recent games.\nEngineering: The Wildman engineering effort is led by James Loe and Chad Queen. James got his start working with Chris at Cavedog on Total Annihilation before moving over to GPG to work on the Dungeon Siege team. Chad Queen has been his partner-in-code since the earliest days at GPG, and they\u2019ve worked on (and re-worked) engines and architectures for Dungeon Siege, Supreme Commander, and Age of Empires Online.\nArt: If you\u2019re a fan of Total Annihilation, you\u2019re probably familiar with the legendary Kbot. What you may not know is that it was named after one of our artists, Kevin Pun, who followed Chris to GPG and has since worked on the art for most of our games. Stu Rose spent 12 years working at a small, unknown upstart called Blizzard Entertainment, making art and stuff for equally small and unknown games like WarCraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and World of WarCraft. He also designed the Blizzard logo and was the voice of the peasant in WarCraft. For reals.\nWe\u2019re giving you a chance to be at ground zero of this game's development, to contribute to the next big thing from Chris Taylor and Gas Powered Games. We will give you frequent updates from programmers, artists, and designers. We will produce fun videos, chats, podcasts, blogs, and lots more. \nWe\u2019ve already started work on Wildman, but we need your help to finish it. We want to follow more closely the examples of companies like Valve and Blizzard, who iterate on as many ideas as possible before settling on the \"right\" features. \nWith that in mind, we have intentionally left some areas of the game\u2019s design wide open. This isn't to say we don't know what we want to do, or that we lack direction or focus. Instead, it's an indicator that we're hoping we get to make Wildman a bit more organically, with your feedback.\n\nThe beauty of Kickstarter specifically, and crowdfunding and crowdsourcing in general, is that we can tap into the creative power of our community to help us make the right choices. You\u2019re not just backing a project; you\u2019re becoming an active participant in its creation and have a chance to shape its direction. Your support is vital, and we're excited to explore this new way of making games with you. \nWildman is an all-new game that needs to be created from the ground up. We are creating a new world, a new RPG system, and it requires new art, characters, animation, and sound. We need to develop engines and servers.\nWe\u2019re looking for a little something\u2026 extra from you to make Wildman an even better experience. In other words, we want to add more\u2026 stuff for you. \nThe game\u2019s design is flexible enough that we will be able to add new features or contents if we reach certain funding stretch goals. Examples include:\nMore: A bigger, richer world filled with even more enemies, more player characters, more visual customization, more animation, more diverse landscapes, more music, and more multiplayer options. Basically, more.\nLanguages: We intend to support English at launch, but through a combination of your support and crowd-translating, we can add more languages: German, Spanish, Italian, French, Russian; if there\u2019s enough interest in playing the game in that language, we\u2019ll do what we can to get it translated.\nModding: We want to release \u201cfriendlier\u201d versions of the tools we use to make the game, with Wikis on their use. With additional support, we can get these in your hands faster, letting you get started making your own worlds and game modes that you can give away or sell from within the game. Get paid for your own hard work!\nWe've also joined the Kicking it Forward initiative, and will be pledging 5% of Wildman's profits to other projects in the Kickstarter community. Learn more at http://kickingitforward.org.\nWe're a company of experienced developers with years of experience working on projects like this. Everyone here is fully committed to delivering an awesome game. This is going to be a blast!\nWe know there\u2019s some risk for us to using Kickstarter at this stage of a game\u2019s development, but we also feel it\u2019s an ideal time to influence and change its direction based on your feedback. You get to help decide the final shape it takes.\nThank you for checking out this project, and feel free to tell us what you do and don\u2019t like about the concept or the Kickstarter.

But we\u2019re an experienced team, and we\u2019re using our own proven technology and tools. We\u2019re confident we can address these issues. \n\nMost of the costs of a computer game development project are in the salaries of the people working on it, so significant delays in its release could require an additional influx of capital. Without this additional money, the release date could be in jeopardy. Mitigating that risk, however, is our history of delivering projects on-budget and on-time.\n\nThe design challenge is to blend two familiar genres in a satisfying way, and do it in a very short amount of time. We will only release Wildman when it meets our quality bar, and we intend to release in within a year of this Kickstarter.

The developer, Calvin (Robot) spends almost every waking hour hacking out code and dreaming up new worlds, when not in front of the computer he's staring into space working in his head. His muse, Alix (Kitty) has been taking care of evil marketing and press releases, and other scary things Calvin doesn't like to think about... but lately she has been more active creating art assets for future games.\n\nOur previous work, Neverdaunt:8bit was an IGF finalist in 2011. Our studio and home is a treehouse, in the woods (in the summer) where we happily make videogames all day ...and play with kittens.\nWe are kickstarting the game to pay the composer, purchase Unity Pro, buy a new dev machine, and of course, more coffee.

Venture Capitalists only want to back mobile or social gaming start ups.\nWe say they're wrong. We say that there is a large audience of PC gamers that want sophisticated games built for their platform. And inside this audience, a significant group of people that have always loved space games, and if given a quality one again will be happy to play it.\nAsk not what your genre can do for you, but what you can do for your favorite genre.\nLet's put high-end PC gaming and Space Sims back on the map!\nStar Citizen brings the visceral action of piloting interstellar craft through combat and exploration to a new generation of gamers at a level of fidelity never before seen. At its core Star Citizen is a destination, not a one-off story. It's a complete universe where any number of adventures can take place, allowing players to decide their own game experience. Pick up jobs as a smuggler, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, or enlist as a pilot, protecting the borders from outside threats. Chris Roberts has always wanted to create one cohesive universe that encompasses everything that made Wing Commander and Privateer / Freelancer special. A huge sandbox with a complex and deep lore allowing players to explore or play in whatever capacity they wish. That universe is Star Citizen.\nThe Reasons You'll Want to Play Star Citizen\n A huge universe to explore, trade and adventure in\nSpace is unending, endless and so are your opportunities. Strike out to make your fortune amongst the Stars or sign-up for a tour of duty in the UEE Fleet.\nConstantly expanding and evolving universe\nWe\u2019re committed to making Star Citizen a living, breathing universe that is its own entity. It will be a constantly shifting and evolving place for players to explore and affect.\nMicro updates rule!\nWe\u2019re not interested in having yearly updates. Once live, we will have a team of people adding content on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. So we\u2019ll always be adding data, stories and campaigns as well as reacting to the needs and actions of the players.\nSquadron 42 - A Wing Commander style single player mode, playable OFFLINE if you want\nPlayable offline or online, co-op with friends, you sign up for a tour of duty with the UEE fleet, manning the front lines, protecting settlements from Vanduul warbands.\nLife during wartime\nIf you distinguish yourself in combat, you might be invited to join the legendary 42nd Squadron. Much like the French Foreign Legion of old, they can always be found in the toughest areas of operation and always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, regardless of the odds.\nThe conflict never ends\nUpon completion of your tour you\u2019ll re-enter the persistent Star Citizen universe with some credits in your pocket and Citizenship to help you make your way.  But in the universe of Star Citizen when one conflict ends, another is just around the corner.  You\u2019ll have opportunity to spend more time with your squadron mates as additional Campaigns are released as part of the content update plan.\nActions of the players impact the universe and become part of its history and lore\nThe universe will change based on the players' actions and adventures allowing them to become part of the history of the universe. As an example, players can scan for gravitational anomalies while out in space. If one is discovered and the player manages to successfully navigate this uncharted jump point, they\u2019ll be able to sell their Nav- Computers recording of their jump flight path for a great profit to a space company for other users to download. But the real prize is getting the system or jump-point named after them!\nAllowing user generated content is a key design goal\nOur modding tools will allow players to design new ships for both submission to the persistent RSI ship dealer network or to build custom ships and items for the self-hosted multiplayer mode.\nIt\u2019s about the gameplay and your interactions with others\nWe plan to put a lot of social ideas in the universe. Since the universe is dynamic, it will create some divisions and factions. For example, it\u2019s a perfectly valid choice not to be a Citizen and operate outside the protection of Earth. We think there will be people that gravitate to crime or helping enforce the law or defending the galaxy from the alien raiders or just accumulating as much money as possible. We want to include all these social divisions so players will gravitate to one or the other much like the real world operates. \nFully dynamic economy driven by player actions\nIf too many people fly iron ore to the smelting plants of New Pittsburgh, steel prices will drop. Buy low\u2026 sell high\u2026 you hope.\nThe cost of society\nIn game trade landing and trade tariffs pay for law and order in the civilized systems. Want to make a bigger profit? Try the outer world - outside earth\u2019s infrastructure and protection. The downside? No military or local police to protect you from an opportunistic pirate!\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYou could be a trader, a miner or an industrial magnate. Amass great wealth or just run enough missions to earn a comfortable living and upgrades for your ship.\nSpace is empty but you\u2019re never really alone\nIf caught alone in an online ambush, send a distress broadcast to your friends and if they\u2019re nearby they can jump in-system to save your bacon. In each combat instance player slots are reserved for your friends so you can rally forces to join you in combat!\nBigger ships offer bigger multi-player action\nOn larger ships, friends can join you to man turrets, repair systems, or switch with you on the pilot\u2019s chair. Think the Millennium Falcon with Han-Solo piloting and Luke on the turret.\nFull rigid body simulation of all spaceships\nYou wanted proper Newtonian mechanics. You got it! Spaceships adjust their trajectory and orientation just like the real thing.\nIntelligent Flight Control System (IFCS)\nLike a modern day F-35, the ships have fly by wire systems which take the player\u2019s inputs and then translate them into the commands for the ship\u2019s engine and thrusters to articulate and deliver the required thrust to achieve the pilot\u2019s request.\nDynamic Ship Maneuverability\nShip\u2019s performance is calculated dynamically based on various physical variables and the ability of your jet maneuvering to deliver thrust towards a requested vector. What does this mean? Infinite customization with component damage, mass or energy changes affecting maneuverability on the fly \u2013 allowing for endless combat strategies and results.\nShip Components matter!\nBecause we are fully simulating the physics and flight dynamics, the actual components matter. If a port thruster is damaged, it will affect your maneuverability organically.  If you upgrade your thruster package with enhanced thrusters that gimbal faster and deliver more thrust it will affect your performance. Dump cargo, you may be able to get the edge in turning in a dogfight.\n10X the detail of current AAA games\nMost current gen \u201cAAA\u201d games have around 10,000 polygons for a character and 30,000 or so for a vehicle. In Star Citizen, the characters are detailed at 100,000 polygons, the fighter at 300,000 and the Space Carrier 7 million! This allows unparalleled detail, making the visuals more immersive than has ever been achieved before.\nEverything you would imagine would move or articulate on a spaceship or a device \u2013 does!\nEvery spaceship is built from 100s of sub-components, many of them moving and articulating just like they would in the \u201creal\u201d world. If a component gets damaged during combat be prepared to feel the effects on your ship.\nRange of scale never seen before in a game\nFrom a vast 1km long carrier to a 27m fighter, to your 1.8m tall pilot, Everything is rendered and to the same level of detail. Zoom in to the paneling of the carrier and its texel density is the same as the 27m fighter. All without a load screen or loss of visual fidelity.\nReally feel the scale of ships and space battles\nBecause of the ability of the game to scale seamlessly you could be looking out the windows on the bridge of a carrier watching the battle unfold or jump into a cockpit and take the fight to the enemy.\nJoystick, gamepad, mouse, keyboard are all supported.\nWe\u2019ve all got our preferences, so why be forced to choose?\nAdvanced peripheral support\nAs part of commitment to high end gaming we are dedicated to supporting the more exotic enthusiast peripherals; HOTAS, flight chair, rudder pedals. It\u2019s all about the immersion and if you've got the equipment we want to support it!\nVirtual Reality is here!\nWe have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?\nNext generation, TODAY\nBuilt on top of Crytek\u2019s award winning CryEngine3 technology, Star Citizen\u2019s engine is built to scale for the PC\u2019s of today and tomorrow.\nA PC gaming enthusiast\u2019s friend!\nAs you upgrade your PC, Star Citizen will take advantage of your extra processor cores, memory or GPUs. This is why you\u2019re a PC gamer \u2013 you love being on the cutting edge, not stuck in the past!\nToday\u2019s game publishers, like their Hollywood counterparts, want predictable returns from sequels to last year\u2019s hits. A game in an out- of-favor genre, set in an original universe is viewed as a bad investment. And the concept of developing a new product exclusively for the PC sends publishing executives and most Venture Capitalists running for the exits.\nAnd that hero is you, the unappreciated PC gamer. The ignored Space Sim fan.\nThis is your chance to have your voice heard. To tell the world that high end PC gaming lives. That you want to sit in the cockpit of your space fighter defending the galaxy or making your fortune as a wily entrepreneur.\nStar Citizen is meant to be everything you ever dreamed you could have in a Space-Sim, all in one glorious ever-evolving package.\nWe know it may not look like this, but we do!\nWhat you've seen was put together by a very small team over the past year. We felt that this vision needed to be shown rather than talked about so we invested our own money to build the technical and visual prototype that shows just how Star Citizen is going to push the limits of PC games.\nInstead of taking this prototype to a publisher for a green light, we are cutting out the middleman and taking it to you.\nYou as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.\nWe have investors that have agreed to contribute the balance we need to complete this game as long as we can validate that there is a demand for a high end PC space game. By meeting or surpassing our target on Kickstarter you tell the world that you want a PC based Space Sim and allow us to make this game.\nBut we're offering more than just the chance to support the platform and genre.\nAs an early backer, you\u2019ll also be getting a lot more than just the finished game.\nFor the people who pledge for their spaceship in the Star Citizen universe, you\u2019ll be part of a select club that has exclusive access to early gameplay and behind the scenes development updates.\nThe people who pledge for their spaceships will get to test-fly them long before the general public. 12 months in, we will allow the early backers to play the multiplayer space combat Alpha, and then 20-22 months in they will get to play the Star Citizen Beta, adventuring around the huge open galaxy, well before the general public. We are going to limit our alpha slots to 200,000 as we want to stress test the game with real users, but will not be ready for the full load until we have finished Beta.\nIn addition, part of the money we are asking for is budgeted to maintain the Roberts Space Industries site with constant updates. Our goal is for the game\u2019s website to be live from day one, constantly giving information about what\u2019s happening in the galaxy even before the game is live, sharing interesting insights into the development process and canvassing the early backers for their opinions. Roberts Space Industries should be the first stop into the Star Citizen universe. When we say we want to involve the community, we really mean it!\nFinally we are offering the pledge slots a discount to what the final digital price will be. Like Guild Wars 2, the basic game will be $60, but for the very early backers we are offering the entry tier at $30. But hurry! Slots are limited!\nOur hope is that these benefits are compelling enough for you to pledge for your spaceship today.\nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion. An amazing Interstellar adventure waits!\nCan't use Kickstarter?

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images. They can be found at higher resolution here:\n http://www.frontier.co.uk/elitedownloads/wallpapers/\n*All names must not be offensive, trademarks, or in any way problematic for us to include in the game, and must follow our naming guidelines.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStating the obvious, all projects, whether building a bridge, making a film, studying for an exam or whatever, carry risk. Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

You'll take to the cockpit of a powerful transforming craft known as the Strike Suit, where - at the tap of a button - your craft will transform from a traditional fighter, to a hulking suit of space armour. \nStrike Suit Zero will remind you of the heyday of 90's space combat, whilst simultaneously introducing exciting new mechanics to make it relevant for today\u2019s audience. To ensure that the game brings space combat back with a bang, we\u2019ve brought in the best names in mecha and sci-fi to really put a stamp on the genre. \nThis is space combat reborn. \nIf you're a fan of mecha, you'll be excited to learn that ship and craft designs come courtesy of Junji Okubo, who has previously lent his talents to Steel Battalion, Infinite Space, Appleseed: Ex Machina and Viper\u2019s Creed. Working closely with the Born Ready team, Junji \u2013 who normally favours a western design philosophy \u2013 has brought some more traditional eastern traits to the Strike Suit designs.\nAs a special reward for Kickstarter backers, we're offering two backers the chance to have their ideas for a mech or space-craft turned into a real design by Junji himself. See below for more on this exclusive opportunity! \nYou can see Junji talking about his work on Strike Suit Zero in the developer diary below: \nIn addition to this, Paul Ruskay, who has composed the award-winning  Homeworld soundtrack, has furnished the game with an original score. With its otherworldly tones and fusion of styles, Paul has created something perfect for Strike Suit Zero. \nThe main Strike Suit theme is a collaboration between Paul and Kokia \u2013 a Japanese singer/songwriter well known for her work with anime and videogames. Kokia has leant her vocal talents to numerous anime and games, including: Tales of Innocence, Origin: Spirits of the Past and Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino. \n--\nThere's a fusion of cultures at the heart of Strike Suit Zero; a strong notion of East meets West. From the soundtrack, to the mechs, to the way the gameplay itself unfolds. Strike Suit Zero is a combination of sounds, designs and mechanics that have been brought together with the precise aim of making the best space combat experience possible.  \nIn the year 2299, an interstellar war rages. Earth's dwindling forces  - the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E) - repel a fearless enemy, fighting to protect a planet on the brink of destruction. You begin the game behind the front lines on a low-priority post defending a station near Earth. After repelling an attack, word comes through from Earth's command that the enemy are intending to end the war with one decisive strike. \n\nThey've amassed a colossal fleet, and are bringing it to Earth. \nYou're sent into deep space to join Earth's forces as they attempt to intercept the fleet.... \nFast, frantic space combat: you can freely engage multiple enemies, dogfight other pilots, fight massive fleet battles and defend vast structures.\nThe Strike Suit: strategically switch from Pursuit Mode (speed and power) to Strike Mode (a powerful, highly maneuverable combat mode) \nMultiple endings: your choices in game - for example, the secondary objectives you choose to complete  - directly affect the state of Earth at the end of the game. With multiple endings, preventing Earth\u2019s destruction is your immediate concern but preserving its future is your ultimate goal.\nCapital Ship Destruction: take capital ships apart piece by piece \u2013 take out their turrets or target weak-points to blow out entire sections of their superstructure.  \n Vibrant and vivid universe: space is far from the dark, featureless void you'd expect. Discover the colour and vibrancy of the Strike Suit universe across 13 unique locations. \nShip Designs from renowned Mechanical Design engineer Junji Okubo (Appleseed: Ex Machina, Steel Battalion.)\nMusic from award-winning sound designer Paul Ruskay (Homeworld) including a collaboration with Japanese singer/songwriter Kokia (Tales of Innocence, Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino)\n\"Born Ready Games have put a lot of effort into building battles that don\u2019t entirely revolve around you. \u201cWe have almost a full combat simulation happening while you\u2019re doing your objectives,\u201d he says.\" -- PC GAMER\n\"...this transmogrifying technobeast took on vessels that made Battlestar Galactica look like Sputnik.\" -- ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN\n \"Strike Suit Zero has plenty to satisfy your space-mech cravings.\" GAMESRADAR\n\"...Then everyone sort of stopped making space games, and a lot of people were forced to pack away their dreams of being interstellar combat pilots.

Should we reach this target, your pledge (given it's $15 or more) will get you the game - on your platform of choice - shortly after the main release of the game.\nWe are Born Ready, a game studio based in Guildford, UK. We\u2019re a 25-strong team with a deeply rooted passion for not just the space combat genre \u2013 but the industry as a whole. We\u2019ve been hard at work on Strike Suit Zero for two years, and can\u2019t wait to get it into your hands. \nThe team has years of cumulative experience in the industry, having worked on the likes of Call of Duty Finest Hour, Warhammer: Firewarrior, Batallion Wars, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Dungeon & Dragons Tactics and Geometry Wars Galaxies, amongst others.   \nTo all our backers: a hearty \u2018thank you\u2019 from everybody at Born Ready. With your help, we\u2019re able to take Strike Suit Zero to next level; we\u2019re able to incorporate player feedback from PAX and gamescom, and let our beta players shape the final months of development. We\u2019re convinced that the game can be something special, and you\u2019re giving us the opportunity to prove it. Again, thank you. \n--", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge facing Strike Suit Zero is ensuring we have the time to match the scope of our initial ambitions for the game.

Piloting a mining craft around a unique series of asteroids, you will be establishing mining operations while defending yourself from incoming enemies who loot and destroy.\nThe key features in this game are a destructible spherical play surface, direct control of the environment and extensive use of physics to make the experience more organic and non-formulaic.

Refreshing too, what with it not being a nostalgia-driven \u201cdon\u2019t make \u2018em like this anymore\u201d sort of affair\u2026\"\nIndieGameMag - \u2018Blackspace\u2019 the Space Mining RTS game Lands on Kickstarter\n\"...it\u2019s not every day that I drool over a Kickstarter project...but holy crap does Blackspace looks good... If what you saw there isn\u2019t making you practically vibrate with excitement then you obviously have no soul.\"\nDestructible everything. Pretty much anything can be destroyed and harvested. The entire ground can be demolished down to the super dense core. Old wreckage, derelict mining bases, even your own demolished structures break apart and can be reclaimed.\nDiscovery. We're adding the element of discovery to an RTS, not just through fog of war, but with the terrain itself. The terrain is a blanket covering resources, and technology. It becomes truely exciting to see that blip on your depth sensor indicating something beneath the surface. Anticipation of the dig, wondering what type of resource and the value it will have, and finally uncovering and extracting it. We want the resource discovery aspect to become a very gratifying and entertaining experience.\nGeological strategy. A base can be built anywhere the ground is level enough, but dirt is weaker than rock. The type and amount of resistance you are likely to face may change your decision to build right next to that element deposit in favor of building on more stable surfaces, then relying on your ability to defend resource transportation to your base. Additionally,  there will be strategy in enemy routing. Ground traversing enemies will try to find the easiest path to their destination. A few well placed explosives could change their route significantly.\nPhysics. Use physics to crush your enemies, smash them into one another or into the ground...or...if you're feeling primitive, drop a big rock on them. You can even test your trajectory skills and try to send them into orbit. The physics of the world are not only fun, they add a new dimension to whats possible in an action RTS.\nCustomize. Your ship is customized to your play style. It has many different loadouts and upgrades that can be equipped, swapped, or expanded. These tools and attachments are the way you interact with the world. Far beyond a simple mouse click, you can sculpt the terrain, dig for elements, collect scrap, hoist wreckage, repair buildings and much more. The capabilities of your \"Lander\" are designed by you. If you like hanging back and letting your turrets do the talking, spend money on your regeneration systems or upgrade the scanner array. If your'e feeling a bit more vindictive, you can equip your mining tools with weapons-grade explosives and beef up your armor. Its up to you.\nCommand.  It's not just towers, while you're not babysitting hordes of units constantly like in many RTS games, you do build and command units, albeit a bit more passively. Your units will be constructed and deployed for many different tasks. There will be units that gather resources, repair and that even defend your base locally.  Units in Blackspace will be intelligent and perform their tasks without much need for player contribution other than an order here or there when their duties are to be changed, though you'll need to setup defenses around their work sites if you expect any to survive.  The interface will be quick and straight forward (no box selecting units).\nNowhere to hide. This \"map\" has no corners. Enemies could potentially come from any direction. But, with some early scouting, and intelligence gathering, you will be able to predict the general direction of the front line so you can dig in and deploy before the enemy strikes.\nStructure alchemy? That's right, you can combine structures into grids, the arrangement and combination of structures will offer special enhancements to the operations within that grid.\nThere's also a ton of stuff that will be familiar to the RTS fan. Base layout, build queuing, and resource management are big parts of the game.\nYou start as an independent mining contractor working for a gigantic mining company, and end up in the middle of a simmering conflict between a major world government and Collier Industries, the mining giant. There is a territorial depute between the two entities with no chance of outside mediation at this distance from Earth. \nCollier Industries pioneered deep space travel and laid claim to an asteroid cluster of particular interest. It is believed to be the shattered remnants of a collapsed star. These fragments have gravitational magnitudes rivalling that of Earth at only 1/100,000 the diameter. Therefore, it contains very uncommon elemental compounds, in quantities far exceeding any source ever discovered.\n\nMining these fragments is dangerous work. Collier compensates proportionately, but he is not generous nor does he get involved directly in the conflict. He provides support in the way of prompt order fulfilment, research facility access, and strong supply lines. \nIt is rumored that he is building something with these rare elements you're gathering for him, but no one knows what it is. This also may have something to do with the growing resistance to Collier\u2019s operations on these asteroids.\nPixelFoundry currently consists of three people. Two developers and a producer. Not surprisingly, we want to change that. A game like this needs large quantities of quality content (ships, upgrades, environments, music, etc). A large hurdle is already cleared; we have created the code and systems to use the content. Now what we need is more content and to hire a few of the right people to help make it.   \nBefore creating PixelFoundry we both worked at EA Sports Tiburon and have extensive experience in shipping AAA video games. We know what it takes to make a quality game, and plan to apply that knowledge on this and future games. With your contribution we will be able to bring on more awesome talent to help us make this game as good as it can be.\nWe're small, but we try to do big studio things. We're excited to announce that we recently began a partnership with NVIDIA. We are very gratified to see a company the size of NVIDIA take notice and support an independent studio like ours. They have been extremely helpful so far and will be working with us to make sure our game works flawlessly across their entire line of supported gaming video cards. Additionally, for those who have the hardware, you will be able to play Blackspace in full stereoscopic 3D with NVIDIA's 3D Vision technology. \n(Don't worry AMD owners we've got you covered too, including CrossFireX)\nYeah, turns out video games are really expensive to make. It seems everyone expects to be paid to do work. We were stunned. We've been spending enormous amounts of our money for the same privilege. If you're a Kickstarter / video game regular, you may have heard this speech before.  \nWe think this game can meet and exceed the standards of games with much larger budgets because of our innovative designs, workflows, techniques and negligible overhead not to mention our dedication.  \nLoads of them...\nThe obvious one is, simply, more stuff. More turrets, upgrades, buildings, elements, missions, locations, etc. But, we also have some big multiplayer plans, micro manager mode, interconnected global player economy, among other things. \nWe'll be laying out the details as the campaign moves forward and we want your take on them as well.  But it seems a bit presumptuous at this point to start talking about stretch goals.\nThis isn't just an idea or a concept. We're not making up exciting features that we think we'll be able to implement. This is a project well on its way to completion, and we're really excited about the prospect of being able to bring it to you.  \nWe have been working on Blackspace full time for ~9 months. In that time, we have been focused on getting the game's core systems, features, and mechanics up and running. We recognize the importance of working these systems out first. The earlier the game is playable, the more time we have to tune and get it balanced properly.  \nAbout 3 - 4 months ago we came to a fork in our game dev path. Since we started this project, the game has changed, and new possibilities have opened up from a design perspective. We had to choose between following the game design where it would lead, or to cut it short and finish a smaller game.  \nWe felt so strongly about the new designs and direction, that we decided to expand Blackspace to what it should be instead of what was convenient for us. We think it is the right decision, and hopefully everyone can benefit from it.\nThe initial release of Blackspace is targeted for the PC. Our code base is flexible and could be branched to Mac, Linux, as well as consoles.But due to the expense of porting a game like this, this will likely happen if and after the PC release is a success.\nOn a related note, keyboard and mouse are the only controllers you need.  The game plays, in many ways, like an FPS so no need to dust off that joystick.  Now if your joystick is not dusty and is impatiently waiting for something cool to do, look no further, the extra finesse you get from a good joystick will add to the experience.  From menus to in-game controls, this game is made to be played how ever you want to play it.  This includes you gamepad folks as well.\nYeah the Oculus Rift. It's an innovative new VR headset and a recently successful Kickstarter. We are VR nerds and really want to support this. The good news is that we already have Stereo 3D functioning in our game so we're not expecting much work to get the Rift supported as well. \nWe are putting together a compilation of mini-games to test out physics as well as flight control. We are using it to tune certain areas of game play and we thought it would be cool to offer it as a fully functioning standalone mini-game package.\nBasically it will be a set of little challenges for you to accomplish. The games will be things like: who can stack a pile of junk the highest, how fast can you race through an asteroid canyon below a certain altitude without killing yourself, and maybe even some stuff to make your CPU sweat like how many crates can you blow to bits and maintain a certain frame rate.  \nYou'll be able to compete against your friends in our online leader boards. Its just some fun stuff to do with flight and physics in the Blackspace universe, and a way to compete with your friends. Also, getting good at these will put you way ahead of the tutorials when the full game comes out.\nHow many challenges will there be? Were not really sure yet. We have about 20 we think would be cool but, it really will be determined by what we  need in order to test certain functionality for the main game which is, after all, why were making these challenges in the first place.\nPixelFoundry is a small non-centralized studio, which basically means we currently work from our homes.\nWorking together for the past 7 years, Jerry Phaneuf and Volga Aksoy have contributed to award-winning AAA games, including EA Sports MMA, Madden NFL Franchises, NASCAR Franchises, Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchises, and more.

On our end we view this cost as unprecedentedly low for a game such as this, while some view it as unreasonably high.

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults. Continue to spread the word about Project Eternity, and let's see how big we can make The Endless Paths!\nWe're also pleased to announce we're supporting the Kicking It Forward initiative.\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

Accomplish various missions to unfold the story and gather materials dropped by defeated enemies to craft your weapon of choice. Any part of your weapon is customizable, each one altering the effect of your attack. Create an arsenal of weapons either to match your own play style or to match the challenge of a specific mission.\nMercenary Kings will have a strong focus on cooperative play. The initial version of the game will feature local 4 player cooperative play and will be available for PC. However, we are planning on supporting more platforms and online play if resources allow it.\nYou play as King, the most skilled mercenary on Earth, and you are sent to an island located in the Central American Pacific Coast to smash a ruthless criminal organization that assassinated your former team members. Your mission might be to save the Earth, but your own motives are to uncover the truth behind their intricate conspiracy and to get revenge for your fallen comrades.\nYou'll need skills, a sharp eye and lightning-quick reflexes. However, you won't stand a chance if you charge blindly. You'll need to be methodical and well prepared. That\u2019s why your backup is the world\u2019s best experts, ready and at your disposal to help you gear up for any mission. The Gunsmith can craft firearms of choice and upgrade your body armor, the Knife Expert can build deadly custom knives, and the Shopkeeper provides you with all the supplies you\u2019ll need.\nMercenary Kings features the art style of Paul Robertson, so be ready for spectacular animations and over the top characters!\nThe idea of Mercenary Kings was born back in 2010, as we were wrapping up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game. We had seen the potential and we were eager to make more awesome 2D games together. It took some time, but the planets finally aligned, and we gathered once again!\nMercenary Kings is currently in a prototype stage, meaning that most basic features have been implemented and are being tested, but it also means that most of its content still needs to be produced. The game will still change and evolve as it takes shape, but the core game mechanics are already well established.\nBackers will have access to a variety of rewards ranging from digital goods, to having an actual influence on the finished game. Higher tier rewards also include premium items such as a set of art prints, a t-shirt, a physical copy of the game, and a limited edition hoodie designed by Bryan Lee O'Malley! Their designs will be revealed in upcoming updates, so stay tuned!\nEarly Hoodie design - Subject to change.\nEarly T-shirt design - Subject to change.\nOur previous game, Wizorb was a success for a new independent game company like us, but it was a relatively small production and even though the revenues earned from it are good enough to allow us to fund another small production, they would not suffice to fund a more ambitious project.\nThis time, with Mercenary Kings, we want to bring our craft to the next level and develop a game to the full extent of our ability. In order to achieve that, we need a budget that will allow us more resources and a slightly longer production cycle. A solution could be to obtain funding from a publisher, but these kind of deals are hard to find and can be restrictive on the creative side. This is why Kickstarter seems like the ideal option for us. It would allow us to fully realize our vision while being able to get feedback from people who support us.\nIf we make it to the $75k milestone, we'll be able to make a version of the game that focuses on the features that are essential to make Mercenary Kings great. But ideally, to bring Mercenary Kings to its full potential, we would need $200k (which is still a modest budget for a video game production). So, listed below are all the features we're planning on developing depending on how much support we get.\n30 to 40 missions taking place on a paradise island under siege.\n4-player local coop mode\n20 to 30 primary weapon sets (guns)\n5 to 10 secondary weapons (knives)\nVarious materials to build parts\nBasic shop items (rations, first-aid, grenades, and more)\nMain NPCs (Colonel, Gunsmith, Knife Expert, Shopkeeper, Helicopter Pilot)\n15 enemies\n4 mind-blowing bosses\n4 color palettes for the main character\nAchievements\n20 to 30 additional missions (total of 50-70)\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\nAdditional materials to build parts\nNew shop items (such as a riot shield, mines, rocket launcher, and more)\nAdditional NPCs (a Fashion Designer and a Cook)\nAbout 10 more enemies (total of 25)\n3 additional bosses (total of 7)\n4 additional color palettes for the main character (total of 8)\nMore Achievements\nThe full plot is unveiled!\n20 to 30 additional missions (total of 70-100)\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\nAdditional materials to build parts\n1 additional NPC (Spy)\nAbout 5 additional enemies (total of 30)\n3 additional bosses (total of 10)\n2 additional color palettes for the main character (total of 10)\nTransceiver item and the ability to call for support (Colonel or Helicopter Pilot)\n4-player online coop mode!\nMore Achievements\nLeaderboards\nConsole version\n15-20 extra missions\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\n1 additional boss (total of 11)\nMore character customization\nOn top of that, no matter how much money we raise, we plan on continuing work on Mercenary Kings even after its release in order to add more features from our wishlist. So, for example, if we reach our $75k milestone, we'll release a version of the game as described above but we'll use the money earned from the sales to work on updates that will add features of the subsequent milestones.\nPaul Robertson \u2013 Animator \u2013 The mastermind behind Pirate Baby's Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006, Kings of Power 4 Billion Percent, and art director on Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game.

I love cooking for others and sharing my culinary insights and experiences gathered from homes, kitchens, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, bustling markets, and busy street food carts around the world.\nWhat The Lotus and the Artichoke cookbook is:\n200+ pages of amazing recipes, photographs, tips and secrets\n100+ vegan recipes inspired by world travel and over 20 years of dedicated kitchen experiences and adventures\n50+ full color photos of key recipes\nCool, custom artwork: Hand-carved blockprints & miniature paintings\nEasy to follow layouts, description, and details on how to prepare delicious and stunningly beautiful meals\nPerfect for your kitchen and complementary to any cookbook collection\nGreat as a gift to friends, family, colleagues, travel pals, partners\nJust some of the recipes:\nVeg Manchurian (Indo-Chinese)\nChili Paneer-Tofu (Indo-Chinese)\nEggplant Basil Coconut Curry (Thailand)\nMoroccan Stuffed Squash (Morocco)\nMasala Dosa and Sambar (South India)\nVeg Biryani (South India)\nMalai Kofta Curry (North India)\nGobi Tikka - Cauliflower (North India)\nPersian Eggplant (Iran/Germany)\nOrange Tempeh Teriyaki (Hawaii/Japan)\nMushroom-Tofu Stroganoff (Germany/Russia)\nKn\u00f6del & Rotkohl (Germany)\nBroccoli Quiche (France/USA)\nSpaghetti and Notmeatballs (Italy/USA)\nSmokey Zucchini Lasagna (Italy/USA)\nCashew Mushroom Risotto (Italy/Germany)\nSeared Pears & Walnuts on Arugula (French/Canadian)\nGinger Lemon Chickpea Sprouts (India/USA)\nBlack Bean Burgers (USA)\n3-Bean Cajun Chili (USA)\nAfrican-Asian Red Curry (Kenya/Thailand)\nMango and Pear Crumble (Germany/USA)\nParadise Pineapple Pancakes (Thailand)\nand over 75 more recipe adventures!\nThis cookbook is for you:\nHowever you choose to define your diet and lifestyle, there's something special for everyone who is turned on by delicious, gorgeous, compassionate, creative international cooking and nutrition.\nPerhaps you are already an experienced expert with vegan and plant-based food, maybe you're an aspiring vegan or mostly-vegetarian, a veg-loving omni, or getting into Meatless Mondays with your partner, family, or friends.\nMaybe you aren't concerned with labels \u2013 you just love amazing food and you dream of distant lands. The Lotus and the Artichoke isn't set on perfectionism, purity, or politics. It's about possibilities: This is a tribute to world flavor, an inspiration to spice up your life, and an open-minded invitation to join me on culinary adventures through world cuisines from around the world.\nWhat people are saying:\n\"The Lotus and the Artichoke is a great source for delicious vegan dishes from all over the globe.

If you spend just a short while talking with him, you're guaranteed to come away feeling better about yourself... and the universe. His passion for life and interest in travel and food is palpable. And trust me: his cooking is delicious... and I'm not even vegan!\"\n\u2013 Adam Groffman (USA), Travels of Adam\n\"I met Justin in Nepal way back in 2001. We quickly discovered a shared obsession with vegetarian world cuisine and began swapping travel stories of exotic dishes we'd had in foreign countries. As a vegetarian chef myself, I really enjoy when fellow veggies \"get\" international cuisine. We've spent years bouncing ideas off one another and evolving recipes. I'm excited that Justin's committed his ideas to paper \u2013 I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on this cookbook!\"\n\u2013 Vincent Campellone (Ireland), Inside Job Catering\n\"I'm proudly supporting Justin's The Lotus and the Artichoke because he's a fellow traveler following his dream and sharing his passion with the world. The food pics leave me drooling!\"\n\u2013 Niall Doherty (Ireland), Disrupting the Rabblement\n\"Justin ist durch die halbe Welt gereist. Seine Rezepte sind einfach die Wucht!

I\u2019m having a nostalgia rush [...] Castle Story is the first new game that I shall be observing by means of a spyglass each morning throughout 2012.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun\n\n\"I am super excited about [Castle Story]! Looks like a game I'd really enjoy.\" - Notch\nCastle Story is a creative voxel-based strategy game in which you can build castles one brick at a time using an army of little characters called Bricktrons. \nYour goal will be to explore a vast landscape full of mysteries and dangers, and defend your castle against onslaughts of hostile creatures and possibly other players. \nThe world of Castle Story takes place on flying islands, high above an infinite ocean. The islands are made of voxels, cubes made of various elements, which means you can dig, carve and build anything you can imagine in the landscape. Digging underground to gather resources, stacking bricks on top of each other to build a wall or even tunnelling through a mountain is all possible and even necessary to keep your Bricktrons safe.\nCarefully designing your castle not only requires creativity and imagination, but thanks to pathfinding AI and physics simulations, Castle Story has layers of strategy and depth on top of an otherwise free-form sandbox experience.\nCastle Story will be released for Windows & Mac (with possible Linux support once Unity4 is released).\nBuild any structure you can imagine! Using 2x1 blocks, create structures that are not only good-looking, but also functional. Your Bricktrons need to be able to navigate your castle to build it and to keep the monsters out! \nPhysics! Watch a tower crumble to the ground realistically when its foundations can no longer support it. The entire world obeys to the laws of physics which means that you need to build cleverly so your castle can withstand attacks from projectiles and explosives.\nSandbox! Build a huge sprawling fortress, a single impenetrable bunker or a network of underground tunnels. The choice is yours. Castle Story rewards imagination and ingenuity.\nStrategy! Command your Bricktrons as they build your castle brick by brick. Manage the way they work, what resources they gather, and the places they explore. Use your resources to build weapons and armor for your Bricktrons and all kinds of upgrades for your castle.\nCombat! Using shields, swords, bows and lots more, your Bricktrons can defend themselves against the hostile creatures inhabiting the world of Castle Story. Lead your Bricktrons through tough fights, and use your wits to gain an advantage. You can even build catapults to rain destruction on your foes!\nMagic! The world of Castle Story is permeated with all kinds of magic. Discover resources with magical auras and learn to mix them to create effects. Explore strange places and find mysterious artifacts left behind by unknown civilizations.\n\nWe've been working on Castle Story in our free time ever since we graduated from game design studies two years ago. We posted a video demo of our game on Youtube last January and received a flood of good comments and an amazing reception on the Internet. So we decided to quit our jobs and work on the game full-time. \nUntil recently we\u2019ve been working heavily on creating the engine for the game. While most of what is in the trailer and demo video currently exists, it needs to be refined and organized into a cohesive whole. In other words, we have a prototype, but we want to turn this in a complete game. \nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter to be able to fund the next stage of development for Castle Story, so we can build the single player and multiplayer modes. We\u2019ll use the money for:\nSoftware Licenses : As a startup studio, we are missing several tools to help us get the job done. Software is expensive and the costs add up quickly.\nHosting : Our website currently isn't capable of hosting large amounts of traffic. Bandwidth and maintenance for our website and forums as well as a server to handle traffic will be essential.\nMultiplayer : We've never done a multiplayer game of this scope before, so it's going to take a lot of time and effort to learn the ropes and get it right. \nMusic & Audio : We hired two musicians to compose the music for the trailer and the results were pretty amazing. We would like to hire them back again to compose a full fledged soundtrack for the game. We would also hire a professional SFX artist to make the soundscape just as good as the visuals.\nSurviving : Paying rent for food and basically sustain the basic needs of three full time developers for a full year.\nPolish : If we reach our goal, anything past that will be put back directly into making the game more polished.\nThe game has already come pretty far in the last months. Here's what it looked like only 6 months ago, before we quit our jobs:\nKickstarter is great because it allows us to have a direct relationship with you. Instead of having publishers interfere with the game development, you can contribute to the decision process so we can take the game into interesting directions. That's one of the great advantages of \"independent\" game development.\nGetting your name in the game:\nHere is a video attempting to explain what we plan on doing with the names of our backers:\nThe Beta:\nEveryone who contributes to the Kickstarter (enough to qualify for the first reward) gets an early version of the game and has access to any updates that come further down the road. The Beta will become the final game eventually so anybody who backed the Kickstarter with the minimum amount of 15$ gets the final game.\nThe Prototype:\nGet access to an alpha build of the game soon after the Kickstarter is over. The prototype represents what we've shown so far that works. The amount of content and the replay value will be limited, and the build will probably be slightly broken. But we want people to test this version and give us feedback so we can make the Beta better.\nTShirts:\nWe've designed a few t-shirts for you to choose from. Once the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you to see what t-shirt you would like and what size.\nPosters:\nDuring the 30 days that the Kickstarter is going to run. We are going to post several timelapses of the painting process behind our two posters. Afterwards, we are going to print limited-edition high quality prints for the backers who signed up for the posters.\nHere's a preview of the posters. Keep in mind that those are only sketches. The real posters will be painted during the Kickstarter.\nThe Bricktron Plushie:\nThis hand-crafted plushie is made by one of our friend, a professional seamstress and fashion designer. Each plushie will be made one at a time, so every one will be unique. If you want, you can choose a name for it, or we can choose for you, and we'll sew the name on the plushie.\nWe call this one Randy:\nMore coming soon...\nWe're pretty busy working on the prototype. But once we see what kind of response we get, we have a few extra rewards that we would like to offer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Castle Story Merch Store!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #117", "update_userinfo": "The Frosty Resort - Building Challenge RESULTS!", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarter friends!\nThe results for the Building Challenge are in!

It's made of ultra-fine stainless steel mesh fused to a durable stainless steel ring. With more than 50,000 holes per square inch, it will filter smaller particles than any other metal filter (by far), and it won't clog, fray or absorb oils. We designed the S Filter to last for years, and we'll cover it with our Lifetime Guarantee (more on that below). We've already built the prototype, tested it (a lot!) and purchased some tools, but we need your help to launch this product. Your pledges will fund our Seattle workshop setup and the first production run of the S Filter.\nWhat's so cool about it?\nGood question. Here's why we think the S Filter is so special:\nIt's truly reusable. We don't mean for 10 uses, or even 100. We built it to last for thousands of uses, because we don't believe in selling you products that are deliberately engineered to break every couple of years (like your toaster or fridge or washing machine!).\nIt's the finest reusable filter in the world. The S Filter is designed with smaller openings than any other reusable filter. By far. With tens of thousands of holes per square inch and hole openings smaller than a human hair, the S Filter will brew a much cleaner cup than other reusable filters.\nIt allows flavorful coffee oils into the cup (unlike paper). We precisely calibrated the openings of the S Filter so they allow flavorful coffee oils into the cup, while filtering out the smallest coffee particles possible. Any larger, and the coffee tends to be gritty. Any smaller, and oils are trapped in the filter and don't make it into the cup. \nIt's made of 100% stainless steel (no plastic or silicone). We don't believe petrochemicals or processed wood pulp belong in our coffee. So the S Filter is made of 100% stainless steel, and we don't use any toxic chemicals to produce it. \nIt's sustainable. To us, sustainable means a responsibly produced product that actually reduces your environmental footprint from coffee brewing. The S Filter will last for thousands of uses.  We make it responsibly by choosing a material that lends itself well to recycling, minimizing energy and water in production, and mechanically cutting our steel instead of photo etching it. As a company, we\u2019re committed to transparency with regard to our environmental impact, including energy and water footprint analysis.  Check out our website for more information. \nSo, who are you guys?\nKaffeologie is a Seattle business that designs and builds reusable stainless steel coffee filters.  It is run by two entrepreneurs, Nate and John, who founded the company in 2009.  We started designing the S Filter last year.\nWhat do I get if I support this project?\nSome really cool stuff:\nThe S Filter: Pledge $10, and we'll send you one of the first S Filters ever!\nThe monogrammed S Filter: Pledge $25 and send us your initials. We'll send you a custom S Filter stamped with your initials. We'll stamp them on an antique printing press the same way we stamp our logo! \nThe AeroPress coffee maker: Pledge $50 or more, and you can choose to receive an AeroPress coffee maker with your S Filter. The AeroPress brews delicious coffee quickly and travels easily so you'll never be without your cup of coffee. We'll even send you our favorite recipe to get you started!\nThe Charity Jones custom T-shirt: Pledge $50 or more, and you can choose to receive a custom T-shirt created for us by artist and fashion designer Charity Jones. Charity is known for her unique, wearable designs that really pop on the street, and she'll be turning her talents toward making a unique and memorable shirt for backers only! You can check out examples of her work at her website.\nThe Finca las Brumas coffee: Pledge $50 or more, and you can choose to receive superb coffee from the #1 Cup of Excellence award winning farm in El Salvador! This coffee has been selected by Mark Barany, roaster and founder of Kuma Coffee. Mark will roast your bag of las Brumas just before we ship it to you, and we promise you it will be awesome.\nThe Porlex Mini hand grinder: Pledge $140 or more, and you can choose to receive a complete AeroPress travel or camping kit, including the beautifully designed Porlex Mini hand grinder. The Porlex is perfectly sized to fit in the AeroPress, holds just enough beans for a single brew, and is made of durable stainless steel with long-lasting ceramic burrs. The Porlex comes with click-based adjustable grind so you can dial in your grind accurately and it's also designed to reduce coffee fines during grinding with a stainless steel dual-fixed burr set axis. This is the grinder we use on the road, and we're very pleased to be able to offer it to you!\nThe very first S Filter: Be the first to pledge $150, and we will send you the very first S Filter we produce in our shop. We'll even stamp it with your initials and production number \"1\" on the antique printing press we use for our logos. Get this one now, because someone else probably wants it... \nWhen and how will you ship my cool stuff?\nWe will ship in September via USPS first class.  If you live outside the US, don\u2019t worry!  Just add the extra postage for international deliver listed in each pledge level.  \nWhat if I want more than one S Filter?\nIf you want another filter, pledge an extra $10 (or $25 for a monogrammed filter). If you're interested in wholesaling the S Filter, please contact us.\nWhat happens if the S Filter project is over-funded?\nIf we get more than our goal, we'll put that extra money toward producing some new filter designs for other coffee brewers. We are very close to releasing some awesome new products. Don't worry, we'll keep you in the loop!\nTell me more about this Lifetime Guarantee...\nWe guarantee all of our filters unconditionally. If for some reason you're unhappy with the S Filter, let us know and we'll make it right. We promise. \nCome on, I want to see more pictures!\nWe understand.

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

The interface will be a fairly streamlined verb coin point & click system. The setting should be familiar to anyone who's seen Tom Corbett: Space Cadet or Perry Rhodan: bubble helmets, rockets 'n ray guns galore.\nThe Story\nIn the year 1999, a retired Jack Houston is recruited by the Venture Aeronautics and Space Transportation (VAST) corporation for one last mission: to man the first rocket to Venus. The rocket is designed to penetrate the hazy atmosphere and land on the surface, where some believe Jack may find the first signs of life in our solar system. En route, something goes terribly wrong and Jack's rocket crash lands in an alien ocean, where he rests in cryogenic sleep for 1,000 years. The world he wakes up to is one of savage beast men who worship a devil god with the power to control the dead. These strange entities are able to inhabit the remains of any creature after death, fortifying and building upon their skeletal structures until they are virtually indestructible war machines. With the tribal inhabitants of the entire planet under their crushing heel, the undead Venusian warlords threaten to pulverize Jack like an ant. But our clever test pilot will uncover a shocking revelation about the origin of these \u201cNecronauts,\u201d a connection between the creatures and himself that could be their undoing\u2026 and his.\nThis isn't the mission Jack signed up for, and even if he finds a way off the planet, the Earth he knew is gone. What Jack will find, however, is a whole new universe where space travel is common place and aliens are everywhere. A galaxy of adventure he could never have dreamed is waiting for him, if only he can survive the perils of this vicious planet!\nThe Setting\nJack\u2019s adventure takes place not far from home, on our neighboring planet of Venus. But this isn\u2019t the lifeless planet we know today, this Venus is a sweltering vine jungle teaming with strange beasts of horn, tooth and claw. This is the world of adventure imagined and glorified in sci-fi magazines and novels of the 40's and 50's, by science fiction authors and artists whose legacies include John Carter of Mars, Carson of Venus, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tom Corbett: Space Cadet, Perry Rhodan and many more. In this future world, humans have conquered space and found a new frontier beyond our imagination.\nStacy Davidson\nDavidson\u2019s love of computer games began at the age of eight with the introduction of a TI-99/4A computer into his household. He later developed a short Extended Basic text adventure called The Quest, followed by many simple arcade and RPG game prototypes on his Commodore 64. He spent a year in Quality Assurance at Origin Systems/EA, published his own shareware game called Shadow of the Lost Citadel, and has spent the last eleven years working in motion pictures as a producer, director, cinematographer, editor, sound designer and visual effects supervisor at his own studio, Odyssee Pictures. In 2010, his fan-game project Han Solo Adventures was featured in Star Wars: Uncut and The People vs. George Lucas. Now at the helm of his new game studio, Davidson is looking forward to exploring the adventure genre in his never ending quest to recapture the glorious days when mysteries were solved and legends born one click at a time.\nYou can check out Davidson's work with a trailer for his horror film Sweatshop, and his music video for the metal band Outworld (because metal. \\m/etal!!)\nThe Team\nStacy Davidson is an accomplished effects artist and game designer, but he is also counting on the help of a small team of artists. The level of involvement of other team members will depend on the level of funding we achieve. We have already tapped the talent of concept artists Patrick Reilly, Mitchell Malloy, Giacomo Tappainer and Mike Oliver, and would love to continue to utilize them.\nWe also have at our disposal a team of effects artists including Mike Oliver, Kristi Boul and Marcus Koch, all of whom have extensive experience in sculpting, molding and casting, and who all have their own valuable creative vision to offer, as well as helping to speed up the process immensely.\nIain Kelso\nInternationally acclaimed composer Iain Kelso has already begun work on a riveting original score for Jack Houston. His score for the feature film Jacob, produced by Odyssee Pictures and featuring Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens, Tombstone, The Divide), recently won the Platinum Award at WorldFest International Film Festival. Samples of his work can be heard here.\nThe Production\nIn film production, it's always the same deal. We pitch a project to investors, raise money, make the movie, and then cross our fingers that we will a) get a great domestic distribution deal, b) have lots of luck at the international markets selling foreign rights, and c) become profitable enough to repay all our investors and make enough for ourselves to launch another picture.\nThat way of working is frankly crazy. With Kickstarter, you as the fans and players can make a project like this a reality by backing it ahead of time and, as long as we do our job, there's no taking chances on market fluctuations, agent fees, greedy distributors, tea leaves, fortune cookies or the ramblings of the Voodoo Lady at the International House of Mojo. We get to create the best game possible and put it right into the hands of the very fans who backed us. No middle men what so ever.\nWithin three weeks of the project being funded, we will go into production full time and begin filling YOU in with regular updates and behind-the-scenes videos keeping you involved in the project every step of the way. You'll have exclusive access to the dev team through the private backers' forum, and high level backers will even have certain perks including quarterly producer reports and the opportunity to vote on critical in-game content.\nPlatforms and Localization\nAt the base goal, we will be using Adventure Game Studio as the base engine, which supports PC and has limited support for Linux. If we continue that path, we will do all we can to support Linux at launch, within the capabilities of that engine, and begin work on a Mac port after launch.\nHowever, we are also formulating a stretch goal that will allow us to develop the game using a different engine that will fully support PC, Mac and Linux at first launch, then iPad and Android tablets soon after. We are committed to seeing Jack on multiple platforms no matter what, but exceeding our funding goals will allow us to do so immediately at launch.\nAt the base goal, the game will be released with English voice over and on-screen text. We are currently formulating a small, attainable stretch goal that will allow us to translate the game text into many other languages at launch. Again, we are committed to supporting as many languages as possible. If we do not attain this goal, other languages will follow sometime after launch.\nKicking it Forward\nWe solemnly pledge 5% of the profits from the finished product back to the Kickstarter community to help fund other people's dreams. http://kickingitforward.org\nWe want all our backers to be super excited about being a part of Jack Houston and the Necronauts!\nDigital Rewards\nAt the basic $15 level, we will get you a download code for the full game, DRM-FREE, which will include an in-game designer commentary audio track, a new HD wallpaper every month, exclusive access to beta-testing and access to our private forum community and video updates for backers-only. At $30 we'll throw in a digital download of the original score. At $60 you'll also get a PDF of \"Crafting the World of Jack Houston and the Necronauts\" which chronicles the complete development process covering sculpting, molding/casting, stop motion animation, miniature building and game development.\nWe also have a special \"ALL-DIGITAL INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE\" at $95 which gives you a huge assortment of nifty digital rewards for international backers who'd rather not mess with pesky customs issues.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter that, the rewards start to get physical...\nAttribution & Gratitude\nSome public domain video clips were used courtesy of NASA.\nAll concept art is the work of Patrick Reilly, Mitchell Malloy, Giacomo Tappainer and Mike Oliver.\nExamples of the Jack Houston team visual effects work featured shots from Psychic Experiment (A.K.A. \"Walking Distance\") featuring Debbie Rochon, Glenn Morshower, Katie Featherston, Reggie Bannister and Adrienne King, from Upstart Filmworks and Lionsgate Entertainment, written and directed by Mel House. More info here.\nSome music created by Jack Houston composer Iain Kelso was used courtesy Odyssee Pictures from the feature film Jacob.\nVoice over work was provided by professional voice actor Otis Twelve, and recorded courtesy of Vince Twelve, creator of the spectacular new adventure game Resonance from XII Games and Wadjet Eye Games (which also features Otis Twelve, and effects work from Odyssee Pictures/Warbird Games, check it out!)\nJoin Team Jack!\nThis project means more to me than you can know. The story is pure Edgar Rice Burroughs pulp adventure, the art design is a Frazetta-fueled dream (Frank Frazetta happens to be our lead concept artist Patrick Reilly's biggest influence), the environment and creatures will be right out of a Harryhausen movie, and just wait 'til you hear the way this soundtrack is shaping up. It's the grab a ray gun, hop in a rocket and blast off to Venus fantasy I've seen in my head ever since I first laid eyes on Amazing Stories magazine, and heard my first episodes of X Minus One and Tom Corbett: Space Cadet.\nI truly can't wait to get started on Jack Houston, so please grab a bubble helmet, holster your ray gun, and fire up the engines because this is surely going to be one seriously kick ass ride!\n~Stacy Davidson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "Another overdue update", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 5335, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warbirdgames/jack-houston-and-the-necronauts", "project_name": "Jack Houston and the Necronauts"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The first REAL watch that connects with your smartphone, keeps you alerted, and unlike other smart watches, DOES NOT NEED TO BE RECHARGED!\nLifestyle shot of the actual COOKOO\u2122 watch.\nSpread the word - follow us on Twitter and like us on Facebook.

With your help we can finish strong!\nBacker Profile Avatar\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRetrovirus is a Descent-inspired six-axis shooter by Cadenza Interactive, the team behind the 2010 XBox and PC game Sol Survivor.  It features levels designed to force players to think off the ground and out of the box.  Its pacing is similar to classic shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament, and agile movement is at the core of the experience.  Retrovirus also features a unique arsenal of weapons that do more than just dish out damage.  By scanning residual weapon effects in the world, you can create gravity wells, knock enemies around or trigger charged blasts on groups of enemies.\nIn Retrovirus, you are the Agent of an anti-virus program fighting against a viral army that has rapidly taken over parts of your system.  Called on to respond to the crisis, you must defend the system and remove the virus before it can corrupt and destroy your world.  In doing so, you'll explore a surreal software environment that pieces fragments of human reality into the fabric of its own world.\nRetrovirus also features a dual narrative, bringing in the fictional people to whom this computer is important along with their personal dramas and real-world implications if the system is allowed to fall.\n5 to 6 hour single player / co-op campaign\na world designed around the unique features of six degrees of freedom movement\nweapons designed to give players both damage and control of space\ndecision-based AI for unscripted level encounters\nDOTA-style FPS MOBA multiplayer\nclassic Domination / Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch multiplayer\n\nIf we're successful with Kickstarter, we'll be guaranteeing the release of our Paragon design tool for the community.  With Paragon, you'll be able to author your own mods and levels, extending the life of the game and enriching the player community.\n\nParagon's basic level design tools are intuitive, based on FPS controls rather than a wholly separate set of editor controls.  You'll be able to play with assets from Retrovirus, or create your own and design a wholly new experience using Paragon as your toolbox.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what the community can do with this!\nMost importantly, Kickstarter will give us the extra development time we need to finish Retrovirus' single player campaign as it exists on paper.  Without Kickstarter, about an hour of single player content is set to be cut.  We're also pursuing professional voice acting and in-engine cinematics to help bring the Retrovirus story to life.  We'd also like to have a large-scale beta to gather community feedback prior to release, and Kickstarter will give us the funds to accomplish that.  A successful Kickstarter will allow us the time to polish the game to the level we know we can achieve.\nCadenza Interactive is a company with real gamers at the controls.  In 2008, the company was formed with the goal of producing the sorts of games we'd want to play at LAN parties.  We released our first game, Sol Survivor, on Steam in 2010 to warm critical and public reviews.  We've learned a lot since Sol Survivor, and we've spent the past two years burying ourselves in the craft of making games.  Retrovirus is a real thing that we've seen grow from nothing into what we're showing you here with Kickstarter.  We want to continue this momentum and finish strong, with the polish and style that our players deserve!\n----------------------------\nWe at Cadenza are all thrilled you took the time to read this far into our Kickstarter.  The making of this game has consumed all of us.  Before Retrovirus' development is through, there will have been two new weddings, four new full-time additions to the Cadenza staff, and many nights shooting at each other in a digital world we've come together to create.  We can only hope that our devotion to our work shines through to you!\n\nIf we've caught your eye, toss us a pledge!  We listen to our community, and we'd love to have you join us in making Retrovirus as much yours as it is ours.\n\nThanks!\n\n-The Cadenza Interactive Team\n----------------------------\nRetrovirus Concept Images from the 'Game & Art Manual'\n---------------------------- \nWallpapers!\nWant to show your support for our project on your desktop?

"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Why GameStop?", "update_content": "We have gotten this question a lot. GameStop was not an obvious choice of an initial release platform; even to me! So, why did we decide to release on GameStop\u2019s PC Digital Downloads first? Lets start at the beginning.\n\nWe needed some funding to finish Retrovirus and make it into the game that we had envisioned. So we put together a Kickstarter. One of our backers was a huge Descent fan. When the kickstarter did not succeed, he put his money where his mouth was and financially backed our project. He saw what we saw.\n\nAnother one of our backers was a manager at GameStop. He fell in love with Retrovirus and wanted to see it succeed. He too saw what we saw. He went to his boss and they both approached us about a week after the kickstarter closed and offered us an incredible deal.\n\nFor small, independent, game studios like Cadenza Interactive, our greatest challenge is reaching out to gamers. Even though we are working on tech and gameplay that is competitive with much larger studios, we struggle to reach out to gamers who have not already heard of us. Our new friends at GameStop offered us that very ability.\n\nIf you live in the US, go to your nearest GameStop store and you will see fliers for Retrovirus on the counter. The store manager will happily talk your ear off about the project. The TV in the corner will periodically show video of the game. If you use the GameStop PC Download App, you will see our banner take over the entire page right after Borderlands 2. If you go to GameStop.com/pcgames you will see Retrovirus appear in the Ad banner rotation next to Darksiders II and Elder Scrolls.\n\nWhy did we release first on GameStop? They offered us a deal that only AAA games get. The success of Retrovirus will be largely thanks to the exposure we are now receiving. More than that, we are releasing first on GameStop because I speak with the higher-ups over there every other day and they are as passionate about Retrovirus as I am!\n\nI know that some of you don\u2019t have access to a GameStop store and don\u2019t use GameStop PC Downloads, and I promise that we have not forgotten you. We will be coming out on other platforms. For now, the GameStop platform is actually very friendly to indie games. Unlike some other platforms, GameStop does not require DRM, they allow users to download their games over again for an unlimited time, and they even allow us to give out keys for other platforms.\n\nFor those who are able, we would appreciate your support by pre-ordering Retrovirus on GameStop and continuing to spread the word about our project to your friends and family. These pre-orders allow you to play the Alpha (and soon the Beta) and get access to updates as soon as we make them!\n\nThank you for your continued support!\n\n-Spencer Roberts-\nPresident, Cadenza Interactive"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 122, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cadenzainteractive/retrovirus", "project_name": "Retrovirus, a six axis shooter"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\nMashable Video: NEW CAMERA CASE MAKES LIGHTING PERFECT FOR iPHONE PICTURES\nFast Company:  KICKSTARTING: AN iPHONE CASE THAT KEEPS GLARE FROM RUINING YOUR PICTURES\nHuffington Post:  TRYGGER iPHONE CASE BRINGS VIBRANT COLORS AND SHARP CONTRAST TO 4/4S CAMERA\nGear Diary:  KICKSTART THIS! TRYGGER iPHONE CAMERA CASE\niPhoneography:  ADD A POLARISING FILTER TO YOUR iPHONE WITH THE TRYGGER CAMERA CASE\nCult of Mac:  THE TRYGGER IS AN INGENIOUS AND EASY WAY TO ADD [A POLARIZER] TO YOUR iPHONE\nTechNewsDaily:  TRYGGER iPHONE CASE MAKES SUNNY PHOTOS LOOK BETTER\nCNET:  A MUST HAVE iPHONE ACCESSORY\nTHE CAMERA CASE FOR IPHONE 4/4S: LESS GLARE. MORE VIBRANT COLORS.\nHi, we're Trygger and we've created the Camera Case. It's an iPhone 4/4S case with a polarizing filter built in to help you make your best photos. \nProfessional photographers have relied on polarizing filters to clean up noisy light for decades. The Camera Case brings that same polarizing filter to your iPhone camera, built-in and always ready to take great pictures. It cuts out glare and unwanted reflections while making colors more vibrant and contrast sharper. It makes the world through your phone look more like the world you see through your eyes so you can capture all of life's moments the way you remember them.\nPOLARIZING FILTER\nThe polarizing filter cuts out glare and unwanted reflections, without blocking your flash. It is made by placing a color neutral polarizing film between two layers of high grade optical Borosilicate glass. Each of your snapshots will be crisp, clean and ready to show off.\nLess Glare (Before/after photos are unedited)\nMORE VIBRANT COLORS\nThe adjustable filter also lets you capture more vibrant colors that are truer to what your eyes see. The world through your phone has never looked this good.\nVivid Colors (Before/after photos are unedited)\nREMOVE UNWANTED REFLECTION\nThe filter also lets you remove unwanted reflection from glass, water and metal. See the image, not the reflection!\nNow You See It, Now You Don't (Photos are unedited)\nADJUST TO COMPOSE\nThe filter is adjustable so you can change how much light comes through. You'll have more control over the look of your photos, as you shoot them.\nSLIDING BACK\nThere are no pieces to carry with you to attach (or lose). Just slide the felt-lined back up and you're ready. You'll be the quickest shot around.\nLOW PROFILE PROTECTION\n1.8mm of high-strength polycarbonate means your iPhone can be fully protected and keep its thin profile. Think of it as peace of mind for when you climb that tree to get the perfect angle.\nBACKER\u2019S COLOR CHOICE\nBeyond the four colors we\u2019ve shown above, we also plan to produce one more color choice for the Camera Case and we want you to vote to pick it out. If you are a backer, you\u2019ll receive a survey after the Kickstarter period has ended. In that survey you can pick one of the existing colors for the Camera Case you will receive, or you can vote for one from the colors below. Don\u2019t worry, if you don\u2019t like the color that ends up winning the Backer\u2019s Color Choice, you will have the opportunity to switch to White, Black, Azalea or Pollen instead.\nDESIGN PROCESS\nThe Camera Case was carefully planned and designed. We're a team of designers and engineers who also love photography. Since we were making a tool to help you make your best photos, it was important to us that you have the best experience using it as well. That means the Camera Case is thoughtfully designed and is made from the best quality from the glass of the filter to the way it fits on your phone. Every detail was important to us. We made more than 30 prototypes before we had something that felt right and decided on our final design. We also field tested the Camera Case in just about every terrain our native state of Oregon could provide. We ended up with a product that is great to use, is going to last and is something we're very proud of.\nTRYGGER CONNECTED CAMERA APP\nTrygger's Connected Camera App enhances the use of the Camera Case to make better photos. The Trygger app is the result of an integrated software and hardware design to simplify taking pictures. For example, the App offers a calibration function aligned with the polarizing filter. We scan the image in real time and create a histogram behind the scene. As you rotate the polarizer, the histogram shifts while the contrast changes and we let you know by a sound cue when to take the best picture. This will be especially helpful when taking pictures in sunlight when it is difficult to see the screen. Scheduled for delivery this fall, the Trygger Camera App will be Free. Here is an early look.\nHere is an early look.\nTrygger Connected Camera App\nYour Camera Case will work great without the Trygger Filter App, but it will work even better with it.\nKICKSTARTER\nThis is where you come in. We're on Kickstarter because we need your help. Manufacturing the Camera Case is going to be expensive and we need funding to put it into production. If we hit our goal we'll be able to make the Camera Case on a broad enough scale so that the cost of each case is very reasonable. It's the upfront costs that we can't make happen without your help.\nSo back us. Help the Camera Case get funded so you can start making your best photos.\nThank you Kickstarter!\nFAQ\nQuestion:  Can these effects be created using software like Photoshop, or an app?\nAnswer:  No, the effects of a polarizing filter can only be achieved when the picture is taken.\nQuestion:  What does a polarizing filter do?\nAnswer:  Among other things, it can darken the sky, remove reflections from water and glass and make plant-life and foliage appear less shiny. Color saturation is also enhanced.  \nQuestion:  Does it work with camera apps like Instagram?\nAnswer:  Yes, it works with every iOS camera app.\nQuestion:  When will it ship?\nAnswer:  Estimated shipping is early July 2012.\n \u00a92012 Trygger LLC.

Whats a better reward than that!\nFAQ\nI thought Teknision had raised over $50,000 in pledges already? What happened? We thought we had made it. Kickstarter is an amazing platform but a really difficult one for anyone outside of the United States. In order to set up a Kickstarter account, you have to use Amazon Payments and in order to use Amazon Payments you have be an American citizen. Luckily for us, we had that covered. At least we thought we did. As with any team, you can't expect all the members to stay part of the team forever. One team member's departure meant the departure of the Amazon Payment account. \nWhy are you only asking to raise $30,000 this time? We are playing it safe. We understand that many people might not be bothered to go through the Kickstarter checkout again so we are lowering the threshold.  Our personal goal is to achieve the $50,000 that we had previously achieved. Rest assured, we are 100% committed to making an awesome home screen and delivering on time. \nWill my credit card be charged twice if I back this new project? No. We  canceled the original project ( http://kck.st/Kt62TM  ) , everyones pledges were refunded, well before the final deadline. \nWhat exactly is the Kickstarter money going towards? Thirty grand sure is a lot of money. In fact, we have already invested far more than that into Chameleon. Creating an product like Chameleon is not done overnight - it needs need a team of developers, designers, and a test bed of hardware. What you are seeing is the product of months of effort entirely self funded by us, all while juggling other projects to help keep the lights on. Oh and ramen noodles of course! All proceeds from Kickstarter will go directly to completing production of Chameleon and its literally a small fraction to what Chameleon costs to build.\nWhat platforms does Chameleon work with?\nChameleon is designed to work on Android Tablets version 3.2 and above.\nDoes Chameleon work for my Android phone as well as tablet? Chameleon will not be available on the phone for the August release. Chameleon is currently designed specifically for the tablet, however any Kickstarter backer who has pledged $5 and up will be able to get early access to our beta release Chameleon Phone app which we are aiming to deliver by winter 2012.\nChameleon will not work on the phone for the August release. Chameleon is currently designed specifically for the tablets - however any Kickstarter backer who has pledged $5 and up will be able to get early access to our beta release Chameleon Phone app. which we are aiming deliver winter 2012.\nWhy did you Kickstart this project? We love Kickstarter and think its a great way to test the market, raise awareness and validate the Chameleon concept. Any product like this needs money to bring a product to market. Traditionally, that money either comes internally or from investors. The beauty of Kickstarter is that it's not investment, it's pre-sales. Practically every backer on Kickstarter is a customer and it's a perfect way to let ideas stand for themselves.\nThe prototype looks finished - why will it take so long to make it available? There is a big difference between a prototype and shippable software. Even a prototype like the one in the Kickstarter video is far from a complete product. While the prototype shows actual home screen creation and editing and real working widgets, there is still a lot of hard work to be done to ensure the user experience is uncompromised in any way and also to ensure that what we are shipping is fully tested to provide the performance we are promising. Remember, we are showing Chameleon on our own tablet, which is a known and unchanging environment. We still have to test on a wide variety of tablets so that everyone gets the same experience.\nWeren't you working on a OEM deal with Chameleon? Conversations with OEM's are still moving in the right direction but we've listened to our fans and made a decision to create a separate product roadmap that allows us to deliver and maintain Chameleon for consumers and still deliver a highly customized set of functionality for OEM's at the same time.\nI don't want a Morning, Work or Evening home screen - can I choose my own? Absolutely, we have used those as examples to get you started. You can make specific Home screens for family members, for entertainment, for travel, whatever. Its completely up to you!\nIf Teknision strikes a deal with an OEM what happens with the software? Will it be supported? Our view is this - as long as there is a market and revenue stream for Chameleon as a Google Play app, we will build it, sell it and support it. Similarly Chameleon as an OEM product would require a OEM backer to make it a reality. We view them as two distinct and independent products, with distinct buyers that have distinct needs. The more the merrier in our opinion!\nI pledge the five bucks, what happens in September, will I have to buy the app again? If you buy Chameleon via Kickstarter, we will ensure that you pay only once and will have access to all applicable software updates.\nWill smaller screen sizes be supported? Because we are focused on optimizing performance - the first release will be performance optimized for 10\" (1280 x 800) however we will be working hard to ensure Chameleon works on smaller tablets as well. The framework and widgets are already designed to dynamically fit different screen sizes, but we want to ensure the performance doesn't suffer.\nWill there be a mobile phone version? Our focus is 100% on making Chameleon for tablets this fall. We will be working on creating a phone based version around winter 2012 with early access to anyone who is a Chameleon Kickstarter backer.\nWhat kind of language support will there be? Our Kickstarter release will be english only however multi language support is part of the product roadmap after V1.\nWill tablets running on Android 4.0+ be able to create folders in the app tray as you can on the current ICS home screen? Not at this time.\nCan I be involved in testing? Yes! We will be conducting various tests and will need your help. Stay tuned for updates!\nHow many Home screens can I make? Currently there is no limit (which may change) but we suspect 5 home screens is the maximum someone would likely create.\nI don\u2019t want to lose my Android preferences how does Chameleon impact my settings? Chameleon will aim to utilize as many Android preferences as possible. Additionally if you decide you want to go back to using your old Android home screen, the settings associated with it will remain as you last left them.\nDoes Chameleon support multiple users? No - our first release will not have user profiles or profile management. While we had this and facial recognition in our prototypes - this feature is a concept only.\nCan I use Android\u2019s live wallpaper or upload my own backgrounds? As a company that focuses in UI design, simplicity and legibility is very important to us. We view Android's live wallpapers as a novelty and visual distraction so at this point we will not be supporting the live wall papers. Chameleon will allow for people to upload their own wall papers.

Besides mad scientist, its the only job I\u2019ve ever aspired to, and I don't think that\u2019s gonna happen.\nI started gaming with an Atari 2600, so I grew up along with the video game industry.\nThe art in paper sorcerer is the culmination of all I\u2019ve been working towards in my personal art.\nI\u2019m just working on this game on my own in my spare time. Although RPGs are one of the hardest games to put together on your own, you gotta do what you love, right?\nGameplay\nFirst, battle mechanics: There are no to-hit rolls [all attacks always hit, except for special abilities that give a chance to dodge], instead all characters have a defense bar, which reduces incoming damage by a static number, for example, if you have a defense of 6, it'll subtract 6 from every attack that hits you, and your defense meter will go down one. Your defense is adjusted by armor and certain skills.\nIn addition to normal attacks, all characters have attack skills, these skill take anywhere from one to three rounds to refresh [to be usable again] and they're unique for each character, for example: one of the first summons you get, the goblin, has a stealth ability that gives him a chance to dodge attacks.\nNormal attacks and skills both charge your energy meter. You use energy to execute more powerful abilities. For example: the goblin's trick attack dazes the enemy in addition to dealing a little extra damage, but using it costs energy. The main goal in a system like this is to make it so that you don't constantly use only your normal attack, you have to strategically use all of your abilities. I'm currently balancing the game to be more difficult so that it encourages the use of all your skills and powers.\nNow for the summons and character customization, there's currently a total of twelve summons planned for the game. Each summon has a base class, and once each reaches a certain level, you'll have a choice of two advanced classes.\nThe main way you customize characters is by purchasing skills and skill upgrades in town. Each character has a predetermined start growth but you can customize the characters by purchasing passive skills and skill upgrades. Also the class determines what kind of skills you can purchase, so when you choose an advanced class, that determines what kind of mid- and late-game skills you can get.  For example, the goblin is focused on disabling enemies, but if I wanted him to be more of a physical damage-dealer, I could buy him strength upgrades that would affect him permanently, or I could buy him equipment that increases his strength for now. The reasoning behind this is that money should be valuable through the whole game, not just in the beginning, and it shouldn't become useless late-game.\n\nNext, the equipment system: all of the possible equip slots are: head, armor, weapon, off-hand, accessory one, and accessory two.\nHowever, the only character that can equip all slots is the sorcerer. Summons each get three equipment slots, varying summon to summon. For example, the goblin has weapon, armor, and one accessory slot; whereas the imp has a weapon slot and two accessories.\n\nLet's do a basic rundown of the summons you start with:\nAcolyte: A corrupted priest, he's focused on protecting the party through buffs and healing injured. He can wear up to chain armor and use maces, so he isn't frail.\n\nStarting Abilities:\nDivine Power: gives the party a +2 damage adjustment, and generates 1 energy.\nFocus: increases his magic stat, so he can heal more, and generates 1 energy.\nHeal: restores HP of a party member, costs 1 energy.\n\nGoblin: An agile thief, his focus is on disabling the enemy with status effects and stealing items. He can use leather armor and daggers.\n\nStarting Abilities:\nStealth: gives him a 25% chance to dodge attacks, and a bonus to stealing, generates 1 energy.\nSteal: steals an item from an enemy, generates 1 energy.\nTrick Attack: attack with slight damage bonus and also dazes the enemy, costs a 1 energy.\n\nImp: Elemental damage dealer, focuses on fire and ice damage, and manipulating enemies resistances. Uses elemental bracelets to increase magic damage, relies on his demonic skin for defense [no armor].\n\nStarting Abilities:\nIce Claw: deals ice damage, reduces enemies' fire resistance, generates 1 energy.\nFire Claw:  deals fire damage, reduces enemies' ice resistance, generates 1 energy.\nAbyssal Frost: deals Ice damage based on how much energy you have stored up, consumes all energy.\nAnother big mechanic is the search function. Certain rooms, after you defeat all the enemies in the level, will have a contextual search icon appear in the corner.\n\nIf you click this option, then you have a chance to find treasure, a room feature, or...\n\n...you have a chance of springing a trap or encountering an enemy.\n\nBy implementing the search feature, I'm hoping that it'll spice up dungeon exploration and make every play session different.\nThe Game Right Now\nI have the framework for all the elements in place; all the stats are setup and working, the skills, status effects, and spells all function as they\u2019re supposed to, I have a rough version of all the menus and UI, the battle system is in place, the adventure elements are implemented in game, and the ability to  use items in the environment is all in. However at this point everything is still very rough. There are some minor usability and presentation issues that need to be ironed out. In addition to more polish what is needed now is more assets. More summons, more levels, more spells, more tile sets, an introduction and tutorial sequence, basically more of everything.\nWhat Will My Pledge Do?\nTest devices (iPhone, iPad, Android, etc)\nDeveloper licenses (Android, iOS, Xbox, etc)\nArt supplies (Pens, nibs, brushes, markers, decent paper, lots of ink, etc.)\nFees and taxes for setting up a small business\nMiscellaneous development costs\nTimeline\nIf funded, I expect this project to take until near the end of August.\nFrom now until the end of May, I'll be working on getting all the menus and usability issues worked out, and some early testing on as many platforms as I can.\nAll of June is going to be dedicated to making levels and content. And testing those levels, with a lot of iteration on level design.\nIn July I will be making more content as well as making the intro movie, ending movies, polishing gameplay, tutorials, etc.\nAugust is all about balancing and bug-testing builds. Making sure that I can distribute on all the platforms, working out all the deliveries, organizing all the rewards.\nOver-funding Goals\nAchieved If we make more than $5500, then I'll add an extra summon to everybody's copy of the game, and several optional levels you can go through to unlock it! It's called the Living Doll*, and it's a blank slate character that you shape based on your play style. You could raise its strength and make it your heavy hitter, with devastating physical attack skills; or you could raise its dexterity and make it an agile thief, whatever you like!\nAchieved At $8,000, I pledge to purchase a license for Unity Pro, thus enabling the game to have custom splash screens [none of the Unity ones], fullscreen rendering, and other extra cool things. The new bonus, is that every pledge $5 or more gets another exclusive desktop wallpaper!\nAchieved At $8500 I'll sign every box copy I ship. That's a signed box copy for every pledge $25 or higher!\nAchieved At $9000 you guys get to vote on what the two bonus summons will be! Every backer gets a vote when we reach this level.\nAchieved At $9500 I'll make a new skin for the main character! When you start the game you'll get to choose which skin you want. This is for all copies of the game.\nAchieved At $10,000 I'll add a new summon, the Giant! I'll also add in several more dungeon levels with new enemies. Every backer gets these, it'll be in every copy.\nAchieved At $12,000 every backer gets a beta to playtest and I'll listen to all of your input. This'll most likely go out early-mid August so that I can have enough time to take in your input and implement it for the final release.\nAchieved At $13,000 every backer's name will appear in-game, in The Tome of Heroes!\n*name not final, subject to change; it looks more like a marionette or blank puppet than say a detailed girl's doll.\nThanks\nThanks everyone for taking the time to look at this, even if you don\u2019t pledge, I appreciate your interest and I hope you pass the word along. :) I'd also like to say thank you to all my friends and family who've been supporting this endeavor.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "State of Paper Sorcerer Update", "update_content": "Hello all,  \nJust over 5 years ago, you contributed to the development of Paper Sorcerer.

This has been a work-in-progress for over a year now and it's finally perfected.  I just need help funding the manufacturing process and getting it to market.\nFeatured on the cool site GearHungry     \n...notice the improved, slightly larger top flap.\nFlashPipe is a clever, new diffuser for your hotshoe mounted flash.  There's nothing else like it and it works great.  The quality of the light it produces is soft and bright with an ever-so-slight warming that makes skin tones look great.  It's incredibly lightweight at just one ounce.  And the coolest part is that it folds flat when not in use, saving valuable space in your camera bag or allowing you to carry it with you in a pocket at all times.  It mounts and removes effortlessly and it's made out of an extremely durable thermoplastic material.  On top of all that, FlashPipe will sell for less than $25, so it's a no-brainer to add one or more to your arsenal of gear.  It's simple, it works great, and it's very affordable.\nAvailable light, diffused FlashPipe light, direct flash light. The right light makes a big difference on your foreground subject as well as the background textures. It's subtle, but in the FlashPipe shot you can tell it's a cinderblock wall.\nThat's it in a nutshell, but please watch the videos and read on if you're the type who likes lots of detail.  More sample photos are below and in the UPDATES section. If you've heard enough already, then go ahead and make a pledge.  You'll get a really fantastic camera accessory and I'll be eternally grateful for your help in getting this launched.  Thank you to all my previous backers who have returned and thank you to all the new pledgers!\nAll camera settings identical. Ambient, Direct Flash, Bounce Flash, Competitor #1, FlashPipe, Competitor #2\n*The first production run will target Canon and Nikon owners since there's such a large base of existing users. Two sizes will accommodate both company's most popular models.  You'll need to tell me if you want the Regular (fits Canon 580/600 and Nikon SB900/910) or if you want the Small (fits Canon 420/430 and Nikon SB600/700/800).  Any brand flash with matching measurements can also use FlashPipe, of course.  There's even a beta tester who plans on using FlashPipe on the bare tube of his Quantum Q-flash, so there are lots of possibilities.  Check out the UPDATES page for specific dimensions.\nIf you want more background info, read on....\nI've been a professional photographer for a few decades now, and whenever I shoot events, or weddings, or editorial assignments, I find that sometimes I need to use on-camera flash. I prefer natural lighting, but you don't always get that luxury. When you have to or chose to, it usually looks better to use soft, diffused lighting. This is especially true when shooting people. There have been a lot of products out there to accomplish this and I've tried several, but I've found that in one way or another they tend to be lacking. Either they don't work effectively, they're bulky or awkward in use, difficult to mount, or they're just too expensive. And most occupy way too much space when not in use. Some just look ridiculous and are an unprofessional looking distraction.\nI began to experiment with shapes and materials in searching for a solution that worked better. I wanted something that above all, created nice light. It also needed to be fast and easy to get on and off my flash, wouldn't weigh it down, didn't cost a lot, and was durable. And, if I needed to take it off momentarily or when I was done using it, I didn't want it taking up a lot of room in my pocket or camera bag.\nAfter lots of thinking, drawing, making prototypes, and finally finding the perfect material (a tough, translucent thermoplastic) I had a refined design that was simple, straightforward , and effective... the FlashPipe.  I also learned a lot from the previous Kickstarter launch and received great advice from several people.  As a result I went back to the drawing board and made improvements that I believe now perfect it.\nStudio Test: ambient, direct flash, bounce, competitor GF, competitor STO, FlashPipe. All same settings, no retouching.\nOriginally FlashPipe was offered in two versions: The Convertible and The Wedge.  But the Convertible could also do the job of the Wedge (permanently open top design) so why have both?  Having two designs was confusing people, so it just makes sense to simplify the product line.  Also, I found that by shortening the length of the body by one inch it not only looked better aesthetically, but it performed more efficiently.  Less light was being \"wasted\" vertically.  \nThe FlashPipe has a flap on top that can be fully opened or closed or left at an angle in-between. This gives the photographer the option of converting from completely diffused light or using the ceiling by completely opening the top, or opening partially and letting the flap give some forward bounce.  An improvement over the first design is the top flap is now larger.  It now extends past the sides and front wall slightly, so when it's closed there's no way raw light can leak out the opening.  This was an important modification for using the FlashPipe in the 90\u00ba tilted forward mode.  When pointed ahead instead of up, the larger flap completely shields the subject from stray light. This comes in handy when doing close proximity shots.  Picture the flash head pointed forward so you can illuminate a small object like a slice of wedding cake or macro insect photo without any harsh light coming out of the edges of the top opening and you'll see the benefit.\nColor Temperature Test against 18% grey wall. Left: competitor GF, Center: competitor STO, Right: FlashPipe. Model is about 12\" from wall. All settings the same. I prefer the slightly warmer look of the left and right photos.\nThey'll come cut and pre-folded to the right size for your particular flash model. Hook and Loop fasteners keep FlashPipe together and allow for slight adjustments in fit.  FlashPipe is designed to fit snugly, but you may want to make refinements and the ability to alter the diameter also allows it to fit other brands and models as well as the Nikon and Canon models they're designed for. Pictured below are the special silicon rubber headbands that keep FlashPipe on your flash.  Keep reading about the wristbands too...\nThese are the silicon rubber \"headbands\" that go over the head of your flash and under the FlashPipe to hold it firmly in place.\nYou slip the grippy clear silicon rubber band around the head of your flash and slide the FlashPipe over it.  That's all it takes!  The resistance between the two materials holds it snugly in place. It stays put, but it's easy to remove when you want to.  Slides on, slides off.  Simple, huh? \nThe headbands aren't ordinary rubber bands, they're made out of an expensive silicon rubber compound.  They're very tough and won't lose their shape and elasticity over time the way regular rubber bands do.  Plus, they have a QR code that can be scanned if you ever need to contact us for anything. \nThe FlashPipe wristband. Join the revolution! Read more about the wristband's other function below...\nThe FlashPipe wristbands were created for fun and as a way to spread the word, but they also serve another function: emergency back-up.  FlashPipe is designed to fit snugly so it stays in place and doesn't wobble when being used.  That's why it will be offered in different diameters for different flash models for a custom fit.  As mentioned earlier, the two current sizes fit the most popular models for both Canon's and Nikon's smaller and larger bounce flashes, as well as a few other brands that happen to share the same outside measurements.  The tolerance is tight and the silicon headbands are thin enough to fit in the tight space between the walls of the FlashPipe and the head of the flash.  But the wristbands are thicker.  They aren't as stretchy or grippy, but they're silicon rubber, too.  In a pinch the wristband can be used as a headband if you were to misplace yours.  You'd have to loosen the FlashPipe's fit slightly by using the hook and loop closures.  And here's the other benefit: if you own both sizes of a flash (a Nikon SB700 and an SB910, for example) the extra thickness of the wristband will allow the regular sized FlashPipe to fit on a smaller sized flash.  It's not going to be a perfect fit, but it works and could save you in a pinch.  Say you're at an event and your flash craps out on you.  You find (beg, borrow, steal) a replacement flash to finish the job, but it's the smaller model or a different brand.  The wristband could be your ace-in-the-hole.  And you thought is was just a fashion accessory!\nThe price? Very affordable and competitive. In fact, it's much less than almost all the other diffusers out there and FlashPipe is the better solution I think. The goal is to sell them for $24.95. At that price point, it's way less than most of the competing products that start at $35 and go past $70.  It's a great value for a lightweight, foldable, durable, nice looking diffuser.\nUp to this point it's all been completely self-funded. I've spent several thousand dollars on legal fees filing for patent protection and getting incorporated, making prototypes, purchasing the domain name (I had to buy FlashPipe.com at a premium price), designing and purchasing packaging materials, and prepping for Kickstarter.  I'm about tapped out.  I still need to fund the first production run and get packaging inserts.  This is why I need at least $5000.  With that I can get tooling dies made, produce the first one thousand FlashPipes in both sizes, and have packaging printed.  Quantities below these amounts are cost prohibitive.  This is the largest expense and where I could really use your help.\nMy desire is to keep the selling price as low as possible, but I can only do that if I get large quantities manufactured and if I sell them directly from a FlashPipe e-commerce website.  If I market them through retail camera stores it may require a much higher price point in order to pay the middlemen along the way.  It was suggested to me by an expert that it might need to retail at around $40 to be feasible.  I really don't want it to be that expensive.  I believe it's worth that price for all the benefits FlashPipe offers, but I want it to be an incredible value.  It's also important to me that FlashPipe be made here in America.  If I have to bring in sales reps and distributors in order to get access to retail stores, then more people take a cut and you have to shave more and more off of the manufacturing cost.  That invariably means producing it in Asia.  I want to buck that trend and prove things can still be made here and made well.  Direct selling would be the solution.\nIf we reach the goal, there will be just enough to get the first production run made and get packaging printed.  If we exceed the funding goal by enough we'll have the means to get a storefront professionally designed and be able to purchase advertising in the right places.  That way FlashPipe could be sold exclusively over the web and allow for a lower final price.\nIt's so close to happening, and finally everything has been tweaked.  It's an even better product than before, the packaging is streamlined, and now we have some great examples photos. This is where you come in and I honestly can't do it without you.  It's ready to go once the funding goal it reached and they can be rolling off the production line in about 4 weeks. Thank you so very much for your support!\n*FlashPipe uses recycled materials as much as possible for all components, including the shipping materials, and everything is recyclable. Packaging is simple and minimal.  The FlashPipe design is efficient in it's use of materials and durable, offering a long service life.  It will be made here, printed here, and assembled here in the USA.\nHere's a previous video describing the material used for FlashPipe and some other information.  Now it comes pre-assembled and this greatly reduces the size of the packaging.

Pick one of the cool built-in effects like Rainbow, Strobe, or Mood. Or, something more dramatic like Fire, Lightning Storm and Cannon shots. It is all there and more...\nWith the Kick and the Kick App you can also sample light effects from any video stored on your iPhone. Or simply sample light straight from the iPhone camera, while you use it. Just point the iPhone towards the light effect you want the Kick to recreate, tap the screen - and the Kick will emit that light!  It's automatically stored in the effects library for use later on. If you haven't already watched the video at the top of this page, you should do it now. The video demos some cool effects.\nSimple light for photo or video\nAt it's most basic the Kick can emit straight white light, when you just need a little extra light. Then it allows you to adjust the color temperature \u2013 how warm or cold the light looks. A little warmth can do wonders for skin tones as the image below demonstrates\nFancy colors\nIn addition to white, you have access to all the colors of the rainbow and any color in between. Via the App's color picker you choose the color you want and the Kick will emit the light instantly.  You can even create animated colors from static images by swiping your finger across the image and the app will record that as a stream and send it to the light... recreate the effect of clouds rolling across a summer sky by dragging your finger across a yellow & dark grey image!\nWorks with your iPhone ...\nThe free Kick App gives you full control over the Kick. Change color and brightness, run any of the built-in light effects and take pictures or record video. All from within the same app. \n... or any other camera device\nJust to be clear: you can use the Kick with any camera \u2013 it is not only for smartphones. If you prefer to use your DSLR or compact camera, you can use the Kick standalone \u2013 as an independent light source with amazing creative features. Your iPhone then works as a remote control for one or more Kick lights.\nSampling of light and effects\nWith the Kick and the App you can create your own light effects by sampling light from any video, or directly from the iPhone camera itself \u2013 even while you are using it.\nThis is how it works: From within the App you can open and run any video. Move the cursor over the light effect you want to sample and it will stream it directly to the Kick. Thus, you can recreate candle flicker without lighting any candles, simulate the glow from a television screen without one to hand. The possibilities are endless.\nWould you like the Kick to enhance the natural light, or light up your subject from a different angle? Kick can stream light directly from your iPhone camera, while you use it. Just point your camera and tap the screen. And the Kick will emit that light.\nIt is like sampling audio, except you sample light!  The ability to capture a stream of light from a video or create a stream from a picture has us really excited.  We can't wait to see the creative uses people put it to.\nTake it everywhere\nThe Kick is small, about the size of an iPhone. It does not weigh much either. Kick is easy to take along, and you will always have a bit of extra light handy.\nWhere are we at?\nThe Kick is a real working prototype. Over the last 2.5 years we have developed, refined, miniaturized, and then developed, refined, and miniaturized some more. And then some. I believe we are at the 6th iteration. What started out as a professional effects light has been shrunk in size and in cost \u2013 but not so much in features \u2013 to an awesome pocket-sized light with a lot of built-in features.\nWe are about ready to enter into manufacturing, but we need your help to fund production tooling and volume component orders. The only way to make the Kick a reality at this price is to manufacture it in volume.\nWhat is the difference between the Kick Basic and the Kick Plus?\nThe full version of the Kick \u2013 Kick Plus \u2013 has everything: built-in WiFi, white and colored light, built-in effects, and you can control it from your iPhone using the Kick App.\nThe Kick Basic is the little brother of Kick Plus and it is great for people who just want a small and simple portable white light. It does not have WiFi, but you can adjust brightness and color temperature with buttons on the device. With Kick Basic you don't get colored light, or animated effects, and since there is no WiFi, it can't be controlled from the iPhone app.\nRewards\n$89 Kick Basic EARLY BIRD.

Instead of playing a puny mortal building a city or closing gates to save the world, you play one of the Great Old Ones, seeking to tear down the city, open gates, and destroy the world.\nAs an Old One, you have mutable traits reflected by Providence cards. So Hastur begins as The King In Yellow, but as the game progresses he could gain Flabby Claws and Membranous Wings. When you begin the game, your primary resources are your cultists, who keep you anchored to the world; however, certain actions call on you to sacrifice your cultists, and you can beat up other Old Ones to steal their cultists. Should you lose your last cultist, you will be banished until you can build up enough followers to return. \nThe second resource in the game are houses. As you move around Atlantic City, you destroy houses. The power you gain in this process allows you to perform the rituals known as Chants. When you destroy the last house on a space, you open up a gate on it. Gates add additional movement options and also grant their owner an additional power (though using this power requires the sacrifice of houses or cultists). Beyond this, opening gates is the key to victory. When you open your sixth gate, you win the game.\nImage is of a prototype board and does not represent quality of final product.\nHowever, every Old One also has a unique path to victory: Their doom. This is a strategic shortcut you can take that gives you a reason to use specific tactics in your choice of Providence and Chants cards, and something that adds replay value to the game. So there are houses on Boardwalk - but your goal is to destroy them, open a gate to Yuggoth, and ultimately to pull off the Ultimate Sacrifice.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $55,000 HAS BEEN HIT!\nCthulhu without the Necronomicon is like Boardwalk without a hotel. Our first stretch goal solves both of these problems by adding hotels into the game. Hotels are more difficult to destroy than houses, but destroying a hotel carries a considerable reward: a tome. These books hold secrets no mortal was meant to know, and they enhance the power of your existing gates. What terrible truths will you unearth from the ruins of Park Place?\n\nThe Shadow over Boardwalk goal went into effect when we reached $55,000. The components of the base game have been expanded to include 8 wooden hotels and 16 tomes.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $75k HAS BEEN HIT\nFor our next trick we announce The Gate and The Key, a stretch goal for $75,000.

I've attempted to respond to every email and have gotten through most of them but will continue to reply. This morning, after reading the comments about reporting me to the Oregon Department of Justice, I contacted them and explained the situation in great detail. While they gave no promises their agent didn't feel that I'd committed any fraud. I am going to provide them with more information and work with them to see what I need to do to make this right in their eyes. I will also be contacting any other agencies who receive reports in order to provide them with a transparent view of the scenario from all angles. This project has been a year of frustration on every level.

no label, no rules, no fuss, no muss. just us, the music, and the art. i'm also making sure EVERY PRODUCT sold through this kickstarter is unique to this campaign, to reward all of you who KNEW ME WHEN and were willing to support me from Day One.\n\nhere we go, yo:\n**ALL SHIPPING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN EVERY PACKAGE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE!**please bear this in mind when you look at the prices. it was easier to do things this way, but it also means, in the spirit of art-in-the-mail-democracy, that those of you living in new york might be paying a little bit more to cover the shipping to the people in, say, tibet. \n\nwhile i can't force you to listen to it on a certain type of media, at a certain time of day, with a special pair of headphones, with a certain flavor of incense burning while you consume a very specific whiskey...i CAN make sure that what you get in your mailbox containing said music is as badass, fancy, and gorgeous as possible. i'll be damned if i don't at least PRESENT it to you in as fancy a way as possible.\n\nyou can get a digital download for as little as A DOLLAR.\nbut, should you wish to HOLD a copy of my album\u2026\n\u2022 both the COMPACT DISC and VINYL will be limited edition \"kickstarter-backer\" editions, never to be made again.\n\u2022 the COMPACT DISC will be in a beautiful hard-bound case and include an art booklet.\n\u2022 the VINYL will be a black 180 gram double-record set, and come in a gorgeously packaged case with extensive large-format art. you will freak.\n\nover THIRTY artists have been slaving away for the past few months to make art (over 70 images so far!) for this album, and the results are STUNNING. here's a sneak peak at a FEW:\n\nALL of the art will be printed in a beautifully bound ART BOOK. the artists include some of my long-time collaborators, like Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, Molly Crabapple, Kyle Cassidy in collaboration Neil Gaiman, Zea Barker, and my favorite 7-year-old draw-er on Twitter, @GavinLovesAFP. I also reached out to some new artists I've never worked with, like the german sculptor Heide Hatry, brooklyn writer/artist Tao Lin, and many others. but best of all I talked some of my musician friends (like DJ spooky, kristin hersh from throwing muses, conrad keely from \u2026trail of dead, and one of my songwriting HEROES robyn hitchcock) into making art which you'll be able to see:\n\u2022 in a hard-bound ART BOOK (similar to the \"Who Killed Amanda Palmer\" book) which will contain the art, photos, lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks at some of the artist's creations, and much more\n\u2022 LIVE and IN PERSON on our ART SHOW TOUR June-August (we'll be hitting Berlin, London, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston)\n\nthis is a package i dreamed up for people who like to get SHIT IN THE MAIL, CONSTANTLY. when i was a teenager i used to love 7\"-of-the-month-clubs, punk rock style, and fanzines that would arrive with weird ziploc bags full of crap in them. if you're a freak for surprises...this is the package for you. over the course of the summer, you'll get a series of 5 packages (sent every few weeks starting in july). the final package will include the deluxe backer-edition of the album, and packages 1-4 are going to be limited edition 7\" vinyl that feature some of the amazing album artwork. and with your 7\" singles, i'll also include an ARTS&CRAFTS SURPRISE. i wanted to stay away from things like shirts and posters and crap...i wanted to make things for you to DO, and MAKE, and SHARE back at me. i'm really proud of the bizarre things we thought up for this. the shipping of multiple packages all summer long is going to cost us a lot, and that's reflected in the price.\n\"BUT ((SAD FACE)) I DON'T HAVE A TURNTABLE....\"\nTHEN BUY ONE FROM US. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.\nVINYL IS BACK. we're going to buy and decorate some really high-quality Crosley USB-turntables and include them in higher-priced packages JUST FOR THIS REASON.\nat some point this summer Cassandra Long (who also happens to be my housemate), Meghan Howland, and a few of the other Album Artists are going to have a massive 2-day party in boston during which we get together and paint all these turntables for you. your excuse not to buy vinyl IS GONE! POOF!\n\n\nlast july, I started randomly drawing people who tweeted black and white photos of themselves to me...with a sharpie of course, because I always have one on my person, because THAT is the secret to being a successful musician. I love to draw these in quiet moments on the road or at home before the mayhem of the day starts. I figured I would extend the offer to be a sharpie-rendition of ANYTHING you send - it doesn't have to be you...it could be a loved one, a lost one, a place, a favorite mug...go crazy. we'll pack it up really nicely and send it to you right along with all the music & art book stuffs. here are some that i've done in the past (for twitter-folk @sermoiii and @SDuPreeBemis):\n\ni'll have neil explain this one, because he writes gooder than me. please be amused at the fact he is, therefore, referring to himself in the third person:\n\n\"To make art for 'The Bed Song', Neil wrote a script, as if Neil were making a script for a five panel graphic novel, and gave it to Kyle. Kyle and Neil talked, emailed, Kyle took photos, and the final sequence of five shots that made 'The Bed Song' art was created.\nWhich left us with a lot of amazing photos of people in beds that we didn't use. And we wanted people to see them. So we are making a limited edition book, with writing by Neil and photographs by Kyle and lyrics by Amanda. Unless you are one of the models in the beds, Neil, Kyle or Amanda, this Kickstarter will probably be the only way you can get one, I'm afraid. There will be a limited, signed, numbered edition of 666 copies, with a very small number of additional unnumbered artists proofs.\nWarning. The book contains naked people, naked emotions and unmade beds.\"\n\nTO KICK OFF THIS YEAR OF MADNESS, in which we'll be touring ALL OVER THE WORLD, we're going to unveil the new material and the original large-format album art/paintings LIVE in six select cities: BOSTON, NEW YORK, LA, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON and BERLIN. in every city, we've PARTNERED with a local ART GALLERY or EVENT SPACE, where we'll hang the art on beautiful walls for y'all to come and admire in person. then we'll have a special kick-off ART OPENING just for kickstarter supporters who back the event. we'll load you down with odd gifts, hugs, and drinks (if you're of age...if not, root beer throwdown) & the band will play a special acoustic set in the Art Space. we're keeping these openings limited to about 100-150, even in spaces where we could fit more people. one of my favorite things about this is that i'll get to MEET you guys in person, and thank you for your backing with a kiss. i'm hoping that our night together, among the art, making acoustic music with the band and sharing wine, will be totally fucking magical & unforgettable.\n\nin each city, we'll ALSO be playing a SMALL plugged-in rock show. the rock shows are open to the general public and have almost all sold out, but the art show kickstarter backers will have guaranteed guest-list to those performances, as well. the tickets to these smaller rock shows will be HARD to get, so backing in your city is a surefire way to know you'll get in.\n\n\neven though we've assembled a tasty variety of backer rewards - $1 all the up to $10,000 - i also know that there are some of you you are HELLA RICH and who would like to put more money towards the project. i know because...i've been asked. SO: for you more invest-y types, i am proud to announce THE LOANSPARK COLLECTIVE.\n\nwith LOANSPARK, i'm not asking for donations; i'm asking for people to step forward as high-level patrons and help out with interest-free loans that will be fully paid back after the album is cranked out and earning money. in exchange for your high-rolling loan, i will make some very special art and/or do a performance to support a charity you're passionate about. it's a slightly mad idea, but if it works, we may be onto a new form of patronage that could work for other artists...so i'm very happy to take a crack at it.\n\nall the info is up on the LOANSPARK WEBSITE, which we've launched in conjunction with this project:\n_________\n\nand that my dear comrades, is it.\n\nWE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.\nthank you, thank you, thank you.\nLOVE,\namanda\nfucking\npalmer\n\namandapalmer.net | @amandapalmer\np.s. a random note about the video: i DID pick up all those fucking signs i'd drawn. i did not leave them in the street in melbourne. we'll figure out what to do with them later...by the time we finished shooting (we did 2 takes), most of the cards had been run over by a car or a bicycle.\n\nBand photos and KS video by Jim Batt | @battsignal\nCollage of the ART (from l-r, top to bottom): Kyle Cassidy, Tony Albert, Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, David Mack, and Tony Albert\nAFP/Keytar photo by Andrius Lipsys\nAdditional images/editing/maintenance by Sean Francis | @indeciSEAN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "heya, it's been a minute. long catch-up letter...& i've got a new album", "update_content": "hola everybody!!!\nGreetings from upstate new york. i\u2019ve missed you.\nthis is an email to my long-lost, wonderful 24,883 ttheatre Is evil\u201d kickstarter backers. long time, no see\u2026.\nTL;DR: i am using patronage now. it is awesome & has changed m life. have a new record out. my patrons get tour ticket access for TWO MORE DAYS, & the cool merch. if you still want to help me make art, join at https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer for as little as $1/month."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "\"the bed song book\" is not imaginary, it's coming!!

Art work; sound; FAQ updated\nGame features:\nCombination of a role playing game and a strategy in right  proportion that can be called a Knight-Errant Simulator.\nTurn based tactical battles where we managed to get rid of the main enemy of turn based battles \u2013 lack of dynamics. There is no moving without striking and every move there is a choice whom to attack and whom to defend. Often an entire battle outcome depends on a decision which makes a battle intense from beginning to end.\nThere are many units with upgrade trees. Each unit can be personalized both with an upgrade as well as with equipment which provides a wide variety of army tuning.\nThere are a lot of weapons and battle spells. Each kind of weapons has its unique features that makes you to utilize it well in a battle.\nPossibility to conquer castles to increase your power and strengthen your army. Obviously, it is not enough just to occupy castles \u2013 they need to be protected from aggressive neighbors.\nThere will be a campaign and some additional missions. In the future we plan to release campaign editor so each player can create his or her own adventure.\nAnd the setting of our game is something we would like to address separately. We feel that all these similar looking fantasy worlds with dragons, necromancers and ancient gods became tiring for many players. The world of Eisenwald is not a fantasy, rather, it's a world with supernatural elements where many medieval superstitions are actually true. There is divination and alchemy but without fireballs and summoning elementals. There are some magical creatures but they are not the lovely elves. Heroes of our legends are not saving the world and are not participating in the wars between gods. Rather, they are directed by human motivations: by a desire to find glory (and wealth), by blood feud, revenge and even by unrequited love. And no, a night walk in a forest is not advisable, especially during full moon.\n\nA Limited Box Edition on two discs, including Legends of Eisenwald, Discord Times Collector's Edition, digital art book, and the soundtrack on a separate disc. It also includes a booklet.\nOur Poster will be signed by our team and our artist, Pavel Romanov. He didn't finish the work on the poster yet but you can see his sketch of this poster in our Update #5.\nThe white metal Knight's Badge will be be about 4 inches tall. This is how it might look like (the actual badge will look different, it will resemble the in-game badge).\nThe leather hand made Pouch will look similar to this picture (the actual pouch will look different).\nThe replica steel Sword will be come with a leather sheath. This is how it might look like (the actual sword will look different, it is not a weapon).\nWe started the development of our game more than 2 years ago. Right now the technical aspects of gameplay, battle AI and most other parts of the game are about 90% finished. We have an alpha version.\nBut as it often happens in game development industry working on the game took more time as we planned and we need more funds.\nYour generous backing will help us to walk the remaining part of the path. To finish our game in \u201cbasic package\u201d we need $50000. It will be enough for:\nTo create and program most of the campaign scenarios (levels);\nTo complete all planned content (battle arenas, characters, artifacts and different items).\nIt will be Windows only in English and Russian.\nWith additional funding we will be able to:\nAdd more to the campaign scenarios, making them more interesting and non-linear;\nAdd more units (at minimum, plus the number of the corresponding rewards);\nCreate beautiful special effects for spells in battles;\nLocalize our game with more languages;\nMake our game richer and more diverse (add unique bosses and characters, create alternate levels and endings etc.);\nPort our game to MacOS and Linux and release it with PC version together if we reach $100000. If not, we will port it anyway to these platforms but at a later date.\nWe are a small team of enthusiastic and dedicated professionals with love for strategy role playing games. We love what we do and as you can see we dip into it fully :) \nOur independent video games development company was founded in 2002. Our first game Discord Times was released in 2004. Thanks to an original and rather challenging gameplay it found many devoted fans. \nFor many years they asked us for a sequel to Discord Times. In the beginning of 2009 we started discussing and planning our new game, and in 2010 we started to work on Legends of Eisenwald. Dmitry Goncharov who used to work as lead animator for Wargaming.net and Ressa Schwarzwald joined our team. \nSeveral words about beta test:\nIt will be in English and Russian only.\nIt\u2019s possible that beta test will be done through an online distribution service like Steam.\nSystem requirements:\nWindows (XP/Vista/7)\nProcessor: 2GHz\nMemory: 2GB\nGraphics: DirectX 9.0, shader model 3.0\nMinimal resolution: 1280 x 768\nEnormous thank you from the bottom of our hearts\nWe are honored and privileged to be in this position to present our work here at Kickstarter.

And if you manage to defeat him, you will get a new achievement that we added as well.

Here >>\nGrab the HQ version Here >>\nJoin Operation Keep Hope Alive! >>\nVictor asks Top 10 questions: Watch Now >>\nBehind-the-scenes at mo-cap: Watch Now >>\nGarnett, Two Jeffs & Ryan chat: Listen Now >> \nAbout the game:\nYou receive a desperate phone call from Hope, a young woman trapped within a shadowy totalitarian state. Using a stolen phone, she calls and begs you to hack into the nation\u2019s surveillance system, assume control, and help her escape from the clutches of the omnipresent Overseer.\nDeveloped by industry veterans behind AAA games like Metal Gear Solid, Halo, F.E.A.R., Kinect,and cutting edge videos like the Skyrim television spot and the iconic iPod \u201csilhouette\u201d ads, R\u00e9publique represents a strategic alliance between Camouflaj and Logan to make an epic action game designed specifically for touch-based devices.\nOn October 31, Logan founder, Alexei Tylevich, and I wrestled with feedback we received from industry colleagues who told us that our ambitions were too big. They suggested we do something simple and small like so many other games on iOS... Alexei and I spent hours reviewing the production and financial risks. We discussed our belief that gamers will embrace iOS when more games are made for them. By sunset, we were even more committed to doing something different, big, and risky. \nHere are the goals we outlined with the teams:\nDesign a game and write a story for touch-based devices\nCreate an intense action game without a focus on killing\nFeature a believable, non-sexualized female lead\nExplore heavy topics, say something meaningful\nPush cutting-edge graphics on mobile\nOn Halloween night 2011, R\u00e9publique was born.\nWe immediately went to work on developing a gameplay system that drives the symbiotic relationship between Hope and the player. Our internal design pillar is \u201cHope is Alive,\u201d meaning Hope is not a marionette for the player to manipulate, but rather a smart, believable, and empathic hero.\nBooks like 1984 have served as key sources of inspiration not only for the narrative, but also the core gameplay. In R\u00e9publique, players become Big Brother: Hope\u2019s protector and growing threat to the Overseer\u2019s grip over his secret nation as players gain control of any network-enabled devices, introducing really cool puzzle scenarios. With the tap of a finger, players can power down lights, wiretap calls, summon elevators and \u2013 like a good big brother or big sister \u2013 protect Hope by slamming doors on her pursuers.\nHere are the specs Camouflaj and Logan are building to:\n4-6 hour campaign\n\"Stealth Survival\" hybrid genre\nMetroidvania exploration & 3D map mode\nBranching, gripping, pull-no-punches story\nFull voiceovers\nReal-time cinematics\nIn the event that we surpass our initial funding goal, every penny will go into building an even bigger game with features that you will help us define.\nThanks to the global proliferation of iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, hundreds of millions of people are now carrying a powerful gaming device with them every day. Finally, game makers can truly speak to a global audience, an audience that \u2013 thanks to touch controls \u2013 can easily jump into the interactive experience. \niOS is becoming a great gaming platform, but where are the games for people who love intense action and story-driven experiences? Where are the AAA games designed specifically for touch-based devices? As someone who loathes virtual joysticks, I have great respect for what Chair Entertainment did with Infinity Blade: they built an action game specifically for touch devices. We aim to do the same.\nWithout fail, every company we\u2019ve shown our game to has expressed sincere excitement about its creative ambitions. In unison they proclaim: \u201cYes! This is exactly the kind of game I want on my iPhone and iPad!\u201d But when it comes down to dollars and cents, the most consistent feedback we get is: \u201cYou have to prove that there\u2019s a market out there for this. And don\u2019t use Infinity Blade as an example unless you can guarantee your game will also be featured in an Apple national TV spot.\u201d\nIf you believe like I do that that there are millions out there who want more serious games on mobile, please support R\u00e9publique and send a message.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is that it allows us to have a a direct connection with the community and have a dialogue with them. Upon announcing R\u00e9publique for iOS, we received an incredible amount of buzz for the game. It also generated a lot of commentary on the chosen platform. We as a team are still committed to iOS, but now, thanks to the community's feedback, we are committed to delivering a unique version of R\u00e9publique specifically designed for PC and Mac with new features, gameplay and story elements that speak to the strengths of the platform. Look for a video update next week where the team at Camouflaj discusses the direction we will take the desktop version of R\u00e9publique!\nDigital platforms like Steam and the App Store are great, but there's something lacking with digital products. I miss the physical connection (and smell!) of game boxes, strategy guides, and maps. This is why I\u2019m excited to announce the R\u00c9PUBLIQUE JOURNAL, the physical half to the game experience. This high-quality book is a \u201creplica\u201d of the one Hope finds in the game: a musty-worn book passed between secret revolutionaries that features hand-drawn maps, writings from undercover dissenters, newspaper clippings from \u201cThe Outside,\u201d sketches of the Overseer\u2019s inner circle, and even a translation guide to the graffiti found in the world that may lead to hidden supply caches and audio tapes.\nThis pocket-sized book is the ultimate companion to the R\u00e9publique experience. While it's not required to finish the game and understand the story, we know players are going to love it.\nJust like the R\u00e9publique Journal, the Collector's Edition is being designed as a believable artifact from the game world. More specifically, the Collector's Edition features a hollowed-out copy of the Overseer's Manifesto that Hope uses to hide contraband items. Everything from the journal to the CD and DVD are designed to look exactly like they do in the world of R\u00e9publique.\nAnd continuing our theme of products hidden from a watchful eye, here is the concept we'll be using as we create our special iPhone case. Since phones and communications with The Outside are not only prohibited in the world of R\u00e9publique but can get you down right killed, some have chosen to take the risk and retrofitted the Overseer's Manifesto pocket edition into a case that snugly fits a contraband phone:\nThe design fits in with the fiction but also needs to be functional. I think we struck the perfect balance.\nWe estimate that R\u00e9publique will cost north of $1 million to complete. After months of meetings and due diligence, we believe that we can raise the necessary additional funds to complete R\u00e9publique from potential outside investors, but there is some risk that our efforts will be unsuccessful. Before we enter into any financial agreements, we want to prove through Kickstarter that there is a market for a serious AAA mobile game. While we may eventually have to share future profits from the game in order to finance development costs, we have no intention of sacrificing quality, creative control or IP ownership.\nIn the very happy event that we exceed our $500,000 Kickstarter goal, this will grant us more financial freedom and will allow us to build an even better game. We will also consider the idea of developing R\u00e9publique for other platforms, however this is not a decision we take lightly, as we firmly believe in developing our games to the strengths of each platform.\n-----------------\nI'm writing this just hours before this page goes live. The team is brimming with anticipation, as everyone is hopeful that there are thousands of others out there who want more AAA experiences on their iOS device. Are we right to assume that? We will all know very, very soon.\nThank you for coming along for the ride.\n-Ryan Payton\n@ryanpayton\nwww.facebook.com/camouflajLLC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "R\u00e9publique VR is Now on Steam!", "update_content": "Hello Loyal Backers!\nAs you may be aware, R\u00c9PUBLIQUE VR released on Oculus Go  back in 2018, and since then we\u2019ve brought our VR reiteration of the game to Oculus Quest & Oculus Rift.

It tells the legend of \u2018Grutte Pier\u2019 (Pier the Great), a folk hero who fought to free the land of our ancestors. Our goal is to create an authentic product that not only reflects the story of Grutte Pier, but also what living in the 16th century must have been like. All wrapped up in a stunning game experience.\n\nWhat is the game about?\nCross of the Dutchman is based on the folk legend of Pier Gerlofs Donia. He lived peacefully with his wife Rintsje in Kimswerd and he was destined to be a farmer. One day their village got plundered by saxon mercenaries. While he was trying to save the village from burning down, they caught Rintsje and killed her. In search for revenge he gathered an army around him and started fighting against the oppressors of Friesland. Soon his cause became a matter for all Frisian people, because he took it upon him to free Friesland. That\u2019s when he received his famous nickname \u2018Grutte Pier\u2019 (Pier the Great).\nHow will it play?\nThe game will have a 3rd person birds-eye perspective, similar to what you're seeing in the Animated GIF. You as the player will control \"Grutte Pier\" who will gather an army of soldiers (farmers) to aid him in his quest. The main goal is to liberate the towns and villages from the enemy oppressors who appear in about four different factions (even though the saxxons were the reason Pier went to battle, there were many small armies trying to get as much as they could back then). Each faction has a different level of hostility against Pier and his men, and different levels of hostility against each other. The result is an interesting game world where you have to watch where you're going, or who you're challenging.\nPier will start out as a humble farmer, but soon people will recognize his cause and start joining his group of warriors. We've created this group to be a flexible company, so soldiers will leave and join the group depending on which village travel through. They might stick around in the inns or brothels or they might get up from their chair and follow you to the next battle. As Piers' actions become known to the people, more soldiers will join the group, ultimately forming a formidable army.\nControls are kept clean and simple. Similar to games like Zelda, action is based on timing and reading the opponent's movements. However, there are several forms of attacks, and Pier is able to use the (destructable) environment as a weapon as well, throwing debris and objects at groups of enemies to knock them over. As the legend tells us, Pier was so strong he could lift a horse, Pier would not have a problem picking up something that would crush an opponent with ease. Your men won't get in your way, and are actually eager to start fighting themselves. The result is t hat once you encounter a group of enemies, the scene turns into a battlefield in no-time. Pier is still able to move around the battle field, \"helping out\" his men with his huge 6-foot sword. By using simple commands, Pier is able to focus his army on certain enemies to weaken or create diversions. \nWe plan to have pretty big battle scenes, and we've tested battles of over 200 soldiers at once without any problems. Battles in villages will likely be a lot smaller than this, but because the bodies of the victims remain out in the open until they are removed by the villagers, you will be able to \"enjoy\" your victory for quite some time after the battle is finished.\nWhat rewards are available?\nFirst of we appreciate everyone's pledge no matter which amount you choose. We offer a wide range of pledges which will all give you an equal valuable reward. When you're backing $25 or more, you're guaranteed to experience Cross of the Dutchman in all its glory as well as join us for the Beta to help us dot the i's and cross the t's.

If you're backing us for $25 or more, you're automatically invited to the beta.\nWhat platform are you developing for?\nThe game is being developed for PC and MAC.

However we would not have been able to make it to this stage if we had not received the public funding to help us in the first steps of the development. We are confident that the contents of our game will help grow awareness of cultural history to a new generation of students, not only in Friesland, but around the world!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Triangle Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nTriangle Studios is a small independent game development company founded in 2006 by Timen Rienstra and Remco de Rooij.

Live the simple life of a merchant, become a bounty hunter, take on work for hire, become a fearsome pirate, or simply explore the galaxy around you, the choice is yours.\n\nI am independent game developer Colin Walsh, creator of the critically-acclaimed iOS space shooter Red Nova, and Drifter is my take on the venerable space trading genre. Inspired by games I grew up playing like Frontier (itself the sequel to the grand-daddy of all space traders, Elite), and Privateer, I'm hoping to bring something fun and exciting to an under-served corner of the video game world.\n\nBecause a game like Drifter deserves more than just canned royalty free music, joining me is renowned video game composer Danny Baranowsky, who is known for his work on a number of awesome titles including Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, Canabalt, and Cave Story 3D.\nDrifter has been in development for about 8 months now. I'm planning to release it for iOS later this year, but I'd also love to bring it to PC and Mac. That's where Kickstarter comes in. With extra funding, not only will I be able to expand the game to those platforms, I'll be able to make it even better in the process. I'll bring in a 3D artist to help me create new assets and I'll be able to focus on adding more features to the game.\nThe Game\nDrifter, as I mentioned previously, is intended to be my own take on the \"space trading\" genre. Briefly, it is a single-player sandbox game that will allow you to fly a spaceship between thousands of different star systems in a procedurally-generated galaxy. The idea is to create an expansive future world filled with excitement, danger, and opportunities for you to explore and enjoy.\nThe game already features a massive procedurally-generated galaxy 100,000 light years across with over 10,000 star systems. As it takes shape over the next few months I plan on adding a ton of things for you to do.\nHere is an idea of some of the things you can expect in Drifter when it's released:\nA PC and Mac release simultaneous with the iOS release: assuming the Kickstarter campaign is succesful I'll have time to devote to giving the PC port the attention it deserves while I work on the game.\nA huge galaxy to explore: The game already contains a 100,000 light year wide galaxy with 10,000 stars. In addition to this there will be dozens of hand-shaped \"core worlds\" where most of the action will be happening.\nA responsive soundtrack: Not only do you get a great custom soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky, but the game will pick music appropriate for the situation at hand to give you an even deeper sense of immersion.\nMany things to see and do: An expansive marketplace where you can earn a living as a trader. Massive asteroid fields with valuable ore ripe for the taking. Procedurally generated missions you can take on, like: courier missions, convoy escorts, or attacks on enemy strongholds. Hunt NPC pirates in the more dangerous systems, or become one yourself.\nAn engaging story: There will be a series of hand-written missions which will help tell an interesting story set within the world of Drifter. The story will allow the player to further immerse themselves in the game and learn more about the different factions that inhabit this corner of the galaxy. While you can choose to ignore the story, you'll be able to earn equipment and ships, and explore certain systems that wouldn't otherwise be available.\nLots of customization: All ship hulls will feature customizable equipment slots. You can choose your weapons, armor and shields, as well as what sort of powerplant and support equipment you need for the task at hand as well as for your playstyle.\nImprove your character as you play: Much like in traditional RPGs your character will have a series of attributes you can improve as you play. This will give you bonuses to ship attributes as well as for different aspects of gameplay like trading, mining, and piracy.\nWho Are You?\nI am Colin Walsh, an independent video game developer living in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. I run Celsius Game Studios, which I founded in 2009 to realize my dream of running my own company making video games. Celsius is just me right now, but I hope that will be changing soon.\nPrior to working on Drifter for the past 8 months, I released the critically-acclaimed iOS space shooter Red Nova, which was a finalist in the 2010 Best App Ever Awards in 7 different categories, including Best App.\nCelsius Game Studios is also a client of The Genesis Centre, which is an incubator for technology companies run by Memorial University of Newfoundland. What this means is that I've had to go through an intense vetting process to prove to a selection board that I have what it takes to run a business. What I hope this means to you is that I'm very serious about making games and that Drifter is in good hands.\nWhy do you need this money?\nIn order to make Drifter an even better game than I could on my own I am hoping that by pre-selling copies of the game and these different backer rewards I'll be able to bring in enough money to hire, at the very least, a 3D artist to help work on assets for the game over the next few months. They'll help create things like new ships, space stations and other interesting background objects that will help bring the game to life and make it look that much better.\nHaving an artist on board means I won't have to make assets myself, which I have been able to do so far but it is a time-consuming process. This way I will be able to focus more of my time on programming and game design.\n\nAdditionally, a small portion of the money will go towards covering my expenses so I can continue to work on Drifter full time. This will keep the game release on track as I won't have to take on extra contract work.\nWhat happens if you get over-funded?\nIf this Kickstarter gets dramatically over-funded I already have plans in place to add one or two additional team members to Celsius Game Studios with the aim of streamlining the development of the game.\nBacker Rewards\nA breakdown of all the different rewards offered for supporting Drifter.\n\nThe Game - Pretty simple, a DRM free digital download of the game on PC or Mac when it is complete.\n\nEarly Beta Access - You'll get access to the game while it is still in beta should you want to. I will, however, save the story missions for after the beta so as to not spoil your enjoyment of them.\n\nThe Soundtrack - You'll get a digital download of the game's soundtrack when it's done.\n\nThe Poster - The Drifter poster is designed by illustrator Steve Courtney. It is 18\"x24\" and will be printed using archival quality paper and inks and will be suitable for framing. All posters printed for the Kickstarter will be individually numbered as well.\n\nThe Collector's Box - Harkening back to when games had boxes, games like Drifter is inspired by, this box will have a real printed manual, a fold-out galaxy map you can put on your wall, and a game disc with art designed by Steve Courtney.\nYour Name Included in the \"NPC List\" - There will be a pool of names that the game will use to generate names for NPCs you encounter in-game. Your name will be added to this list!\n\nSigned Poster - The normal poster signed by Danny and Colin.\n\n3D Printed Ship Model - Using 3D printing technology you'll get an awesome replica of the Drifter \"starter\" ship. It will be finished in grey primer. Also, while it might go without saying, these models are not intended to be toys and are for display purposes only (click here for more details on the material they will be constructed out of). There will be a large 6\" ship (pictured) which is included at $500 and above and a small 3\" ship (not pictured) which will be included in the $250 reward level.\nDrifter T-Shirt - All backers at $250 and above will automatically receive a t-shirt based on Steve Courtney's exceptional poster design. All other backers can add a t-shirt to their pledge by adding $30 ($35 outside the US and Canada) without changing their reward level. When the campaign is over there will be a place in the backer survey to specify the style and size of shirt you would like to receive.\nBecome a Drifter Legend - You'll be written into the game! Have a planet named after you, or a space station, or heck, an entire star system. Want to become the legendary space traveler who was lost never to be seen again? I'll work with you to add you to the game in an interesting way, within reason of course.\nWhat about Linux?\nI've been a huge supporter of Linux since the mid-90s and there is no technical reason that I can see why a Linux version of Drifter is not possible. Originally I was unsure if I could support Linux at launch and was hesitant about promising it as part of the Kickstarter. However, if the project meets its $100,000 stretch goal I will be able to put resources into making a Linux version possible at launch. Also, even if that goal is not met, I promise that I will work on Linux support after launch and all backers who receive a reward that includes a copy of the game will be able to get the game on Linux when it becomes available.\nInternational Friends\nThis information has been stolen shamelessly from The Banner Saga's Kickstarter page, as I think it's pretty darn useful. I hope they don't mind!\n\nIf you live in a country where you cannot donate directly to Kickstarter the current best option is to buy a prepaid amazon cash card and use that for your donation. You must add $1 more than the prize amount to make sure the donation goes through. This thread (a million thanks to Double Fine), offers the most comprehensive guide on how to do this.\nThank You\nThank you for having a look and I hope I can count on your support for Drifter. It's been a life-long dream of mine to run a video game company making games like this. Hopefully through the magic of Kickstarter I'll be able to keep doing what I love as well as get a running start on hiring some amazing talent on what promises to be an incredible journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 620, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celsiusgs/drifter-a-space-trading-game", "project_name": "Drifter: A Space Trading Game"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Pictures of limited edition Kickstarter Edition below!\nOnce the project has ended, you will get a questionnaire through Kickstarter to give your color choices and shipping address. \nRed is now in production and available in all reward levels! \nHi! I'm Eric, owner and maker at Corter Leather. Corter is a one-man company- I make every single piece by hand with no machines in my apartment studio. This Kickstarter campaign is to help fund the production of my first non-leather item that I designed called the Bottlehook. It's the first piece I'm not 100% making with my own two hands.\nThe Bottlehook is very simple; it's a beautiful key hook for your belt loop that also opens bottles, and includes a natural hand-stamped leather tab for your info in case it's left somewhere. It comes in a hand stamped gift box, and solves a whole slew of problems:\n-It's made in the USA. The hooks and split rings come from California, the solid copper O rings are each hand made in Montana, and the leather tabs come from my Boston shop. Then I assemble every one by hand. \n-It's cast out of steel for strength, then plated for looks. Because of this it's also very light, measuring 3\" tall, 1.5\" at it's widest point, and a little less than 1/4\" thick. No more replacing those chewed up aluminum bottle openers every 6 months. \n-There's a spot for your info, because once in a while we all open a few too many and forget to put our keys back on our belt loop. The natural veg tanned leather ages beautifully to a dark carmel color because it's not dyed or oiled. \n-There are no moving parts to break, which means you won't be locked out of the house like that time the spring on your carabiner broke and you lost all your keys. \n-It's a damn good bottle opener. I've had many bottle openers on my keychain, and they all lack something (looking at you, anodized-shark-jaw-opener). This is a full sized bottle opener with a handle big enough to get plenty of leverage. You don't need to fumble to find it on your ring either- just slide it off your belt loop or out of your pocket, pop your favorite drink, and slide it right back on. \n-It looks awesome.I wanted to design something that stood the test of time, so I turned to advertising key rings from the early 1900's for inspiration.  The plating and natural leather will patina over time, making it an heirloom quality piece. \n-It stays on great, as it's locked onto your belt loop by the bottle opener. I've worn an old belt loop key hook for over 6 years riding my bike around the city and never lost it. When I wore carabiners, I lost 2 in about a years time. \nFor this Kickstarter campaign, I've sourced some very rare green Shell Cordovan from Horween to provide a special limited reward. Shell Cordovan is known as one of the nicest leathers in the world, and it takes over 6 months to produce each 4 sq. ft. hide at Horween's factory in Chicago. You can use a wood burner or soldering iron to brand your info, or just admire the tab...Shell Cordovan is beautiful.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "The Albatross Brand", "update_content": "Hey Everyone!

I believe there are people watching and waiting to jump in and now is the time!  Remember high pledgers: you can always turn around and sell them.  Capitalism is alive.  :-)     Thanks everybody!\nNew Packaging Design Will Bring Down Manufacturing Cost!  Please be sure to read updates #10 and #11.  A redesign that involves less packaging will reduce the cost about 40%. \nNew incentives have been posted.  \nThanks for taking the time to check out my FlashPipe project.  This is something I've wanted to do for quite a while now and I'm excited as it finally starts to take shape.  I've been able to accomplish a lot of the preproduction on my own up to this point, and I've had some help from close friends. Thanks HancockMedia.net and thanks, Travis!  But now I need your assistance in getting it over the hump and letting the momentum take it the rest of the way.  I can't do it without you.\nI've been a professional photographer for about 30 years now.  And whenever I shoot events, or weddings, or editorial assignments, I find that sometimes I need to use on-camera flash.  I prefer natural lighting, but you don't always get that luxury.  When you do have to or chose to, it usually looks better to use soft, diffused lighting.  This is especially true when shooting people.  There have been a lot of products out there to accomplish this and I've tried several, but I've found that in one way or another they tend to be lacking.  Either they don't work effectively, they're bulky or awkward in use, difficult to mount, or they're just too expensive.  And most occupy too much space when not in use.  Some just look ridiculous and I wouldn't want one on my camera rig.  Appearance does count for something when you're around your clients.\nI began to experiment with shapes and materials in searching for a solution that worked better. I wanted something that above all, created nice light. It also needed to be fast and easy to get on and off my flash, wouldn't weigh it down, didn't cost a lot, and was durable.  And, if I needed to take it off momentarily or when I was done using it, I didn't want it taking up a lot of room in my pocket or camera bag.  \nAfter lots of thinking, drawing, making prototypes, and finally finding the perfect material (a tough, translucent thermoplastic) I had a refined design that was simple, straightforward , and effective... the FlashPipe.  Currently there are two versions:  the Wedge and the Convertible.  \n****Please check Update #7 on the Updates page for some sample photos....\nThe Wedge is an open top design that diffuses the light 360 degrees around the camera but allows for a \"wash\" to bounce off the ceiling in environments that allow you to do so.  Additionally, its frontal reflecting area reflects some light forward.  The open top also allows the Wedge to be used as a diffused \"snoot,\" throwing undifused light to illuminate far away objects in the frame when the head of the flash is tilted down 90 degrees.  This is useful, for instance, when you see someone across the room or at a podium and you want to light them, but not blast the foreground with harsh light.  You may need the strength of raw light to illuminate them at a distance, but don't wish to hit others who are in your frame (or not) with raw flash light.  After capturing that shot, tilt the head back up for normal diffusion.  Quick and easy.\nThe Convertible has a flap on top that can be fully opened or closed or left at an angle in-between. This gives the photographer the option of completely diffused light with no chance of raw light spilling anywhere. In environments that don't offer a light colored ceiling for bounce or when that's not desired, it's more practical to keep the FlashPipe closed. The flap can be opened completely to allow for ceiling wash when it is desired.  Or, it can be partially opened at a 45 degree angle giving a soft forward fill bounce while at the same time diffusing the light in all directions.  \nThey'll come already cut to the right size and shape for a particular flash model.  They're pre-scored for easy folding into the three dimensional shape they become.  Impressions in the material indicate where to place the hook and loop adhesive backed dots.  It's a simple process of defining the creases, placing the fasteners, and then folding the FlashPipe into shape.  Done!\nThen you just slip the grippy silicon rubber band around the head of your flash and slide the FlashPipe over it.  The resistance between the two materials holds it snugly in place.  It stays put, but it's easy to remove when you want to. Simple, huh?\nThe first production run will target Canon and Nikon owners since there's such a large base of existing users.  Two sizes will accommodate both company's most popular models.  Any brand flash within those dimensions can also use FlashPipe, of course.  And as demand calls for it, other sizes will be released. There are future designs that will be introduced later, once the project is up and running.  One imminent model already prototyped is a cylindrical version that will fit flashes with round reflector dishes such as the Quantum Q-flash or Norman and Lumedyne flashes.  There are several other ideas on the drawing board, too.  Stay tuned for more...\nPrice?  Very affordable and competitive.  In fact, it's much less than almost all the other diffusers out there and FlashPipe is the better solution, IMHO. Ok, not so humble. The goal is to sell them for $24.95 or less.  At that price, it's a no-brainer.  Currently a large portion of the cost is in printing and packaging. But at higher production volumes the economies of scale will kick in and should allow for a retail price that's a little less.  Even at a $25 price point, it's way less than competing products that start at $35 and go past $50.  It's a great value.\nUp to this point it's all been self-funded and I haven't had to sell a kidney. I've spent a small fortune filing for patent protection, making prototypes, purchasing the domain name (I got in a bidding war), designing packaging, and buying shipping supplies.  I'm about tapped out.  I still need to fund the first production run, which means getting tooling dies made and finalizing the manufacturing parameters. I need to get the packaging inserts printed, get help designing the website, and then complete the patent process.  (Just the U.S. patent alone will cost over $10,000 when all is said and done. And international patents will cost $30,000 to $40,000.)  Yikes! \nIt's so close to happening, but I need your help to get it across the finish line and make any last minute tweaks  This is where YOU come in and I can't do it without you.  Once the product is out there and selling, then I can use any profits to file for international patents and start selling it in Europe and Asia and elsewhere.  Right now I'm concentrating on the USA.  By the way, it's manufactured here and will employ fellow Americans. Printing is done here, as well.  We're using recycled materials as much as possible for all components, including the shipping materials, and everything is recyclable.  Packaging is simple and minimal.  FlashPipe itself is efficient in it's use of materials and durable, offering a long service life.  What's not to like?\nMy only other alternative funding method would be to get pregnant and sell the baby.  I don't want to be forced to to that.  And I'm a guy, so it might be really difficult.  So if the idea sounds interesting to you and you want to help, I would really, greatly appreciate your contribution.  It'd be cool if 10,000 people gave a buck, but I set a 30-day time frame and I don't know if it can attract that much attention that fast.  So, I've created several levels of participation with incentives along the way.  From an indebted and sincere thank you, to a nifty black silicon wristband with white lettering (soon to be the fashion accessory), to actual FlashPipe products.  Check it out and see what you feel you can do.  Thank you so very much for your time and your donation.  I'll keep you posted all along the way.  And remember: you could be saving a baby's life.\n*Just a note about contributors outside the USA.  I can ship anywhere as long as a postal person can reach you.  I thought I wouldn't be able to ship overseas due to patent filing complications, but I was mistaken.  I budgeted $5 apiece for shipping, so any amount over that to mail to anyone outside of the States would need to be collected from all you groovy international types.  Thanks!\nThanks, everybody!

S. Backer of the Biblio iPhone and iPad Combo.\nIf you're itching to stylishly transport that new iPad or maybe an iPhone or MacBook Air or Pro, check out the lovely \"Biblio\" handmade covers offered  by George Aye and David Hull. The sweetness is in the campaign video\"\u2014Gapersblock.com \nBookish Sensibilities\nBiblio is a new line of sleeves for the urban scholar, proudly designed and made in Chicago. Inspired by long-forgotten ribbon book bags, these handmade wool felt cases protect your precious belongings while making them readily accessible at a moments notice. \nWhen designing Biblio, we found our inspiration from a time when our modern day devices were not so modern\u2014when books were the latest mobile technology. Hence the name Biblio. But when we noticed that our ribbon pull tab could work for many different situations, we knew we could design a range of solutions for the modern-day, urban scholar. Biblio sleeves are the first products from our insight.\nSimply insert your book (or modern day equivalent) in Biblio and the ribbon pull tab gracefully retracts into the sleeve. When you're ready, simply pull on the ribbon pull tab for a smooth, quick presentation of your device. \nBiblio is available in a choice of ribbon colors: lime green, canary yellow, orange orange and stealth black. The felt sleeve always remains light grey (outer layer) and white (inner layer).\nKickstarter campaign\nBiblio is now available on Kickstarter with pre-sale pricing to help us launch the Biblio brand, with a modest target of $5000. \nYour support will help us pay for setting up manufacturing of Biblio in Chicago, ensuring a local investment in quality and craftsmanship. Post Kickstarter campaign, your support will help us create an e-commerce site and web-presence to get Biblio into more people's hands. Lastly, it will help us invest in future exploration of new product launches.   \nEach reward tier includes $5 for shipping within the US. Backers wishing to ship to Canada and other international locations, an additional $10-15 will be requested post campaign.\nDesign and manufacturing details\nBiblio sleeves are made from several components. The sleeve itself is made from a sandwich of two layers of 100% wool felt sourced with the outer layer from the USA (Michigan) and the inner layer from Germany. The nylon pull tab is made from a seat belt maker in the USA (Seattle). Each Biblio is hand made and machine stitched in Chicago. All design and prototyping was made in Chicago.\nAfter many rounds of prototyping and an open dialog with our local manufacturing partner, we feel confident that this project will be completed on time and your rewards will ship promptly.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nInspired by the hundreds of projects that designers have demonstrated on Kickstarter, we decided that the best way to give back to that inspirational well was by launching a campaign ourselves.\nAs strong believers in first-hand experiences, we set our expectations low but our ambitions high and set out to learn what it takes turn a conversation into a product. To go from a sketch to a paper prototype, to place an order for yards of fabric, to make production drawings, and then find and work with a master craftsman who could turn our ideas into a working prototype. And then finally go through the excitement of producing a kickass video. \nWe learnt tons: what it was like to work together, what it takes to launch a Kickstarter campaign and how to tell a simple story about design and manufacturing. Even though this is a simple product, the whole endeavor has taken about three times longer than expected, but easily three times more fun than we thought possible.\nAbout the designers\nGeorge Aye has designed products for over 12+ years and has been an entrepreneur since 2005 when he co-founded Hubwear, an apparel company for the urban traveler. Again with his wife in 2011, he co-founded Greater Good Studio an innovation consultancy that uses design methods to solve social problems. \nDavid Hull is currently completing his MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He brings with him 5 years of experience as an industrial designer. His work can be seen at David Hull Design.\nThank you,\nGeorge Aye + David Hull.\nIndividual product photography of Biblio\nBiblio for iPhone\nBiblio for iPad\nBiblio for MacBook Air 11\" and 13\", MacBook Pro 15\".

Read down to the stretch goals, and see Update 16, to see what's in the box! If you need more detailed lists of each reward level, see Update 26.\nOgre was the first game I ever designed. It came out in 1977! It\u2019s been out of print for years, except for the miniatures rules. I\u2019m constantly getting requests to bring it back, and in 2008 we started working on a new edition . . . a \u201cdesigner\u2019s edition\u201d that would be as big and beautiful as any wargame you\u2019ve ever seen.\nEven as planned right now, the game is huge. The current prototype weighs 14 pounds! There are three huge maps - one 17\" x 21\" Ogre map and two geomorphic two-sided G.E.V./Shockwave maps. The hexes are 1.5\" across, with counters to fit. And the Ogre and building counters are 3-D models made of heavy cardstock. There are already about 40 square feet of chipboard in this game.\nWe couldn\u2019t sell this for $100 if it weren\u2019t for the cash that Munchkin has brought in (thank you, Munchkin). But it\u2019s something I want to do.\nWhy are we using Kickstarter, when we had decided to do the project no matter what? Three reasons:\n- First, our margin on this game is low, so we had to be conservative in our plans. We couldn\u2019t put a 10-year supply in the warehouse. We were going to print only 3,000, which is the absolute minimum we were sure of selling in a year or so. There would probably not have been expansion sets, or even a reprint. Something that\u2019s expensive to do at 3,000 units is impossible at 1,000!\nBut with Kickstarter, we can reach a lot of people quickly, and gauge our support. If the initial print run can be bigger, fine! If the gamers show that they want an expansion set later, then I get to do it! (Edit: And they did. And I will!)\n- Second, because I got literally hundreds of requests to pre-order the game, and we don\u2019t do pre-orders. When we get our new shopping cart set up, sure . . . but that won\u2019t be any time soon. By using Kickstarter, we get a pre-order system automatically. And, because so many people said they wanted more than one copy, we\u2019re offering options for two and even three.\n- Third, because with Kickstarter we can have stretch goals, which will let us add more components and improve the ones that are already there. (Edit: And boy, oh, boy, did THAT work out well!)\nThe $200,000 stretch goal is the one that excites me the most, because that\u2019s the level where we can afford to turn the two two-sided maps into four one-sided maps. That doubles the potential play area. (Edit: DONE!)\nOur actual funding goal was low - only $20,000. We're long past that now!\nAnd some of the support levels are intended to let the gamers get into the game. Everybody who buys a game on Kickstarter will be acknowledged both on our website and on the box. At higher levels, you can put your initials on an Ogre, get painted into an illustration, or even get your own custom counter sheet. (Edit: Those have all been taken . . . sorry . . .)\nSo please support us. Help us show that classic wargames aren\u2019t dead. And remember the guys you played Ogre with in high school or college? Let them know so they can reserve a copy too. Spread the word!\nThank you. It means a lot to me to be able to do this, and with your help, I can.\n- Steve Jackson\nUPDATES!

It will come already punched out and packaged in its own box to protect it in travel.   (US free shipping, and see new International Shipping below.)\n* Tournament Ogre Package  \u2013 $50. Three extra of the orange Ogre map. Useful for stores and conventions that want to run several games at once, but you will want the Extra Counter Set, too. (Edit: Actually, there are now so many different counters in a single copy of Ogre that you could easily populate four basic-scenario maps at a time without buying extra counters, as long as you limit players to reasonably balanced forces.)

FOUR big maps \u2013 one of each of the FOUR big (G.E.V.-style) maps in the set.

You will be able to create a hex battlefield of the size not seen since the glory days of SPI and GDW.\n* Extra Copy of the Game  \u2013 $95. One more copy of Ogre. Only available if your basic support level includes just a single Ogre. This is provided at the request of (for instance) the people at the $200 Ogre-naming level, who wanted an extra copy of the game. Please don't order more than 2 of this extra, because we are limiting individual supporters to 3 each. US only, please.\nInternational Shipping Extras\nHere are three Extras, each representing a different-sized USPS Flat Rate box. Each gives two costs: one for Canada/Mexico, and the other for Everyplace Else. If you add one of these boxes as an Extra, that covers your shipping fees on whatever we can stuff into it. Some typical recipes will be listed under each Extra. If you order a box and no other Extras . . . well, please don\u2019t do that.\nWe will deliver this box to the USPS. It will go through your national customs and then, for good or ill, into the hands of your national postal system. This is \u201cUS Priority Mail.\"\nNote that a medium box is definitely bigger than two smalls, and a large is definitely bigger than a small and a medium, but two mediums are bigger than a large.\nBe sure to read the \u201csubstitutions\u201d note after the Large Box listing. Sorry this is so Byzantine. Maybe we\u2019ll find a way to make the next one better. In the meantime, do your best to calculate, and we\u2019ll do our best to hold up our end.\nInternational Shipping: Small Box\n         Canada/Mexico: $13. Everywhere else: $15. (You are not losing your mind; that number was $17 until it was pointed out that $17 represented an increase from the earlier rate for the smallest possible international \"extras\" order.) Untrackable and uninsurable. We will not send this size box to Brazil.\n         Can hold: One shirt plus a couple of dice sets or pins, OR five sets of dice or pins. Maybe more, but let\u2019s not promise more than five. This is a little box, so a counter sheet will not fit at all.\nNOTE: If you order a game from outside the US, and the only extras you order are pins, dice, and the Ogre Supporter T-shirt, and we can get your stuff into a Small flat rate box, shipping is FREE. The extras do have to be a separate shipment; we can\u2019t get them into the carton with the game, but we won\u2019t charge for that shipment.\nInternational Shipping: Medium Box (shipping prices now reduced)\n         Canada/Mexico: $23. Everywhere else: $38. Trackable (if the USPS employees enter the info) and insured \u201cup to $100\u201d by the USPS (with some weasel words, and some online comments indicate that collecting a claim is not always easy). Here\u2019s their info page: https://www.usps.com/business/priority-mail-international-flat-rate-for-business.htm\n         Can hold: One Giant Battlefield Set or Tournament Ogre Package plus 4 shirts and a couple of dice or pin sets, OR seven shirts plus a dice or pin set.\nInternational Shipping: Large Box (shipping prices now reduced)\n         Canada/Mexico: $30. Everywhere else: $51. See tracking and insurance notes for the medium box.\n         Can hold: Two sets of maps (Giant Battlefield Set or Tournament Ogre Package) plus five shirts, OR one set of maps and six shirts, OR 12 shirts.\n         OR this box can hold a single Ogre Canvas Bag, 2 shirts, and a few patches.\nSubstitutions in Medium/Large Boxes (much updated)\n         We hope these are conservative estimates:\n      We are now willing to say that one Extra Counter Set, including the Kickstarter extra counters, can replace one set of maps.\n         A classic counter set would replace one shirt, perhaps leaving a bit of slack.\n         Extra Kickstarter counter sheets are skinny, so figure that three of them would replace one shirt. Luckily, we have three to offer.\n      A couple of dice or pin sets would replace one shirt.\n      A woodkit set would replace two shirts.\n     Four shotglasses would replace a shirt. Fewer than four should also be treated as replacing a shirt, to be safe.\n    A hat would replace a shirt.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$40,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  Build your own Ogres! We have posted blank 3-D designs online for the Mk III and Mk V, so you can cut out, color, and assemble your own, assuming you have the right tools and/or inhuman patience. Here's the PDF with line art, here's the completely blank \"platform toy\" version, and here's the \u201cHow To Build An Ogre\u201d video. Send us pictures of what you do! ogrepix.sjgames.com\n$75,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Thanks to everyone who voted in the survey to choose the contents of this sheet. Another bonus! We will create a big Exclusive Kickstarter Counter Sheet and add it FREE to every Ogre game ordered through Kickstarter. A double chipboard sheet (about 10\" x 16\") of 3-D counters, including a lot more buildings and one each Ogre Mk III and Mk V with graphics exclusive to Kickstarter supporters. The survey decided: The buildings will include a nuclear reactor and a lot of other things to shoot at, and the Ogres will be green. We call this sheet \"Targets Go Boom!\"\n$90,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Steve started working on the new scenarios last night . . . Four new Ogre scenarios designed by Steve Jackson will be posted to the SJ Games website: one each week during the month of November (the game\u2019s release month). At least one of these will play off of something new introduced on the $75K counter sheet.\n$100,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! A bonus for everyone! We will include the Ogre blueprint poster in every copy of the game, and we\u2019ll announce at least one more stretch goal.\n$110,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Targets for your homemade Ogres! We'll post blank 3-D outlines for the Command Post, Laser, and Laser Tower, so your custom Ogres can have custom targets. And here they are. With line art: http://sjgames.com/ogre/img/ogre-pob-lineart.pdf. Without line art: http://sjgames.com/ogre/img/ogre-pob-noart.pdf.\n$120,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! We'll post some pictures of acrylic vs. urea so you can see the difference you made. At this level, the game dice get much nicer for everyone. Instead of using the standard die material, urea (which is available in only a few standard colors), we will order a mold suitable for acrylic dice. This will increase our die cost, but we will be able to create the dice in many more (and cooler) colors, forever.\n$130,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! You have totally proved to everyone that Steve can spend more time on Ogre. Steve is happy! Four more Ogre scenarios by Steve Jackson will be posted during December 2012.\n$140,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! And Steve was up late last night drawing overlays in his head. Now to find some paper . . . At this level, your game gets heavier (again). A new full-sized (not the 8\" x 10\" we first offered at this level) sheet of terrain overlays will be created and added FREE to every copy of Ogre.\n$150,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Now Phil has to schedule that container! Your support has earned you an early release for YOUR copies. At this point, we will have enough Kickstarter copies to fill a 40-foot container. So . . . that container will be the first one shipped out, and Kickstarter copies will start shipping two weeks before the regular release date.\n$175,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  Phil, go to China, please, and talk to the factory! You have made the dice bigger as well as shinier. Instead of the standard 16mm dice in the original budget, we\u2019ll go up to 19mm. And, of course, they\u2019ll still be acrylic.\n$200,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Now we need to figure out what that did to box weight! You have made the game MUCH better for everyone! Instead of two double-sided maps, every copy of the game will include four single-sided maps. You will be able to use all four maps in a single game if you want to! Yes, print costs just went up a lot, but so did the awesomeness of the game, and your support made that possible.\n$250,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! This is the level at which we use two containers! One 20-ft and one 40-ft container of games will come to Austin . . . and these will ship one month earlier than the distribution copies.\n$300,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! We are now committed to releasing an Ogre computer game, for some platform or platforms, by the end of 2014. It might very well be a lot sooner. This is totally separate from the record sheet app, which will be free and come out before the boardgame ships. This is not an addition to any current reward levels - this is just something that your support and feedback has convinced us to do.\n$325,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  We will release an Ogre expansion set late in 2013, with new units and at least one map. The pricing and contents will be determined by survey. Mmmm, surrrrrvey.\n$350,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  - We will add a new 11.5 x 17.625\u201d Kickstarter-exclusive sheet containing either more 3-D units, or more 2-D units and/or overlays. (To avoid increasing weight, we have canceled the one unsold $3,000 custom counter sheet.) We will survey to see what YOU find most interesting, and the survey includes requests we have had in comments, such as \u201cFlat Ogres\u201d and \u201cOld-style square B&W counters.\u201d\n    We have had a number of requests for duplicates of the extra overlay sheet that was the $140,000 goal. So, having hit $350K, we will also \u201cunlock\u201d that sheet, print more copies, and put it in every set sold -- and we will offer it in W23 so you can buy individual extras. This means that the supporters' exclusive sheet will be one YOU voted on, instead of the one I had made up. But everyone still gets the one I made up . . .\n$375,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Translation! This goal is in honor of our Eurogamer supporters. We will make the rules and scenario book available, in PDF form, in one other language. The new survey lists ten languages where we know we will find a lot of gamers. Update: The survey is over. A translation will be released in German.\n$400,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  - Pocket Ogre! By popular demand, a new \u201cmini\u201d edition of Ogre that will look a whole lot like the very first edition. We will send a copy to everyone who pledges $150 or over, regardless of what that support consists of - so Canadian and overseas supporters will automatically get one to say \u201cthanks for paying all that postage\u201d. This edition will eventually be sold in regular distribution, but not until the summer of 2013, so supporters can gloat over it for a whole year.\n$425,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  More Tom Smith music! At least 30 minutes, with several different tracks: we\u2019re talking about themes for the GEVs, the infantry, and so on. We\u2019ll offer this as a free download to everyone who sponsors at the $25 level and above. (There may be a ringtone in there, too . . .)\n$450,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Okay! Somehow, some way, we WILL bring back the Ogre miniatures (and not just the Ogres themselves, but the whole line). Maybe resin, maybe metal. I have already gotten some interesting responses from custom casters.\n$475,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will run a scenario contest, pick at least four winners based on fun and balance, tweak them if required, and put them online. We will also combine them and the previous eight scenarios in a laid-out color PDF and make that file available (probably by DropBox) to everyone who supported at $25 or above.\n$500,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Classic counters. Okay. We said we would never do these. You changed our minds. They will be available as an extra and in Warehouse 23.\n$525,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will replace the cardboard \"Ogre garage\" in the box with a heavy-duty vacuum-molded piece. More expensive, but you've told us you want it. To anticipate questions: We can probably order extras of these for W23, but not as part of Kickstarter. And they will not have separate lids, because really, the Ogres should be heavy enough that they won't just jump out.\n$550,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will start interviewing for a full-time Ogre line editor in the Austin office, because it looks like this game is back for the long haul.\n$575,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will put Ogre Miniatures, 2nd Edition on the schedule for late 2013, as both hardcopy and PDF. It will incorporate the material in the \"update\" PDF now available, as well as whatever gets developed as we work on Ogre over the next year. There will be new photos and new graphics. Good thing we will have a Line Editor!\n$600,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - I will come to at least two major summer/fall game conventions in 2013 (which ones? Still to be determined). The point is that at those conventions I will make Ogre my main focus, rather than That Card Game. I will run Ogre events, blow up your CP, and discuss what will be in the next supplement(s).\n$601,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - New unit added! For those who weren't excited by the convention goal above, here's a goal that specifically improves the set for all KS supporters. I will add the Heavy Weapon Team unit type to one of the Kickstarter exclusive sheets. Some counter sponsors want to put them on their sheets, too. This will be an improved (both clearer and more flexible) version of a unit that appeared only in Ogre Miniatures. Rules will be online, so as not to make the purchasers of regular editions go crazy looking for a counter that is not in the set.\n$650,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will do some kind of special launch event in Austin. It may be a simple, free open house where you can pick up your game and get it signed. Or it may be a mini-convention with food, events, special giveaways, maybe a GoH. If it\u2019s a convention, there will be a cost to attend, but we will not offer the memberships through Kickstarter, as there is absolutely no time to sort out details or set a reasonable fee. I guess I should surrrrrrrrrvey to find out what you prefer.   (Edit: Enough of you like this idea that we like it too and hope to do it, but many commented that since they don't live close it's a meaningless goal. Hmm. Lesson learned. So see the goal below.)\n\n$651,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Two more new units added! I will add (a few) Engineers to one of the Kickstarter exclusive sheets, plus a Vulcan. The Vulcan will be flat, matching the scale of the sheet of flat Ogres provided by supporter Michael Johnson - thanks, Michael! Preliminary rules for Engineers and Vulcans, developed from Ogre Miniatures, will go online when the set is shipped to you, and your reactions to those rules will shape the final version of the Engineers/Vulcans supplement . . . if and when you choose that as a release. Surrrrrrveys will continnnnnnue.\n\n$700,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Drive Offensively! We will launch a Kickstarter project for Car Wars! We *think* this will turn out to be a refinement of Car Wars Compendium 2.5, but you'll tell us. Our supporters at the [new] $23 level and higher will be invited to join an exclusive Car Wars forum, where we\u2019ll build the new edition from the ground up - issues like \"which classic cover do we use?,\" \"10 phase, 5 phase, or 3 phase movement?,\" and \"do we include boats?\" Once the project launches, surveys will be open to the public, but only supporters of the current project will get in on the preliminary planning. And we'll take everything we have learned from our Ogre Kickstarter project to make the Car Wars project even better. If we make this goal, the private Car Wars forum and surveys will launch before the end of 2012. The game will be published in late 2013.\n    (PS #1 - And we will add staff as necessary to make sure that the Car Wars and Ogre projects don\u2019t compete for attention!)\n    (PS #2 - To make sure this is clear: Supporters of Ogre are not receiving a copy of the new Car Wars. You\u2019re just making us DO it. Thank you . . . we think!)\n\n$750,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Say thank you to the Car Wars fans, because they helped us to this probably-final goal for Ogre. Because you asked for this the most: we will cram one more exclusive Kickstarter sheet into your box. If it drives up shipping, we\u2019ll eat the cost. Contents will be determined by surrrrvey (one option will be a 3-D Vulcan), and when we post it we\u2019ll give you as much info as much as possible about the already-planned sheets so you know what you are already getting. That surrrrrrrrrrrvey will be posted AFTER the campaign ends - this page will still be here and we will keep updating!\n$782,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  We have regained first place for Board/Card Game Funding. There was whooping and hollering. A video will be posted.\nSince you are being excellent to us, we will continue to be excellent to you in whatever ways we can - and we have already found a couple of ways to improve the project further - but there will be no more specific stretch goals. Support as you wish, tell your friends while there's still time, and it ends where it ends. This has been an incredibly successful campaign.

Modular animation has been the secret to large sprite animation since our 16-bit days; both in aiding the process of animation but, more importantly, in working with the limitations of various platforms. Something like this becoming mainstream helps independent developers to overcome platform issues and alleviate a very frustrating part of game production. Spriter's interface is easy to learn, intuitive to work with and can easily be incorporated into any artists' workflow. I'm excitedly looking forward to the progress that will be made towards the refinement of this very promising tool and also to the day when I can incorporate something like this into my team's day-to-day tasks.\"\nNick Wozniak - Animation Director - Wayforward - developers of Thor : God of Thunder for DS\nSpriter Beta animation implementations developed during this Kickstarter:\nCocos2d(by @TacoGraveyard) http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mtX0a26voWU\nGameMaker(by icuurd12b42) http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=537492\nFlashpunk(by @abeltoy) http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter/PunkSpriter.swf\nFlixel(by @abeltoy) http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter/FlxSpriter.swf\nStarling(by @abeltoy) http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter/StarlingSpriter.html\nAS3(by @abeltoy) http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter/BitmapSpriter.swf\nXNA(by Mark Schmelzenbach) http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter/SpriterBetaXNA.zip\nJBlocks(by Zeroluck)\nLibgdx (by Christian Finckler) http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3863\nLove2D(by @mariocaprino)\nTorque2D(by @FractalOutlook)\nSFML(by @mrwonko)https://github.com/mrwonko/SFMLSpriter/downloads\nMonkey(by therevills) http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=2709\nClick here for info about 2D Rigging Features in Spriter 1.x\nLink to the Beta Test\n    Whether you're curious, skeptical, or just want to give it a test drive, please feel free to download the beta of our free version (featured in the image and video above).  We're not done with it, so please understand this is a beta test version, and much will be improved and added. Please read the Getting Started Guide, included with the download.  \nWhat is Spriter?\n   Spriter is a powerful animation tool for creating highly detailed 2d real-time game characters and effects in an intuitive, visual editor. The characters are saved to a format that allows game engines to produce higher quality visuals, while also using less video ram, and requiring less disk space per frame than traditional 2d sprite animation. \n   Spriter also provides several game specific features like collision boxes, and sound effect triggering, and saves to an open format that will be useable across many different game engines and platforms. \n   We released the beta version fileformat to selected developers on April 7th, and within 2 days there were 5 different implementations. As of April 17th, the beta format is available to all developers(See Update 7).  As of this posting there has Spriter beta format animation loaded and played back in cocos2d(@tacograveyard), xna(Mark Schmelzenbach), LibGdx(Christian Finckler), JBlocks(ZeroLuck), flashpunk(Abel Toy), as3(Abel Toy), flixel(Abel Toy), and starling(Abel Toy).\nHow does it work?\n    Spriter uses a multi-image animation technique similar to some of the more visually impressive modern 2d games such as Muramasa or Shank.   Until now there hasn't been a 3rd party tool for this purpose.  Game makers looking to use this technique needed to create their own animation software from scratch.\n     In Spriter, what you see in your editor is what the player will see when in their game.  Not scaled down.  Not selected animation frames.  The same large, smoothly animated character.\n   Export images from the software of your choice to create the parts you wish to use to build your character. Spriter will use these to create your 'palette'. You can then build and animate your character out of these parts in our streamlined editor, which includes useful animation features like Onion Skinning and Selection Grouping.  But rather than export each frame as one complete image, Spriter saves the coordinate, rotation, size, color tint, opacity, etc, of each of the parts, which can be used in the game engine to recreate the animation.\n    With this technique, you can have as many frames as you want without affecting VRAM usage.  For developers and animators this means  more detailed characters, more detailed animations, and more available resources.  In short, much better looking, and much better performing games.  For gamers, this means that instead of just a handful of developers making cutting edge 2d, this animation technique will now be accessible to all developers, large and small, which means more great looking games for you.\n Spriter's Open, Universal File Format\n   Spriter game animations won't be tied to a specific development tool.  Spriter saves to a fully open XML based format we call SCML, which is an acronym for Spriter Character Markup Language.   Our intention is to get Spriter animation supported on every major game authoring tool.  So far, we have a feature complete Scirra Construct Classic plugin in beta for creating DirectX 9 games with Spriter.  Work has begun by third parties on Unity and Torque2d support for Spriter animations, which means soon Spriter animated characters could be possible on PC, Mac, PS3, XBOX360, Wii, Android, iOS, and Flash. \n    Anything that can read XML and display images in different positions, can support Spriter animation.  With the early version of the plugin we're developing for Scirra's amazing HTML5 game creator Construct 2, we've actually managed to load and animate a Spriter character in a standard HTML5/javascript webpage, this is without using any special plugins - just a stock browser. We are also pursuing support on GameMaker, MMF2, DarkBasic, and other popular game engines.\n   In addition to the plugins and extensions we will be creating in house or outsourcing to a third party, we will provide full documentation of the file specification and free support on our forums to anyone who wants to integrate Spriter animation support into any game authoring tool or programming language, including their own proprietary game engine.\nGame Specific Features\n   Spriter allows animators or developers to use the same intuitive editor to add game specific features such as collision rectangles, action points, variables, and sound effects that can all be animated with the character.   Want to know whether your character was punched in the face?  Name a collision box \"face\" and animate it with your character.   Add your sound effects in the Spriter editor, to have them triggered in game at exactly the right moment.  Use animatable action points to keep track of important spots you'll want access to at runtime, like the tip of the gun barrel to spawn bullets from.   And animatable variables to embed any information you wish directly into your animations, whether that's how powerful the punch is at any certain moment in the swing, to whether your characters feet are on the ground.\nCharacter Maps\n   In Spriter, art assets and animation data are kept separate, ,which makes it possible to have what we call Character Maps, to do anything from replace your characters' weapons and armor, to creating entirely different characters, simply by choosing alternate images for groups of parts.  You can animate your character once, and then draw as many alternate parts as you wish, and Spriter will simply animate the on screen character with the alternate parts.  For each character map you can choose to display, hide, or replace any number of images.\n   Eventually, we'd like to add support to create character maps at gametime, to let your players create mods for your game with no additional programming effort, simply by exposing a given character's art assets, and giving your players the option of choosing a folder of similarly named replacement images.  You could also use this to allow for randomized NPCs built by combining several optional parts, or customizable characters players could save from one version of your game - say the Facebook version, and load them on a completely different platform, like iPad, or PS3.\nArt Packs\n   Spriter has the potential to revolutionize 2d animation in the game\nindustry by introducing the concept of 2d art packs. Imagine buying a set of fully animated game characters, then just changing a handful of body part images to create your own totally unique, fully animated characters for your game. And you could of course tweak any of these animations to further customize your character, and add your own for your game's specific purposes. With these art packs, gorgeous professional quality 2d art and animation can finally be within any game maker's budget. \n   We've already begun work on our first fully professionally animated video game art packs. The first two we create will be Platform/adventure and Game effects. Certianly countless other artists will also begin creating similar Spriter art packs as Spriter becomes more popular and supported in all the major game authoring packages.\nHow will the funding be used?\n   Simple. To pay basic living expenses while we continue to work fulltime to get Spriter to 1.0 over the next 9 months.  Continued full-time focus on Spriter will also help us to recruit talent to get Spriter support on as many different engines and authoring tools as possible, as well as write tutorials and documentation.\n   Spriter fills an important niche for artists and game developers, and deserves and requires fulltime attention to get it to where it needs to be.  It isn't enough for Spriter to just work, it has to be a great animation editor.  An animation program that is merely adequate isn't adequate at all.  Artists are at their best when their tools are refined and their interface is streamlined.   Making a great UI is a fulltime job, and has often been an overtime job.\n   This is doubly important since Spriter is the first third party tool of this nature. Because of this unique position, it represents an opportunity to establish file format and workflow standards for future tools of it's kind, and we're committed to continuing to incorporate feedback from a variety of testers of varying backgrounds, to make it the best tool it can be.  This is not a job that should be rushed, and left to spare time.\n   So in short, funding will keep Spriter development speeding ahead at full speed, with our full focus.\nBeyond our Funding Goal - Procedural Animation and Other Possibilities\n   We chose a funding goal that we estimate is required to complete Spriter to 1.0, and include all the features that have been mentioned above in 9 months.  That is the goal of this project. \n   However, there are possibilities far beyond what's been stated above, and with proper funding, we can begin work on these immediately after we meet the above goal of Spriter 1.0.  These are future planned features of Spriter, and before beginning on the current version of Spriter, we had working prototypes of all of the following features, a few of which can be seen in early experimental form at the end of the video above.\nFree-form Deformable Parts and 2d skinning\n   First, we'd like to add the ability to bend and reshape each image into any amorphous curved shape, which can be used to create very organic, fluid characters.  These shape would also be tweenable, which could be used for anything from complex and detailed facial expressions to fluidly flowing clothing or clouds of dust.\n   The separate, but related feature of 2d skinning would allow you to bend both standard parts, or these new free-form deformable parts around \"bones\".  For instance, an artist could draw one complete arm, and attach it to the arm joint, so this one image could actually bend at the elbow. This would be similar to what's possible with packages such as Flash or Anime Studio and Adobe After Effect's puppet tool, but optimized for realtime use in games, and again, with Spriter's highly streamlined, focused interface, and saved to Spriter's universal file format.  \nProcedural Animation, Shapes, and Variables\n   For those who are unfamiliar with the term procedural animation, it basically means your game can generate new animations while your game is running. This allows you to create animations that can automatically adapt to each and every unique gameplay situation in a variety of ways that modern games are only beginning to scratch the surface of.\n  One example is NaturalMotion's Euphoria software which made it possible for Grand Theft Auto IV and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to have characters that continued to try to recover from physics controlled falls instead of just becoming lifeless ragdolls, though ragdolls themselves are an older simpler form of procedural animation.\n   Another very different example is Spore by maxis, which is famous for it's heavy use of procedural generation.  Because of it's procedural content, Spore has an amazingly massive scope that spans literally hundreds of thousands of planets, where you can possibly encounter hundreds of millions of very different creatures. \nProcedural Content in Spriter\n   Through our various prototypes and experiments, we discovered a way  to integrate a variety of procedural techniques for animation, behavior, and shape generation, without the need for a complex interface or scripts.  This would allow for a wide variety of possibilities, but I will give a few examples here.\nProcedural Shapes\n   You could create a range of preset shape possibilities for facial expressions, and have your characters' face reflect a unique mix of several emotions that can change from moment to moment, as well as be unique for each character's personality.   This could also allow you to generate infinitely diverse faces and clothing for background characters, or background elements, like trees and clouds, that retain your unique style, but allow for infinite variety generated on the fly.\nProcedural Animations\n   The same could be applied to animations as well.  For example, you could create a variety of different walk and run cycles or fighting animations reflecting anything you wish, from a character's femininity or masculinity, strength, fatigue, fighting style or skill level, personality, current emotional state, etc.  These could be used to create specific characters for your game's storyline, who animate very differently without the need to individually animate them, or you could also create an infinite variety of extremely diverse background characters each with  their own personality and way of reacting to what's happening in the game environment and to eachother.  This could also allow for parts of your character to animate for you, both in the editor, and in game,  as other parts of your character move.  This could be for anything from a bicep bulging automatically as an arm flexes, to a complex set of gears and pistons moving in perfect sync to a robots body movements.\n   Spriter could also allow you to set constraints that can be used to mix these dynamic animations with non-Spriter game information to be able to mix animations with ragdoll physics, or to make a characters look at specific objects, aim at a specific point on the screen, or adjust their walk cycle to navigate rough terrain more realistically or step over obstacles.  This could also be used to make things like trees or grass that animate in a stylized way, that is still dependent and affected by what's happening in the game.\nProcedural Variables\n   In addition to procedural animation and shapes, we could extend the concept of animated variables into the procedural domain. This would allow you to make variables that can interact with each other, and your game, and other Spriter characters, to allow for extremely dynamic characters and extremely dynamic interaction.   An example of a few variables interacting could be a variable called \"intimidation\" coming from one character can have an effect a value called \"fear\" in another.  The degree to which \"intimidation\" affects \"fear\" could be based on a third variable called \"bravery\" or \"cowardice\".  By using these variables to control the blending of procedural animations, it's possible to create very dynamic characters.\nProcedural Art Packs\nLastly,these concepts could be used to create procedurally animated art packs, which would contain all of the animation data necessary to create a custom walk cycle simply by dragging sliders representing things like fatigue, gender, emotion, or even cartoony vs realistic.   Again, in the editor you could also visually specify ranges of possibilities that your game could use to create random characters and creatures for the background, or even make each character in that horde about to attack your characters a unique looking and moving individual.\nThank you\n Thanks to everyone who took the time to learn a little bit about Spriter.

His resume', including testimonials from previous employers, can be found at holymonkeystudio.com. Mike founded Brashmonkey, and created a functional, earlier version of Spriter.\nI was originally hired by Mike to make a plugin for using Spriter animations in Scirra's Construct Classic, an open source game creation tool. I had contributed to Construct Classic with plugins, and various feature enhancements and bug fixes.\nI had also been working on a similar program, lacking some of the features of Spriter such as character maps, and an open file format, but which had a much more userfriendly interface, and the beginnings of many of the features listed in the 'Beyond our Funding Goal' section. After completing the Construct Classic plugin, I approached him about developing a new version of Spriter, that would incorporate the best of both our ideas.\nWe decided to become full partners, and create the ultimate 2d animation platform.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #113", "update_userinfo": "Special deals on our new Kickstarter for our 2012 Spriter backers!", "update_content": "Hello backers!

She'd rather be left to her own devices \u2013 literally \u2013 inventing things and solving math problems and ignoring people altogether.\nShe's also forced to study alongside the imaginative girlie-girl Mary, who's always going on about romance and exotic travels.

But the best way to describe Carbon Grey is for me to show you a progression of images.\nI initially did a pencil drawing of Mathilde around 2002 and was immediately flooded with story ideas. I wanted to tell a story about innocence lost, in a war that would consume the world.\nI then fleshed out her design and proceeded with her painting. And it wasn't until I painted Giselle (red haired girl) that the story started to solidify in my head. From then on it was work done between jobs and family, whenever I can find the time. I often stay up till 2 or 3 AM to work on it, but knew that I could not do it alone. I brought in Mike, Khari, Paul and Kinsun to help me finish the book. And last year we put out the first chapter of Carbon Grey from IMAGE Comics.\nWhat's the story about?\nCarbon Grey is a story about humanity's creative or destructive side. At the center of it, it's about family, tradition, duty and honors. It's an epic \" Diesel Punk\" world fill with intrigue, espionage and tragedy.\n\nSummaryThe sisters of the Greys; descendants of Gottfaust \u2013 Godlike hero of the nation\u2019s Golden Era.\n\nFor over three hundred years their family have protected and counseled the Kaiser, ruler of the Prussian Empire. The sisters are beautiful, wise and deadly; bred for purity and groomed to achieve perfection.\n\nThrough generations there have always been three \u2013 one for Strength, one for Grace and one for Wisdom.\n\nBut this is a different time.\n\n1913. At the beginning of the industrial age a great war is raging. As the myth of glory in battle is cut to ribbons on the frontline of Mitteleuropa twin sisters are born; Mathilde and Giselle. One of these two sisters is the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey, prophesized by Gottfaust to bring about a renaissance, and restore the nation to glory.\n\nBoth are flawed; imperfect in different ways. Giselle is disobedient, stubborn; but her faults are hidden. Mathilde does not share the physical perfection of her sisters, something she cannot hide. And an exposed flaw can be exploited.\n\nThis war is a diversion, orchestrated by the ruthless Queen, Raisa Vasilyeva. She conspires to manipulate Mathilde, twisting Gottfaust\u2019s prophecy to turn sister against sister, all to gain possession of the Stone, the source of Gottfaust\u2019s Godlike power.\n\nWhen the Kaiser is murdered Giselle must run, traveling west across the scorched battlefields of Mitteleuropa on a mission to deliver a mysterious letter into the heart of enemy territory. Pursued by the sisters and hunted by the enemy Giselle must discover the prophecy\u2019s true meaning before the Cossack queen harnessed the power of the stone to rewrite history itself.\nWhy is the production so expensive for a comic book?\nCarbon Grey is not like any ordinary comic book, it's structure more like a graphic novel. The story is epic in its scale and we wanted to do justice to it. We hand painted each and every panel on the page, it is a slow and meticulous process, but the end result speak for itself. Here is an example of a page we had to redraw and repaint. The final version in the book looks nothing like the original anymore, but it was necessary to propel the story forward.\nWhy should I care? and why did this project take so long?\nCarbon Grey has been a labor of love for me and my friends. We have been working on and off with this project for almost a decade. It is a dedication born of passion, perseverance and hard work. And the belief that one day we'll complete this journey.\nI have been self-funding this project for a while now, unfortunately, I've now ran out of money. The budget for the first arc was 40K and the second arc will be the same. I'm now reaching out to the KickStarter community to help me fund the second story arc. It will be another 3 issue mini-series published by IMAGE Comics.\nI need to finish Carbon Grey just as much as I need to breathe. It's hard to explain, the need to be creative can be overwhelming at times. \"What my mind sees, my hand cannot create fast enough.\" Please help me and my friends finish what we have started.\nThank you for your generosity.\nHoang Nguyen\nPrizes for your support\nPledge $10 or more: Issue # 1 of Carbon Grey (Volume 2) signed by the creative team.

Thank you all again for your support.\nValdis Story A.C. is a side scrolling action adventure for P.C. with an emphasis on intricate and rewarding combat as well as deep play style customization. The player will assume the role of Wyatt as they explore the ruins of a holy city that was lost many years ago. Wyatt must battle various types of demons, angels, and a new threat tentatively known as \u201cFerals\u201d using swordsmanship, martial arts, and sorcery. There are many customizable skills and equipment that will aid Wyatt on his journey.\nWhat's Valdis Story about?\nOver 40 years ago the Dark Goddess Myrgato attacked and killed her creator, the All Mother Valdis. Since this event Myrgato has been at war with her twin sister the Goddess of Light Alagath. The war has wreaked havoc on the land and the hope of mankind is dwindling as they are forced to choose a side or perish. Wyatt has been following a trail of clues for the past 5 years left by his father that he believes will lead him to find a way to end the Goddess War.\nWhat does the game feature?\nIntense combat weaving sword and sorcery together seamlessly.\nEquipment and Customizable skills to fit your own unique fighting style.\nUnique magic souls that aid in combat and traversing the ruins of the city.\nInterconnected zones allow you to explore new areas or backtrack.\nWho are you and why do you need my money?\nEndless Fluff Games is a team of two. Both of us share development tasks to create the games we love and make them as great as we can. What's great about that is that we have our hands in every part of the game. Check out our last game, Legend of Fae.  \nIn the past we've done our own music/sound for our games, but we'd like to give that task to someone who's got that discipline down packed. We estimate that Valdis Story A.C. will take 9-10 more months to finish. Your pledges will help fund the rest of development and get us the quality sound and music the project deserves.\nThe Lost Crew\nOne of the coolest rewards we are offering in return for your support, is the chance to work with us to design one of the lost crew members. Before entering Sitheil, Wyatt was traveling with Reina, Gilda, Vladyn and Faolan along with 20 other crew members from his ship. When the game starts Wyatt is separated from his crew and can locate them through out the game. The crew members have a variety of skills and backgrounds that you get to help us design. The designs will then become NPCs that are scattered through the game and each one will provide some sort of special attribute ranging from being a special item vendor to unlocking new areas. There are only 20 crew members though so this reward is limited.\nREWARDS!\nMore incentive previews coming soon!\nThe Key Chain! Take mini Wyatt with you anywhere. This is a mock up of what the acrylic printed charm  will look like. \nThe SHIRT!  The votes are in and the most popular was #5!

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies.

We'll only be displaying the latest updates here.\nFOR OUR NEW BACKERS: Early on in the campaign we changed the prizes so that anyone who pledges $50 and up will receive all three parts of the trilogy: the full game! It's our thanks for helping us achieve our goal so quickly.\nApril 20th, 4 hours left in the campaign: KABOOM. 700%. You did it. We didn't believe it could be done. We are in awe. Keep an eye out, we'll be sending out an update when the campaign officially ends exclusive to our incredible backers!\nIn the last three days of the campaign, we've put together a final video with a some pretty important news... plus we're hiring! Please take a look and get the full description in Update #9.\n\n\"The Banner Saga looks to take everything that was great about the heyday of animated motion pictures and crams it into a strategy game that looks almost too good to be true.\" - Gamezebo\n\"...the art speaks for itself. The developers describe it as \"painstakingly hand-animated,\" and it shows. The colors are lush, and the stylized scenes and characters as crisp and vivid as in any animated film, perhaps more so.\" - Kotaku\n\"It's a beautifully hand-drawn, animated adventure with turn-based tactical strategy set in a post-apocalyptic Viking world. If you didn't start throwing your money at the screen six words into that last sentence, then you're either completely dead inside, or else you enjoy things that are different from the things that I enjoy, in which case you are dead to me.\" - Cracked\n\"We got a few glimpses of that hand drawn artwork when the Banner Saga site went live recently, but it looks even better in motion. The turn based combat in particular looks livelier for that hand-drawn touch. Lovely stuff.\" - PC Gamer\nWHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT BANNERS AND SAGAS?\nThe Banner Saga is a role-playing game merged with turn-based strategy, wrapped into an adventure mini-series about vikings.\nTravel through stunning landscapes straight out of an animated film. Battle painstakingly hand-animated foes in strategic, turn-based combat harkening back to the classic \"Tactics\" days of gaming. Make decisions with consequences in conversations with people you'll truly care about.\nAnd throughout the whole thing record the history of your people on your banner where it will be remembered, because soon there might not be anything left.\nThe Banner Saga is a mature game aimed at gamers who appreciate art, story and strategy.\n\nTHE GAME\nOur first priority has always been to make a role-playing game that feels and looks fresh, and plays like the classic tactical strategy games of our childhood. It's not about defeating the villain and saving the day. It's not about grinding to get past the next fight. The Banner Saga throws you into the end of the world and asks \"how do you deal with this\"?\nDRM-Free, and available on PC and Mac\nNot another generic fantasy: Drawing heavily from Norse culture while creating its own identity and mythology, The Banner Saga takes a low-fantasy approach to viking themes. Giants: yes. Horned helmets: no.\nStrategic combat: Recruit a large roster of unique characters throughout the story, each with different abilities that interact in combat in a deeply tactical way and personalities of their own. The Banner Saga harkens back to classic turn-based gameplay with a strong emphasis on tactics over brute force and endless grinding.\nTravel across gorgeous landscapes: The choices you make as events arise have a huge affect on how the story plays out- who survives, who dies, and what's worth saving. Add people to your caravan as you travel, or lose them when tough decisions arise. You're not just fighting to save nameless strangers, you're fighting for your neighbors, your family and your way of life. We want you to care what happens to them.\nAn emphasis on story: Your choices in dialogue and throughout the game truly affect the story and the people around you. A mature story for adults means forming relationships and making tough decisions; not sex, violence and swearing.\nPlay online: Though the single-player campaign is our focus, The Banner Saga provides a deep multiplayer game; build a unique party of characters and battle friends and enemies in multiplayer combat. Upgrade your party over time and devise new strategies.\nRisk in gameplay: A lot of modern games play it safe- you know you'll defeat the evil and save the day. In The Banner Saga you can't take anything for granted. We want it to feel like a good tv mini-series; the world doesn't revolve around you, it's about how you deal with change.\nWhat does \"Chapter 1\" of the full game mean? We've added an explanation in the faq below.\nDON'T YOU NEED MILLIONS TO MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS?\nWith 30 years experience between us in the games industry, and after working as leads on The Old Republic; one of the biggest projects in gaming history, we know what it takes to make a top-tier game.\nWhen we decided to go independent we knew it would mean making some hard compromises, but it was never our goal to make something small and casual. We designed a game that, at its very minimum, would cost us $100,000 while still focusing on our top priorities - story and strategic combat - at the highest possible level of quality.\nOur promise to you is that all the support we receive goes right back into the game to make it the best it can be. Your donations don't just let us tack on more stuff, they let us return to the full scope of the game we've always wanted to make.\nAdditional funding allows us to give you:\nA bigger, richer world. More characters in combat, more animation, more diverse landscapes, more music, engaging animated cutscenes, and more multiplayer options. We have a huge story we want to tell and this will let us deliver it in the most compelling, meaningful way.\nPorting to more devices. Our first release will be on PC and Mac, but funding would allow us to convert the game to iOS, the Kindle Fire, consoles like XBLA and PSN and maybe even portable gaming devices like the Vita.\nLocalization (translation) in more places. Viking culture is huge in Europe and turn based strategy is big in Japan. We'd love to bring The Banner Saga to both of those places and anywhere else we find significant interest.\nThe game the way we think it should be. By crowdfunding this project we won't be tied to publishers telling us to change the giants to orcs or dumbing the story down for children. We think this means a better game for everyone.\n\nBEHOLD, THE PRIZES\nWe're absolutely over the moon to be able to offer prizes not just for a game, but as an art project. Scroll down to see everything we have to offer!\nThe Wallpaper\nA sleek, stylized background for any size computer or portable device. Get it with or without the game logo. Obviously we can't show it here, but it's exclusive to Kickstarter backers and never seen before.\n\nThe Guild Crest\nThis is your chance to get in the game. In both single player and multiplayer, when the player starts the game they choose a crest to represent their family or guild. We'll give you a template, and you give us whatever symbol you want to see in the game. It could be your family crest, your guild emblem, or a drawing of your dog. It's not just for you, though; everyone who plays the game will be able to see your design. If you donate at this level be sure to check out the FAQ for some simple guidelines. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Game Poster\nA full-sized 24 x 36 inch movie-style poster featuring official artwork for the game and featured on the cover of Indie Game Magazine. Each poster is personally signed by the team at Stoic! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe T-shirt\nA t-shirt designed exclusively for the Kickstarter campaign and only for backers. Carved into the horn is the history of the world. Once the campaign is over they'll never be seen again! We'll be making the t-shirt available in all the major sizes (s, m, l, xl and xxl) and both genders. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Button\nAll prizes at the $80 and up level come with a free pin based on the brooch worn by a key character the game, which can be seen in the animation cel below. Use it to hold together your sheep-skin cloak in the icy winds! Show off your viking spirit in public! Or whatever! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Score (Special music promotion)\nAustin Wintory, composer of the hit game \"Journey\", will be providing limited edition physical copies of the soundtrack, hand-signed by the composer himself. Different from the official soundtrack, once the campaign ends these special edition CDs won't be available again. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\nThe Animation Cel\nThis is a throwback to the golden age of animation. A cel is a single frame of animation on a transparent sheet that is laid on top of a painted image. If you're a huge classic animation nerd like we are, you can own a signed and numbered 8.5 x 14 inch animation cel from the game the way they used to do it in the good old days of Disney and Don Bluth. Includes all previous rewards. Pick one of two pivotal characters below:\n\nThe Signature (Special music promotion)\nGet an autographed copy of the performance parts from the recording sessions; the SHEET MUSIC used by the actual musicians who play on the score. Needless to say, this prize will be a limited run. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score for the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Landscape\nWe're thrilled to offer our take on works of art inspired by the incredible paintings of the American master Eyvind Earle. This is an image that defines The Banner Saga's art style. Get this framed 36 x 12 inch lithograph with no logos, no gimmicks, signed and numbered by the artist in limited supply. Your friends won't even know it's from a game unless you decide to tell them. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Relic\nImmortalize something meaningful to you in The Banner Saga that other players will find on their own adventures. Send us a photo of your own heirloom, memento or just something you'd like to show your friends and we'll turn it into a relic of value and power. We'll work with you to come up with a unique name and description that could include anything from a mysterious inscription to giving off a certain aura. You'll personalize it and make a coveted piece of gameplay by choosing from a list of rarities and in-game bonuses it provides. Doesn't look very viking-themed you say? That's ok, the marketplaces trade in items pillaged from all over the world. Check the FAQ for more info. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Shadowbox\nWe'll be creating a piece of art with true depth that replicates the way the game parallaxes and overlaps. It comes in a 2-inch deep glass-paned frame at a hefty 20 x 16 inches. Below is an example image by the artist who will be creating the shadowbox (not the actual image!). Rest assured that we'll be doing something special for this piece. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Transcendence\nBECOME A VIKING GOD in the game itself. The gods may be dead but that doesn't mean they're not an important part of The Banner Saga. We'll work with you to create a unique deity with your likeness which will be seen all over the game in various forms of effigy and as an integral part of the lore, all in strong Norse themes. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Performance (Special music promotion)\nYou are invited to personally ATTEND the music's recording sessions in Los Angeles or elsewhere later this year. This will include a day of hanging out with all of us at the recording studio, and lunch (on us). You will also receive a signed, leather-bound book compiling all of the game's music (produced as a one-off and therefore never commercially for sale) and earn a Music Associate Producer credit in the game and on the album. Not enough? Austin will personally compose an original 30-second ringtone, just for you! As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game recorded in a live studio! Please note: this is a special case prize. While it does include the signed CD and the sheet music, it does not include any of the previous rewards. This one's for serious music fans. You must be able to travel to the Los Angeles area or elsewhere. If you're interested in this prize you must contact us to make arrangements before the end of the Kickstarter campaign: stoic@stoicstudio.com.\n\nThe Motion Shoot\nCome on over to our high-tech motion capture studio and we'll put YOU (yes, physically you) in the game, doing an animation for an attack or special skill. Think you'll look silly? Don't worry, by the time we're done you'll look a bad-ass viking warrior. After the shoot we'll take you out to lunch and chat about the game. Male or female, no problem; we've got plenty of characters to choose from. We can honestly say there will probably never be another chance like this. Must live locally or be able to travel to the Austin, TX area. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Executive\nWe have so many prizes now we had to compile them all into one final, huge mega-prize. The Executive gives you every prize we have to offer (except for the rotoscope shoot), including the viking god and attending the recording session. On top of that, you will be given an Executive Music Producer credit in the game and on the album. Lastly, receive a framed copy of the Banner Saga main theme, each note inscribed by hand by Austin Wintory, who will also be kind enough to sign his work. Has anything like this even been done before? Please contact us before donating at this tier.\n\nAnything else?\nThat's not enough? If you have any questions about the prizes or are interested in making some kind of arrangements for a private donation, please feel free to contact us at stoic@stoicstudio.com\n\nWHO ARE YOU, TO PROMISE SUCH THINGS?\nStoic is made up of three industry veterans with over a decade of experience each, and from all walks of development. We're overwhelmingly confident that, with your help, we can create something meaningful and beautiful.\nArnie Jorgensen started off working on comics such as Justice League America for DC. Eventually he got into games, putting his abilities to work on Star Wars: Galaxies and The Old Republic as the lead concept artist. Now instead of making art just for concepts it goes right into the game.\nAlex Thomas got into the industry early and has done everything from 3D characters and environments to 2D animation, illustration, screenplay writing, game design and cinematics for games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Shadowbane.\nJohn Watson has been programming since he was 6. After doing some work on the Hubble at NASA he decided to apply his vast abilities in the games industry, eventually bringing his experience as lead combat programmer on The Old Republic to Stoic.\nTHANK YOU\nWe're honored and humbled to have this opportunity, and we're beyond lucky to be in this position at this time. We'll do everything we can to make the kind of game that we're proud of sharing and talking about with gamers and, hopefully, create something that's meaningful to you.

LEGO\u00ae! Strategy and tactics!\nMobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack is the tenth anniversary edition of Vincent Baker's Mechaton. Build yourself a company of robots called mobile frames out of LEGO, give yourself some objectives to defend, lay out a table with a few friends, and fight! We're making sure you've got all the parts we've got so you can have the most fun you can with the game. You'll get play instructions, building instructions, even instructions for how to make your own setting. \nBecause, just like a LEGO set, building what's on the front of the box is fun, but building your own thing is where it really catches fire. So that's what we want you to do! Build robots, play with our setting, sure! If you're into VOTOMS, Dougram, Macross, or Gasaraki, then we want to play with you! We've put a lot of love and care into the designs and the setting and we're excited to see what people do with them. But then check out the advice on building a setting and house rules, too, and go to town!\nAbout the rules\nMobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack is designed to be playable with two to five players, each fielding a company of mobile frames of different strengths. The game keeps tension high by making sure that no player ever quite has enough frames, equipment, or time to be a sure thing. In fact, the player in the strongest points position to win is the player with the weakest company; if you expect to fight from a difficult position, be ready to run away and come back in another round!\nPlay starts with the doomsday clock set to 11. Every turn, it ticks down by one automatically. At 0 the game ends. But adding to that is the possibility that each player can mark it down faster. If you're winning, you'll mark it down every round. If you think you'll be winning this round, you'll mark it down. Players never really know how soon the game will end until the very end.\nRules are tightly tied to the frames themselves. Every frame has its own two white dice, then has added to it up to four subsystems. Those systems help the frame move, attack at one of three ranges, defend themselves, and observe & communicate. When a frame takes damage, it takes damage by losing those systems. \nPlay takes between 2.5 and 4 hours, depending on the age and number of players. Eager 10-year-olds seem to grasp the game well, but it offers a constantly flowing sea of tactical options to more experienced players.\nAbout the Setting\nIt's the year 0245 of the Solar Calendar. The Earth-centered Solar Union has overstretched, abandoning the interstellar colonies and colonists that can no longer produce enough for its vast and struggling population.\nWhen the Solar Union's colonial efforts reached the homeworld of the Ijad, they found their first opposition. Religiously opposed to empire, they quickly adopted the SU's technologies of interstellar travel and the muscle cylinders that made their mighty mobile frames possible. The Solar Union now finds its own technologies turned against it as the Ijad fight in their quadrupedal Scrambler frames to force back the tide of the Solar Union.\nInspired by the Ijad religion and rising against the Solar Union are the newly-formed Free Colonies. Fighting with labor frames and homebuilt mobile frames built from scavenged muscle cylinders, they take inspiration from the Ijad's liberation theology in the hopes of achieving Badhal \u2014 self-determination.\nWithin these factions are many more. You'll define your Ijad religious factions, your companies of United Mars Foreign Legionnaires and Terran Trade Marines, you Free Colonial popular movements. They might not agree with their purported allies, and they might find themselves friends with those who would be their enemies.\nMobile Frames\nThe United Mars Foreign Legion's ST-07 \"Chubs\", backed by their ACT-022A \"Chub Tub\". The Free Colonies' Hi-Leg \u2014 a low-cost homebuilt mobile frame and the converted labor frame, the Commissar. The Ijad's \"Scrambler\" and \"Stalker\" (names given the frames by the Terran Trade Marines who first encountered them) are often supported by Swerves, tiny flying craft designed to pierce and cut between the plates of enemy frames.\nA sample of decals \u2014 a change in printers has allowed us to print a greater variety than you can see here.\nKickbacks\nSoren and Joshua are working hard to bring some unique, limited edition stuff that we can't possibly mass-produce to you guys.\nDecals are the first. Designed by Joshua A.C. Newman specifically for the Kickstarter, you'll receive sheets of transparent decals to distinguish your companies. They'll include symbols for all three factions including industrial markings, rank insignia, religious slogans, and kill markers.\nThe Mobile Frame Garage is a kit thoughtfully designed by Soren to give you a pile of parts appropriate for building mobile frames. Designed for players who don't have a big bin of LEGO at home, tiny hinges and other parts give you all you need for a company of five mobile frames. Presented in neutral colors, you can liven up your particular company by adding in parts from any LEGO set.\nSoren's Special Edition kits are designed and hand-assembled by Soren to give you real punch right out of the box. There are only two of each faction, so choose wisely.\nA custom-designed company by Joshua will set you up right. You'll chat with Joshua, who will help you figure out what faction you like the most, how you want to play tactically, and custom design and assemble your company.\nA custom-designed company by Soren will make your company the most coveted in all of LEGO mecha. You'll consult with Soren and Joshua, working out what faction you want and how you want it to work tactically, and then Soren will build it up for you.\n\nWho are we?\nVincent Baker (@lumpleygames on Twitter) is the designer and publisher of Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, The Abductinators, and a bunch of other games. His website is lumpley.com.\nJoshua A.C. Newman (@JoshuaACNewman on Twitter)is the designer and publisher of Shock:Social Science Fiction, Shock:Human Contact (a Kickstarter project also), and Under the Bed. His website is glyphpress.com.\nSebastian is our apprentice. He's Vincent's son and Joshua's godson. He's got a game coming out soon called Blasters for Hire about space bounty hunters.\nSoren Roberts (@harmfulmechanic on Twitter) is an extraordinary artist and designer in the LEGO medium. He's been wowing the LEGO community with his mecha for years. You can see his work in his substantial Flickr stream.\nOne thing we're not is employees of LEGO. We're a bunch of guys who love it, but we're not them, at all. In fact, I can even tell you that there are other great building toys that you could use with the MFZ rules like Gundam models, Mega Blocks, or even little squads of metal miniatures where each unit, instead of a system, represents a die. \nWant to see something neat?\nYou should check out the Mobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack Flickr pool. There are hundreds of robots from within and without the Solar Calendar from all different skill levels.\nYou'll also see a lot of neat stuff over at Zeekhotep's blog, No B.S., Just ABS. One thing you'll see is an interview with Joshua, talking about MFZ and where it came from!

It's not a retro-clone, but an entirely new game with a very familiar feel.\nSome of the changes and additions include new character classes such as the bard, jester, mystic, savant, and mountebank, plus scores of new spells for them. It has a new combat system that's smoother than the original and yet fully compatible with it, all at the same time. There are new monsters and magic items, including a system to allow for any sort of magic weapon to have almost any weapon power; you can have a spear of venom or a sword of thunderbolts. Plus much more.\nA Curious Volume of Forgotten Lore is designed to be a rules supplement suitable for use with almost any other game that's compatible with the 1st edition rules. It's completely modular, so if you want to just take one or two of the classes, or just use the combat system and some of the monsters, or take the whole thing and plug it into your game, you're able to. It's all also compatible with existing adventures and settings, so there's almost no conversion work needed.\nPeople who pledge $10 will receive a pdf version of the rules.\nThose who pledge $30 will get the softcover version and the pdf.\nThose who pledge $60 will get the hardcover and the pdf.\nAnd, finally, those who pledge $100 will get an autographed copy of the hardcover, a copy of the softcover, and a copy of the pdf.\n----- BONUS REWARD!!! -----\nIf we pass the $3,500 mark, each and every person who pledged $10 or more will also receive a pdf adventure module specifically designed to highlight the various character classes in the book and how they can be used in an urban, wilderness, and dungeon environment. The adventure, to be written by the same Humble Author who wrote \"A Curious Volume of Forgotten Lore\", will feature examples for game masters to help their players get the most out of the various character classes in the book.\nTell your friends, tell your fellow players! And thanks again to everyone who has already pledged.\n----- SECOND BONUS REWARD!!! -----\nIf we pass the $5,500 mark, everyone who pledged $10 or more will also get a pdf copy of the map and key for Level 2A from the fabulous megadungeon Dwimmermount. A treasure map found in that legendary laboratory level can be used to lead in to the first bonus adventure. You can play the bonus adventure as a stand-alone game, or in conjunction with this masterful megadungeon level.

FTL will be on Steam!\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing an early build of the game, and it\u2019s amazing.  When it comes out... you should play it because it\u2019s amazing.\u201d - Graham Smith - PC Gamer Preview\n\u201c...fighting to stave off the inevitable destruction of my ship and crew as we make a mad dash through the cosmos gets my blood pumping every time.\u201d - Nathan Meunier - Gamespy Preview \n\u201cThis game is brilliant, and brutal, and different every time.\u201d - Tom Francis - PC Gamer Preview \nFTL: Spaceship Simulation Roguelike-like\nFTL, Faster than Light, is a game coming to Windows, Mac & Linux made by Justin Ma and Matthew Davis.  It features a blend of exploration, discovery, ship management and real time strategic combat that creates an experience quite unlike other games in its genre.\nEDIT: But don\u2019t take our word for it...\nThe OnLive demo is over!\nFor the first 2+ weeks of the Kickstarter, a demo of FTL was featured as part of OnLive's Indie Showcase.  It was an event coinciding with GDC that allowed people at home to try a number of the IGF nominees and honorable mentions.  It was hugely successful: FTL was one of the most played demos of the event.  At one point it was the 2nd most played game on the entire OnLive service*!    For now we will be working hard to get the game ready for the beta in May.  In the meantime we will be putting up some more gameplay videos to let you get a better feeling for the game.\n*Or so we were told at GDC.\n\nThe Game\nFTL has been described as \u201cFirefly by way of Spelunky.\u201d  Many games have tackled the goal of recreating the feeling of space operas, but few have focused on the inner workings of a single ship. How does the crew react when their ship takes a heavy missile barrage and the shield batteries shut down?  Do you reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape?  Do you power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky before they can breach your hull?  Or do you teleport a boarding party onto the enemy ship and take the fight to them directly?  FTL allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.\n\nA setting of intergalactic war:  The player is tasked with a mission vital to the survival of the Galactic Federation currently threatened by a nearly victorious rebellion.\nA story that engages, but does not dictate player experience:  The setting provides direction but the real story of FTL is created by the player and it evolves organically during each play-through.\nAn arms race: The locations and enemies grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.  To survive you will need to find and purchase equipment; hire and level up crew; and upgrade the ship\u2019s systems.\nExploration is key:  Every location you Faster-Than-Light travel to contains a text based event.  This includes scenarios like attempting to help an infected space station pleading for help; slavers demanding your surrender; hunting pirates through a nebula; and surviving an uncharted asteroid field.\nA random galaxy:  Each play-through will feature different encounters, events, choices, and results to your decisions. \nPermadeath is at the core of FTL:  Knowing that your crew\u2019s lives are in your hands and that each battle could mean the end of your trek fills the player with a sense of urgency and desperation that adds importance to every decision.\nSleek and focused gameplay:  FTL focuses on the development of your ship, recreating the atmosphere of space operas without the countless menus and confusing interface that frequently go hand in hand with ship management and galactic sim games.  Currently each game lasts between 15 and 90 minutes.\n\n\nThe Combat\nShip-to-ship combat is a large focus of the game.  Check out this older gameplay trailer to see it in action: \nEDIT:  There are new gameplay trailers to watch.  Check them out in Update #4 and Update #5!\n\nThe Final Game\nA lot of these elements are fully functional and can be experienced (briefly) in the demo... so what will we be adding between now and release?\nShip Customization:  Choose & name your ship; outfit it with weapons & equipment; and hire & name your crew.  \nAlien Races: We are working on 5 playable alien races that have unique abilities, ships and implications during exploration.\nCrew Development:  Your crew will gain skill over time, allowing survivors to have improved combat and operate ship systems to increase their potential..\nAn Ending:  The current game is infinite (play until you lose), but we want to have a more controlled game mode that gives the player a final goal and rewards for completion.\nDeep Meta-game: Unlock playable ships, unique crew members, weapons and equipment to be used in subsequent play-throughs.\nCustom Soundtrack:  We have two songs so far, but our sound designer will be working hard to give us a soundtrack that greatly enhances the experience. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nYou may be wondering, \u201cif the game is so close to completion, why do you need our money?\u201d   When we quit our jobs last year, we intended to work on a small project for a few months.  During development we received such overwhelmingly positive feedback that we changed our plans.  We decided to bring FTL up to a finished game quality.  However, releasing a game takes money and our funds are starting to deplete.  Your generous pledges will go towards:\n\nBusiness Costs: To officially start selling the game we have to set up a company, deal with licensing and other expenses.\nPaying Our Sound Designer: It is fine that we\u2019re working out of pocket, but we will need to have money to pay our wonderful sound guy, Ben Prunty.\nPolish & Improvement: Making FTL as good as it can be.\n\n\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $10 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released.  We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux.  See below for estimated system requirements.  We're aiming to be content complete within a few months and then release the game by the end of summer.  This is subject to change and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nPledging $25 or more will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain but we will attempt to start it within a couple months of the end of the Kickstarter.  Here is what we know now:\nThe Beta will initially require Windows and have only English localization.\nIt will initially be available only to backers.\nEDIT: The beta will be organized through Steam!  This means you will need access to a Steam account to join the beta.\nSystem Requirements:\nThe requirements are all subject to change. We're doing our best to accommodate as many machines as possible, but with our currently limited testing we're unsure of what the final requirements will be.\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7), MacOS, or Linux\nProcessor: 2ghz Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 512 MB \nGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 Support, 256 MB (dedicated card preferred)\nMinimum Resolution: 1280 x 720\nThank You\nFTL\u2019s website can be found at www.FTLgame.com\nIf you\u2019re confused about the game, check out our FAQ\nYou can voice any questions or concerns to devteam@FTLgame.com\nSign up for the newsletter on our website.\nFollow us at @FTLgame\n\nAnd of course, thank you to the girlfriends, friends, and family who have been with us every step of the way:  finding bugs, vetoing bad ideas, and feeding us.

Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this?

Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.
