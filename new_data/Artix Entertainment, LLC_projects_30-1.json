Once you create your game on the PC, you can save it onto a cartridge that plays on a real console.\nSoftware and hardware prototypes\nRetro Game Builder won't force you to program in complicated 65816 assembly language like it's 1991. Instead, you can construct your game logic with an intuitive graphical interface. And if you happen to be an advanced programmer who wants maximum performance and control, you'll be able to access the assembly code under the hood. \nI started making games back in the 1980s on 8-bit computers, and over the years I've used various game engines, libraries, and frameworks. For the past two decades I've been developing business software, but games have always been my true passion. That's one of the many reasons I'm making Retro Game Builder.\nI produce videos for element14 Presents, where I design and build electronics projects. Check out some of my favorite hacks involving retro game consoles:\nRetro Game Builder is in the early stages of development. There's a working prototype for the cartridge programmer, and the software is in a pre-alpha version. Here are a few of the things it can do today:\nAsset creation, including palettes and tile sets\nUI-based logic design (logic flows)\nFile export for testing in emulators\nAbility to save files to cartridge \n\nFor months I've been working in my spare time to prepare for this campaign. Unfortunately, nights and weekends aren't going to be enough to finish development in the reasonably near future. Funding is needed so I can work full-time on the following features:\nAdvanced tile map editing, including metatiles and large maps\nAnimation and collision detection\nA wide range of pre-built logic nodes\nSound and music\nAbility to save games to SRAM\nMode 7 support\nTutorials and demos\nFinal version of cartridge programmer with improved performance\n\nFor rewards that include the software, you'll receive a link to download a digital copy of the program when it's released. Retro Game Builder is a Windows application. For rewards that include cartridges, they will be shipped to an address that you provide. The cartridge programmer shown on this page is a prototype only. Backers will receive an improved final version.\nIf you choose a reward with beta access, you'll receive a link to download an early preview version of the software when it becomes available.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done my best to set a realistic funding goal and delivery estimates based on my experience. But things don't always go perfectly to plan. Unforeseen technical challenges could cause development to take longer than expected, and that might affect the delivery dates for rewards. It's also possible that importing parts like chips and PCBs could take longer due to factors beyond my control. Regardless of what happens, I'll be as transparent as possible and share regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andy West\nFirst created \u00b7 5 backed\nI have a lifelong passion for video games that started with the Atari 2600 and eventually led to a career in software development.
