Now they don\u2019t clean the floors unless it\u2019s to mop the blood off \u2018em.\nThe saloon is home to a high-stakes underground poker game that features a cadre of gamblers, criminals, and rogues. \nTOMMY DAKOTA: Infamous robber, renowned desperado, and legendary outlaw. Society shunned him years ago, so Tomas De Santos changed his name, joined the military, and hid his passions to be just like everyone else. When that wasn't enough, this queer Latino threw away a life of service for a life of crime.  If this world wouldn\u2019t take him, he would take what he wanted. Since then, the thrill of the heist and the promise of the payoff are all he's needed...until he met Jep Walker.\n\nJEP WALKER: Jep, the Burgundy Ten bartender, has been trying to find the right scheme to get out from the life he\u2019s been living and a past that still haunts him. When he joined forces with Goldie, he never imagined his heart would be on the line. After Tommy Dakota walked into the bar, everything changed.\nGOLDIE HESSER: A former high roller turned crook bound and determined to rob the game. All she needs is a bandit crazy enough to help her pull it off.  \n\nNow this terrible trio has a plan to take the ultimate prize and the payoff of a new life.\nTheir plan is set.

My father, Robert Schanke who is one of the grampas mentioned in the title, and I, Julie Schanke Lyford, have co-written one of the very first children's picture books to feature Gay grampas! \nWhere is the money going?  We are using it to help bring this book we've dreamed of publishing for YEARS to life!  A large portion goes to pay for the illustrator so that she can create all of the original artwork  for the book. Also, even though we have a publisher, we still have to pay for things like the printing cost, the cover design and the typesetting of the book.   We want this to look fantastic, and so we are bringing in the experts to help us make this a professionally produced book.\nThere are many different levels to pledge and MANY fun rewards.  The different levels feature everything from having the child of your choice included in the final book to fabulous pride themed cheesecake from Muddy Paws Cheesecake.   \n About Julie \nBeing a mother, I have read many picture books to my children.  However, there were NONE that showed OUR family unit, a family with gay grampas.  Working together with my father, Robert, we have taken a true story and turned it into a beautifully illustrated picture book.  \nGrampas Bob and Jack\nAbout Robert\nDuring my 40 years of teaching theatre at various colleges, I also authored eight books focusing on LGBTQIA+ artists in the American theatre. Co-authoring this children's book, however, has been a highlight of my career. In being autobiographical, it has allowed me to express my joy of being a grampa and part of a loving, modern family. \nKaty Introducing Her Two Grampas to Her Classroom\nWhy the Need for THIS Book? \nSeveral children\u2019s books focus on children with their gay parents. Few, if any, however, deal with their gay grandfathers. This book, a true story, with dozens of colorful original images, tells the story of a first-grade girl with a lisp who is always misunderstood by her classmates and teacher. One day when she talks about her two gay grampas, she becomes very frustrated when they think she means grampa and gramma. With the help of her big sister, she is able to let her teacher know what she is trying to say.  Finally, because she has such love for her gay grampas and so much trust in their understanding her, she unexpectedly shines when introducing them at a classroom party for grandparents. \nBe a character in the book!!\nExclusive Peeks Behind-the-scenes - How a Book Is Created\nHow is the Magic Made?\nJulie has been working with Mariia Luzina, a fantastic Ukrainian illustrator who currently lives in Pomigliano D`Arco,  Italy.  Mariia has brought the story to life with her imaginative and heartfelt images.  We communicate daily and work on the sketches to make sure they tell the story we are wanting to tell and showing the emotion that is happening at that part of the story.\nMariia has been stuck inside during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy so it's given her plenty of time to create wonderful images for the book!!  Here are a few examples:\nWe start with a character study.\nThen we move on to a sketch for a page in the book - we talk about the images I am looking for her to create.  I send her examples to use for ideas...You can see the photo I sent her made its way into Katy's thought bubbles below! \n  After talking about the image - we change things - note the change in Katy's facial expression and the fact that we can see the girls more clearly in the beach image.\nKaty's Wonderful Memories with Her Grampas\n Love is Love Pin \nThis beautiful Love Is Love Rainbow Pin features the phrase \"Love Is Love\" across a silver heart with a rainbow-striped background.

So they strap up, hit the streets and are ready to fight back against bigotry with a sequin baseball bat and some bad ass righteous fury! \nThe fabulous Bi Phallicia\nFollow the most fabulous street gang in the world as they patrol the Gay Village, step up to bigoted politicians and bash down the bashers. And in the midst of it all, they discover there's a conspiracy behind it all!\nThey're sick of being seen as victims! Sick of having crimes against them ignored! The Glitter Vipers are here to fight back!\nThe story is a brisk 60 pages, with a few behind the scenes extras thrown in too to give you a great little package in a glitter grindhouse revenge fantasy!\nThe gang's all here! Art by Katie Fleming\nWho Are the Glitter Vipers?\n Bi Phallicia  - Bi Phallicia, real name Jason Filson, is a Manchester drag queen of some repute, who as well as her weekly shows runs a support group for those that have been victims of abuse, bigotry or hate crimes. Unfortunately, she finds herself becoming not just the organiser but also one of the members. She takes on the lead in the Glitter Vipers gang when they decide to fight back. \nJesus Moretti - Jesus is a Colombian immigrant living in Manchester, UK and close friends with Bi and her group. He's dating Anton Bakunin. He's a broader, tougher looking man who came to the UK to live a more open and free life as a gay man. \nAnton Bakunin - Anton had a rough upbringing, finding it a lot harder to hide who he is as a gay man. An Eastern European immigrant who fled his home where being gay can result in being 'vanished', Anton came to the UK to try and find peace. Unfortunately, homophobia isn't just something that happens 'somewhere else'. \nMelissa 'Mel' Carter - Mel is a garage worker in Manchester, and is dating Bri. They are attendees of the support group after the pair were attacked by homophobes on a tram.  Mel is very tough, and has been harbouring a lot of anger over the surprise attack they suffered, and is eager to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n Bryony 'Bri' Stonehouse - Manchester born and bred, Bri has been dating Mel for nearly two years now. She also felt more anger than anything else after they were attacked, but she abhors violence entirely. Instead, Bri uses her smarts and community spirit to build the community support group stronger than ever before. \nCallum 'Cal' Wilkes - Cal came out much later in life, as his life in a biker gang didn't feel like the safest place to be openly gay. In fact, it turned out he was right when he did get outed to his gang and he wound up kicked out and alone. Struggling at first to find his tribe after this rejection, Cal is now a regular of Manchester's leather scene and brings his gruff, take-no-guff attitude to the local queer community. \nQueenie Iwobi - Queenie is a trans woman from a Nigerian family, she moved from her home in London to Manchester for council work years ago. Now, she takes part in the support group as a way of managing the daily micro-aggressions she faces as a proud trans WOC in this world, and to help support others like her. Also not a fan of violence, she joins Bri at the homebase, creating a helpful, safe space for the community and using her skills as a community support worker. \nAlbert 'Alby' Prince - a 16 year old trans masc kid, Alby has been sneaking out to the gay scene for a while to find a safe space to be their authentic self, away from their home where they are not out. Alby became a big fan of Bi's shows, and Bi took them under her wing so she could make sure Alby was having a safe experience. Alby prefers he/him or they/them pronouns, but is not yet out to their family.\nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nContent Warning\nWe are aware that the topic of hate crimes, bigotry and assault are sensitive topics, that we as a queer community often face far too often. Sensitive to this, the book will contain content warnings so that readers can be aware going in what to expect. \nWe are also aware that it can be annoying to be seen as just the victims all the time. And while there can be a lot of emotions that are discussed after these kind of things, one emotion is often overlooked or swept-under-the-rug: anger. \nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nSometimes when we see these things happen, or when they happen to us, there can be a strong sense of justified anger, and we look at that through the medium of revenge fantasy grindhouse action and explore what sense of resolution or satisfaction can be found there. \nAll the while telling an entertaining, thoughtful action story in a very modern world. We'll have fun, but won't be making fun. \nWho's It For?\nHave you ever seen the news and just felt so angry? Then you, for sure. \nBut seriously, I think anyone who has felt that kind of strong reaction to things that happen in the world, whether it be a story of injustice they've seen in the news, or an article of a hate-fuelled attack, or worse, have had personal experience with that; I think anyone who relates to that will find something to relate to in Glitter Vipers. \nQueenie Iwobi by Katie Fleming\nAnyone who has stood up to or is aware of organised hate, systemic violence and bigotry in this world can maybe find something in Glitter Vipers that speaks to them. We've all felt angry: this is about our right to that rage, and finding an outlet for it.\nWe all get told that we should not let that anger rise, that we don't have the right to our anger or how lashing out is wrong, but see the same things happen again and again. Glitter Vipers will explore that anger, it's justification and how it too can have a role in recovery, for good or ill.\nGenerally suitable for teens aged 16 years of age or older, the book has some light use of course language, violence, and as mentioned, sensitive topics around bigotry, hate crimes and assault. If you are buying for someone else, please do bare that in mind. \nCover by James Gifford\nWho's Making It?\nOne thing that we wanted to achieve with this book was the keep the whole creative team as queer identifying people. It's an LGBTQIA+ focused story, so it only felt right to have it be made by LGBTQIA+ people. \nThe team is as follows:-\nJoe Glass - Writer\n Joe Glass - Joe is the writer and co-creator of popular LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series, The Pride, now a successful ComiXology Originals series. He's also the writer of Acceptable Losses, a mature, political thriller with a dark edge. Most recently, he's worked with RuPaul's Drag Race star Manila Luzon on a countdown Instagram comic for her single, Robbed! Joe lives in South Wales with his family, and a petulant cat named Oliver. You can find his website here. \nKatie Fleming - Art\n Katie Fleming - Katie Fleming is a queer artist from Dublin, Ireland.  She began creating comics with her Partner with their LGBTQ+ comic '100 Times' and '100 More Times'.  since then she's worked on numerous anthologies and comics, such as 'Heart of Steal', 'The Black Rubric' and the webcomic, 'Ship Wrecked'. Glitter Vipers is her first graphic novel and she's super excited. When she's not making comics she's spending her time as a Werewolf. Her work can be found here. \n Kelly Fitzpatrick - Kelly Fitzpatrick is known for her work on books such as: Bitch Planet, Supergirl: Being Super, Wonder Woman: Tempest Tossed, Shade the Changing Girl, DC: Bombshells, Archie, and Josie and the Pussycats. Nominated for the esteemed Hugo awards, she is also a past nominee for Autostraddle, Ghastly & Prism awards and has worked on titles nominated for the GLAAD and the Harvey awards. Her client list is available on her website and includes such prestigious publishers as DC Comics, Archie Comics & Dark Horse Comics. \nLucas Gattoni - Letters\n Lucas Gattoni - Lucas Gattoni is a seasoned graphic designer and typesetter now pursuing his dream job of comic book lettering. He has lettered GLAAD nominated Liebestrasse for ComiXology Originals, Twin Worlds for Action Lab, Eskimo Kisses for Scout Comics and is currently lettering the Spanish version of Sonic The Hedgehog for IDW. He lives in his home country of Argentina with his husband and their three unnamed goldfish (oops, make that two now). His website is here.\nTed Brandt - Editor\n Ted Brandt - Ted Brandt is best known as an inker, working with his partner Ro on the Eisner- and GLAAD-nominated CROWDED from Image Comics. He likes long walks on the beach, and eating too much pizza. Ted is using his editorial hat on Glitter Vipers to help make the book the best it can be. \nJames Gifford - Cover Artist\n James Gifford - James Gifford is a cis gay illustrator and storyboard artist who lives in London. He's a wayward pirate, plundering whatever illustration jobs he runs ashore on, never resting in one spot for long. A lone creative, a side-spitting gunslinger. The moment you think you have him pinned, he slips through your fingers like smoke. He's earned coin from Cartoon Network and Marvel comics and is currently creating content for Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. You'll chip your teeth on his tough exterior, but deep down his heart is gold. His website is here. \nSpire Eaton - Spire is a graphic designer, artist, animator and comic creator based in Florida. He designed the Glitter Vipers logo for the book. That fabulousness is all down to him! You can check out his work here.\nHow Far Along Is It?\nAt time of launching the campaign, the book is entirely written, final inks are done for about roughly 20% of the book, with a further dozen pages ahead prepped too, and colours and cover work is starting in conjunction as the rest of the pages are drawn.\nAlby Prince by Katie Fleming\nWe estimate that by the end of the campaign the book will be half way or more complete, and have allowed a roomy space of months between campaign end and delivery in an effort to ensure prompt delivery of the finished product. \nBy following and/or backing the campaign, we will keep you updated with new pages and art as they happen, so you'll be the first to see more as it comes!\n How is the Money Spent?\nA Breakdown of How the Goal Amount is Split\nThe majority of the goal amount is to pay for the art production of Glitter Vipers: this includes the drawing/inking, the colours and the design elements of putting the book together. \nThe next biggest elements are the printing costs (currently based on a modest-to-large print run) and the shipping costs of sending copies out to those who back for physical reward tiers. Costs of shipping have been worked out based on impending Royal Mail price changes taking effect on July 1st 2020. Due to COVID-19 and changes in legislation for USPS in America, international shipping will be rising significantly, but we are baring this in mind in the planned goal amount and postage prices. \nThe smallest element is to go on extra rewards elements, like the stickers. \nAs such, the greatest overall chunk of the the goal amount we are asking for is to cover the production cost and to make sure our art team get a good, speedy payment for their hard work. \nSample colours by Kelly Fitzpatrick\nWhat Can I Get?\nWell, naturally we are looking to provide both digital and print options of the book as reward tiers. In this day and age, there's no excuse to not offer both options to backers, so both will be readily available. \nThere is also a tier to get multiple copies of the book, at a discounted price! This is primarily for comic stores that would like to support and stock the book, but also libraries and heck, if a group of friends all want to support but are on a budget, or you think you know a group of friends or family who'd all be interested in a copy, you can back at that level to get multiple copies at discount. This level is limited.  \nThere are options to get signed copies of the book, signed by writer Joe Glass, but again these are limited due to the time and energy taken in signing a lot of books can take.\nWe also have Glitter Vipers stickers available, so you can grab reward tiers with those included. \nSample of the Embroidered Patch\nOr, why not grab an embroidered Glitter Vipers patch! This is a very limited reward tier, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get it while you can! \nPlus, there's just the positive energy of knowing you've supported a great, queer focused comic project by queer creators, and that's worth everything, right! \nFinally, we have been sure to include the price of postage so when you back, you'll know exactly how much it will be in total. We've based the postage prices on the updated Royal Mail pricing coming into effect on July 1st, 2020, based on the planned sizing of the book and estimated weight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes life gets in the way, and unforeseen obstacles pop up causing a delay in getting the products shipped in time. In this campaign, we have estimated a lot of time for completion and printing, so all things being equal there shouldn't be a delay to the books going out, but as ever, it is an estimate. \n\nLikewise, as far as postage goes, we have sourced good, strong, tough packaging that should withstand any handling from delivery services. Similarly, we have taken into account the new postal rates for sending to the United States from the UK, and have priced accordingly. This does mean International postage costs are higher, but with the changes in USPS and increases in general post costs due to COVID-19, it is worked out to be as fair and cheap as possible, while still maintaining a relatively speedy and well-handled delivery. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the goal amount: while it can seem large, the goal is what it is to allow for making sure the team are all paid fairly for the books production, the printing of a good sized print run and shipping. The biggest help to overcome this challenge is to share and spread the word of the campaign, so for all of you deciding to support, we hope you can help us in spreading the word too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Our unending thanks for helping us on our fight back!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "A digital copy of Glitter Vipers\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["195 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Print Copy", "descp": "You'll get a print copy of the book and a digital copy too!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a314 or more", "title": "Sticker!", "descp": "At this level, as well as your print and digital copies of Glitter Vipers, you'll be able to mark your membership to the GV gang with a shiny holo-sticker!

The event is excited for its 4th year and is organized by WabiSabiZinez and Pat Rielly. NYCQCF is proudly hosted by BGSQD.\nDoable Guys and Ship Jumper Comic\nWhat have people have said?\nDanial Stalter attended last year for the first time and said, \"I have grown to love small conventions with low table prices. When they cater to niche markets and communities that I\u2019m a part of, that\u2019s even better.\" And, \"[NYCQCF is] a great opportunity to meet a bunch of other queer creators in a way that I don\u2019t always get to when tabling.\"\nIn 2017 Hornet reported on the fair, highlighting eleven of the show's participants.\nAlso in 2017, the creator of the NYCQCF popped up on Comic Book Bears podcast to discuss the fair and its participants with the hosts. \nArtist James Dillenbeck liked the show so much he did the cover art for the Kickstarter this year!\nJohn Jenson cavorting with creator of Kyle's Bed and Breakfast\nWhen and where is it?\nThe event will be hosted by The Bureau of General Services Queer Division (BGSQD) on Saturday and Sunday, April 11th-12th, from 1-7pm each day.\nThe Bureau of General Services Queer Division (BGSQD) is located on the second floor of The LGBT Center NYC (208 W 13th St).\nCome in costume for a free zine!\nHow do I participate?\nBack this project at the vendor level to participate!\nSpace is limited to sixteen vendors each day. Tables are shared, with each vendor getting about 2 1/2 ft. by 2 1/2 ft. 100% of funds raised go to space, promotional materials, advertising, and Kickstarter fees. There are no refunds for vendors who cancel after the Kickstarter has ended.\nThe NYCQCF is dedicated to staying small and only using queer spaces; we believe in keeping costs as low as possible and providing the best possible experience for building community. If you wish to vend but cannot afford the table cost, contact us through this page and hardship accommodations may be reached. If you know artists who would improve the diversity of the show, help build community, or simply need to have their work seen put them in contact.\nThe NYCQCF does take volunteers. Mostly we need folks to direct traffic, hand out programs, and count heads. Additionally, it would a great help to have folks promoting on their campuses, social groups, and social media; contact us if you would like digital flyers or content to print and distribute. \nCarlo Quispe of Uranus Comics and contributor to World War 3 magazine,\nNew Addition: A Zine Anthology\nThis year we are proud to add an anthology zine as part of the fair. All of the funds raised by the zine go directly to promoting the fair, which means promoting the artists who make the fair happen! As a result, we are adding a backer level for the zine; that means, even if you can't be with us physically, you can join the fun with an 5.5x8.5 hand assembled zine. \nIn addition to the artists at the fair, the zine will feature artists who couldn't be with us this year.

Featuring three characters who are crafty, testy, and human, SOME STRANGE DISTURBANCES situates itself amongst Victorian horror legends like Mary Shelley, Edgar Allen Poe and others. \nFrom SOME STRANGE DISTURBANCES #1\nThis series is dear to my heart, as it is incredibly important for members of the LGBTQ community to see themselves as thriving, surviving characters in fictive works, but it is also incredibly important for members of the LGBTQ community to understand the history of oppression we have faced & overcome & continue to struggle against. Straight allies, we'd love to have you along for the ride, too; there's a lot for you here. You can equally enjoy & learn from this series as well.\nFor those of you new to the series:\nThe setting of Victorian London opens a lot of avenues for social commentary about the present day. In addition, the story is populated with characters who are indelible:\nPrescott Mayfair, a closeted homosexual hiding from his family in America AND from the police in London, where being gay is an arrestable offense. Prescott comes from a line of psychics (usually the women in his family), and he is still not sure he accepts this gift.\nDelilah Quinton, a black choral performer now in London as part of a sponsored choral group. Performing nightly, she uses her experiences from travelling across the United States with the Great Negro Mesmerist, Lord DuBois. In Victorian London, race is handled differently: as long as you are of a certain class, skin color is irrelevant. So as a celebrity, Miss Quinton has many privileges not afforded to others of her culture.\nThe Comtesse, a young woman thought to be possessed by her parents. They hire Prescott to investigate if she is lost to them. But the Comtesse has a deeper story that would be spoiled here.\nPLAN OF ACTION\nHere are a few reviews of Volume 1, The Rat King of Bedlam:\nhttp://highlowcomics.blogspot.com/2019/06/hurd-mckenney-gervasio-aon-some-strange.html\nhttp://www.roguesportal.com/review-some-strange-disturbances-1/\nhttps://graphicpolicy.com/2019/09/14/review-some-strange-disturbances/?fbclid=IwAR3rQwnWsdv1FAvIXcP5Jf7cGtHdm51X7OCTabMaGsqtHs9NSMEhwhoAutk\nFrom SOME STRANGE DISTURBANCES #1\nVolume 2, THE LUNCHROOM UNDER THE ARCH, will be a 100-page, b&w graphic novel written by Craig Hurd-McKenney and illustrated by Gervasio & Carlos Aon, Cover by Tyler Smith Owings, Graphic Design by Keeli McCarthy, and Editorial Assistance by Shon Bacon. NOTE: All funds raised in the campaign will go to pay Gervasio and Carlos for their artwork. You & your pre-orders are vital to this project's growth! UPDATE: If we go over the proposed $6000, all extra funds will go to the artists, up to $10,000 total. Beyond that, funds will go to paying the graphic designer. I will cover any remaining costs, like the cost of the cover artwork, editorial & design fees, printing, and marketing/ shipping/ distribution that we do not make in the campaign. \nFrom SOME STRANGE DISTURBANCES #1\nKickstarter Supporter Rewards...\nTote Bag\n Lovely canvas tote with the Headless Shakespeare Press logo, designed by Constance Kwinn.\nHeadless Shakespeare Press Logo Tote\nPaper Dolls by Gervasio & Carlos Aon\nWith this tier, you'll get a paperdoll set of all three main characters!\nPrescott Mayfair Paper Doll\nThe Comtesse Paper Doll\nDelilah Quinton Paper Doll\nArt Prints\nYou have four prints to choose from, and they are all wonderful interpretations of the SSD world!\nPrint 1 is by Dietrich O Smith, artist on \"Victor LaValle's Destroyer,\" a modern \"sequel\" to Frankenstein.\nArt Print by Dietrich Smith (Not Final Version)\n Print 2 is by Katie Skelly, creator of \"My Pretty Vampire.\" Katie's women are smart, sexy and not taking your >bleep<.\nArt print by Katie Skelly\n Print 3 is by Richard Case, artist on Grant Morrison's \"Doom Patrol,\" \"Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme,\" and others.

This book features 24 stories about first dates, sneaky feelings, awkward moments, flights of fancy, and the kind of self-discovery that only queer romance can deliver.  Crush will be co-edited by Tara Madison Avery (We're Still Here, ALPHABET, The Transgender Heroes Coloring Book) and Viktor Kerney (Strangelore, Prism Comics board member), and the book will feature over 200 pages of all-new comics content. Crush will be published by Stacked Deck Press, a publishing house focused on comics and coloring books of queer interest.\ncover design and artwork by Hayden Harwood\nIn order to get out the word about Crush to aficionados of queer comics, Stacked Deck Press will be working with Prism Comics and the City of West Hollywood to promote this very special book. With the help of Prism, we've conducted a talent search for new crop of queer cartoonists, artists, and writers just starting their careers. In particular, we've made a special effort to reach out to creators of emerging identities: asexual, genderqueer, aromantic, polyamorous, and more. The City of West Hollywood will be providing us with a book launch party in the City Council Room at the West Hollywood Public Library as part of their 2019 Pride celebration, where contributors to the book will read their stories from the book.\nfrom \"The Calamansi Tree\" by Jaime Aguilar\nCrush will feature stories from these creators:\nJaime Aguilar\nAmyEYE\natelierMuse\nTate Brombal and V.

Gagnon\nThe stories include tales about a Virtual Rock Star who has a robotic body built to pursue the woman of their dreams, a hesitant \"Third Wheel\" being accepted into a polyamorous relationship, an 18th Century \"Lady\" whose lover rightly accepts him as a lord, and a Master Craftswoman whose Queen desires more from her than just a new means of transportation!\nfrom \"Luminous\" by Letty Wilson\nFirst love is tricky enough when you're straight, but downright confounding when you're on the LGBTQAIU spectrum. Whether you're an Ace discovering that loving a person doesn't have to include sex, a young man having that first relationship with an Older Gentleman that changes the direction of your life, or an Aromantic Demon finding a surprising exception to his fun-only rule, Crush tells stories that ring true to queer experience.\nfrom \"Many Lovers for a First Love\" by Hayden Harwood\nBudget and stretch goals\nOur budget includes funds for printing, manufacturing the backer rewards, shipping, Kickstarter fees, and most importantly creator compensation.

During this Kickstarter campaign we will be preparing the book for print so that it can be sent to the printer immediately upon funding. This will ensure we meet our goals in a timely manner. \n\nWill the rewards packages be ready in time for estimated delivery?\n\nIn the past complicated rewards packages have greatly extended our fulfillment time. Considering this, we have decided to keep our rewards simple. We have experience with sticker sets and tote bags, and vendors already in place to provide them. Crush contributors are already aware that they may be asked to provide original sketches for the backers. The coloring book reward for the Crush Kickstarter campaign will be for one of our already published titles, meaning we will not have any holdups filling backer rewards as we put together a whole new coloring book.\n\nWill the rewards ship in a timely manner?\n\nIn order to ensure prompt shipping, Stacked Deck Press has procured the help of a wholesale shipping service, greatly expediting the shipping process. A simpler rewards package structure will also mean that all of the items for the rewards will be ready upon arrival of the books themselves, further expediting shipping.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tara Avery\n4 created \u00b7 13 backed\nTara Madison Avery published her first professional comic, Faith and Hollywood, in 1991.

Princess Adrienne, whose on a quest to save her sisters, alongside the blacksmith Bedelia, find another princess locked away in a tower and decide to save her. But Princess Raven has plenty of secrets and Adrienne finds herself pitted against her deadliest opponent yet!\nRaven would go on to star in her own critically acclaimed spin-off title, RAVEN: THE PIRATE PRINCESS. This is the perfect hardcover for PRINCELESS and RAVEN fans alike. A great starting point for newcomers who want to see empowering princesses who turn tropes upside down. \nPRINCELESS is a five time Glyph Comics Awards winner and three time Eisner nominee written by Jeremy Whitley. Jeremy has written several other fan-favorite comic book series, including Marvel's The Unstoppable Wasp, Dynamite Entertainment's Rainbow Brite and IDW Publishing's My Little Pony, just to name a few. The Pirate Princess art team features the creative stylings of Ro Stein and Ted Brandt (art team for Crowded by Image Comics). \nWhen asked about the deluxe hardcover, Jeremy Whitley commented, \"It was so nice to finally give the first Raven story the full hardcover treatment. It really is wild that what we started as a free comic book day, eight pages story giveaway, and grew into this arc that not only introduced the world to Raven, but also to the amazing art team of Ro Stein and Ted Brandt. Now with the hardcover collection, readers can see what that evolution looked like as Raven went from being an idea to a character that would launch her own series.\" \nThis volume of PRINCELESS highlights diversity, strength in self, feminism, LGBTQ+ themes and rewrites classic fairy tale tropes in a way suitable for children of all ages.

The series pivots into an adventure of espionage and intrigue while always keeping the humanity of the men present and in front.\nIf you have just found out about Velvet Collar, you can look up info on the series Gay Comic Geek YouTube and T+S Magazine Review \nIssue 2 will be a WHOPPING 44 pages of full-color, original art and story by Byron Power,   Pup Tut and Dave Davenport.  \nBUT FIRST...\nThank you to all our original kick-starter backers and new fans for helping make issue #1 a total success! Upon publication of issue 2, backers who pre-ordered issue 2 will get their promised copy of issue 2 in digital or paper at no additional expense.                                      We remember you and we honor you!\nWith your help, we hope to complete issues #2 and #3!  We appreciate your patience and understanding while health and personal emergencies behind the scenes have been resolved. This was worth the wait!\nABOUT ISSUE 2 AND THE SERIES\nVelvet Collar issue 2, Rough Trade Secrets, picks up two years after the events of issue 1. The five main characters are summoned by a mysterious stranger to find out that their problems are far from over. \n Each character developed in the series comes from real people. Sometimes you will wonder, \"Did this actually happen?\"\nWhen the plot becomes (almost) impossible to believe, the fears, hopes and dreams of real people are seen and felt through the characters you read about. Most of the experiences and choices of the characters come from real choices that workers have had to make. When their experiences and survival is criminalized and exploited, fantasy is often the safest place to tell the truth. Don't you want to find out?\nSince the publication of issue 1, more than fifty real workers from around the world have come in to contribute their thoughts, concerns, jokes and amazing stories to be included in the planned nine issues. Would you be excited if this comic could become a #NetflixSeries? \nThe most wonderful comments have been from people who didn't even know that these professionals existed: \n\"His Daughter actually said that? OMG!\" -Nancy, Helicopter Mom CEO, 60, NYC\n\"I had no idea that guys who did this work could be so different and be happy.\" -Kelly, Insurance Leg Broker, 45, Las Vegas.\n\"This was hot, my friends are really excited to see what's next,\" -Nathan, Retail Surgeon, 24, Miami.\nThis comic series has been driven by real people contributing to the work from day one. That means the men in the business and YOU, our backers, friends and allies.\nThis comic is part of how marginalized voices #Resist. Places to speak openly about LGBTQ+ sexuality, identity, and the overlap with capitalism and politics, are being shut down. Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram and many other places on the internet have been censored, shuttered, or aggressively policed for content threatening to the status quo. How's that working out for everybody? \n Your help supporting this project and others like it are part of how you make a difference. Art and storytelling from marginalized voices is powerful.  And why not make it fun?\nVelvet Collar is the  first comic series to focus on the lives of modern male-identified adult industry workers.  Explicitly, these are experiences of professionals who have voluntarily participated in the industry as legally recognized adults. This is not the same as  those who have entered sex work against their will. The work does not endorse illegal activity. This work talks about what actually happens with both adult industry members and the people they are involved with. \nSPECIAL NEW FEATURES\nWe have signed up more than 40 reaL professionals to be illustrated as characters in upcoming issues. They tell the stories of the workers they represent. Best of all, you can say hello to them on social media! Great icebreaker, right?\nREWARDS AND RISKS\nWe have all the classic awesome rewards plus a few new ones!\nWe have collectible stickers that make great gifts, an additional comic from a another project done by our colorist Byron Power, and a special limited edition collectible from Scott Reynolds, who plays the character Daddy in the series.  More coming!\n WHAT WE NEED THE MONEY FOR\nMAIN GOAL: $8,000\nBecause of the success of issue 1, we are able to keep our costs for production the same for issue 2 and offer more to you. We need $5,000 for the art production, $2000 for printing and $1000 for taxes and materials (envelopes, packaging, promotional materials). \nSTRETCH GOAL, $10,000+\nIssue 3 is planned to be 52 pages.

Two thirds of the comics are from anthologies published over the past ten years; one third is new, unpublished work.\nBACKGROUND:\nI have been self-publishing SHIRTLIFTER since 2006. SHIRTLIFTER is a venue for me to draw comics that explore various aspects of gay culture, and each issue has had its own identity: SHIRTLIFTER  1 was a short story about an ex-pat couple living in Tokyo; SHIRTLIFTER 2 was a collection of short autobiographical pieces that had been created over a five year period, plus some new work; and SHIRTLIFTER 3 - 5 serialized my graphic novel \"Unpacking\", documenting the relationship between a gay guy and a straight, married man.\nSHIRTLIFTER 6 is a sequel of sorts to the second issue, featuring a number of autobiographical short pieces authored over the past 10 years. I'm sort of an accidental autobiographer; when I started doing comics I really had no intention of doing them, and the majority of pages I have produced over the 17 years I have been drawing comics are straight up fiction. However, when thinking about stories, sometimes the issues I want to bring up are ones in which I have personal experience; in that context, inventing some thinly-veiled fictional avatar to stand in for me seems pointless. There is a power in having the events be real, or as \"real\" as my biased perspective can possibly make them. Fictionalization is an inescapable part of all memoir, and these comics are no different: people have been combined, dialogue has been invented or distorted by memory, body fat has been trimmed down. The results are emotionally and thematically accurate to the events of my life, if always literally true.\nVacant Lots\nTwo thirds of this book consists of short pieces that were created and published in anthologies between 2008 and 2018. Some of these anthologies, such as  QU33R  and ALPHABET, were comics focused, while others, such as I LIKE IT LIKE THAT and QUEERS WERE HERE, were prose-oriented but asked me to contribute. Much of this work has been been virtually unseen, and the two stories from prose anthologies are appearing in color for the first time.\nOne of the Guys\nSHIRTLIFTER 6 will also include a 17 page suite of extremely short stories that I have worked on in collaboration with my husband, Todd Brower. This group of short short stories, between 1 - 4 pages in length, are an attempt to show, in a humorous way, the dynamics of our relationship. The back and forth in the comics mirrors the back and forth between us in writing these stories; at this  point I honestly don't know who wrote what; both of us generated ideas and scripts, and then watched as the other revised the other's ideas, changed dialogue, changed ending. It's definitely a product of both of us, which is appropriate, given the subject matter. \nDeath Shark\nFunicul\u00ec! Funicul\u00e0!\nTodd also wrote two of the other stories in this collection, \"Food for Thought\" and \"Ex Communication\" the latter of which was included in the BEST AMERICAN COMICS 2010 anthology. \nEx Communication\nI'm very happy to be able to finally have enough autobiographical material to fill another issue. The next project I will be working on is fiction, so it will be a while before I do any more autobiographical comics. Then again, when I started out I had not intention of doing any, so who knows? I shouldn't make promises I might not keep.\nThe Shortest Distance\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nThe goal for the campaign is the minimum needed to cover the printing costs. If the campaign exceeds the minimum, the following stretch goals will become possible.\n$4000 - Improved paper stock\n$5000 - Exclusive print to all backers at the $10 level and above\nOmisoka", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the second Kickstarter I have run by myself, in addition to assisting with my publisher Northwest Press to collect my Unpacking story into one graphic novel.

The issue is almost, but not-quite, finished as this Kickstarter is being launched, and I anticipate having books back from the printer by mid-May. This means backers should have their ebooks, signed copies and prints by the end of May (international orders will take slightly longer).

It will be standard comic book size, with the book being printed at 6.7\u201d x 10.2\" with a color cover. Recommend for ages 13 and over as there are adult themes. \nJoin our narrator who goes by only the name \"The Janitor\u201d, as he cleans out his huge hallway of closets and dishes about some pretty interesting secrets found along the way. This mysterious figure weaves you through the first of, what I hope is, many issues of this ongoing series with tales titled: \n\"Departure with a Kiss\" - Two young girls share their first kiss, but will it be the kiss of death for them?\n\"A Contract with God\" - A devout man finds that some things you do or don't do on earth really do matter in the afterlife. \n\"Love Afterlife\u201d, a tale about two young boys who find love after meeting a zombie who served in WWII.\nPlus, extra content and bonus activity  pages. \nInspirations for this series are very much old EC comics, Tales from the Crypt, Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, Tales From the Dark Side, Haunted House and many, many more! I remember reading those tales and their portrayal\u2019s of queer characters as stereotypical tropes - like the wife's hair dresser, who the husband kills because he is jealous and thinks they are lovers. I want to take stories like that and make the queer characters the protagonist and not always the victim. However, as it is horror, I can't promise that will always be the case!  \nNow for the budgeting. The money raised by this Kickstarter will be broken down in the approximate ways: \nPrinting of the THE CLOSET OF SECRETS #1 and other rewards $1230\nKickstarter Fees $200\nShipping and Handling $200\nAny money raised over the Kickstarter Goal will be used to attend comic cons and art fairs to promote and sell more copies of THE CLOSET OF SECRETS #1 and ensure that we get a second issue. \n$2500-The ability to order a larger number of books at a higher discount. It will also cover some of the costs associated to tabling at convention so that I can share this book with more people after the Kickstarter ends. If this goal is reached I will add a preview of \"Moon Pack\" a future CLOSET OF SECRETS story.\n$4000-The creation of a website and the ability to attend cons more and larger comic conventions. If this goal is met I will add a \"Fan Club\" Package to each person who donated above the $10 level and selected to have something shipped to them. \nI've been making comics and zines since 2009. Most of my work has been around my battle with cancer and comics that deal with narratives around medicine. Even in these early works, you can see my love for monsters and horror comics with the use of a \"tumor monster\" to represent the disease. Through this work, I\u2019ve slowly started creating one-off tales that encompass more bizarre and supernatural themes. In 2015, I produced Astonishing Queer Tales, a group of zines that focused on horror, crime and bizarre stories that focused on the queer community. Some stories were based on facts, like the story of \"The Doodler\u201d, a real serial killer who was active in the 1970's and was never captured. Others were more far out stories like \"Pocket Monster\", about a night out in Brooklyn that that ends badly. These books were the precursor to this larger project that I'm so excited to share with you. \nREWARDS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter so I'm sure there is something I have forgotten! But that said, I have worked on a lot of projects and feel that I am in a good place with this book. As the comic is in the final editing phase, I don\u2019t foresee any risks. I just need your support to allow me to share this with the world!\nWith the release of this Kickstarter, the illustrations for the book are all complete and I'm in the final editing phase.\nMy main concern is shipping as I have heard nightmares about high shipping costs, both domestically and internationally and just not gathering the proper information from backers. But I have plans in place and will tackle each challenge as they come to make sure that backers are as satisfied and as excited about this project as I am.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Put Me In The Closet!

Both contextually and metatextually focusing on improved representation and diversity for the community in the superhero format, the comic follows the formation of the team, the individual heroes' personal trials and tribulations and their conflict with a world-threatening villain that they may be the only heroes around capable of stopping. \nJoin FabMan, Wolf, Twink, Bear, Angel, Frost, Muscle Mary, White Trash and Cub as they come together to face off against prejudice, the media and of course dastardly super-villains. And then follow them through further adventures as they tackle lucky thieves, bullying, revenge-killers and even a giant evil drag queen. \nThe Pride brings all sorts of crazy, fun, wild superhero story adventures for anyone to enjoy. \nWhat else is it about?\nIt's also an awesome superhero adventure series consisting a long form main adventure and a series of smaller adventures that build on character and the general drama in a colourful, bright and positive way. \nThe Pride by Ricardo Bessa\nThe paperback book will contain The Pride #1-6, The Pride Adventures #1-4 and behind-the-scenes sketches and designs! 280 pages, at an incredible price!\nWait, you have representation?\nYup, representation is vitally important. Feeling like you are being seen and catered for is a hugely powerful feeling, and despite so many of the LGBTQ+ community being fans of superhero comics and films, it's rare to see people just like them in the medium. \nThe Pride aims to change that, with queer heroes as text rather than subtext, and the community as the heroes instead of victims. Featuring gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer, gender-fluid, drag queens and straight characters working together, and creating a world with the scope to continue building and include more; inclusiveness is a key factor in the series. \nSo if you've ever felt like it would be nice to see more of yourself in superhero characters and adventures, then The Pride is for you. And it's also pretty accessible to broad range of ages and demographics whether part of the LGBTQ+ community or not...The Pride is really here for everyone. \nThe Pride by Kris Anka\nDidn't The Pride get collected before?\nYes, The Pride was successfully Kickstartered and collected as a gorgeous hardcover collection in 2016. \nHowever, this hardcover is now all but sold out, and it's time to restock with a new edition. \nThis time, we're going paperback, to create something that takes up slightly less shelf-space and is available at a much cheaper price to make it accessible to even more people.\nThe Pride Volume One Paperback edition will contain The Pride #1-6, The Pride Adventures #1-4 and all the behind-the-scenes content of sketches, designs and more, so you'll be getting all that amazing content at an incredible price. \nThe Pride by Cory Smith\nSo why Kickstarter?\nThis campaign is just to raise the funds to cover the print costs for this new edition, so I can keep bringing The Pride to more people who want and need it, in a new, inexpensive and accessible format. \nNo new content to be produced, no new merchandise to produce, just a simple fund raise to cover printing costs for a new edition of the first volume of the LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series only. As such, I'll be running it much more streamlined and straight-forward than usual. \nAs you'll see there are just a handful of reward options, for a copy of the book digitally or in the new paperback edition; or with the latest issue The Pride Adventures #5 to add with your book, and even a special option to get a batch of five copies, ideal for stores or groups looking to get the series. \nThe button badges designs!\nThere's also options to get the book with bookmarks, buttons and some our fabulous enamel pins!\nBear Pin, designed by Gavin Mitchell\nAngel Pin, designed by Gavin Mitchell\nAlso, for all single copy tiers, there's free UK shipping!\nSo please consider joining us on this journey to have fun, accessible and inclusive superhero stories that everyone can enjoy. \nThe Pride by Jamal Campbell\nAbout the creator\nI'm Joe Glass, the writer and creator of The Pride. I wrote the majority of the series, with two shorts written by Mike Garley and PJ Montgomery in Volume One. I've been making The Pride for around eight years now, and have seen the series go from humble beginnings to an international and broad audience of readers the world over. \nWith a wide team of incredible creators (a full list can be found below), I put the series together as it was something I wanted to see in comics, both now and when I was a teen coming to terms with my own sexuality and finding solace in comic books. \nMuscle Mary by Kris Anka\nI've run several campaigns in the past, including the hardcover edition of the first volume, a special limited edition pin design, and recently the very first new issue of content in the series. All have been successful, and have either already been fully fulfilled or will be shortly. \nMy hope is to keep bringing inclusive, diverse comics out that everyone can enjoy, and for those under-represented by the medium to feel they can be part of it too. And all the while, have fun and be positive in my superhero stories. \nPraise for The Pride\nThe Pride #1 was one of the Top 25 Best Selling ComiXology Submit Titles of 2014. \n\"You should support The Pride because it's an important book, but you should REALLY support it because it's a great read. Fun, smart, high-stakes, but above all heartfelt - full of rich, complex characters sure to become some of your new favorite superheroes.\" - Scott Snyder, Batman, Justice League, Wytches\n\"I highly recommend this smart, charming, wonderful book to anyone who likes good comics.

All the characters are fleshed out and drawn with charm & care. Amazing storylines that impact many. I hope more amazing team members get introduced & involved, soon! Also: FabMan, Cub, Wolf, and many more on the Pride team are definitely a team that's got your back & I'm glad they've got mine.\" - Elijah Knight, GeeksOUT\nThe Pride Adventures #4 cover by Hamish Steele\n\"The Pride is immediately appealing with its range of characters that play off of superhero and queer community archetypes. What surprised me was how these archetypes developed into the nuanced characters, brutally honest storylines and complex relationships that any superhero comic would be envious of.\" - Hamish Steele, Deadendia, Pantheon, Eisner winner of the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award 2018\nThe Pride Adventures #2 art by Christian Wildgoose & Ben Wilsonham. Letters by Mike Stock.\n\"The Pride is the kind of book that makes you realize, there was something missing all along and you hadn't known it. Its colorful, energetic nature only serves to underscore its nuanced emotional core.\" - Vita Ayala, The Wilds, Livewire, Supergirl)\n\"You don't have to be LGBTQ+ to enjoy these comics.

Photo: Jeff Knutson.\nWhy a cooking show with drag queens?\nCooking and drag have so much in common - whether you're getting dolled up or rolling the dough out, you take different elements and put it all together to come up with a fabulous new creation.\nWe believe food doesn\u2019t just nourish the body, it feeds the soul. When you make a meal with someone you also share your heart and mind with them and that\u2019s the bond we are trying to create between the drag queen and the audience. Won\u2019t you have a seat at our table?\nA drag queen is anyone who transforms themselves into a beautiful creature of their own imagination.  Here at Feast of Fun, we're all about telling the stories of amazing artists, sexual and gender pioneers who draw with all the crayons in the box. We believe deeply that LGBT folks have our own unique culture, and we want to present exciting drinks, meals and desserts that use all the spices in the rack.\nDrag is fierce and delicious! Think of Cooking with Drag Queens as RuPaul meets Martha Stewart. \nHi I'm Fausto Fernos and I'm Marc Felion. For the past 13 years we've interviewed the world's most beloved drag queens on our award winning podcast Feast of Fun. As a way to showcase the amazing talent coming through our home we created Cooking with Drag Queens, a traditional cooking show that examines the lives of extraordinary performers. Although the concept of a cooking show with drag queens seems like an unusual mix, it fits together like peanut butter and chocolate.\nWhen we started Cooking with Drag Queens we had no idea that it would be an ongoing series like this but the audience is definitely hungry for more episodes and we can\u2019t let the children go hungry. So, today, we\u2019re happy to announce we are ready to launch Season 3 of Cooking with Drag Queens with exciting new episodes, recipes, challenges and more of what you love: beautiful creatures of their own imagination making scrumptious foods and lovely libations.\nDraw with all the crayons in the box, cook with all the spices on the rack.\n\nAt Cooking with Drag Queens, not only do we like to use fresh ingredients, we also like to use fresh ideas so this season we have a lot of exciting things happening in the kitchen- including a wider variety of shows and more experimentation with the show format.\nIn order to put out fabulous new videos, we\u2019ll need the following ingredients:\nVideo Editors and Direction. \nProfessional multi-camera crew. \nLighting & Sound technicians.\nHard drive storage, video camera and sound equipment.  \nFood.\nTravel and Accommodation costs.\nOUR GOAL: $20,000.\nREWARDS: Every person who tips us $3 dollars or more gets to see the new episodes before anyone else, and gets their names in the closing credits. Get your drag name up in lights as producer in the opening title sequence. Visit the set while we\u2019re taping or come on a skype date with us. Check out our digital media rewards, where you can access all the past shows of Cooking with Drag Queens, our podcasts, behind the scenes photos and wallpaper for your phone.\nNew Reward! A Phone Call with Vivacious\nMother (SNAP) is calling! Spend a hour on the phone with Vivacious from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 6. Get all the hot tea as you kiki on the phone on the party line with Vivacious, Fausto & Marc.\nStretch goal: An explosive drag queen cooking competition.  If we manage to reach our first stretch goal of $23,000, we\u2019ll film a drag queen cooking competition, where two queens battle it out to become the queen of the kitchen. And they will be harshly and unfairly judged by two campy, TV celebrity chefs! \nMore money means more episodes with more gals. Give big to support the project and you\u2019ll get great rewards: Cooking with Drag Queens aprons, refrigerator magnets, tote bags, t-shirts and more.\nWith your support, Cooking with Drag Queens will be a community funded program that will be free to watch online, to anyone around the world.\nWe\u2019ll introduce so many new and amazing gals to the world. The drag queens deserve it, and so do you.\nPlease share this video with your friends, blog about it, or send in your own testimonial video in drag. Can I get a bon app\u00e9tit up in here?

You can Make it Happen!\nWith your help on Kickstarter, we can make issue #1 a reality!\n32 pages of full color, original art and story.\nAbout Issue #1 and the Series\nEach story and character in the series are drawn from real stories of male escorts and adult performers. They may not have superpowers, but they have charisma, nerve, determination to give their lives agency.\nPeople who are sex workers rarely get a serious place in comic books. Their roles have traditionally been limited to victims, criminals, or as secondary characters with limited development. Their personalities, life choices and decision making are never fully realized.\nWhile a rare selection of titles have had protagonists that are sex workers, they have been primarily female roles with limited agency. For example, in Chester Brown's famous Paying For It, the author strips away any individual identifying features, personalities and human essence from the women he meets in his encounters. Velvet Collar puts the color and life back into the people. \nVelvet Collar would be the first comic series to focus not only on the lives of modern adult industry workers, but specifically on male-identified individuals. Explicitly, these are experiences of professionals who have voluntarily participated in the industry as legally recognized adults. This is not the same as those who have entered sex work against their will (human trafficking victims and involuntary participation.) The work does not endorse illegal activity. This work talks about what actually happens with both adult industry members and the people they are involved with.\nIn consulting male escorts for this project, one professional had this to say:\n\"Most of us treat what we do as a job, like any other. We try to pay our bills and our taxes, and we plan for the future. We have people we take care of and little luxuries we want to enjoy.\"\n\"I want your comic to become reality because I want people to know what our lives are like, and to have fun with it. Plus, the drawings are really fun.\"\nUltimately, this series is about the relationships that male adult industry performers have with their audience, with their loved ones, and with themselves.\nWith art done in bold, vibrant colors and a dialogue with a natural rhythm, these stories come to life. We want to push the  genres of political observation, queer male erotica, political observations and action adventure.\nDiverse Lives Brought to Life in Full Color\n  Real Stories that have to be lived to be Believed\nAbout the Art and the Writing\nThe author, Bryan Knight, was inspired by the real stories of modern male sex workers in America. His style has been influenced by descriptive prose masters such as Ray Bradbury and humorist observers like John Kennedy Toole and Mark Twain. This issue and series will be his first published comic project.\nThe artist, Dave Davenport, who has authored and illustrated individual titles and for series such as Hard to Swallow, and recently Damaged, has come to this project with confidence and enthusiasm. With bold watercolors, exciting line weights and panel layouts, and an excellent sense of visual and emotional pacing, he knows how to make art that will make you go 'wow.'\nREWARDS\nWe are offering a bunch of amazing rewards around Velvet Collar, in digital and print formats.\nPledge Rewards!\nGOALS\nWe are seeking $8,000 as our minimum target to produce the first issue, including $5,000 for the artwork, $2,000 for the publication costs (including printing and shipping) about $750 for Kickstarter fees.\nStretch goals\nIf this project really excites you, we can go for $10,000.\nThis would go a long way to producing Issue 2!\nWe will add 2-4 extra pages to issue 1\nAnd it would cover promotional copies and more", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first issue is more than two-thirds complete.\nOnce we reach our goal, we will be able to commence printing and distribution.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Curious Reader", "descp": "A Digital Or Paper Copy of Issue #1!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Fan Reward", "descp": "A Digital AND a paper copy of Issue #1\nplus\n8 pages of original art from the making-of.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Excited Fan Reward", "descp": "Everything from Fan Rewards, plus\nan Autographed copy of Issue #1,\nand a pre-order for issue #2!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Hero Reward", "descp": "Items from the Hero Reward plus\nan original bust sketch from the comic artist, Dave Daveport.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Limited (20 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "Movie Star", "descp": "You get everything from the Excited Fan/Hero and you get to be drawn as a cameo character in issue 2!\n(choose Hero, Villain, or Fool.

And yes, some of the art will have a bit of nudity and mild sexuality. This is a coloring book for Grown-Ups.\nTwo satirical coloring books\nWhy I'm Doing This\nI created these books because adult coloring books are an accessible, non-threatening way to poke fun at American culture.

Although we may have disagreements over the direction of the country, I very much believe in the USA's ability to be a force for positive change for all its citizens and throughout in the world.\nSample pages from Socially-Conscious White Ladies\nI also believe that positive change starts from within and the first step on that path is honesty about the problems we face. These coloring books are intended to point out what I see as problems that need to be addressed. I'm not telling anyone what to do. I'm simply offering my perspective and opinions on where we are as country and I'm doing it with a healthy dose of humor. \nThe Plan\nMy goal is to print and ship Socially-Conscious White Ladies by the end of November 2017.\nSocially-Conscious White Ladies Coloring and Activity Book\n8.5\"x11\", 44 pages\nColor cover with B&W interior\nPaperback\nI'm aiming to raise at least $4,000.

This project is a book of new stories by creators from the first anthology, entitled The Secret Loves of Geek Girls: Redux.\nThe Secret Loves of Geek Girls was a collection of comics, prose, and illustrations all on the themes of dating as a geek. The collection was full of stories from comic creators, sci-fi writers, videogame designers, cosplayers, and fans! The stories were a diverse range on different topics from first dates to discovering your sexuality and they've touched the hearts of people the world over. And this redux project will be the same! \nCover art by Jenn Woodall (not final cover)\nBeing Part of Kickstarter Gold\nKickstarter has meant the world to my projects, helping me bring back lost treasures of Canadian 1940s comic history (Nelvana of the Northern Lights, Brok Windsor), 1980s independent comics (Fashion In Action), and new collections (The Secret Loves of Geek Girls, A Minyen Yidn) showcasing unique themes and stories by talented creators.\nIt's more than fair to say I wouldn't be in publishing or have a career if it wasn't for this platform! I certainly wouldn't be a Kickstarter Thought Leader. Thank you to every person who has helped to support me so far, and those who are joining me for the first time!\nTo celebrate the good that Kickstarter has done, for me and so many other creators I've worked with, I'm bringing back a follow-up to my most successful project to date: The Secret Loves of Geek Girls, and I'm grateful for Kickstarter for this opportunity to join their Kickstarter Gold program.\nAfter premiering as a breakaway success last year on Kickstarter, The Secret Loves of Geek Girls was later picked up by Dark Horse Comics. It is now sold in bookstores and comic shops worldwide, and has received overwhelming love from readers everywhere!\nA selection of creators from the first volume at our launch party in Toronto in 2015!\n  We can't thank Margaret Atwood enough for her support and cheerleading of the project!\n  We did convention panels and signings almost everywhere in 2016! (here at SDCC)\n  Even all the way to England! (w/Katie West, Hope Nicholson, & Cara Ellison)\nThe Project\nThe Secret Loves of Geek Girls: Redux is a project with the same mandate as the original: Geek Girls sharing true stories about love, sex, and dating. Where the original project was limited to 5 pages each for the stories, we're going even smaller with this one: Most creators are contributing 1 page stories, with some up to 4 pages long. Most of the stories have already been completed, and we have experienced book publisher Sam Beiko designing the book. So, overall we hope that this will be a nice, quick, exciting project to fund and to be a part of!\nThe book itself will be a 6x9 softcover, perfect bound book, black and white. To keep the budget low for this follow-up and to reduce the amount of initial print run we need to be successful, we are doing the book as a print-on-demand, and it will be roughly 40 pages.\nAll the Kickstarter patrons will receive their names in the book\nPS.

Go deeper into the Mike Diana comics obscenity trial, and join in our efforts to finish telling the story of the price he paid for his art.\n  IMPORTANT NOTE: You may notice some images censored on this page. Nothing will be blacked out in our film.\nDoes Freedom of Speech mean anything when authorities see only obscenity? Does an artist\u2019s vision matter when community standards conspire to suppress it? In a small town in Florida back in 1994, Mike Diana learned that the answer was a resounding no. Freedom of Speech doesn\u2019t mean anything when your art is declared obscene. And one man\u2019s art could be another man\u2019s obscenity.\nDiana\u2019s crime? Publishing a hand-made comic zine called Boiled Angel full of graphic, outrageous, often hilarious confrontational art, full of sex and violence, meant to shock and disturb. But it was a zine only sold to adults by mail. With a print run of only 300 copies, Diana\u2019s zine was NEVER available in comic racks or in stores. And only one copy \u2013 count \u2018em, one! \u2013 was ever sold to a customer in Diana\u2019s hometown. And that one customer was an undercover cop!\n   Authorities in Florida were so appalled by Diana\u2019s art that they first thought he was a serial killer! After determining that he wasn\u2019t, they nevertheless decided to put him on trial for three counts of obscenity. Then, amazingly, the prosecution brought in a psychologist who testified that Mike\u2019s comics could actually CREATE serial killers!\nWith an enraged community up in arms, Diana was found guilty. Though he only served four days in jail rather than the three years the prosecution asked for, he was put on probation for three years with a laundry list of regulations that included forbidding him to draw anything that MIGHT be considered obscene, even for his own pleasure in the privacy of his own home! And authorities were allowed to conduct warrantless searches to see that this was enforced.\nBoiled Angel \"Ate\" - Front and Back (By Mike Diana)\n  \"It\u2019s shocking that these things happen but I wanna make people more aware these things were going on around them, like priests molesting children.\" - Mike Diana, Seconds #38\nOf course, that all happened in 1994 but it\u2019s worth reminding people how fast one can lose their First Amendment rights.\nIt might seem like obscenity charges are a thing of the past but as the recent past has repeatedly shown us, Freedom of Speech is something that must be continually fought and won. And, unfortunately, history has a way of repeating itself.\nTHE TRIAL OF MIKE DIANA is not only an urgent reminder of how authorities can dictate what adults may create, see, and read, but it\u2019s also a multi-faceted celebration of one of the most unique artists of the last 30 years.\n\u201cBecause if you don't stand up for the stuff you don't like, when they come for the stuff you do like, you've already lost.\u201d - Neil Gaiman\nBy Mike Diana\n  THE TRIAL OF MIKE DIANA has already begun production with the full participation of Mike Diana and unprecedented access to his personal archives, but we need your help to make it a reality. We feel strongly about telling this story honestly, without shying away from the controversial nature of the case or the extremity of the artwork itself. This is why we are making this as a completely independent film, with no outside interests to control the message.\nWe're most of the way through shooting, but some of our key remaining interviews will require some travel. We will be using funds raised from this campaign to cover basic travel expenses.\nFor a film about an artist, we will need to make sure that art is represented onscreen in a uniquely cinematic way, using a combination of techniques including original animation by Mike Diana himself. The post-production process will be a tremendous undertaking, but one that will shape the film into a finished product worthy of it's incredible subject. The editing process, as well as a final sound mix, color correction pass, and the composition of an original score will account for the bulk of how funds will be used.\nLastly, a full legal review will also be necessary, as you can probably imagine given the nature of the project. This is costly, but ultimately a requirement for a film that deals so heavily with the court system itself.\n  If fully funded, we aim to complete principal photography by the end of the year. The editing process will be happening concurrently with the remaining shoots, and we plan to have a version of the film ready to show at festivals in early 2017.\nWe want to get Mike Diana's story out there in a big way, so we'll be bringing the film to the widest audiences possible. Following a festival run, we'll be seeking distribution to bring the film to audiences in theaters, as well as home video, VOD and SVOD.\nBy Mike Diana\n  Cult filmmaking legend Frank Henenlotter is directing the film. Henenlotter's films such as BASKET CASE, BRAIN DAMAGE, and FRANKENHOOKER have secured his legacy as one of the masters of the \"horror comedy\". In recent years he has also created several feature documentaries about the fringes of filmmaking he dearly loves with THAT'S SEXPLOITATION! and HERSCHELL GORDON LEWIS: THE GODFATHER OF GORE. He has also helped to preserve exploitation film history through his involvement with the distributor Something Weird Video.\nProducer Anthony Sneed will be familiar to fans of Henenlotter's work, having had starring roles in the director's films BAD BIOLOGY and the upcoming CHASING BANKSY, which Sneed co-wrote. He founded 85 North Productions. He is a performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade and Magnet theaters, and has also exhibited work as an artist in both the fine art and street art arenas.\nProducer Mike Hunchback is the author of \"Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Darkest Era\", as well as a longtime staple of the DIY punk scene. He currently plays rhythm guitar in Screeching Weasel and co-owns Co-Op 87 Records in Brooklyn, NY.\nAssociate Producer Caitlin McGurk is the Associate Curator for Outreach as well as an Assistant Professor at the Ohio State University Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, the largest collection of comic and cartoon art in the world. You can see more about the library at cartoons.osu.edu.\n    We can't get this story out there without you.

This time Kitty is on top of the World! Her new comic book series is a huge success and she's once again the talk of the comic shops! Naturally, Kitty's publisher wants to capitalize on her new-found popularity with a big budget blockbuster Kitty movie! To make this happen, Kitty goes off to Hollywood, but once again she finds herself in danger! Someone is out to kill Kitty and this time even the reader won't know who's doing it or why! A lot of Kitty's old crowd from Die Kitty Die like Little Satan, Maxi Millions, and of course everyone's favorite kid corpse, Dippy the Dead Kid will be back. Some will be on Kitty's side and some of course are out to get her! Plus we'll see lots of new faces joining Kitty's cast. She'll face new menaces like the unstoppable Hexecutioner and she'll be aided by new allies like the cult-favorite family of freaks, the Carneys! Die Kitty Die: Hollywood Or Bust will be Kitty's biggest... scariest... and funniest adventure yet! It will be magical. Hopefully she'll survive!\nDan's cover for DIE KITTY DIE: HOLLYWOOD or BUST ! #1\n  Fernando's cover for DIE KITTY DIE : HOLLYWOOD OR BUST #1\n  The Carneys are our special guest stars ! How did they find their way into Kitty's world......?\n  ....it turns out Kitty and Linda/Louise go way back! Who knew?\nRight from the beginning, we knew there were more stories to tell about Kitty and her comic book world. After the phenomenal response to our first incredible Kickstarter and the very passionate support we received from our very kind fans, we're back to put together a project that is not only as good as and worthy of our first book but that surpasses it with more action, more adventure, more humor, and more surprises. In the first book, Kitty took on the comic book world and she's not done with them yet. Plus now she's also leaving her mark on Hollywood and the entertainment industry. You know there will be lots of fun and satire along the way! We always have a lot of fun working on Kitty's stories. We hope we can count on our very loyal and generous fans to make this the best ride yet!\nMeet Dan and Fernando, your friendly creators!\nWe hope to follow the basic model of our first book with a four issue storyline that we will initially release as individual PDF issues. As before, each individual issue will feature twenty pages of original story and art plus fashion pages, funny ad pages, pin-ups, variant covers and other added material. We will be handling the bulk of the writing and drawing ourselves but much of this additional material may be completed by some of our talented friends and colleagues in the comic industry. Later, these issues will be collected into one softcover trade paperback and as per our last campaign, our goal is to collect enough funding to be able to make the softcover trade into a hardcover with a dust jacket.\nWe're Astrocomix!\nOnce again, we are planning on a number of stretch goals to make this project better and better.  We are hoping to add bonus material such as an additional exclusive story by the popular, talented Gisele Lagace and fashion pages by the awesome J Bone. In addition to these fun objectives, we've gotten really ambitious this time! If other goals are met, we hope to do two additional Kitty special issues such as a Kitty Summer Special and a Kitty Holiday Special. These would be really great additions to this round of Kitty Kickstartering but we can only get there with everyone's help!\nGisele Lagace is on board to do another Kitty story!\n  Wanna see more fashion pages by the awesome J. Bone? Of course you do!\n  One of our stretch goals will be to fund a KITTY SUMMER SPECIAL!! Let's do it!\n  Fernando's Summer Special cover... if we're lucky enough to fund it!!\n  Dan's cover to the DIE KITTY DIE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!\n  Fernando's cover for the DIE KITTY DIE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!\n                 YOU CAN ALSO ADD THESE FUN ITEMS TO YOUR PLEDGE. CHECK OUT THE GRAPHIC UNDER THE ADD-ON LIST IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON HOW TO DO SO\n                  Our friends at Chapterhouse Comics help to distribute our books!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince our incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign last year, Die Kitty Die has enjoyed a lot of good luck. The reception to our first Die Kitty Die book has been almost universally positive and Kitty has been picked up by Chapterhouse Comics to be published in single issues and distributed to retailers world wide! \n\nWe'd like to point out to everyone that despite this great good fortune, producing Kitty still falls to us. This is what brings us to Kickstarter. We can't do it alone. As you might imagine producing four complete issues of original story and art takes a lot of manpower and resources. We have our impressively talented team of inkers, letterers, colorists and others that we must hire and pay. We also have other costs such as printing, shipping and many other miscellaneous expenses that we need to cover ourselves. We can't do this without the very generous help of our very kind and loyal fans and supporters. We were deeply appreciative and touched by the phenomenal amount of support we were shown throughout our first campaign and even afterwards. Making an independent creator-owned and driven project like Die Kitty Die has been our dream since long before either of us ever got into this business. We couldn't make that dream happen without your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "SINGLE PDF REWARD", "descp": "SINGLE PDF REWARD: Get a PDF of issue #1 of 4 from the \"DIE KITTY DIE: Hollywood or Bust collected trade\".", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "FOUR PDF REWARD", "descp": "FOUR PDF REWARD: Get all 4 issues that will comprise DIE KITTY DIE: Hollywood or Bust's collected trade IN PDF FORMAT.

WE ARE LOOKING FOR PRINTING AND PROOFREADING FUNDS ONLY. We have successfully run and shipped two publishing Kickstarters in the past, so we know what we are doing. You WILL get this book.***\nPaperback Cover for MFDKH\nMY FATHER DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF is a fully edited and ready for print 300 page young adult mystery novel told through blog posts between Delilah and her best friend Alex as they come to terms with an intimate death and how it changes their relationship.  \nPublished by Wannabe Press, this is our third Kickstarter and we've successfully delivered the previous two, so you're assured to get this book. \nWhat's this book about anyway?\nDelilah is a teenager who adores her father, so when he commits suicide it's devastating to her. He was the perfect dad in her eyes, and her family had the perfect life.\nWhen her father's life insurance policy won't pay out on a suicide, she sets out to prove he was actually murdered so she doesn't lose her childhood home. \nSet in 2007, My Father Didn't Kill Himself is told all through blog posts between Delilah and her best friend Alex as they battle through the emotional turmoil of the death somebody they love...and the realization they might not be the perfect person. \nBut before you think the book is wholly depressing, don't worry. I don't roll like that. In fact, my thing is kind of taking wholly depressing loglines and stories, then injecting humor and warmth into them. I'm like John Green meets Kurt Vonnegut, or at least that's who I aspire to be one day...they both have amazing hair. \nSo who the heck am I? \nMy name is Russell Nohelty. I am the publisher of Wannabe Press and the creator/writer of tons of awesome projects, mostly in the comic book space...until now.\nI've successfully funded Katrina Hates the Dead and Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter through Kickstarter, delivered them, and now I want to move into publishing traditional novels. \nReally? What qualifies you, some sort of comic picture guy, to write a novel? \nBesides the fact that I love it and am passionate about it, right? Well let me tell you about comics. \nComics are incredibly complex. They need great writing and great art to bring everything together. It's not just amazing art in great comics, but there's also incredible story. \nAs for the prose itself, I've been writing for over a decade in the movie/tv/web series space. If you look up Connections and Russell Nohelty on Youtube, you'll even see one of my first projects as a writer and director. You'll also see very clearly why I don't direct any more.\nFinally, I've already WRITTEN a novel! Gumshoes: The Case of Madison's Father was a middle grade fiction book we released in 2014. Originally published through Oaklight Publishing, we re-released the book ourselves with our own editors. \nAdditionally, I've got two other completed manuscripts, fully edited, ready to go once we get through this Kickstarter. \nUgh! Alright. So you've got Koalifications as a writer, but how do I know I'm going to get this book in my hands, huh? \nThat's a great question.  \nMost writers aren't publishers. They don't have any idea how to get a book from the page through editing and finally into your hands. \nNot us. Wannabe Press already has a distribution channel through Ingram, and we're already stocked in dozens of book stores around the country. \nSo not only can I write a great story, but we as a team can deliver a book as we've proven in the past. I can tell you that for sure because we've already been doing it for years! \nWait, You've got a publishing company. Why are you on Kickstarter then, millionaire? \nUm...because as an indie publisher we don't make money. At least not enough to scale our business and get recognition in the way we want. We're very well respected with those that know us, but that doesn't mean we make that cheddar. \nThere's a reason we're called Wannabe Press. \nThank you so much for considring contributing. If you got this far I know you care about crowdfunding, like this project, and think pledging is a good idea. So please, even if it's only $1 it helps so much. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe try to take all the risks and challenging out of your mind before we launch a product. However, we can't take out all the risk. I know you will receive this project. The biggest thing I can't answer, though, is when the book will get into your hands. \n\nI can't promise a date. Though I will say it SHOULD be in your hands by June/July timeframe.\n\nHere's why I won't promise anything: \n\nIt takes two weeks for Kickstarter to disburse funds, then another two weeks for the survey to be completed. That's a month right there.\n\nThen it takes about another 6-8 weeks for me to work with the printer, get test copies, add all of the additional rewards into the book, and order a full run of the book. That's two more months.\n\nOnce the book gets to me it takes 2-4 weeks for me to ship everything out and get it into your hands. There's another month. \n\nAll in all, that's four months. I would also like to do 1-2 more passes with my editor just to make sure everything is perfect. That could be another month or two.\n\nI hope I can work faster than that, but all in all it COULD take up to 6 months. That's because I want to make sure everything is perfect. \n\nIf I didn't add people into the book or make special thanks sections we could be done quicker. \n\nHowever, that's one of the great joys of Kickstarter, to get written into the book and have your name listed in the credits forever.

AND A QUICK \"DIE KITTY DIE!\" INTRO                   \nKitty Ravencraft, a beautiful and magical young witch, is the star of her own popular comic book. When her greedy, publicity-starved publisher wants to increase interest in her comic book, he does what many comic book publishers do nowadays... he sets out to kill his main character, Kitty! Even worse, he decides to REALLY spike sales by killing the REAL Kitty in REAL life! The question is though... how do you kill a witch? \"DIE, KITTY! DIE!\" is a funny, exciting, and often sexy story about a girl caught in both the supernatural world of witches, and the super-crazy world of comics!\n\nDAN PARENT and FERNANDO RUIZ. WHO ARE THESE GUYS?\nCreators Dan Parent and Fernando Ruiz pose with some of their artwork for \"Die Kitty Die!\"\nSome of you may not know us but we've been in the comic business for over twenty years. We've produced many popular, high-selling comics for other publishers, e.g. Archie Meets Kiss, Archie Vs Predator, Felix the Cat, etc. Over the years, we've often talked about the possibility of doing something together that is creator owned, and the timing for this has finally arrived. \"Die Kitty Die!\" will be a collaborative effort where we'll share writing and art duties. This will be our first joint effort under own new label, Astrocomix (it just sounds better than Parent & Ruiz comics, you know?) We hope this venture will prove popular enough that we can produce more books and possibly launch more projects! You can read more about us individually at our own web-sites: danparent.com and fernandoruizeverybody.com  And for more Kitty info there's diekittydie.com and her Facebook page here\nWHAT ARE WE TRYING TO FUND HERE?\nFernando's cover for Die Kitty Die #1\nDan's cover for DIE KITTY DIE #1 !\nGisele and Shouri's gorgeous pin-up which will be a print too!\nWith this campaign, we are looking to fund the printing of the first \"Die, Kitty Die!\" collected trade. We say collected as our plan is to first release this trade as four 24+ page digital issues that will be delivered to backers on a monthly basis until the printed trade is ready to ship. Each issue will include 20 page of story, funny ad pages, fashion pages, pin-ups, AND variant covers produced by our very talented and accomplished friends in the comics business. We feel this route will satisfy both print and digital fans.\n\nWe have set a lean, realistically-attainable goal of US$25, 000. This will help us pay for a print run of one thousand copies of the first trade, help us pay the printing of the art cards and posters we are offering, pay our collaborators/contributors, AND of course, cover the shipping cost for about half the print run. Speaking of collaborators inks will be handled by artists extraordinaire  J. Bone and Rich Koslowski. Colors will be handled by Dan and amazing color artist Shouri. Other contributors will include webcomics pioneer and creator of Menage \u00e0 3, Gis\u00e8le Lagac\u00e9, the fantastic Phil Jimenez, and pop culture artist phenomenon Glen Hanson! And the incredible Darwyn Cooke will be doing the cover to the trade!\nThe color version of J.

Plus, a whole slew of off the wall characters from the entire history of \"Kitty Comics\". Some good. Some bad. Some VERY bad.\nDippy and Friends!\nKitty's hangout!\nIf our supporters are especially generous with us, and we exceed our goal, we will reward everyone by growing our project to include more story pages in our collected trade. Gis\u00e8le Lagac\u00e9 & J. Bone already agreed to provide additional material if this happens. Exceeding our goal could also lead to a limited hardcover edition, and more goodies!\n\nBefore getting into the rewards, we would like to thank you for your time, and send a shout-out to all the fans we've met at conventions and other venues. Many of you have become cherished friends, and very loyal supporters. We hope you'll follow us on this very personal and dear venture.

We think you\u2019ll love what we have in store for you!\nIf you\u2019d like to see more programming with drag queens, this is your way to share it with the world.\nOur goal is $25,000 to produce Season Two with at least 10 drag queens, but if we go over our target, we\u2019ll add even more episodes with more gals. Give big to support the project and you\u2019ll get great rewards: Cooking with Drag Queens aprons, tote bags, t-shirts and more at our big gay bake sale with homemade goods- fresh form our oven and into your mouth.\nWith your support, Cooking with Drag Queens will be a community funded, broadcast quality program. Every show will be free to watch online, to anyone around the world.\nWe\u2019ll introduce so many new and amazing gals to the world. The drag queens deserve it, and so do you.\nPlease share this video with your friends, blog about it, or send in your own testimonial video in drag.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe answer to all of life\u2019s challenges is always the same - more drag!

Scroll down for our stretch goals!\nInsurance is the industry of information. If the insurance company knows you smoke cigarettes, they'll charge you more for life insurance. But all sorts of crazy things get insured these days. Governments carry insurance policies for risk management on terrorist attacks. Hedge funds trade derivatives off derivatives off everything.\nThe Pros approach volatile, unpredictable situations with a mandate to \"fix\" them, any way they want. But with that freedom comes responsibility. Why not use this morally dubious job to try and do some good?\nTheir first mission: defuse a potentially lethal standoff between federal agents and a gun worshiping cult. Can they do it without anybody dying? Can they even survive the job themselves?\nCheck out our FREE 8-page preview, here.\nWhile we're at it, check out this free preview of issue 2, too.\nThe Pros issue 1 cover\nAbout This Project\nAll the art for issue 1 is finished, now we just need a way to share it with you! By backing this Kickstarter, you will help raise the money to print and ship it straight down your lovely throats.\nThis first issue is 22 pages, full color, PLUS a backmatter essay by Iraq Veteran and activist Scott Olsen.\nWait. Insurance...spies?\nInsurance is the industry of information. And industry is taking over government functions one by one. Like Blackwater founder Erik Prince, who said, \"We are trying to do for the national security apparatus what FedEx did for the Postal Service.\"\nWhy wouldn't some audacious businessperson decide to \"disrupt\" the bloated, inefficient, unpopular NSA? Why wouldn't that person be H.A. Klamath, Company Insurance's overseer of The Pros?\nOr maybe it's all a little bit goofy.\nRead The Pros if you want a comic about big data and privatization, about guns as both symbol for freedom and a weapon for murder, about veterans, gender, drones, technology, and the future. Except a little bit goofy.\nWho are The Pros?\nIssue 1 follows Nass, an Afghanistan War veteran turned peace activist who's disillusioned with both worlds.\nNext up is Caitlyn: serious, hardworking, and extremely loyal. Most of us don't put up with bullshit; Caitlyn takes this to an art form.\ncle is the team's hacker\u2014posthuman, agender, and able to create anything out of anything else.\nSasha has 7 PhD's for the same reason he has big muscles: just to show off.\nAnd finally Buzzy, the team's pet drone. An experimental model from Company Aeronautics, Buzzy is fully autonomous and uncomfortably cute.\nAbout the Creators\nSteve Stormoen, Writer (USA)\nMaking The Pros has been such a significant part of my life for such a long time, and I can't wait to share it with you.\nI'm Steve, and I'm a writer and community organizer from Santa Barbara and Lompoc, CA. I've worked in the past with the Chelsea Manning Support Network, the Lompoc Theatre Project, Alliance for Community Trainers, and many more, and my writing has appeared in the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Huffington Post, and several print and online journals. In 2012 I ran a successful Kickstarter with a couple friends to publish three books. This is my first comic book.\nJelena \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, Artist (Serbia)\nThe special quality of The Pros is the balance of serious and fun, which made me learn new, gratifying stuff, like how to match dark lines and bright colors.\nI'm Jelena, I'm an unemployed psychologist and a self-employed comic artist from Nis, Serbia. I've published a book of illustrations Ulysses Reload in Serbia and many short comics and illustrations in various anthologies with friends all over the world (Arcadia, Memory, Broken Pieces, TV Gods, Outre).\nE.T. Dollman, Letters (Italy)\nGreg Benninger, Cover and Graphic Design\nAbout the Rewards\nAt $2, 3, or 4, you'll get the digital comic. It used to be $4 only, but we just keep hitting stretch goals and unlocking the lower price points. Pay whichever amount you prefer. Hopefully, we'll get to offer this even cheaper (see stretch goals, below).\nAt $8 we'll send you a physical copy of the comic, along with a couple buttons. One is the logo of The Pros. The other is an image from the comic that Jelena drew and I quickly became obsessed with. It's, hm, quite graphic.\nFor $15, we'll send you a physical comic AND a copy to your favorite comic book shop, anywhere in the US.\n$25 lands you a physical comic and the buttons, plus a DIGITAL PRINT of original artwork by Jelena and customized Company Insurance DOG TAGS. So cool!\nFor $50, you get the comic, the buttons, the digital print, and the dog tags, plus a hand-printed block print by artist and printmaker Angelina La Pointe, and special Sneak Preview access to art from issue 2 as it becomes available! Heck yes.\nOur $75 reward includes everything from the $25 reward, plus I'll take the time to do a deep reading of a comics script or short story you wrote and give feedback and advice. I backed the Kickstarter for Rocket Girl at a similar level a while back and Brandon was a huge help to this project. I'd love the opportunity to pay it forward.\nAt $100, you get your face in the comic! Jelena's already working on issue 2, so you won't appear until issue 3. That should be fine, though, because between now and then you get to enjoy all the rewards at the $50 tier!\nFor $150, you get your face AND your name in the comic. It's like the last one, except your character will be named.\nFor $200, you will get a piece of ORIGINAL ART by Jelena, hand-drawn on A4 bristol board. Choose from some pinups inspired by the comic, or add another $50 for an original commission.\nAnd, the grand prize. For $201, I will get really drunk and talk about comic books on camera. Read the description on the right if you must know more.\nSHIPPING TO THE U.S. AND SERBIA IS FREE. FOR SHIPPING TO CANADA, MEXICO, AND EU COUNTRIES, PLEASE ADD $5. FOR SHIPPING ANYWHERE ELSE, PLEASE ADD $10.\nStretch Goals!\nThe stretch goals fall into two categories. Roughly, more money means we up the print quality and make the digital version more accessible. More backers means we give you all more free content. We'd love to do all of these!\nOne note about the prequel story reward, which we unlock at 100 backers. This will be a prose short (not a comic) that I will write and post for free on my website when we ship out the rest of the rewards in April.

Flame Con is going to be a blast!\n=============================\nSince 2010, Geeks OUT has organized events throughout the country so queer geeks can meet, mingle, and geek out (it's our name for a reason). Now, we need your help for our biggest event ever.\nIn 2015, we're going to change the geek community in NYC and the greater Northeast by hosting a new comic convention - one made especially for queer fans! \nWhat's Flame Con About? \nCommunity \nThe LGBTQ community is separated into different groups that all too often don\u2019t mix or learn from each other\u2019s experiences: gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, cisgender and trans people, aces and bears\u2026 But comic cons are all about mixing! People of every size, gender identity and expression, age, color and type come to comic conventions to get geeky, expressing what makes each of us different, special, and awesome. A queer comic con is a great way to bring us all together under one roof. We'll learn about ourselves as a community, and explore topics that haven't already been paneled to death at other cons. We want to end the con having brought queer people from different parts of the rainbow closer. \nGeeking Out\nCons are about meeting people face to face. You get to revel in each others' creativity and open spirit. you connect. You realize that you're not alone in what you love. Or who you love - really, there are a lot of similarities between being a geek and being queer. Weird, niche interests don't have to be isolating, and meeting others who are into what you're into makes your passions that much more fun! Come out! You'll find that you're part of something that doesn't just begin and end with the con! \nShowcasing Cool Queer Stuff\nWe love pop culture, and there's a lot happening now in comics, TV and movies that seems to be catering to non-straight tastes. From Orphan Black to Dragon Age to Arrow to Gone Home, there are queer characters and call-outs...subplots and inclusive themes. Sweaty workouts. Girls kissing. Gay gaming options. The entire world of fanfic... Still, enjoyable stories and ideas that are explicitly queer are rare, and often controversial. We've been enjoying queer winks and nods since the dawn of literature. We want to enjoy stories that don't rely on subtext and innuendo to create believable, honest portrayals of LGBTQ experiences. So, let's have a con that just puts it out there! You won't have to scan the floor for a rainbow flag just to find a queer-friendly artist. You won't have to sift through tables and tables of comics just to find a story with two boys or two girls kissing. Think of it: All the amazing queer art you always hope you can find at a big con, ALL IN ONE PLACE!\nGeeks OUT president Joey Stern with Cthulhu and Lewd Alfred Douglas at NYCC 2011\n  Here are some of the awesome things we\u2019re planning to feature at Flame Con!\n\nCreators! \nWe hope to feature dozens of artists and vendors, catering to all kinds of queer tastes and interests.  Come see creators you've always wanted to meet, and meet creators you may have never heard of, but will remember forever! \nNoelle Stevenson (Lumberjanes, Nimona) and Allison Kolarik (Comic Book Afterlife) at our 2014 NYCC signing table.\nIf you or someone you know is a creator who might be interested in exhibiting at Flame Con, check out our \u201cArtist Table\u201d incentive. You can reserve a table at Flame Con right now, at a low early-bird price!\n\nBig Names!\nFlame Con is more about building community than big (and usually expensive) names, but we hope to give you a chance to shake hands with a couple of our favorite celebs. Feel free to let us know if there's anyone in particular you'd like to see, and stay tuned for more updates!\n\nPanels!\nWe want to have discussions you won't hear at a mainstream con, between thoughtful, creative, and hilarious people. What would you like to hear about? What do you want us to explore? Bi erasure? Homophobia and transphobia? Body image issues? Creative processes? Let us know! Flame Con will be a place to engage fans in new conversations, and put forth ideas that will influence pop culture and the LGBT community long after the con wraps up.\n\nAn Art Show!\nFor the past three years, Geeks OUT has held celebrity-themed art shows, each featuring dozens of artists paying tribute to geeky icons important to the LGBTQ community:\nGeeks OUT's last three art shows!\nThis year, we'd like to include a tribute show WITHIN Flame Con! Artists exhibiting at Flame Con will be encouraged to participate, and creators unable to make it to Flame Con can still be a part of the event by contributing to the art show!  \nAnthology!\nGeeks OUT is just getting started on our first ever comics anthology, featuring work from queer and queer-friendly creators around the world. The theme is POWER, and we're super excited to show it to you. We'll be releasing the anthology at Flame Con! Fans at the con will get first dibs on it, and can line right up to get it signed by the creators it features -  several of whom will probably be tabling at Flame Con! \nThe Geeks OUT Anthology Comic is in the works!\nCosplay Parade\nAt the end of the day, we'll host an after-party at a bar within walking distance of the con! Cosplayers can take to the streets and lead the way! This will be a great opportunity to meet more fans and continue mingling with the cool people you met at the con.\nRowr!

I was too young to buy it then, but I never forgot it. As I got older I discovered the Meatmen collections in gay bookstores. As a life-long comics fan, I was in Heaven! Even then, I wondered who the people were that created these stories. The books were a thrill for me, but required so much work for the writers and creators. I knew they were people very passionate and committed to their craft and to their sexuality. And they were gay and proud! It doesn't get much gayer than this fearless depiction of our raw sexuality. I loved it! I bought every Meatmen and every other gay erotic comic I could find. In the pre-internet days this was challenging and exciting. As a young gay person, these stories and pictures shaped how I saw myself. I didn't have to be a scared suburban homosexual. I could be a proud gay man, claiming my sexuality without apology. The men who created these stories had this kind of impact because they were good. They were REALLY good at what they did! They know how to turn their audience on. They knew how to be gay. And they freaking knew how to WRITE and DRAW! \nWho were these men? I wanted to know. What were they like? Were they wonderfully weird? Did they have day jobs? Did they ever have to pay a price for creating these stories? It wasn't until years later that I got some answers. But until then I thought about these creators, many who only listed their first name as their credit. \nThe stories I read in these erotic comics weren't just a quick thrill to me. I thought about them. I revisited them. I re-lived them when I closed my eyes at night. They were as complex, beautiful and wonderful as any of the mainstream comics or \"graphic novels\" on my shelf. I felt so privileged that these men told me their stories. Now I want to tell theirs.\nDirty Sexy Comics will tell an important story about people who have been marginalized and an artform that's been ignored. The history of gay erotic comics is the history of the gay rights movement. It's a story of people who risked everything to express themselves. It's a story of who we are and what we desire. It's a story of rebellion, of artists refusing to conform and doing it with style and beauty.\nIn Dirty Sexy Comics, I'll take a look at gay erotic comics, past and present. I'll trace the roots of the medium and find the giants of the industry \u2014the ones who are no longer with us and the ones who keep it alive and thriving. Many of these artists worked when they could have been discovered and lost their jobs and more. Their work let gay people know we weren't alone. And that there's nothing wrong with us.\nThis is a film about the rebellious part of the gay rights movement movement. Gay men were drawing sexy comics before Stonewall and we haven't stopped. We don't need to conform. We should understand our sexuality, not deny it. It should be celebrated! Gay people can be whoever we really are\u2014 and we have the right to put that down on paper or pixels.\nComics are getting more attention everywhere\u2014from Hollywood to academia. Erotic gay comics deserve to have their story told too. Help me do that.\nArt by Patrick Fillion\nWhy should I be the one to do this film?\nI've made hundreds movies, some mainstream and promotional, some erotic. I know how to make a film and I have the follow-through to finish it. Not everyone on Kickstarter can say that. I've done hundreds of quality interviews with all sorts of people for video, print and the Internet. I'm no stranger to life behind the camera and I love it.\nI'm passionate about comics, art and erotica. And I've got the drive to dig in and make this happen.\nWhat will I do with the money?\nI\u2019ll find the men who created these comics in the early days through to today and record their stories. I'll shoot great interviews with all the key people and experts in the field. I'll be travelling all over to shoot and I can't do it alone. I'll need equipment, travel and crew. In post production I'll need editing, music, color correction, audio and output/applications for festivals.\nWhat happens if the project is over funded? \nWhat I'm asking for is the minimum I need to make this movie. Any more funds will be put into doing more interviews and creating animation and using voice talent to bring the comics to life! The comics are at the core of this story and I want to audience to really experience them like never before.\nYou'll receive great incentives for your contribution! Check out the list.

I personally like to think of BENT-CON as an annual celebration that is a welcoming and safe place for anyone\u2014fan or professional\u2014who believes everyone has a right to see themselves reflected in the things they love.\nBENT-CON was founded with community in mind. In 2010 we held the very first BENT-CON in a donated space in Los Angeles\u2019 Silverlake area, as an experiment to see if works that were unabashedly queer-positive could stand together and bring in an audience. And they did!\nThe success of that one-day show is when BENT-CON was truly born. From nearly 500 attendees then to nearly 3500 attendees at our 2013 convention\u2014BENT-CON has shown steady growth year after year, thanks to the ever-evolving community that has grown to love and embrace it. This November, BENT-CON will be celebrating it\u2019s 5th year, and we want to make it our biggest and best yet.\nSince BENT-CON is all about diversity and inclusivity, we decided to reach out through crowd funding to preserve the intention and heart of BENT-CON:\nFor the community, by the community.\nOur Bent-Con Poker Chip Necklace!\nSo we need your help!\nWe\u2019ve set our initial goal at $15,000, which is intended to bring more attention to the annual celebration as a whole and, with your pledges, BENT-CON hopes to cover the total convention\u2019s costs for this year and even some extras that we\u2019ve indicated in the stretch-goals portion below.  \nYou'll notice that most of our rewards are very limited!  Some are even one of a kind! \nAnd because BENT-CON is also a federally recognized tax-exempt corporation, your contribution (less the value of your backer reward), is tax deductible. So Everyone Wins!\nWe need your enthusiasm, interest and curiosity. With your help, we hope to not only meet our starting goal, but also lay a solid foundation for the future of the celebration, so BENT-CON can be fully financed for years to come.\nWe\u2019re eager for you to experience first hand what\u2019s possible when the community comes together to build and nurture environments that reflect the beautiful diversity of the real world, beyond what we\u2019re often served by mainstream pop-culture.\nWe want BENT-CON to send a clear message to social culture and mass entertainment: \nCollectable Flex Sticker Sheet at our $16 level!\nMinus Zero Productions! On our $20 and $30 levels!\nNo matter what your tastes, you\u2019ll find something exciting and new at BENT-CON!

BENT-CON is more than just a yearly convention\u2014it\u2019s also a destination, with a great crowd of people to mix, mingle, and celebrate with. Let\u2019s make it a destination we can be even more proud of. Let\u2019s celebrate our differences \u2013 safely, happily, and without judgment.

Thank you!\nThe Center for Sex and Culture, located in San Francisco, is publishing an art exhibition catalog on our safer sex poster collection in conjunction with an exhibition displaying these posters at our gallery. The 2-month exhibition opens on November 8, 2013.\nBuzz Bense, sex activist and graphic designer, donated over 150 unique posters to CSC last year. Bense has collected and produced safer-sex posters aimed at members of the LGBTQ community since the mid-1980s. Circulated at a time when the community was particularly hard-hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, these posters comprise a striking aesthetic collection of graphically innovative design that explicitly visualizes homosexuality, diverse LGBTQ communities and safer-sex activism.\nSF AIDS Foundation\nBecause of the cultural and historical significance of the posters, we are inspired to share these images and their story with people in the Bay Area and beyond. It is easy to forget details of recent history, especially when related to sexual history because it is less likely to be preserved. This project aims to preserve and share some of what might easily be lost. The book will contain over 20 color reproductions of posters, an introduction by CSC\u2019s executive director, Dr. Carol Queen, and an essay by the New York based art historian and curator, Alex Fialho, and an interview between Buzz and Alex about the history of the collection. Alex has spent time in San Francisco and New York researching and interviewing the people who created these posters as activists, artists, community organizers, members of health organizations and independent graphics designers.\nThe collection consists of posters, primarily from San Francisco, but also encompasses other cities throughout the United States. It also includes international representations from Australia, Germany, Denmark, and Canada. This historical archive presents the visual means through which LGBTQ people passed on life saving information about safer-sex practices during the height of a health epidemic that continues to affect us today.\nWe are confident the exhibition and book will function as both an art historical survey of the importance of this collection of aesthetically beautiful and functionally informative posters as well as an educational endeavor engaging the LGBTQ community and beyond.\nBrothers Network, San Francissco\nThese posters do more than chart the tragedy of an epidemic, of an outsider community reeling from grief, loss, and the decimation of a blooming culture of sexual liberation. The history of these posters is a story of a fight against stigma, hatred and ignorance; of a community stepping up to take care of its own; of finding a way to extinguish fear and build pride and self-esteem; and of devoted efforts of committed activists to communicate a path to health and survival. -Buzz Bense\nSF AIDS Foundation\n\"everybody's doin' it!\" National Condom Week\n\"Keep a Rubber on Hand\" San Francisco", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause CSC is a non-profit run by volunteers dedicated to cultural and educational events about sex, we face particular fundraising challenges.

Representing characters of varying ethnicity, cultural experience, sexuality and gender expression is a mission close to our hearts.\nOur comic is rated PG and aimed primarily at teens, but we\u2019ve been delighted to find, as the project has progressed, that adults can enjoy it also-- either because it\u2019s a story they would have liked to see as teens or just because they\u2019re as into fun, silly stories as we are. And though Mahou Shounen FIGHT! is an LGBT-friendly comic, that\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be consumed and enjoyed by everyone, regardless of identity!\nWho are we?\nWe\u2019re Dusty and JD, a queer couple about to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of sharing our life and creating stories together. We\u2019re artist alley regulars at conventions all over the country and have spent a perhaps startling percentage of our adult lives at comic book conventions. You might have even seen us at a convention near you!\nWe conceive and write Mahou Shounen FIGHT! together, Dusty thumbnails the pages, and JD does the pencils and inks. Then it\u2019s handed back to Dusty for the color and typesetting. It's a real team effort! :)\nThe Book!\nOur comic has been in production for 3 years and in that time, we\u2019ve completed four and a half chapters. The comic is available online for our audience to read for free (@ MahouShounenFight.com) and we\u2019ve been printing small batches of individual issues, whenever we can afford to do it. This method of printing is expensive and means we don't make any profit from our comics, though has been a great way to get our work out there for people who prefer to read their comics in physical form, instead of on a screen! But now that we\u2019re on our way to being 5 chapters in, we want to put together one big book, using offset printing! This printing method makes great-looking books, at a more affordable price per book, but it requires a larger minimum order than we can afford to pay out of pocket ourselves! This is why we need your help!\nThe book itself will measure 7x10 inches and collect approximately 200 full color pages. It'll feature tons of stuff you won\u2019t get anywhere else! We\u2019ll be including concept art, walkthroughs of our process and exclusive extra comics and character stories.\nWe'll be working on finishing up chapter 5 this summer and are looking at a shipping date of April 2014.\nA Rainbow of Swag\nAs though there wasn\u2019t enough glittering goodness in the book, we\u2019ve got plenty of fun backer rewards to go along with it!\nPrints\nWe\u2019ll be creating three new 7x10 inch art prints with exclusive MSF! illustrations for the Kickstarter. These are illustrations that will ONLY be available through the Kickstarter, and we'll keep our backers up to date as we create each illustration so you can see our progress! On top of this, in our stretch goals, there\u2019ll be several more prints to unlock. If we reach those goals, those of you who pledge at a level that includes the three initial prints will get ALL of the prints that are unlocked! \nFor the stretch goal prints, as backers, you'll be able to vote for the designs you\u2019d like to be unlocked first! At our $40 pledge level, you get one print of your choice. At $55 and up, you get ALL of them!\nStickers\nAt the $55 level and above, our backers will receive a sheet of adorable Shounen Fight stickers featuring lots of our characters and little items like Mike\u2019s Mantisman undies, the Sun Guns and Joe\u2019s multitude of sweets.\nIf we reach $20,000, EVERYONE who orders a book will get the stickers!\nKissing Charms\nWe\u2019ll also be producing a set of twelve 1.5 inch acrylic charms that can be used as cel phone charms or keychains or even jewelry. The best part of these is that they\u2019re double sided and therefore reversible -- so their kisses can match up with any other charm.\nRight now you get your choice of 4 charms at the $100 pledge level but if we hit $30,000 everyone at the $55 level or higher will get their choice of 2 charms!\nYour choices will be: Mike, Yuki, Raji, Oliver, Summer, Winter, Spring, Autumn, Anjika, Sonya, Alex and Chloe\nSome Help From Our Friends\nWe\u2019ve been lucky enough to make friends with some incredibly talented people during our travels on the convention circuit, and we are so grateful and honored to say that we have some incredible artists offering us some help to getting this Kickstarter going!\nThree of our friends will be creating 11x17 Mahou Shounen FIGHT! posters that will ONLY be available through our Kickstarter!\nWe are delighted to say that E, artist of Teahouse will be doing a pinup of Raji in all his drag glory. Pilot-Star, artist of Two Keys and Honeydew Syndrome will be creating an illustration of the boys in their school uniforms. And Chira, artist for Sfeer Theory and The Fox Sister will be making one of the team in their battle costumes. Lucky ALL OF US!\nYou can chose one of these guest posters at the $65 level OR get all three at the $100 tier! If you pledge at any level that includes the \u201cSWAG BAG\u201d rewards, you'll get to choose one of these posters as well!\nIt's Your Comic, Get What You Want!\nAs a way to offer our readers a closer look at our characters, in the past we\u2019ve written illustrated short stories (\u2018Before Winter\u2019 and \u2018Burgers\u2019 let us get a little peek at Alex and Yuki together). We\u2019ll have a few of these for the compilation book but if we hit our stretch goals, we\u2019ll pile on a whole lot more literature! We\u2019ll have a list of topics, characters and prompts that you, as a backer, will be able to vote on to determine which stories will be unlocked first.\nWe\u2019ll also have some extra comics set up much like this, including the stories of how Raji, Oliver and Yuki came to meet their own spirits. If things go REALLY well, we might even look at making a separate, black+white saddle-stitched book to house all this fun stuff.\nOriginal Art from JD + Dusty\nOn top of the various goodies we've got to go with your books, we're also offering a few rewards aimed for fellow creators and art collectors.\nIf you're a comic artist, you have the opportunity to get one-on-one feedback and advice from Dusty. An extra, trained eye can be super helpful so Dusty will review your composition, typesetting and color.\nSpeaking of color, Dusty is also offering to color 3 pages of your comic project at another reward level!\nWe've got two great reward tiers which include custom digital art made just for you! The first of these is the \"FIGHTING SPIRIT\" pledge which offers the opportunity to get a portrait of you (or your kid, or your dog or your best friend) and your very own body-snatching Spirit! Just like Mike is stuck with Summer, you too can get saddled with your very own visiter from the spirit world! JD and Dusty will invent and illustrate a unique spirit just for you (or your kid, or your dog, or your best friend)! When it's done, we'll send you a high resolution copy of the art via email, as well as a nice, shiny autographed print in the mail!\nThe second reward tier that nets you a custom piece of digital art is called \"PROMOTED TO LOVE INTEREST\"! This tier is especially for those of you who can't get enough of romance, who maybe have a favorite pairing that you don't get enough of in our comic, and those of you who want the chance to dictate to JD and Dusty just who from MSF! you think should get all lovey-dovey <3. Pledge at this level if you want a fun, romantic, unique piece of art of ANY two characters from Mahou Shounen FIGHT! (No incest or adult+kid pairings, please!) Just like the option above, you'll get both a high res copy of the art as well as a signed high quality print in the mail!\nIf you want to really go all out, JD is also offering several options to get some custom original art! We have reward tiers which feature watercolor or oil paintings in three different sizes. JD will work with you to create an illustration in watercolor of up to two characters (either MSF! character or your own original characters!) or a one of a kind oil portrait of you (or anyone else you can provide photograph reference of)!\nAnd then, there's more!\nOur project goal is $9,000 but the higher we go, the better products we can bring you! To keep this magical train moving, we've got goals in place to reward your love. \nWe've got markers where we'll make fresh new content for the book. YOU, as a backer, will be able to vote on what the content will be for your extra content. We've got short novels and extra comics in store and you'll choose from a variety of story lines to decide which gets tackled first.\nTHIS JUST IN!\nWe've got 7 Days. LET'S MAKE PLUSHES!\n\nReaching Critical Adorbs\nThat's right, if we reach the $17,000 point in the next 7 days, we will be able to make PLUSHES of Teacup! These are going to be adorable and snuggly and horrifying and you KNOW you need one.\nAside from a super-cute plush, the toy will include a removable collar. On that will be an acrylic charm nametag -- but if we hit $20,000 we'll upgrade that charm to a METAL nametag! And we'll be trying to make the collar double as a bracelet for you.\n Everyone who pledges $150 or more will get a Teacup plush if we hit $17K. As an add-on, the plush will sell for $20 + $5 shipping ($10 international). \nAt the moment, we are sorting out the very last details on how to include an order for Teacup in your pledge. Stay tuned for details!\nWe have amazing friends who have come to help us add even more stretch goals! For each guest art goal we unlock, a guest artist will contribute a full page illustration to the book. And never fear, digital downloaders, these will also be available in the digital version.\nMany thanks to our wonderful friends!!!\nUNLOCKED!! $11,000 -- Ben Juwono, storyboard artist and creator of \"We're all In This Together\" will contribute an illustration [Ben on Tumblr]\nCheck out his 2013 sketchbook! More printed things, yay!\nUNLOCKED!! $13,000 -- Justin L, creator of 'Loki' and 'Pariah Song' will contribute an illustration\nUNLOCKED!! $14,000 -- Kori Michele, creator of 'Prince of Cats' will contribute an illustration [Kori on Tumblr]\nUNLOCKED!! $16,000 -- Emy Bitner, creator of 'Trying Human' will contribute an illustration [Emy on Tumblr]\nWowzers!\nOne of the things we are most looking forward to is being able to share our progress on this project with you, our backers. We'll be staying in touch every step of the way so you can see the whole process from start to finish. We\u2019ll keep sharing our ideas and make sure you stay updated as our project progresses.

One of the things we constantly battle is balancing the sound effects, music, and dialog so that each comes through clearly. If we had a little extra cash to modernize the audio gear it would make for a much more complete upgrade project. We are so close to our main goal, lets put it over the top and make the sound great too.\nHere at Central Cinema, we are committed to bringing you quality films ranging from Citizen Kane to Howard The Duck, but as we move into the future of theater projection we need to convert our theater to DCP. DCP stands for Digital Cinema Package. It is the new standard in movie projection and by 2014 all major movie studios will only deliver films in DCP. Right now, two major studios are only doing DCP screenings which means there are tons of great movies that we would love to screen but cannot. Crowd favorites include:\nPrincess Bride\nSay Anything\nAlien & Aliens\nDangerous Minds\nAdventures In Babysitting\nMannequin 2: On The Move (Jason's favorite)\nTrue Lies\nSister Act & Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit\nCocktail\nPoint Break\nThe Last Of The Mohicans\nReturn To Oz\nand hundreds more!\nCentral Cinema's KICKSTARTER campaign is to raise the funds to convert our theater to DCP, and we need your help to make this a reality. State of the art digital projectors are expensive, and we would have to save up for a long time to afford the equipment we need. The trouble is that we need to do this in the next six months before Hollywood shuts off the supply of non-DCP movies. If you can help us get over the hump with the new projector then we will bust our butts to make the shows that much better for you.\nReward Update: A YEAR OF MOVIES pass is now TWO YEARS OF MOVIES. We felt the passes needed to be balanced better with the punchcard rewards so we extended their time. We are willing to pay the movie fees over time if we can raise the money now for the project. Don't worry if you have already picked up a Year of Movies Pass, it will automatically be upgraded to Two Years of Movies.\nthe DCP projector we need\nA DCP system will also take the picture and sound quality of our shows to the next level. Whether it's a screening of a Technicolor Classic, a Cult Favorite, or one of our own Sing-Along events, the new systems will make everything more gorgeous on the screen. Brighter brights and vibrant colors all smothered in delicious caramel!\nthe Central Cinema crew\nHere at Central Cinema we love movies, and we love watching them with friends while yummy food and great drinks are brought by the wonderful servers. We started Central Cinema to bring more fun to the CD neighborhood. For the past eight years we have used our scrappy ingenuity to build our own DIY movie system for getting the show on the screen. In fact we built the whole place ourselves on the bones of our old art studio. It has been great fun building a totally home-made movie theater, but now it is time to go big and take the Cinema to the next level.\nMeter Music School performs at the Central District Holiday Party\nCentral Cinema continues to support the local community with projects such as the Central District Holiday Party, high school student Mia Roberson's senior project, The Black & Beautiful Film Festival and the Central District Garden Tour. We look forward to continuing special events such as these and screening all the movies that you want to see!\nNeighborhood Block Party\nWhat We Need\nWe have been talking with Miles McRae over at McRae Theater Equipment in Fremont. Miles got us going with our first screen eight years ago as an upgrade from showing movies on the wall. If you want a person who can set you up right, Miles is the guy to talk to. We have our eye on a Barco projector and a DCP digital media storage block. If we are able to raise any extra money we have our eyes on a Datasat(nee DTS) digital audio processor and some other sound system upgrades that will really make the room sing. There will also be a number of cables and support bits to hook everything together. The new projector is significantly larger than what we have so we will need to construct a new support and housing to fit it. We will also need to pay Miles for his time to connect and configure everything into a cohesive system. We have determined that a fundraising effort of $60,000 plus what we are kicking in will buy us the ideal system to fit Central Cinema for all of the different types of events that happen here.\nPlease help us meet this goal so we can expand our repertoire and continue making our unique brand of entertainment for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we do not make our funding goal then we will have to find another way of making the DCP conversion happen. In the current economy the banks are still quite hard to work with and equipment lease deals are approaching usury. An upgrade of this size is too large to put on our line of credit and credit card rates are out of the question. We may be able to work out a loan arrangement eventually but the best option is still to have the fans of the Cinema help us with this Kickstarter. \n\nCurrently there is a backlog of orders for DCP systems as independent theaters everywhere are being pushed to upgrade all at the same time. The sooner we can get an equipment order put in the better shape we will be for getting a timely delivery.\n\nWe will need to build a new support and housing since the new projector is much larger and heavier than our current one. Making sure the housing is built to the right size before the projector arrives will have to be carefully coordinated to make sure there are no surprises when we go to put the new gear inside.\n\nThe changeover will be a complicated dance as we will try to keep the theater open as much as possible during the installation. We may not be able to have both our old and new systems in operation simultaneously so we may need to close briefly while everything is tuned and tested.

The problem when working with a producer who is also involved in working with other touring acts, is that it's often hard to book an adequate amount of time, especially when we aren't paying them a full rate. It also doesn't help that Double Duchess plays lots of shows out of state. However, if we're able to pay our producer/engineers enough, then we can book the time that we need to really get involved and finished the record by the end of fall 2013.\n\nIn the event that our producer becomes unavailable, we would just finish the recording session with him, and then find a recommended studio where we will proceed to mix and master the record with other engineers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Thank you sooooo much!", "update_content": "Doing some recording and re-arranging at my home studio to get ready for our recording sessions down in LA the end of next month!!\nThank You for helping the record come to LIFE!"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "107 backers pledged $6,879"}, {"Project launches": "JUNE 5, 2013"}]}], "comment_no": 3, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/823701617/double-duchess-creates-a-full-length-record-so-let", "project_name": "DOUBLE DUCHESS CREATES A FULL-LENGTH RECORD- SO LETS  DANCE!"}}, {"backer": "Zan Christensen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Have you ever felt as though your brain doesn\u2019t match your body?

Follow the incredible and honest journey of a truly remarkable individual managing the beginnings of gender re-assignment. Finding Kim is a glimpse of the authentic soul and self-discovery.\nOur Mission:\nThe message of \"Finding Kim\" is one that speaks beyond gender. It's about knowing and understanding yourself & who you truly are as an individual. We want to unveil Kim's story in the most organic way possible while staying true to the documentary filmmaking process.  We wish for Kim's voice to resonate with anyone struggling with gender identity or self-acceptance.  We will follow Kim around for the next year filming the most intimate parts of his life, including his top-surgery, struggles and moments of happiness.  We will also be interviewing the individuals closest to Kim.  We wish to discover their thoughts on his process and how this will affect their relationship with Kim. Other segments will include others who have gone through the process of gender reassignment. Ultimately, we want you, the viewer, to walk away with a new outlook on gender. \nProduction \nProducing a documentary is a long process that requires a lot of time and energy and money. Not only for the filmmakers, but also for the subject involved.  It can be somewhat of a shock at first, having a camera and (sometimes) complete strangers following you around filming your daily life. Finding Kim will always aim to keep the number of production crew involved at a minimum for the sake of comfort for Kim.\nOur Plan:\nThe support you bring will help in the overall production costs for Finding Kim in 2013. You will help us fully realize post production, design costs, travel for the filmmakers, and overall costs incurred while making a film.  Once the film is complete, our plan is to submit to the large, regional and local film festivals across the world.  We want Kim's voice to be heard!\nAbout the Filmmaker:\nAaron Bear\nAaron Bear grew up in Dayton Ohio by way of San Francisco and Atlanta. From an early age, Aaron has had a love and passion with film, music and photography.  Aaron's influences run the gamut from John Waters to Paul Thomas Anderson to David Lynch. Primarily focusing on highly produced/high concept content, Aaron's stylistic approach to projects aim to have an end result that look both brilliant and beautiful.  He's produced videos for local Northwest artists such as Watch It Sparkle and most recently a video for Portland artist Logan Lynn.  From 8-5, Aaron manages and produces rich media advertising content for a large consumer and news website. Clients include ABC, NBC, Honda, Paramount, Xbox and various other consumer products. Aaron currently resides in Seattle.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnyone who has ever made a film knows how quickly production costs arise. Making a film is expensive, especially making a great film. There are many challenges involved with producing documentary film. Currently, our biggest challenge is securing the support to begin and continue production. \"Finding Kim\" will be filmed in Seattle and surrounding areas. Securing travel and other incidental costs that is required to make a great film are also items that your backing will help.

We believe that there are a great number of Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, Gender Queer, and Bisexual folks out there, of every color and creed, that at the end of the day, love to geek out. Geek about video games, tabletop games, tech, comics - all that fun stuff. And we believe that creating a community for these folks, Gaymers as they are affectionally dubbed, is important to help shape a more tolerant and safer space in gaming. After all, everyone games.\nThe stereotypes about gamers are many, but the core is the perception that gamers are usually straight white guys in dark rooms furiously mashing at a controller. That\u2019s not the reality. Gamers come in all sizes, genders, races, and sexual identities. Unfortunately stereotypical bias among gamers does exist and it can make a hostile environment for minorities in the gaming community. Hang around an online game long enough and you\u2019ll start hearing homophobic, racial, and misogynistic slurs slung around without a second thought. Gamers, as a whole, have had to make space for themselves in a society that, for a long time, treated them as outsiders. They have come together and created a real community of people, but one that is not always welcoming if you don\u2019t fit into the mold. Just like most gamers, queer geeks and gaymers want that same sense of community and belonging. Therefore we intend to create a space where all gamers and queer geeks can come together in a welcoming and safe space.\nThis space is GaymerCon.\nWe are creating a convention where all types of geeks can come together, meet others like them, and have a blast without having to worry about what their peers think of them or being discriminated against.. We will have exhibitor space, cosplay, guest speakers, live music, panel discussions on topics that are directly relevant to our interests, gaming industry professionals who support including queer content in their products, social events, and of course\u2026GAMING!\nWe will also have events and activities that target other areas of geek and tech culture besides gaming. From tabletop gaming to geek chic, from panels by tech leaders to cosplay and live music- we hope to have something for everyone.\nWe want to be clear this isn\u2019t just for gay white dudes either. We want all genders, races, and sexual identities including our straight friends and allies to come together and have a gay, geeky good time. We believe very strongly that creating a space like this is not only important for building a strong community, but also showing new generations of gaymers that there are others like them out there, they are not alone, and there is a welcoming place for them, not just at GaymerCon, but as part of the larger gaming community. \nWHAT THE MONEY IS FOR\nGaymerCon is going to happen no matter what in the late summer of 2013, but big events like this don\u2019t happen by magic and certainly aren\u2019t cheap. This is where you come in. Without any donations we will create a great space for gaymers to come together, build community, and have fun. WITH your donations however, we can reserve swankier and more centrally located venues, book more geeky bands to play for you, have more consoles and games to play on, have cool prizes for contests, and more. Basically the more you give, the more you get out of the con when you come. If we raise lots and lots of money, it will get the attention of the gaming industry, making them more likely to come to the show too so you can see their awesome stuff, but also let them know there is a market out there for gaymers and maybe they should pay attention to you. All this for what it costs for a day pass to most other conventions....oh and did we mention that almost all pledges come with a free pass to the con? Yup. That\u2019s a thing. Go ahead and go donate. We\u2019ll wait.\nCan't come to GaymerCon? We also have sticker packs and Blue/Red GaymerCon Bitroms, for those supporters who want a little more Gaymer in their lives.\nBitroms are entirely original hand-made cartridge necklaces - choose from either Fire Red Conway, Cool Blue Turing, or (at higher levels) you can get the limited Kickstarter-edition Turing & Conway's Adventure.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WE WON\u2019T JUST SPEND THE MONEY ON MOUNTAIN DEW AND CHEETOS\nWe know we can make Gaymercon a success because we are already experienced in being successful. We have a team of extremely talented, connected, amazing folks on the team including engineers and business folks at top startups here in San Francisco. These include Jack DeVries out of IGN, Zach Weiner from SMBC Comics which is one of the largest comics and websites in the world and Matt Conn from the founding team of BandPage, as well as other visionaries and leaders from the LBGT & fundraising world.\nAlso: Cheetos and Mountain Dew? Ew.\nPlease consider contributing and we hope to see you in August 2013.\nWait...you\u2019re still not convinced? Alright. Fine. Time to bring out the big guns. What if I told you that a certain evil computer from a certain video game that starts with a \u201cP\u201d and ends with an \u201cortal\u201d thought you should? You really going to say no to her?\nSee you at GaymerCon 2013!\nTweet at us at @GaymerCon or follow us at facebook.com/gaymercon to stay up to date. We won't camp at your spawn point. Promise.\nFAQ\nWho are you?\nWe are a bunch of geeks and allies based mostly around the Bay and Seattle areas. Most of us work in the tech or gaming space.\n\nWhy isn't there a venue set?\nThat's one of the main reasons why we're holding this Kickstarter - depending on demand and the amount raised, we'll be able to find a location that fits the expected attendance. The more we raise, the more awesome the space we can get, and hopefully get some awesome panels and bosses of honor, too!\n\nWhy is it in San Francisco? Why isn't it in ______?\nSan Francisco is where the highest concentration of gaming, geekdom, tech, and gay communities all coincide, and for year one, we want to make sure it is in an area where there is already, what we hope, is strong demand.\nWho are Conway and Turing?\nConway and Turing are based off of two LGBT geek heroes that we wish to honor as well as help educate the young folks on:  Alan Turing, with whom we would not all the amazing technology and toys that we have to today, and Lynn Conway, engineering pioneer and activist for the transgender community.\n\nI'm under 18 - Can I go?\nFor at least the first year, GaymerCon will be an 18+ event. Although we understand that helping create a safe space for youth is just as important to our mission, for year one, there are a lot of insurance and liability issues to take into account with minors. If you'd still like to come, please let us know so we can gauge demand!\nI'm Straight! Can I come? \nOf course! We want to create a gaming and tech event that focuses on queer issues and themes, not the other way around. Similar to Gay & Lesbian film festivals and cultural events, we welcome all and hope to provide a fun, exciting, vibrant community that is in no way closed off from the rest of the gaming community.\nI don't think something is a good idea becuase of [valid reason]/I would like to see [something cool]\nWe are always down to discuss and help explain our point of view and also listen to, and learn, from others. We are forging new ground with GaymerCon and a helping build a new community - and we want to hear what you think. Please drop us a line on fb or @gaymercon\nI would like to troll you because... \nBe nice, please. We're trying to create something that we believe can help make the lives of gay geeks around the world a bit more interesting and more social. We can take the heat, but we'd prefer if you could please keep it civil.\nWait, I'll only sponsor this if I can get in the field reccomendations from my peers set to Japanese chiptune music.\nGot it.\nNEW! \nSTRETCH GOALS!!\n35K - GAYMERCONCERT! (UPDATE: WE DID IT!!!) GaymerCon will hold a GaymerConcert on Saturday night, bringing in musicians and bands that appeal greatly to the Gaymer community, for a night of drinking, dancing and socializing!

However, we really want to meet with everyone one of you, soooo... if we hit $50K, everyone who has donated $100 or more will be invited to have free breakfast with us the Sunday morning of the con. This will be a bigger group, but we'll still try to make our way around to thank each one of you in person. It will be our honor to do so. If you've already pledged below $100 and want to join...just up it to $100 and you're in.\n60K- CELEBRITY BOSS OF HONOR: (UPDATE: SUPER FINAL BOSS MODE UNLOCKED!) GaymerCon will bring in a real awesome celebrity to be an official BOSS OF HONOR.

The idea? That you can easily go in and find other Gaymers to play your favorite games with. Playing Call of Duty? Here are all the Queer Clans. Looking for someone to fight against in Street Fighter 4? Here are 20 awesome geeks to play against.\nThe best (and most relevant) part: we can coordinate GaymerConnect with GaymerCon itself, setting up an easy and instant way for you to connect online with all the awesome people you meet at the con.

My most well known work would have to be \"SO SUPER DUPER,\" but I've got a few other queer positive titles I've released over the years, like \"REIGNBOW & DEE-VA\" and \"FRIEND OF DOROTHY.\"\n\"SO SUPER DUPER\" is a giggle-filled, action-packed, superheroic soap opera with tons of heart about a gay superhero named Psyche who at first doesn't realize his own gayness but slowly accepts himself and becomes a better hero because of it.\n\"To put it bluntly, So Super Duper is a surprise. It\u2019s friggin\u2019 fantastic.

The College Board plans to introduce a new AP course and exam (CS Principles) in the next few years. Google recently launched a portal for Exploring Computational Thinking resources. Many people \u2014 and businesses \u2014 recognize the importance of computer science education.\nBut none of these people have cartoons.\nWe're here to fill that lonely void with professional, CC-licensed illustrations. Did you watch the video? Seriously, you have to see Tim draw. Not only is it amazing to watch the process, but you can see that he really understands how to communicate visually. He did the first illustration on nights and weekends, and will now complete the series of ten.\nI wish I already had these cartoons to use in my own classroom. I was even thinking about commissioning them completely out of my own pocket. As I searched for the right illustrator, a mutual friend introducted me to Tim. Together, we had an even better idea: Let's make these cartoons available to everyone, so that students and teachers everywhere can benefit. (And now that we've reached 100% of our funding goal, we have a new goal to do comic strips using the same characters if we can reach 150%!)\nThe illustrations will all be in a vector format so they can scale cleanly to any size. That means you'll be able to make classroom posters, include them on web pages, or print them in documents. And, most importantly, they will be licensed under Creative Commons (BY-SA) so they will be free for everyone to use forever.\n\"Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists.
